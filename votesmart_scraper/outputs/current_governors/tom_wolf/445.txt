Governor Tom Wolf, Insurance Commissioner Teresa Miller, and Department of Human Services Secretary Ted Dallas are reminding consumers today that there are health care coverage options available for all Pennsylvanians. Open enrollment for individual health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act begins Sunday, November 1 and enrollment for Medicaid and CHIP are open throughout the year.
"This upcoming date is an important one for all those in Pennsylvania who are looking to enroll in, renew, or change their healthcare plans," said Governor Wolf. "After expanding Medicaid in April, we have enrolled nearly half a million new Pennsylvanians in healthcare. Open enrollment is another opportunity for those in need to get covered. My administration will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all Pennsylvanians have access to their best possible healthcare coverage plans."
