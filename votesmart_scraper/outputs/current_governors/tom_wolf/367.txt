Governor Tom Wolf today announced that Commonwealth Cornerstone Group (CCG) has completed a $7 million new markets tax credit (NMTC) financing transaction that will help fund the adaptive re-use of the historic Keppel Building in downtown Lancaster. The building, which once housed the Keppel Candy Company, is located at 323 N. Queen Street.
"Any time we can save one of our historic buildings in a downtown area and re-purpose it to meet the needs of today's businesses, it's a big win for that community and for Pennsylvania," said Governor Wolf.
