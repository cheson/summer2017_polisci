Governor Tom Wolf today announced the investment of $75.6 million for nine drinking water and wastewater projects across eight counties through the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST).
"Today the PENNVEST Board of Directors renewed its commitment to clean water in Pennsylvania and to the health of it citizens", said Governor Wolf. "The investment of millions of dollars all across the Commonwealth serves as testimony to the Board's and this administration's desire to improve our environment and to protect our precious natural resources, for today's Pennsylvanians as well as for future generation s to come."
Of the $75.6 million, $54.4 million is allocated for low-interest loans and $21.2 million is awarded through grants.
The funding comes from a combination of state funds approved by voters, federal grants to PENNVEST from the Environmental Protection Agency and recycled loan repayments from previous PENNVEST funding awards. Funds for the projects are disbursed after bills for work are paid and receipts are submitted to PENNVEST.
