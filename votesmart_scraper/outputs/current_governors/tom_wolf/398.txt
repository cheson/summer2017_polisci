Governor Tom Wolf today announced that Commonwealth Cornerstone Group (CCG) has completed a $7 million new markets tax credit (NMTC) financing transaction that will help fund construction of a new $29 million shopping center located at Harbison Avenue and Tulip Street in Philadelphia. Known as Shoppes at Wissinoming, the 110,000-square-foot project will include a Shoprite Supermarket as the anchor tenant, plus space for retail stores and restaurants.
"This new shopping center will not only stimulate job creation and more investment, but it will directly touch the lives of local residents by giving them more healthful food options not currently available," said Governor Wolf.
