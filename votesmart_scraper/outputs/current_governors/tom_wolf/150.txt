TRANSCRIPT:
Thank you for allowing me to address a joint session of the legislature.
Working together, we have had great success in moving Pennsylvania forward, but we still have a lot more work to do.
I am grateful to President Scarnati and Speaker Turzai, Leaders Corman, Costa, Reed and Dermody for your willingness to make the fight against opioid addiction a priority and for your work in the past to address this crisis.
