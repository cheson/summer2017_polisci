Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: May 23, 2017
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today released a statement detailing the devastating effect President Trump's budget will have on seniors.
Governor Wolf's full statement:
"President Trump's budget puts Pennsylvania seniors last. It makes deep cuts to Medicaid and will force seniors to pay more for health care.
"Medicaid is a lifeline for seniors across Pennsylvania that helps pay the costs of nursing home care. The Trump budget proposes deep and devastating funding cuts over the next ten years, which would force many seniors out of nursing homes.
"We cannot turn our backs on seniors and force them to bear the greatest pain of these cuts."
