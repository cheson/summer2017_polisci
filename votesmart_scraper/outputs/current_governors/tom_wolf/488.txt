Governor Tom Wolf today ordered all Pennsylvania flags in the Capitol Complex and at all commonwealth facilities to fly at half-staff to honor former United States Senator and Secretary of Health and Human Services Richard Shultz Schweiker.

"On behalf of all Pennsylvanians, Frances and I extend our condolences to the friends and family of this great public servant."

He began his elected service to the country in 1960, representing Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district in Montgomery County. He served in the United States Senate from 1969 until 1981.
In 1981, Schweiker was sworn in as the 14th Secretary of Health and Human Services. He retired in 1983 after 22 years of public service.
State flags shall remain at half-staff until interment.
