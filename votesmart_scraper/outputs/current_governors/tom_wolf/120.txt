Location: Harrisburg, PA

Today, Governor Wolf signed HB 683 sponsored by Rep. Kathy Rapp that amends the Taxpayer Relief Act by removing veterans' disability payments from the definition of "income" that is used to determine eligibility for the Property Tax RentRebate Program (PTRR).
"Pennsylvania veterans' service to our country is invaluable and immeasurable," said Governor Tom Wolf. "I am proud to support these strong men and women by helping them qualify for property tax rebates that they previously would not have qualified for."
Veterans' disability payments include compensation approved by and received from the federal Veterans Administration (VA) as a result of an illness or injury that is directly connected to active military service, as well as compensation under several state programs. As amended on the House Floor, Federal veterans' disability payments and state veterans' benefits are specifically excluded from the definition of income.
Governor Wolf also signed the following bills into law:
Act 116 (Saylor) -- Amends Landlord and Tenant Act providing for death of a tenant.
Act 118 (Wentling) -- Amends the Public School Code, in certification of teachers, further providing for continuing professional development, for program of continuing professional education and for charter schools.
Act 119 (Killion -- Res. 5/11/16) -- Amends the Medical Practice Act further providing for perfusionist.
Act 120 (Killion -- Res. 5/11/16) -- Amends the Osteopathic Medical Practice Act further providing for perfusionist.
