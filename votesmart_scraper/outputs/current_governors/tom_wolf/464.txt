Wolf Administration Announces Renewed Commitment to Fighting Hunger
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Sept. 29, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today addressed the serious problem of hunger and inadequate nutrition in the commonwealth by issuing an executive order to coordinate Pennsylvania's food and nutrition programs. According to the order, the governor will appoint an advisor to lead a newly-formed "Governor's Food Security Partnership.'
"Hunger remains a serious problem in Pennsylvania, with too many of our citizens unable to access food for themselves or their families," Governor Wolf said. "Pennsylvania administers state and federal funds for food programs serving the elderly, families, pregnant women, infants and children. Through the coordination of these varied public and private sector resources, we can ensure access to much-needed food and nutrition."
