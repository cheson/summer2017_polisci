Acting on recommendations of Governor Tom Wolf, a panel of forestry experts from private, public and academic sectors today kicked off a series of meetings to analyze current limitations to forest conservation and job growth, and to develop an action plan to address both objectives.
"One of Pennsylvania's greatest strengths is our natural resources," said Governor Tom Wolf. "Over 57 percent of Pennsylvania is forested and prioritizing conservation and job growth related to this field is vital to creating a sustainable, dynamic industry."
