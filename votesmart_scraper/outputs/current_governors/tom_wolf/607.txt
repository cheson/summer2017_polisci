Statement
By: Tom Wolf

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today announced Pennsylvania's transition to a simple traditional Medicaid expansion plan.
"Today is the first step toward simplifying a complicated process and ensuring hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians have greater access to the health insurance they need," said Governor Wolf. "Our approach will alleviate confusion, remove unnecessary red tape, and streamline the system so that people can see a doctor when they are sick and health care professionals have more time to concentrate on providing quality care."

Governor Wolf today directed the Department of Human Services (DHS) to submit a letter to the federal government withdrawing the "low-risk" health care package known as the "Healthy" option from further federal consideration.
