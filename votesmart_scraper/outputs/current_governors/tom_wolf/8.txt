Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today released the following statement urging the Senate to send House Bill 1238 -- an overhaul of Pennsylvania's animal abuse law including Libre's Law -- to his desk for his signature:
"I am proud to be a long-time supporter of Libre's Law and eager to sign the bipartisan, comprehensive House Bill 1238 into law. I applaud the sponsors and advocates who have fought for too long to improve Pennsylvania's protections for animals. This bill increases penalties for animal cruelty and neglect. Pennsylvania is only one of three states that does not have a felony statute for severe animal abuse. We are long overdue to join the rest of the country in having higher standards of care for our pets and other animals. I thank Libre, the Pennsylvania SPCA, Sen. Alloway, Rep. Stephens, and all those in the legislature and animal advocacy community for their work getting this bill towards final passage."
