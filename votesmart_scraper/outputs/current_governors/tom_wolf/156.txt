In March, Governor Tom Wolf signed Executive Order 2016-03, entitled "Establishing "Employment First' Policy and Increasing Competitive-Integrated Employment for Pennsylvanians with a Disability." The goal of this executive order is to make the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania a model state when it comes to creating a climate hospitable to workers with a disability. Under this executive order, competitive, integrated employment becomes the first consideration and preferred outcome of publicly funded education, training, employment, and long-term supports and service programs for working-age Pennsylvanians with a disability.
"Pennsylvanians with a disability are valued members of society who make important contributions to our state's workforce," said Governor Tom Wolf. "There is dignity in work, and when people with a disability hold jobs and earn competitive wages they can achieve greater independence and inclusion in the community."
The executive order directed the Departments of Labor and Industry, Human Services, and Education to obtain stakeholder and business input and work with other agencies as appropriate to develop a plan within 120 days to implement the executive order.
