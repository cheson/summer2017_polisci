Press Release

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today joined the head coaches participating in the men's and women's tournaments from Duquesne University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, Robert Morris University, Saint Joseph's University, Temple University and Villanova University to urge Pennsylvanians to make a pledge to play a role in preventing, addressing, and responding effectively to sexual violence, as part of the commonwealth's "It's On Us PA" campaign.
"Pennsylvania is home to some of the best schools and athletic programs in the country, and sexual assault should not be part of any student's experience. Ensuring our students' safety and well-being is paramount not only to their success, but the success of Pennsylvania as a whole," said Governor Tom Wolf. "I'm proud to be joined by these accomplished coaches who not only excel on the basketball court, but also set a tremendous example every day for their players to shape them into better women and men, and role models for their communities. Let's stop the madness -- take the pledge and help Pennsylvania end sexual assault."
