Governor Tom Wolf today announced the successful transition of the remaining 79,272 individuals from the previous Healthy PA plan to HealthChoices, Pennsylvania's expanded traditional Medicaid program. The comprehensive Medicaid program provides greater health care coverage in a simpler and streamlined method to Pennsylvanians who are most in need.
"Today marks the completion of the transition to a full Medicaid expansion and greater access to quality health care for over 440,000 Pennsylvanians to date," said Governor Tom Wolf. "The seamless transition to HealthChoices means that more Pennsylvanians than ever before can see a doctor when they are sick and receive preventive health care. Ultimately that translates to the opportunity for more Pennsylvanians to live healthier lives."
