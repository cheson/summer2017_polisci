Governor Wolf Statement on Passage of Health Care Bill in U.S. House
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: May 4, 2017
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement condemning the passing of the health care bill by the United State House of Representatives:
"This is a sad day for millions of Pennsylvania families who now continue to worry about their access to health care. I will continue to fight to save health care access and consumer protections that help protect the health and financial security of Pennsylvanians. While some in Washington are celebrating today as a victory, this shallow and shameful attempt to score political points at the expense of the sick, poor, elderly and disabled will not soon be forgotten. I thank the Republicans and Democrats who voted "no' today. We can only hope that the United States Senate cares more about the people they were elected to serve."
