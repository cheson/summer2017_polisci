Governor Tom Wolf today applauded the Public Utility commission (PUC) for its enactment of a gift ban as part of the organization's ethics policy.
"I am committed to making government work so we can restore the public's trust and make sure we are being open and transparent," said Governor Wolf. "That is why I signed executive orders banning gifts for all employees of the executive branch and reforming the way the commonwealth contracts with outside legal firms.
"I commend PUC's actions following my lead to ban gifts. This is an important step."
PUC recently conducted a thorough review of its existing policies within the context of the Commission's standards and missions. Effective May 1, 2015, all PUC employees will be required to adhere to a ban on the acceptance of gifts and favors.
In February, Governor Wolf urged independent state agencies to ban gifts. The PUC joins major independent agencies, including the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, in banning gifts.
