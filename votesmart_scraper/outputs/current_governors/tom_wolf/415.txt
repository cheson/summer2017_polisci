Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today announced that more than half a million Pennsylvanians have enrolled in HealthChoices since Pennsylvania expanded its Medicaid program. Governor Wolf and Department of Human Services Secretary Ted Dallas announced the milestone at an enrollment event at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center.
"Since my administration expanded Medicaid, more than half a million Pennsylvanians now have access to health care," said Governor Wolf. "The commonwealth's uninsured population has dropped from 14 percent in 2013 to eight percent today. The overwhelming response to Medicaid expansion further proves the significant pent-up demand and need for health care in the commonwealth. Access to health care means Pennsylvanians can take charge of their health by receiving preventive services at the right time, in the appropriate place, avoiding costly trips to the emergency room."
