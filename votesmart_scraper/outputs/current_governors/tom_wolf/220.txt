Today, Governor Wolf ceremoniously signed SB 609, sponsored by Senator Bob Mensch. This bill creates greater public awareness of measures available to detect, diagnose and treat prostate cancer and related chronic prostate conditions.
"As many of you know, earlier this week I underwent an outpatient procedure to treat my prostate cancer. My case was diagnosed early," said Governor Tom Wolf. "Fortunately, that early detection allowed me to have the opportunity to make decisions and schedule an effective treatment. My case was diagnosed as a result of a routine checkup, which is why SB 609 is an extremely important bill"
