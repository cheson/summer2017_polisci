Press Release

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today applauded the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB) for its legal advisory, which would allow beer distributors to sell 12-packs and other "original containers' containing at least 128 fluid ounces.
"Today's action by the PLCB is a step towards modernization," Governor Wolf said. "This action provides customer convenience at distributors and enables smaller breweries, including many in Pennsylvania, to better compete with larger institutions."
