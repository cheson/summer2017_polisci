It's been an incredible journey to Election Day, and because of people like you, it's been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
Thousands of supporters have spent more than a year chipping in, volunteering their time, and spreading the word about our campaign to give Pennsylvania a fresh start.
It's been great working with you, and I know I can count on you to get out the vote before the polls close at 8:00 p.m.
After you cast your ballot, please take a moment to let your friends and family know why you're standing with me, and encourage them to vote, too.
If your friends and family don't know where to vote, they can look up their polling place here:

I am so grateful for your support.
Thank you.
P.S. Please join me at the York Fairgrounds after the polls close at 8:00 p.m. for our Election Night celebration, which features free refreshments and entertainment. It's going to be fun.
