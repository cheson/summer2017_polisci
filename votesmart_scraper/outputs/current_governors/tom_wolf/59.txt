Statement

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement in advance of today's rally on the Capitol steps in support of women's health care access:
"The attacks on women's health at both the federal and state level are nothing more than politicians inserting themselves between doctors and their patients. I thank the many women and men who have stood up are taking a stand against these efforts, including those rallying at the Capitol today. The attacks on women's reproductive health care and organizations like Planned Parenthood put women, especially in rural and underserved communities, at risk of having extremely limited access to essential health services. Federal and state politicians should be focused on fixing our schools, getting people back to work, and solving the opioid and heroin crisis, not making it harder for women to access critical health and wellness services. I will veto any measure, including Senate Bills 3 and 300, that seeks to prevent women from accessing health care services or providers that they or their doctor deem appropriate for their own health."
