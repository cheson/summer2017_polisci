Governor Tom Wolf joined Insurance Commissioner Teresa Miller today in alerting consumers that the Insurance Department will continue to oppose a practice known in the industry as "price optimization", in which sophisticated pricing tools are used to charge different premiums to policyholders who present essentially the same risk to the insurer, with the price differences based on whether or not a particular policyholder is likely to shop around for less expensive coverage.
