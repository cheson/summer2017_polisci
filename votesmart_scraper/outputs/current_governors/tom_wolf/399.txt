Pennsylvania Makes It Easier for Working Families to Access Quality Child Care
Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Jan. 5, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf announced today that Pennsylvania is one of the first states in the country to implement a change in its Child Care Works program to help families who experience a temporary disruption in employment continue to access quality child care. Through this change, working families will now re-determine their program eligibility every 12 months instead of the current six-month eligibility period.
"It is critical that we improve access to child care for all Pennsylvanians," said Governor Wolf. "My administration remains committed to protecting Pennsylvania's children, and making it easier for working families to access care is an important step toward achieving this goal."
"This change means that Pennsylvania families that experience a temporary job loss, are seasonally employed, or fall victim to an extended illness can count on child care that will help them continue to provide for their children," said Pennsylvania Department of Human Services Secretary Ted Dallas. "Quality child care is not only a vital early learning tool for children, it is also a critical component of making sure that working families can seek and obtain good family-sustaining jobs. "
