Governor Tom Wolf today announced that Pennsylvania entered into a three-year cooperation agreement today with West Virginia and Ohio to collaborate on areas critical to maximizing economic growth in the shale gas region. The agreement was unveiled at the Tri-State Shale Summit in Morgantown, West Virginia.
"We must work together to ensure our region has the skilled workforce necessary to fill jobs and attract new employers," Governor Wolf said. "The demand for workers by the energy industry and off-shoot industries, especially manufacturing, is high and still growing. Here in Pennsylvania, I have proposed to expand investments in education across the board and especially increase funding for trusted and proven job training and workforce development initiatives."
