Statement

For more than six months, my administration has been working extensively with the legislature to fund the Service Infrastructure Improvement Fund, which supports technology upgrades, benefit modernization, and unemployment compensation call centers among other things.
However, the Republican Senate made a conscious decision to not vote on House Bill 2375 -- which would have funded the system -- and thereby decided to make it harder for working class people who have lost their jobs to pay their bills, put food on the table, and find new opportunities.
