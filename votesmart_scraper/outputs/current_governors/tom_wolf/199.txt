Governor Wolf Announces $30 Million for Abandoned Mine Reclamation Projects
Press Release
By: Tom Wolf

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Wolf today announced the award of $30 million for 14 projects to reclaim abandoned mine lands (AML) in 10 Pennsylvania counties. The projects were selected for funding based on their potential to create long-term economic benefits in the coal communities in which they are located.
"When these mines closed, these communities lost jobs and were left with land that was difficult to repurpose," Governor Wolf said. "This program will help strengthen coal communities and put people back to work, while also improving the environment in these areas."
