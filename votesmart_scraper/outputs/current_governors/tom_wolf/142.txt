Governor Tom Wolf and Secretary Leslie S. Richards announced today that 37 highway, bridge, bike and pedestrian projects will receive $40 million in Multimodal Transportation Fund grants from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). A list of the projects by county is below.
"Communities across Pennsylvania rely on infrastructure improvements to support economic growth and attract new residents and businesses," Governor Wolf said. "These projects support improved transportation for all residents, whether they walk, bike or drive."
"The fund allows us to assist communities with needed transportation improvements that otherwise may not move forward," said PennDOT Secretary Richards. "This process represents an opportunity for worthwhile local projects to secure the support needed to come to fruition."
PennDOT evaluated 251 applications totaling more than $282 million and made selections based on safety benefits, regional economic conditions, the technical and financial feasibility, job creation, energy efficiency, and operational sustainability.
The Multimodal Transportation Fund was created by Act 89, enacted in November 2013, Pennsylvania's far-reaching transportation funding plan. For the first time, transit, aviation, rail freight and pedestrian and bicycle modes obtained dedicated sources of funds, putting the modes on a firmer footing for future initiatives.
