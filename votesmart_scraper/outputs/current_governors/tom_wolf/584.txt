Governor Tom Wolf continued his "Schools That Teach Tour" today at an elementary school in Clinton County, where he discussed the historic public education investments made in his 2015-2016 budget. The Governor's proposal restores massive cuts made over the last four years, with a commitment to increase school funding by $2 billion over four years by instituting a commonsense severance tax on oil and natural gas. His plan will also cut property taxes by 50 percent for the average homeowner.
Governor Wolf spent the afternoon with students, teachers and administrators at Robb Elementary School. The Governor's budget proposes more than $1.8 million in increased state funding to the Keystone Central School District. It will also provide the district with an allocation of $11.8 million in property tax relief.
