Moody's: Pennsylvania's Outlook Remains Negative, Warns of Consequences of Failing to Address Structural Budget Gap
By: Tom Wolf

Location: Harrisburg, PA

A new Moody's report has affirmed Pennsylvania's negative rating. The report cites Pennsylvania's "negative fiscal position following years of deficits and large structural imbalance" and "poorly funded pension plans and historical practice of underfunding" as chief credit challenges. Furthermore, our "failure to address [the] structural budget gap" could lead to credit downgrade.
"As I have warned for years, we must address Pennsylvania's structural budget deficit," said Governor Wolf. "Either we can invest in education, eliminate the deficit, and put Pennsylvania back on track or we can continue on the same path with dire consequences. If we do not act, a more than $2 billion deficit will force cuts to education funding and human services while increasing property taxes for people across Pennsylvania."
