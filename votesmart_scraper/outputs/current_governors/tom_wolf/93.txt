Press Release

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Today, Governor Tom Wolf announced the approval of more than $17.8 million in tax credits to support 114 community investments through the Neighborhood Assistance Program (NAP).
"The Neighborhood Assistance Program provides tax credits to encourage businesses to invest in projects that improve distressed areas, promoting a shared belief that thriving neighborhoods are a cornerstone of Pennsylvania's success," said Governor Wolf. "The continually strong applicant pool and participation levels of this program demonstrate both its demand and the importance of the positive impacts it creates across the commonwealth."
Administered by the Department of Community and Economic Development, NAP provides tax credits to encourage businesses and community organizations to invest in projects that serve distressed areas or support conservation efforts.
Last fiscal year, DCED supported 100 projects throughout the commonwealth. Complementing the nearly $18 million in tax credits awarded, more than $60 million in additional funds were leveraged by corporate contributions. This year's participation is likely to leverage similar results.
Strong participation in NAP was witnessed in 2016, with a robust applicant pool of more than 200 for the 2016-17 funding cycle.
NAP has five main components, including the Neighborhood Assistance Program (NAP), Special Program Priorities (SPP), the Neighborhood Partnership Program (NPP), the Charitable Food Program (CFP), and the Enterprise Zone Program (EZP). A description of each of these components is available within the NAP Guidelines.
