Pennsylvania was one of seven states to be selected to participate in a National Governors Association (NGA) learning lab designed to combat the opioid epidemic. Last year over 3,500 Pennsylvanians died from drug overdose -- that is an astonishing 10 deaths a day and up from the more than 2,500 reported deaths in 2014.
"I have made battling the opioid epidemic my top priority. The opportunity to participate in this program will guide and inform future practices in helping Pennsylvanians suffering from the disease of addiction," said Governor Tom Wolf. "As we all know, the opioid epidemic does not discriminate -- it affects Pennsylvanians from all walks of life. We can and should do more to address this matter that is plaguing all of our communities."
