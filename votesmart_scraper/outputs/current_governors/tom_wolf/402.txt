Governor Tom Wolf today announced the successful January 1 phase-out of Pennsylvania's Capital Stock and Foreign Franchise tax, calling it "an unfair tax on business" that he was committed to eliminating.
"As I noted in my budget address, Pennsylvania's economic prosperity has long been hobbled by an outdated tax structure that fails to incentivize job growth," Governor Wolf said. "It was well past time for Pennsylvania to finally remove the Capital Stock and Foreign Franchise tax from the books."
