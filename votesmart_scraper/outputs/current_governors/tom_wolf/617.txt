Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Jan. 28, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

At today's reorganization meeting of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, Sean Logan was selected as Chairman. In his first act, Chairman Logan revised the Commission's Code of Conduct to be consistent with Governor Tom Wolf's Executive Order banning the acceptance of gifts for all employees of the executive branch. Governor Wolf released the following statement:

"I am committed to making government work so we can restore the public's trust and make sure we are being open and transparent. That is why moments after I was sworn in, I signed an executive order banning gifts for all employees of the executive branch, and also why I required members of my staff and cabinet to undergo ethics and open records training on my first full day in office.

"I commend the Turnpike Commission's swift action today by following my lead to ban the acceptance of gifts by its employees. This is an important step in the right direction for an agency that has had its share of troubles."
