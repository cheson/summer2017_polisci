Governor Tom Wolf announced today that the Commonwealth Financing Authority (CFA) has opened the new Pipeline Investment Program (PIPE) for applications, offering up to $24 million funding to make Pennsylvania's natural gas available to its residents, manufacturers, and pad-ready sites, hastening the development of low-cost energy and creating new jobs.
"Pennsylvania boasts tremendous natural gas resources, and it makes sense that our residents should benefit from the assets right under their feet," said Governor Wolf. "Doing so will also have a significant impact on the economic well-being of the commonwealth by creating jobs and making low-cost natural gas more readily available."
