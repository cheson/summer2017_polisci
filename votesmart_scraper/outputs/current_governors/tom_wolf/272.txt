Statement

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today applauded the Obama Administration and the Department of Labor for extending overtime pay eligibility for 4.2 million Americans. This new regulation will affect 185,000 hardworking Pennsylvanians. Governor Wolf released the following statement:
"I applaud the Obama Administration and the Department of Labor for extending overtime pay eligibility to millions of hardworking Americans. This new rule will help 185,000 Pennsylvanians, and as I have said, no one who works 40 hours per week or more should have to struggle to pay rent, put food on the table or provide for their family. This rule will put more money in the pockets of middle-class workers and provide future protections and clarity. For too long, large sectors of our workforce have not been treated fairly or compensated appropriately for their work, and this action will provide the necessary economic security. This is an important step, but here in Pennsylvania we must do more, which is why I look forward to working with the legislature to increase the minimum wage to support workers and local businesses, create new jobs and boost state revenue by more than $60 million annually."
