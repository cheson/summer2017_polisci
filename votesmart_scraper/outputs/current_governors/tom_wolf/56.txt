Governor Wolf Signs Short Term UC Fix, Calls for Long-Term Solution
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: April 24, 2017
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today signed Senate Bill 250 into law, which is now Act 1 of 2017 and provides a temporary infusion of resources to improve customer service for the unemployment compensation service centers operated by the Department of Labor and Industry.
"I am grateful to Sens. Ward and Tartaglione, Reps. Kaufman and Galloway, and all those in the General Assembly who helped get these temporary but necessary resources through both the House and Senate," Governor Wolf said. "In the coming weeks, I will continue to work earnestly with the General Assembly to find long-term solution. A failure to pass legislation doing so will not only lead to a crisis similar to the one the Commonwealth just faced, but also create chaos for workers or those seeking unemployment."
The administration expects this funding to support the rehiring of approximately 200 workers for a term of nine months, as prescribed by the legislation. This process will be based on collective bargaining and will begin immediately. The department hopes to have the Altoona call center reopened by early May.
