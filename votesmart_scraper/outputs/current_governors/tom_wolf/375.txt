Press Release

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Wolf traveled to Johnstown Friday to announce the creation of over 130 new jobs, as well as a multi-million dollar state investment to help revitalize the city. The governor, speaking at a ribbon-cutting for LifePoint Health Business Services, said this will spur economic development and job growth in the entire area.
LifePoint -- in exchange for a pledge to create 132 new jobs over the next three years -- received a funding proposal from the Governor's Action Team (GAT), which is an experienced group of economic development professionals who report directly to the governor and work with businesses that are considering locating or expanding in Pennsylvania. LifePoint's GAT offer includes:
$500,000 Pennsylvania First Program grant
$112,200 in WEDnetPA funding for employee training
Governor Wolf also announced more than $15 million in additional state investments through the Department of Community and Economic Development, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Department of Transportation, to align with the region's Vision 2025, a framework for revitalizing greater Johnstown.
"While it's important to highlight investments being made and jobs being created by the private sector, it's also important to build strong, stable communities to support business growth," Gov. Wolf said. "I look forward to continuing to visit Johnstown and receiving updates on the momentum of Vision 2025."
