Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today joined House Democratic Leadership in putting forth an amendment in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to fix the commonwealth's structural budget deficit, fund K-12 education and provide expanded property tax relief to seniors and disabled households.
"Pennsylvania needs critical revenue to fix our structural budget deficit without gimmicks. We need to make sure oil and gas companies pay their fair share so we can restore the drastic cuts made to education, and seniors and disabled households desperately need relief from skyrocketing property taxes that resulted from underfunding education," said Governor Wolf. "If we do not fix our deficit, our credit rating will be downgraded to junk status and we will be forced to cut more funding from education. More education cuts will lead to the layoffs of more educators, further increases to class sizes and skyrocketing property taxes. We must get Pennsylvania's financial house in order and invest in our future. The plan filed today gives the commonwealth an opportunity to move forward and away from the failed status quo."
