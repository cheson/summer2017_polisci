Governor Wolf's Statement on Civil Service Commission Banning the Box
By: Tom Wolf
Date: May 9, 2017
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement on the Civil Service Commission's decision, at his urging, to "ban the box' on employment applications starting on July 1, 2017.
"I applaud the State Civil Service Commission's decision to "ban the box' and make opportunities for reentrants more accessible and create economic opportunity to combat recidivism. Banning the box will allow prospective applicants with criminal records to be judged on their skills and qualifications and not solely on their criminal history, while preserving a hiring agency's ability to appropriately screen applicants as part of the hiring process."
Today's announcement comes after Governor Wolf's change to "ban the box' on non-civil service job applications last week.
