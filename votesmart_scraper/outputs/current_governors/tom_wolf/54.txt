Governor Wolf Statement on Senate Advancing Bill to Defund Planned Parenthood
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: April 26, 2017
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today released the following statement on a Pennsylvania Senate committee advancing a bill that would effectively defund Planned Parenthood in Pennsylvania:
"This bill is nothing more than an ideologically driven attempt to disrupt health services for thousands of women in Pennsylvania. Planned Parenthood provides important health and welfare services for men and women, especially in rural and underserved areas. Some politicians in Harrisburg are dead set on putting themselves in between a woman and her doctor and prevent both men and women from having access to services they may not have an opportunity to get elsewhere. This legislation solves no problems but rather seeks to create additional hardship for Pennsylvanians seeking health care, especially women. I call on Senate leadership to put a stop to this legislation, but if they refuse, I will veto this bill if it reaches my desk."
