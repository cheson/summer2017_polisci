Governor Tom Wolf today released the following statement congratulating Patrick McDonnell on his confirmation as Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP):
"Patrick brings a breadth of experience to the Department of Environmental Protection, with his more than 20 years of government service. His deep knowledge of DEP's mission, policies, and processes are why I chose him to lead an agency that plays such an important role in Pennsylvanians' lives. From the water we drink to the air we breathe, DEP touches all aspects of life and the economy in Pennsylvania. That's why it is important to have a leader like Patrick McDonnell at the helm.
