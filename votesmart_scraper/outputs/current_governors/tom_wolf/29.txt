Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: June 5, 2017
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement on the bipartisan Senate support and passage of Senate Bill 1, the pension reform compromise bill, which now heads to the House:
"I applaud the 40 bipartisan Senators who voted for this bill and thank Senators Scarnati, Corman and Browne for their leadership on reforming our pension system. I look forward to working with House leaders to get this bill across the finish line.
"This pension compromise achieves my foremost goals: continuing to pay down our debt, reducing Wall Street fees, shifting risk away from taxpayers, all while providing workers with a fair retirement benefit.
"Achieving this compromise will provide employees with the fair retirement that they deserve, while also providing long-term relief to school districts, ensuring more future state dollars go directly into the classroom."
