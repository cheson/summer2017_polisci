Remarks by Governor Wolf at Non-discrimination Executive Orders Signing
By: Tom Wolf
Date: April 7, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Today I am signing two executive orders in an effort to explicitly and decisively end discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender expression and identity in the executive branch of our state government
And I am urging the legislature to pass a non-discrimination bill that makes it clear to the world that Pennsylvania is a welcoming place for everyone
This is the right thing for us to do
Just as it was right for William Penn to proclaim that Pennsylvania was a place for everyone regardless of your religion
But this is also the smart thing to do
Pay Pal's recent decision not to bring additional jobs to North Carolina because of that state's insistence on promoting a culture of discrimination shows this
Like Pay Pal, businesses want to invest in places that show they value all people who are willing to:
Work hard
Take risks
Raise a family
Or build a business
We need a level playing field in Pennsylvania because economies don't thrive on a playing field that isn't level
We need to ensure that Pennsylvania is a welcoming place regardless
Of the color of your skin
Your gender
The religion you profess
Or the person you love
We need to understand that a future that does not take non-discrimination seriously
Is a poor future indeed
We can -- and should -- do better here in Pennsylvania
And I am troubled by the General Assembly's inaction on passing non-discrimination legislation
Pennsylvania needs to go on record to proclaim that all people -- regardless of sexual orientation, gender expression or identity -- are treated equally under Pennsylvania law
So while I wait for the legislature to send non-discrimination to my desk, I am signing these executive orders today
In other words, these executive orders are a first step toward the non-discrimination legislation we need
These Executive Orders; one that applies to Commonwealth employees and the other that applies to grants and procurement, say that no agency under the governor's jurisdiction shall discriminate against any employee or applicant on the basis of:
Race
Color
Religious creed
Ancestry
Union membership
Age
Gender
Sexual orientation
Gender identity and expression
National origin
AIDS or HIV status
Or disability
Each agency under the governor's jurisdiction will ensure fair and equal employment opportunities
The employment practices of the commonwealth must be non-discriminatory
And all businesses contracting with the commonwealth should use non-discriminatory practices in:
Sub-contracting
Hiring
Promoting
And other labor maters
The point is that fairness matters
Fairness and equity are simply right
None of us can lead full lives if all of us can't
A society that is unfair to some
Is unfair to all
If we want a healthy economy
If we want a strong democracy
If we want a healthy economy
We must have a just society
That is why non-discrimination is important
And that is why these Executive Orders are important
It is a small step in the broader effort to make sure all Pennsylvanians feel their lives are filled with fair chances
That broader effort includes:
Equitable and adequate education funding
A fair minimum wage
And good government
We all want Pennsylvania to have a bright future
These initiatives -- and these executive orders -- will make that future brighter
My hope is that the General Assembly comes around to share this point of view with me
