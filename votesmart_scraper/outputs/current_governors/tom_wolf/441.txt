Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf and Department of Corrections Secretary John Wetzel today announced the awarding of a grant from the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Career, Technical and Adult Education to DOC to improve prison education. The DOC will use the grant funds to prioritize adult offenders aged 25 and younger who are medium to high risk of reoffending.
"In order to truly make our system fairer and less costly, we need to create opportunity for young offenders to keep them from re-entering the system," Governor Wolf said. "These funds will help Secretary Wetzel and Department of Corrections to bolster their efforts to reduce recidivism and prepare offenders for the world outside their walls."
