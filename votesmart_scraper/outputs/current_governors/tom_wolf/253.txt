This week, following my request, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board voted to free the six-pack and allow for gas stations like Sheetz, Wawa, and Rutters to sell six-packs of beer as long as they have appropriate accommodations.
Currently, the Pennsylvania Liquor Code requires the PLCB "refuse any application for a new license or the transfer of any license to a location where the sale of liquid fuels or oil is conducted."
However, a recent Commonwealth Court ruling affirmed the PLCB's authority to improve customer experience and make purchasing beer more convenient for Pennsylvanians. This ruling sets an important precedent that clarifies this piece of Pennsylvania Liquor Code and allows for the sale of malt or brewed beverages at gas stations and other businesses. This is an important step toward improving availability and convenience for customers.
Creating and following this precedent will make the commonwealth more inviting for customers and businesses, while we continue to work on improving customer satisfaction for all Pennsylvanians.
