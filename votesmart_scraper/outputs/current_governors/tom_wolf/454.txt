Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today announced that the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency (PHFA) has approved nearly $8.1 million for 44 housing projects to improve the availability and affordability of housing in 28 counties.
These projects are being supported by the Pennsylvania Housing Affordability and Rehabilitation Enhancement (PHARE) Fund, which is administered by PHFA and funded by Act 13's impact fee on natural gas producers.
"A strength of this PHARE funding is that the projects that are supported are proposed by local governments based on evaluations of their community's housing needs," said Governor Wolf. "The funding is being used by local organizations and government leaders to address their most pressing housing concerns and provide the most immediate and positive impact."
