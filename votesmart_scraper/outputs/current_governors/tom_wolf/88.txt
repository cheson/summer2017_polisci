Governor Tom Wolf announced today that new statewide investments through the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority (PIDA) program will help spur development in the commonwealth and creation and retain more than 95 jobs.
"The PIDA program helps Pennsylvania's small businesses and entrepreneurs succeed by providing low-interest loans to aid with site development, infrastructure improvements, and equipment acquisition," said Governor Wolf. "Coupled with significant private investments, the PIDA loans make projects possible that often also lead to the creation and retention of jobs across the commonwealth. I'm pleased to announce that this month's approvals will create and retain a total of 97 jobs."
Over the last month, PIDA approved $5.3 million in low-interest loans to support four projects in Allegheny, Blair, Erie, and Lancaster counties that will generate more than $8.2 million in private investments. These investments are the first approved in 2017. In 2016, PIDA approved $48.2 million in low-interest loans that resulted in $103.5 million in private investment and supported 1,868 created and retained full-time jobs.
