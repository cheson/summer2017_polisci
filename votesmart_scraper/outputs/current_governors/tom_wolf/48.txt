Press Release

Date: May 5, 2017
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today announced the award of $2 million in reemployment funding for 14 educational institutions that have demonstrated a track record of training and placing adult students into occupations that are in high demand by local employers.
"These funds provide for equipment purchases and upgrades to provide adult students with industry-relevant training to better meet the needs of local employers," Governor Wolf said. "The grants also allow local colleges and career and technical institutions to increase training capacity for in-demand programs to close the skills gap for local manufacturers in high-priority occupations."
Approved through the Department of Labor & Industry, Tech Grants are used to support equipment purchases and/or upgrades at Pennsylvania's post-secondary career and technical centers, and colleges of technology to more effectively prepare adult students for entry into Pennsylvania's competitive employment marketplace.
"Acquiring industry-relevant skills is one of the key factors to career success in today's economy," Department of Labor & Industry Secretary Kathy Manderino said. "Providing the right training on the most up-to-date equipment for high-demand occupations ensures that employers have access to a robust pipeline of qualified talent."
One of the recently awarded grants will be used to purchase equipment for the adult Welding Program at the Greater Altoona Career and Technology Center to benefit individuals in the program, local employers, individuals seeking industry training and those seeking industry certifications in the Southern Alleghenies region of the state.
"These grant funds will enable students to receive state-of-the-art training in important phases of the industrial welding processes," said Greater Altoona Career and Technology Center Executive Director Dr. Donna M. Miller. "The addition of new equipment will help students develop skills to the level required for American Welding Society (AWS) certification."
