Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today continued his "Government That Works" Tour and announced a significant step forward in his administration's fight against the heroin epidemic in Pennsylvania. Governor Wolf stood with Physician General Dr. Rachel Levine at the Pennsylvania Medical Society as Dr. Levine signed a statewide standing order for naloxone*, a medication that can reverse an overdose that is caused by an opioid drug. The governor was also joined by Secretary Ted Dallas, Secretary Gary Tennis, Secretary Karen Murphy, and Chairman Josh Shapiro.
"This standing order is the next step in my administration's fight against the addiction and overdose epidemic in our state," said Governor Wolf. "We must do all that we can to support those Pennsylvania families suffering from the effects of addiction. I am proud to take this action with my cabinet members today."
