Governor Wolf Statement on Attorney General Shapiro's Filing Against Travel Ban
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Feb. 6, 2017
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today released the following statement on the amicus brief filing of the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, along with a coalition of 15 fellow attorneys general from across the country:
"I thank Attorney General Shapiro and his fellow attorneys general for standing up for our economy and the rule of law. This poorly-constructed order denies legal immigrants entry to America and threatens harm on Pennsylvania's higher education and medical institutions, and our economy. I fully support the Attorney General's lawsuit and stand by the principles on which our commonwealth was founded, including to provide refuge from persecution. Today, I, along with Congressman Dent, proudly welcomed legal immigrants to back to America after they were rejected by the federal government last weekend. This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue -- this is an American issue."
