Press Release

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf and Revenue Secretary Eileen McNulty today announced the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue's launch of a new Tax Registration Office to improve how businesses register and update information with the department.
"The new streamlined process is another example of how my administration is listening to taxpayers and making innovative enhancements to improve customer service and create a government that works," Governor Wolf said.
"The Tax Registration Office is a one-stop shop to register and update business tax account information with the department," said Secretary McNulty. "No longer will taxpayers need to contact multiple bureaus for their tax registration needs.
The Tax Registration Office combines the business registration functions previously managed separately by the Bureau of Business Trust Fund Taxes and the Bureau of Corporation Taxes.
Existing department staff were reassigned to the office to improve customer service.
The Tax Registration Office handles the registration and maintenance for corporate tax, employer withholding tax, promoter licenses, public transportation assistance tax licenses, sales tax exempt status, sales, use, hotel occupancy tax licenses, small games of chance licenses/certificates, transient vendor certificates, use tax, vehicle rental tax, and wholesaler certificates.
The office will assist business taxpayers with updating their address, bank account information, entity ID, legal or trade name, filing status, and filing frequency, as well as cancelling an account. Corporate filers can also update corporate officer information with the office.
