Commonwealth Court: Governor Wolf's Homecare Executive Order Allowed to Proceed
By: Tom Wolf
Date: April 23, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania today allowed Governor Tom Wolf's homecare executive order to proceed. The order is one key part of an overall plan designed to provide choices for seniors, efficiencies in home and community-based care, and offset over $162 million in costs to taxpayers. The plan also ensures that seniors, consumers, and direct care attendants will continue to have a voice in shaping the future of the homecare industry.
Governor Wolf released the following statement:
"Today's ruling by the Commonwealth Court is a victory for seniors, consumers, and direct care attendants. The court's decision affirms a key provision of my strategy to provide choices for seniors, efficiencies in home and community-based care, and offset over $162 million in costs for Pennsylvania taxpayers.
"We need to ensure the homecare sector is able to attract qualified attendants so that seniors have the option to age in a home or community-based setting. This decision allows for a critical conversation to move forward about protecting seniors as they age and treating attendants with the respect that they have earned.
"It is my sincere hope that stakeholders interested in advancing our long term care system will join me in having a robust conversation about how we deliver care to those who need it most."
As the Wolf Administration has said, the executive order ensures that home care workers have a voice in shaping the future of the industry and seniors have choices about where to receive care. The executive order does not grant collective bargaining rights to workers, does not force them to join a union, does not make them state employees, and does not give them a right to enter into a contract with the state.
