Governor Wolf today released the following statement in response to the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education's board vote to approve a tuition freeze contingent upon passage of the governor's proposed 2015-16 budget:
"I applaud the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education Board of Governors for agreeing to freeze tuition at all 14 state-owned universities. This decision is contingent upon passage of my proposed 2015-16 budget that provides a $45.3 million increase to the system. Students have borne the brunt of massive cuts over the last four years and today's action is an important step in giving them a break from constantly rising college costs. I am hopeful that the legislature will step up and deliver on this investment in higher education so we can ensure we are training graduates with the skills they need to compete in a modern economy and helping middle-class families."
