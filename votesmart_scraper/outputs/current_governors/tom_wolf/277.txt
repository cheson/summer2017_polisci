Governor Wolf Announces $12 Million in Green Light-Go Traffic Signal Improvement Funding
Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: May 16, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf announced today that 109 municipalities will receive $12 million to underwrite the costs of upgrading traffic signals under the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's (PennDOT) "Green Light-Go" program.
Made possible by Act 89, the state's transportation funding plan, the program establishes partnership agreements between municipalities and PennDOT through which municipalities request up to 50-percent funding for traffic-signal projects.
"State and local partnerships like this are critical to improving traffic flow and safety across the state, and this program helps us meet that goal," said Governor Wolf. "Through this investment, communities across the state will benefit from upgraded signals and intersections."
During this fiscal year, grants can be used for installing light-emitting diode (LED) technology, performing regional operations such as retiming, developing special event plans and monitoring traffic signals, as well as upgrading traffic signals to the latest technologies.
Under the Green Light-Go program, projects on corridors with fewer than 10,000 vehicles per day will be managed by the municipality, and PennDOT will manage any project with signals on corridors that have greater than 10,000 vehicles per day. Both types of projects will require a 50 percent match from the municipality.
