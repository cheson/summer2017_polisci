For over a century, Pennsylvanians have traveled to New York City to celebrate the holidays at Pennsylvania Society weekend. It is part of a long tradition that brings people from throughout the commonwealth together. Frances and I have always enjoyed this special weekend in New York during the holiday season.
Last year, instead of holding a fundraising reception at Pennsylvania Society as typically is the case, I contributed the cost of such a reception to Pennsylvania food banks so that those who are less fortunate than many of us may enjoy a brighter holiday. My staff and I also participated in our own small day of service on the Thursday prior to Pennsylvania Society.
