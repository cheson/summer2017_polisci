Governor Wolf Budget Update Remarks
Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Dec. 19, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Wolf gave the following budget update. Remarks as prepared:
"We still have a budget plan. It is a compromise and it is the product of a lot of good people working across the aisle to get it done.
"This is not over. We still need a budget. And we need it now. The Senate Republicans led on this -- but it was a bi-partisan effort. They delivered a budget --full year budget -- that made wise investments in our schools and that was truly balanced.
"We cannot slide back on our commitment to our schools. We cannot slide back on our commitment to a truly balanced budget. We cannot slide back on our commitment to a full year budget. Let me be clear. A stop gap is not the answer. We need a full year budget.
"Let's get back to work. All of us. Let's get this done now."
