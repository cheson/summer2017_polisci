This winter season, more than 700 plow trucks covering interstates and expressways statewide will be outfitted with technology to improve location and operations information through a Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) pilot program, Governor Tom Wolf announced today.
"This system will allow PennDOT to see operations and conditions on the ground in real-time, helping them to better analyze how they do their jobs and get the best investment out of every dollar," Governor Wolf said. "A government that works is also a transparent one and this pilot is a perfect example of maximizing efficiency and modernizing operations."
