This week, the Governor continued to hold bipartisan roundtable discussions to address Pennsylvania's opioid crisis in Williamsport, Lancaster, and Coatesville. Fighting Pennsylvania's opioid and heroin epidemic is a top priority for Governor Wolf and these roundtables are an opportunity to work collaboratively with the General Assembly and community leaders to ensure Pennsylvania leads the nation in the fight to combat the opioid abuse and heroin use crisis.
Governor Wolf also applauded Insurance Commissioner Teresa Miller for announcing new Insurance Department expectations for non-discrimination provisions in health insurance policies, including language prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The governor also celebrated the one year expansion of medicaid in Pennsylvania. Because of the expansion of Medicaid, hundreds of thousands of people have a brighter future and better potential health outcomes. We are excited to enroll even more Pennsylvanians in our next outreach efforts.
