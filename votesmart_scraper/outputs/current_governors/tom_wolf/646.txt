Tom Wolf released the following statement addressing Governor Corbett's 2014-2015 budget:
"Over the last four years, Governor Corbett has displayed a lack of leadership when it comes to addressing the needs of Pennsylvania's economy and schools. The governor has refused to support a responsible and reasonable severance tax to fund our schools and he has failed to find solutions to the state's struggling economy, which has plummeted to 49th in job creation.
"Governor Corbett's latest budget - true to form - is not a blueprint for the future, but another missed opportunity that will keep our state stuck in neutral. It's built on one-time revenue sources and other gimmicks, and the projections are based on flimsy assumptions and thin expectations. As a result of these failed policies, our children are not receiving the resources they deserve and school districts across Pennsylvania have been forced to raise property taxes.
"Right now, middle-class families are shouldering the burden while special interests are given endless breaks. We need to work toward building an economy that works for all Pennsylvanians. It's tWhile Economy And Schools Suffer, Corbett Signs Budget Built On Gimmicks and Gamesime to move Pennsylvania forward."
