Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf today announced that the Pennsylvania Capitol Police are now trained to administer and will carry the life-saving opioid overdose reversal antidote known as naloxone.
"In October, my administration took the step of signing a statewide standing order for naloxone as part of our fight against the addiction and overdose epidemic in our state," said Governor Wolf.
