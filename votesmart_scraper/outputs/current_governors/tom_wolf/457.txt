First Lady Frances Wolf today announced that 3D mammograms will be covered by insurance under existing state law and must be provided to Pennsylvania women at no cost. The announcement, which establishes that insurers must treat 3D mammograms the same as traditional two-dimensional mammograms when determining healthcare coverage, came during a meeting of the Pennsylvania Breast Cancer Coalition in Harrisburg.
"This modern technology is offering new opportunities for physicians to diagnose breast cancer in women and provide life-saving treatment earlier than ever," said Governor Tom Wolf. "Questions have arisen as to whether 3D mammograms should be covered by insurance in the same manner that traditional mammograms are. Today, I am announcing that my administration's answer to this question is an absolute yes."
