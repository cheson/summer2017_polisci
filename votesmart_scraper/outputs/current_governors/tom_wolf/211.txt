On Tuesday, U.S. Senator Bob Casey hosted a news conference in Pittston, Pennsylvania to address the need for non-discrimination legislation to be passed nationally and statewide. Pennsylvania's Physician General Dr. Rachel Levine attended and participated in the senator's conference.
Governor Wolf and his administration have supported non-discrimination efforts and have urged the legislature to pass laws to end discrimination in housing and employment practices statewide. In April, the governor signed two executive orders to protect LGBT workers employed by the state and companies contracted by the state.
"We must show that Pennsylvania is the place that William Penn envisioned when he founded our commonwealth on the principle that it is open, diverse, and inclusive for all people," said Governor Wolf. "I call on the General Assembly to swiftly put legislation on my desk that ensures that people throughout the commonwealth -- regardless of sexual orientation, gender expression or identity -- are treated equally under Pennsylvania law."
