Location: Harrisburg, PA

As part of an expanded technology pilot, the public can now view hundreds of plow trucks on interstates and expressways this winter at www.511PA.com, Governor Tom Wolf announced today. The announcement is part of the Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) system pilot first announced by the governor in October, which improves PennDOT's information on vehicle movement and usage of winter materials.
"This initiative will improve PennDOT's operations by looking for efficiencies in how the agency's fleet is operating during the winter months, while promoting transparency by allowing the public access to this information," Governor Wolf said. "This is a step forward in showing Pennsylvanians how hard PennDOT is working to keep them safe during the winter season."
