Governor Wolf Vetoes Unnecessary Encroachment on Executive Responsibility to Ensure Public Safety
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Dec. 4, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today vetoed Senate Bill 490, which stripped the vested, sole authority of the governor to appoint the director of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency established more than three decades ago.
"Senate Bill 490 unnecessarily encroaches upon this longstanding gubernatorial authority without providing a sound basis for doing so, which could disrupt PEMA's ability and responsibility to ensure public safety in emergencies," Governor Wolf said in a message to Senators. "Given PEMA's unique mission concerning preparing for and responding to disasters, it is imperative that its leader's path to directing emergency management operations not be unduly obstructed following his or her appointment. Any impediment or disruption could have a detrimental impact on public safety and the welfare of the commonwealth and its citizens during an unforeseen crisis."
