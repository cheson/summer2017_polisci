In letters to be sent today to board members and leadership of more than two dozen state commissions, authorities and other agencies, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf will urge each of the independent organizations to enact a total ban on gifts for their employees to in-line with the Governor's executive order signed on his first day in office.
"As elected and appointed leaders, all of us have a duty to be responsible stewards of the democratic process and taxpayer's hard-earned money," Governor Wolf said. "Too often our leaders take advantage of the public, but I am committed to making government work so we can restore the public's trust and make sure we are being open and transparent. Each of these agencies should join me in enacting sweeping reform to end a practice that has plagued the public's trust in state government for too long."

Last week, both the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board revised their existing policies to conform to the Governor's executive order banning gifts. Governor Wolf commended both of these organizations and their leadership for each taking a strong step toward increasing the public's faith in their organizations and state government.

In addition to signing an executive order banning gifts, Governor Wolf required members of his staff and cabinet to undergo ethics and open records training on his first full day in office.
