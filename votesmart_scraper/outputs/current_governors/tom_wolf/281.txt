Wolf Administration Announces New Rail Projects That Will Create, Retain 48,000 Jobs Through State Investment
Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: May 12, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

An estimated 9,200 jobs will be created and more than 39,000 will be retained over the next five years due to thirty-one rail projects being made possible by two PennDOT-managed grant programs.
"Pennsylvania has the most railroads in the country and these make up a vital component of our economic and transportation activities," said Governor Tom Wolf. "These investments underscore our role in supporting jobs and economies across the state."
The State Transportation Commission (STC) voted today to approve $36 million for 15 projects through the Rail Transportation Assistance Program (RTAP) and 16 projects through the Rail Freight Assistance Program (RFAP). RTAP is a capital budget grant program funded with bonds and RFAP is underwritten through the new Multimodal Fund, created by Act 89.
Act 89 is a far-reaching transportation program that clears the way for significant investments in all transportation modes.
