Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf today made his first pair of school visits since delivering his 2015-2016 budget, which makes historic investments in public education.

Governor Wolf spent the afternoon with students, teachers and administrators at Hamburg Area High School, following a morning stop at Downingtown STEM Academy High School in Chester County. The Governor's budget will restore over $780,000 in funding to the Hamburg Area School District. It will also provide the Hamburg Area School District with an allocation of $5.8 million in property tax reductions.
