Press Release

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today announced the investment of $68 million for twenty drinking water, wastewater and non-point source projects across fourteen counties through the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST).
"The PENNVEST Board of Directors today continued its commitment to improving the drinking water consumed every day by citizens all across Pennsylvania while also helping to improve the quality of the Commonwealth's remarkable system of rivers and streams", said Governor Wolf. "These otherwise expensive projects are brought within the financial reach of the communities who received assistance today, due to the low interest rates and grants that PENNVEST is able to offer its funding recipients."
Of the $68.1 million, $46.8 million is allocated for low-interest loans and $21.3 million is awarded through grants.
The funding comes from a combination of state funds approved by voters, federal grants to PENNVEST from the Environmental Protection Agency and recycled loan repayments from previous PENNVEST funding awards. Funds for the projects are disbursed after bills for work are paid and receipts are submitted to PENNVEST.
