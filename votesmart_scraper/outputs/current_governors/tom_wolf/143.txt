Governor Tom Wolf today joined Senator John Yudichak and Representative Eddie Day Pashinski to announce a $2 million state grant for the expansion of a technology innovation project in Downtown Wilkes-Barre. "Innovation Squared' is a four-pronged initiative to create an innovation district for the region, and will create and retain 200 full-time jobs.
"Great work has already been done to improve the safety of and capitalize on the assets of the Square here in Wilkes-Barre, but this particular site remains outdated," Governor Wolf said. "The renovation will make the center of Downtown Wilkes-Barre a focal point for a vibrant and active community, while creating good paying jobs that will attract talent to the area."
