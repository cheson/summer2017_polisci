Press Release

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf, presiding over a cavalcade of bands, livestock, farm equipment, agriculture royalty, and volunteers at the opening ceremony of Pennsylvania's 100th Farm Show today touted the state agriculture industry's ability to meet food demands and to strengthen Pennsylvania's economy.
"Agriculture is a tremendous resource that fuels our economy," said Governor Wolf. "Pennsylvania is already a national leader in commodities like milk and mushrooms, apples, eggs and hardwoods. These goods generate billions of dollars for our economy and employ tens of thousands of people.
"I envision a Pennsylvania agriculture industry that builds on our existing strengths and expands to meet growing demands for food year round. But to do that requires new investments in technology, in market development, in education and workforce development, and in improving access to food. It requires us to be vigilant on matters of food and animal safety, as well as plant health, and controlling against invasive threats. These are priorities for my administration, and we're making great progress, which people can see firsthand here at the 100th Farm Show."
