Governor Tom Wolf signed House Bill 1552 into law, which establishes a fair funding formula and provides emergency funds for two of the commonwealth's financially distressed school districts. Governor Wolf also called for new funding to help restore equity to Pennsylvania public school districts.
"Prior to today, Pennsylvania was one of only three states in the nation without a fair funding formula," said Governor Wolf. "Following great work by the Basic Education Funding Commission, the commonwealth finally has a permanent formula for the distribution of basic education funding that takes into account each district's unique needs."
