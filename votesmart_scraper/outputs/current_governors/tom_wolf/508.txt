Governor Wolf announced today that the Commonwealth Financing Authority approved funding to support a new Alternative and Clean Energy (ACE) project with an investment of $500,000 in Clearfield County.
"The Commonwealth Financing Authority made a key investment today for Pennsylvania's environment and growth," Governor Wolf said. "The project approved today marks advancement for clean energy technologies to once again make Pennsylvania a national energy leader."
The Commonwealth Financing Authority (CFA) approved one Alternative Energy Production project through the state's Alternative and Clean Energy program that is projected to result in more than $2.17 million in additional economic investments.
West Branch Area School District will receive a $500,000 grant for the installation of a biomass boiler system in Morris Township. The system will be used to heat both the elementary and secondary school buildings. With the current boiler system, West Branch Area School District uses oil for 100 percent of its heating demands. With the installation of the new biomass boiler system, the usage of oil will decrease to 20 percent of the heating requirements for the school, saving approximately 53,832 gallons of oil per year. The biomass system will burn approximately 738 tons of locally grown wood fuel per year and provide annual savings of $137,214 for the school district.
The ACE Program provides financial assistance in the form of grants and loan funds that will be used by eligible applicants for the utilization, development and construction of alternative and clean energy projects in the state.
