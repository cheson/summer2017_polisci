Governor Tom Wolf and Department of Human Services (DHS) Secretary Ted Dallas today announced that the commonwealth has successfully transitioned the first Pennsylvanian into an apartment through the Section 811 Project Rental Assistance (PRA) program.
"My administration has worked since day one to provide the best possible home health care for Pennsylvania," said Governor Wolf. "Our hope is that we're able to provide access to housing that enables more Pennsylvanians to live independently and safely in the community."
