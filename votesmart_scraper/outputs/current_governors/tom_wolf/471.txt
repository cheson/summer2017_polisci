By: Tom Wolf
Date: Sept. 11, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today ordered all United States and Pennsylvania flags at the Capitol Complex and at Commonwealth facilities statewide lowered to half- staff on Friday, September 11 in honor of Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance.
Today Governor Wolf spoke at the Flight 93 memorial:
"What happened in New York City, Washington D.C., and here in Shanksville on this day fourteen years ago changed our world.
"We will never forget what happened on Flight 93 and the passengers and crew who made a huge difference in the course of our history. The terrible tragedy that would have taken place had Flight 93 gone where the hijackers wanted it to go must continue to haunt us.
"The actions of the passengers and crew of Flight 93 taught us that we are -- each one of us -- capable of doing remarkably selfless and heroic things.
"What they did saved countless lives. And what they did told us all a great deal about the potential nobility that lies within each of us.
"Today, we remember what they did on September 11, 2001. And we will be forever grateful. Thank you."
All Pennsylvanians are invited to participate in this tribute.
