Governor Tom Wolf announced today that Cumberland Valley Analytical Services (CVAS), a chemistry forage lab serving the dairy industry, will relocate its operations from Maryland to a renovated facility in Washington Township, Franklin County. The move will create 78 new, full-time jobs over the next three years.
"Cumberland Valley Analytical Services chose to relocate its operations to Pennsylvania for several important reasons, including our business-friendly climate, our strong agricultural focus, and the value we place on industry's benefits to the local economy," Governor Wolf said. "It's with great pleasure that we welcome this family-owned and managed business to the commonwealth. The services it provides help support our dairy sector and promote a safe food supply for our residents."
