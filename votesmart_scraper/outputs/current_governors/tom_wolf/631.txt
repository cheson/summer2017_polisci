Tom Wolf released the following statement after Governor Corbett signed the Philadelphia cigarette tax into law:
"I am pleased that Philadelphia schools will be receiving much-needed funding to help educate our children, but the reason Philadelphia schools are in a situation where they need to rely on a cigarette tax is the direct result of Governor Corbett's failure in leadership. Governor Corbett's misguided policies and $1 billion cuts to education have decimated schools across Pennsylvania.
"As a result of Governor Corbett's cuts, few schools districts were hit harder than Philadelphia where they lost over $260 million, and have suffered through massive layoffs to teachers, nurses, librarians, and guidance counselors. To make matters worse, in order to open schools on time, the district was forced to cut security, janitorial services, and transportation. We should not be putting any of our school districts in this situation.
"Under Governor Corbett, 27,000 educators have been laid off, property taxes have skyrocketed, class sizes have increased, and valuable programs have been eliminated across the state. I will restore Governor Corbett's drastic cuts by passing a 5 percent severance tax on natural gas. I will also work to create a fair funding formula that takes each district's unique needs into account."
