Tom Wolf issued the following statement regarding the CMS Medicaid waiver:
"It is unfortunate that hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians lost a year of health care coverage, but I am gratified that they and their families will now have added health and economic security.
"After standing in the way of Medicaid expansion for years, Tom Corbett has finally been forced by political reality to accept a Medicaid proposal.
"Tom Corbett's unconscionable delay has cost Pennsylvania hundreds of millions of dollars while making it more difficult for hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians to get the health care they needed.
"Tom Corbett should have expanded Medicaid on day one instead of wasting two years. Tom Corbett's repeated mismanagement is completely unacceptable, and it underscores the importance of giving Pennsylvania a fresh start."
