But I also want to say that as a Pennsylvanian, I am so proud of the way this was handled by the folks here in PhiladelphiaÂ…This is an example of cooperation and collaboration. We have worked together to work through this tragedy and I can't say enough about the heroism of the first responders who came to this site right after the accident and risked their lives to save as many people as they possibly could. So as a Pennsylvanian, I just want to express my pride and my thanks to the mayor and his team for doing such a tremendous job during such a terrible tragedy."
