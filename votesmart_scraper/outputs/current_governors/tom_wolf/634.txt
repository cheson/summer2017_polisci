Today, it was announced that the Corbett administration needs to take out a loan to meet basic state spending. For four years, Tom Corbett has relied on budget gimmicks that have created a fiscal mess. Tom Wolf released the following statement.
"Once again, Pennsylvanians are suffering from Gov. Corbett's mismanagement and failed leadership. Gov. Corbett's budgets have been filled with one-time gimmicks and a lack of real solutions, resulting in credit downgrades and a $2.7 billion deficit. Now, Gov. Corbett's financial mess has forced Pennsylvania to rely on loans just for the state to pay its bills. It is time for a fresh start and a new approach that will put Pennsylvania's fiscal house in order and get our commonwealth moving again."
