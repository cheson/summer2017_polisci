Governor Wolf Statement on Recent Events in Louisiana, Minnesota, and Texas
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: July 8, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Wolf released the following statement:
"I'm greatly saddened by the horrific acts of violence that have taken place over the past several days.
"We have to ask ourselves, is this the type of country we want? I believe the answer is no.
"We must treat each other with compassion and understanding. We must seek to understand each other, our similarities and our differences. And we must never, ever let violence beget violence.
"When incidents like those in Louisiana, Minnesota, and Dallas happen, it raises concerns and questions, and we must demand change and action.
"It is unacceptable for people to live in fear because of the color of their skin. There is no justification.
"Law enforcement has a trying and dangerous job to do, and they keep us safe. As officers were bringing out the best in ourselves by protecting protesters and preserving their right to assemble, they were attacked. There is no justification for that either.
"All of us must take steps -- community leaders, elected officials, public safety professionals, each and every person -- to build the country we want so that all people feel safe in their interactions with their fellow citizens. We all must denounce violence unequivocally and embrace peace. We must ensure that justice is served to those who commit attacks and gruesome crimes against fellow citizens and law enforcement. We must demand better of our country and our fellow Americans."
