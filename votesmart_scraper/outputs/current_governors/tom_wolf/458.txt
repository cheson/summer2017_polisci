Remarks by Governor Wolf at Corporal Bryon Dickson Exit Dedication
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Oct. 2, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

We are here to pay tribute to a hero. Corporal Bryon Dickson gave his life in the service of the people of Pennsylvania. Like his colleagues -- including Alex Douglass here today -- in the Pennsylvania State Police, he chose to serve his Commonwealth.
And like his colleagues, he did this voluntarily. He did it knowing the risks he was taking for himself. And for his family. And his wife Tiffany. And his two sons -- Bryon and Adam. And he paid the ultimate price
So in dedicating this exit ramp to his memory, we are honoring him for his specific act of selfless heroism. But we are also honoring him for the valiant gesture he made to all of us in volunteering for this duty. For being so willing to serve us.
