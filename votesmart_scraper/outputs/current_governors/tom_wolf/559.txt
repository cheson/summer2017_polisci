Location: Harrisburg, PA

Today, Governor Tom Wolf visited East Penn Manufacturing in Berks County and released a new web video to highlight his proposals to rebuild the middle class, reinvigorate Pennsylvania's manufacturing sector, and ensure more workers have the skills that employers demand. Governor Wolf's budget makes significant new investments in manufacturing, economic development and workforce training aimed at rebuilding Pennsylvania's middle class while reducing the corporate net income tax by 40 percent immediately.
"To rebuild the middle class, we need new ideas to create jobs that pay and policies that support our manufacturing and new growth industries," Governor Wolf said. "Coming from the private sector, I know we must make new investments in 21st century manufacturing and refocus our economic development dollars and strategies. The commonwealth can help set the table for robust private sector growth to create and retain good jobs while strengthening the middle class."
