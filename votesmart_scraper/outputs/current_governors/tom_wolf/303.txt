Governor Wolf Statement on Fiscal Code
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: April 22, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Wolf released the following statement regarding the fiscal code:
"Over the past several days, I have worked with Republicans and Democrats in the legislature to finalize the 2015-2016 budget. I will let the fiscal code become law without my signature, and I look forward to working with the legislature in the coming weeks to address our challenges and meet the needs of distressed school districts so that they will remain solvent. As we enter 2016-2017, I look forward to coming together to reach a long-term solution to fix our deficit and to fund education at all levels. I remain adamant that we must take additional steps to restore the cuts from the previous administration.
"We still have a long way to go to restore the cuts to education at all levels, Pre-K through higher education.
"I am eager to get to work immediately with Republican and Democratic leaders to discuss a responsible 2016-2017 budget that is balanced, fixes the deficit, continues to make important investments in education and prevents Pennsylvania from going over a fiscal cliff that will have serious implications for our long-term future."
