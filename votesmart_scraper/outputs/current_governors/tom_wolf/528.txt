Governor Tom Wolf announced today that All Fresh Farms, LLC, an indoor hydroponic production and packaging operation that specializes in growing lettuce mixes, kales, and basil, will establish a new facility in Greene Township, Pike County, a move that will create at least 200 new jobs.
"Today's announcement of 200 new jobs coming to Pike County is another huge win for Pennsylvania," said Governor Wolf. "All Fresh Farms chose the commonwealth as the best location to support their business over other sites outside of the state and I have no doubt that my budget as proposed will continue this momentum, paving the way for even more jobs that pay."
