Governor Wolf released the following statement regarding legislation approving the sale of six-packs at beer distributors:
"I have worked hard with Republicans and Democrats in the General Assembly to modernize the sale of liquor, wine, and beer in Pennsylvania in order to bring the commonwealth's wine and spirits system into the 21st century.
"I applaud Republicans and Democrats in both chambers for approving the sale of six-packs of beer at distributors throughout the commonwealth, and I look forward to signing the legislation into law.
"Following my administration's successful efforts to free the six-pack at gas stations across the commonwealth and my work with Republicans and Democrats in the legislature to pass historic liquor reform, this legislation enhances the customer experience by providing greater convenience and satisfaction to the residents of Pennsylvania."
