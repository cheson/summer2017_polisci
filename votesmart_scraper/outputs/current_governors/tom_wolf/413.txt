Governor Tom Wolf and officials from the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMVA) today announced that as part of the Governor's challenge to significantly reduce veteran homelessness, 481 homeless veterans in Pennsylvania were placed in permanent housing between Sept. 23 and Nov. 30, 2015. The Governor's challenge was announced on Sept. 22.
"Pennsylvania is making steady progress in housing its homeless veterans. With winter weather and extreme cold temperatures rapidly approaching, it is more important than ever that we locate and assist them," said Governor Wolf. "While we still must wait for final numbers for December, we know that we are getting closer to meeting our goal of providing 550 veterans with stable housing, as well as access to the programs and services that will help them rebuild their lives, by the end of the year."
