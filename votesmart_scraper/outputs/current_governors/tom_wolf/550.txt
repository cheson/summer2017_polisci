Governor Tom Wolf today announced that 15 environmental projects from across the state will receive the 2015 Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence.
"These awards represent some of our best citizen-led efforts in environmental stewardship," Wolf said. "Their leadership is bound to make a positive impact on the communities they serve."
Any Pennsylvania business, school, government agency, trade organization, non-profit organization, or agribusiness that has completed projects to promote environmental stewardship and economic development was eligible to apply for the award. The winners were selected by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
"We received numerous entries from worthy projects across the state," Acting DEP Secretary John Quigley said. "The innovations shown by this year's winners represent Pennsylvanians' commitment to protecting our environment."
The winning projects include a recycling drive, a statewide litter cleanup, a watershed enhancement initiative, a cleanup of an industrial site, and much more.
The Pennsylvania Environmental Council will host a dinner to honor the award winners April 28 at the Hilton in downtown Harrisburg.
