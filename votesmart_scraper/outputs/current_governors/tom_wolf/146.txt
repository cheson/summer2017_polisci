Governor Wolf Makes Schools That Teach Stop in Pittsburgh
Press Release

Date: Oct. 6, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

As part of his statewide "Schools That Teach' Tour, Governor Tom Wolf visited today with students and staff at Allegheny K-5 School in Pittsburgh. In the 2016-17 budget, Governor secured over $3 million in increased classroom funding for the Pittsburgh School District, making for a total increase of over $6 million to Pittsburgh schools over his first two budgets.
"We have made great strides over the last two years in restoring the massive hit schools took due to state budget cuts in 2011, but we still have a lot of work to do," Governor Wolf said. "The Pittsburgh School District is one of many across the commonwealth that continues to struggle for adequate funding while working hard to provide the best possible education to students."
Governor Wolf has fought for more education funding since day one and he has made investment in our schools and our children his top priority. Working with the legislature, the governor has secured historic increases of nearly $640 million in his first two years:
$415 million in basic education funding
$60 million for early childhood education
$50 million in special education funding
$14.6 million for early intervention
$81.4 million for PASSHE and state-related schools
$16.4 million for Community Colleges
Additionally, in June 2016, Governor Wolf signed House Bill 1552 into law, which established a fair funding formula and provided emergency funds for two of the commonwealth's financially distressed school districts. The law, known as Act 35, establishes a fair, equitable formula for allocating new state funds to Pennsylvania schools. The Basic Education Funding Formula accounts for district-based factors including the wealth of the district, the district's current tax effort, and the ability of the district to raise revenue.
