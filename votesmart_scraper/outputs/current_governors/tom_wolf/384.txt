Governor's Office statement on delay in implementation of the Keystone exams:
"Governor Wolf supports the delay in implementation of the Keystone exams. While the governor believes we should have high standards, there have been issues with the implementation, and it is prudent to allow more time. Additionally, the governor and Secretary Rivera are currently engaging teachers, administrators and students, community leaders, stakeholders and advocates from around the state to develop a comprehensive school accountability system that will support schools and help Pennsylvania students succeed."
