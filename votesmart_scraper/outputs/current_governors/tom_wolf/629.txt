Tom Wolf released the following statement in response to the Philadelphia School Reform Commission's action in Philadelphia:
"This is just one more situation that has been forced by Gov. Corbett's $1 billion cut to education in Pennsylvania and his chronic neglect of the Philadelphia public schools and schools throughout Pennsylvania.
"All stakeholders have to work together to ensure the best results for students in Philadelphia. Unilateral action undermines the collaboration that we need in order to develop a long term solution for schools in Philadelphia and throughout Pennsylvania.
"Under Governor Corbett, 27,000 educators have been laid off, property taxes have skyrocketed, class sizes have increased, and valuable programs have been eliminated across the state. It's just simply unacceptable.
"As governor, I will work to fund our schools by implementing a 5 percent severance tax, implementing charter school reform, and creating a fair funding formula that takes each district's unique needs into account."
