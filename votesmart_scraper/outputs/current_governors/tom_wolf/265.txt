Governor Tom Wolf announced today that FedEx Ground will establish a distribution center in Allen Township, Northampton County, a move that is expected to create 680 new full-time and part-time jobs.
"Pennsylvania is steadily rebuilding its reputation as the best state to do business in, thanks in part to our unparalleled public-private partnerships," Governor Wolf said. "The significant investment FedEx is making in Pennsylvania by establishing a new mid-Atlantic distribution facility that is expected to create 680 new jobs is just one example of the type of success that is happening all throughout the commonwealth."
FedEx Ground has purchased 253 acres in Allen Township, Northampton County, and will construct an 800,000 square-foot distribution center and related structures as part of a new Mid-Atlantic hub. FedEx Ground will invest more than $227.5 million in the project, and is projected to create 282 new, full-time jobs over the next three years and also anticipates creating 398 new, permanent part-time jobs. In addition, the company is expected to retain 1,652 existing employees statewide.
FedEx Ground received a funding proposal from the Department of Community and Economic Development that includes a $1,130,000 Pennsylvania First Program grant, $846,000 in Job Creation Tax Credits to be distributed upon creation of the new jobs, and $126,900 in WEDnetPA funding for employee training.
The project was coordinated by the Governor's Action Team, an experienced group of economic development professionals who report directly to the governor and work with businesses that are considering locating or expanding in Pennsylvania in collaboration with the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation.
FedEx Ground is a wholly owned subsidiary of FedEx Corporation. FedEx Corporation has more than 340,000 employees worldwide, and FedEx Ground has nearly 80,000 employees in the United States and Canada.
