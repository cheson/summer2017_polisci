Today, the Tom Wolf Administration Transition is launching a new website that will allow Pennsylvanians to interact with the transition, learn more about the process, provide feedback, receive announcements, and submit resumes.
"Launching WolfTransitionPa.com is the first step in the transition process, and it will help facilitate a conversation with the people of Pennsylvania about giving our commonwealth a fresh start. During the transition, I will work to bring together people from diverse backgrounds who have new and innovative ideas for Pennsylvania," said Tom Wolf. "It's a big challenge, and I need people throughout Pennsylvania to be part of how we move Pennsylvania forward."
