Governor Tom Wolf today announced that the Pennsylvania State Police will receive nearly a half million dollars in federal grants to supplement their efforts to combat drug trafficking in the commonwealth.
"My administration has provided more resources and help for people struggling from the disease of addiction, while at the same time holding drug traffickers that prey on these victims accountable," Governor Wolf said. "These grants will help bolster the work that our troopers are already doing to root out and arrest drug traffickers."
The grants from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) include $300,000 to combat heroin trafficking and $186,793 to combat methamphetamines.
DOJ's Anti-Heroin Task Force (AHTF) Program advances public safety by providing funds to investigate illicit activities related to the distribution of heroin or unlawful distribution of prescription opioids, or unlawful heroin and prescription opioid traffickers through statewide collaboration.
"Our Troopers are on the front lines of combatting the drug trade and work on local and multi-state trafficking investigations to stop heroin and other drugs from creating further damage to our communities," PSP Commissioner Col. Tyree Blocker said. "We are proud to be a part of Governor Wolf's efforts to combat the heroin and opioid crisis facing our commonwealth."
In the first half of 2016, the Pennsylvania State Police seized over $31 million in heroin, marijuana, and other illicit drugs. Specifically, these totals include over 42 pounds of heroin with a street value of over $13 million.
