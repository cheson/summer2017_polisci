Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: March 9, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement on the first meeting of the Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI) Working Group:
"Today's first Working Group meeting illustrates the depth and breadth of the problems facing our criminal justice system and the incredible opportunity we have to save money, improve public safety and promote fairness with this phase of the Justice Reinvestment Initiative in Pennsylvania. The working group is made up of a diverse and robust representation of the stakeholders in our criminal justice system from arrest, trial, sentencing, incarceration, and post-release.
"The front-end focus of this phase of JRI will require significant work to find common ground but today's meeting proves that we are all committed to finding ways to reform our criminal justice system based on research and focused on outcomes that improve public safety. I look forward to the work that will be done with our partners at the Council of State Governments over the next year and working in a bi-partisan, data-driven way to make real criminal justice reform a reality."
In February, Governor Tom Wolf, leaders of the General Assembly and criminal justice stakeholders announced the formation of the JRI Working Group. Today's meeting was led by Chair of the JRI Working Group and Chairman of the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency Josh Shapiro and Vice Chair and Secretary of Corrections John Wetzel, along with representatives from the Council of State Government. JRI work is funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts and the United States Department of Justice.
