Governor Tom Wolf today applauded the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority (PRPA) for its enactment of a gift ban as part of the organization's Ethics Policy. The governor also commended PRPA for adjusting its process for contracting of legal services.
"I am committed to making government work so we can restore the public's trust and make sure we are being open and transparent," said Governor Wolf. "That is why I signed executive orders banning gifts for all employees of the executive branch and reforming the way the Commonwealth contracts with outside legal firms.
"I commend PRPA's actions following my lead to ban gifts and to make the process of contracting outside legal work more transparent. This is an important step."
PRPA's board passed a resolution amending the Authority's ethics policy so that the section on prohibiting gifts mirrors that of the Governor's executive order. As you will see the ethics policy covers both the Board and its employees. PRPA also adjusted its internal process for contracting legal services. Going forward, on projects that require legal services, PRPA will issue requests for qualifications to firms that are currently on the approved on-call list and selections will be made based upon qualifications and an equitable distribution of work.
