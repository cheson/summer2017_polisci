Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Wolf released the following statement regarding the Commonwealth Court's decision on Medicare Advantage:
"From the beginning, I have been very clear that I will not stand by and allow our most vulnerable citizens, especially seniors, to be used as pawns in the dispute between UPMC and Highmark.
"UPMC's decision to cancel Medicare Advantage for over 180,000 seniors was wrong, and today I am pleased that the Commonwealth Court ruled in favor of protecting seniors. The feud between these two companies must end -- the people of Western Pennsylvania have had enough.
"My administration will continue working tirelessly to protect consumers, especially seniors and vulnerable populations caught in the middle."
