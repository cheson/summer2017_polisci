Governor Wolf Announces Eighteen Municipalities to Improve Traffic Safety with Red Light Enforcement Funds
Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: May 16, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today announced that the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) will distribute nearly $5.5 million in Automated Red Light Enforcement (ARLE) funding to 18 municipalities statewide to fund 23 safety projects.
"While having all drivers traveling safely is our ultimate goal, I'm pleased that traffic fines are being reinvested into making our communities safer," Governor Wolf said. "This program brings safer travel to every corner of the state."
As part of the statewide investment, the selection team identified that $200,000 should be used to update the state Transportation Advisory Committee's 2011 evaluation study on the ARLE program.
Under state law, fines from red light violations at 28 intersections in Philadelphia supply the grant funding. Pennsylvania's ARLE program aims to improve safety at signalized intersections by providing automated enforcement at locations where data shows red-light running has been an issue.
The law specifies that projects improving safety, enhancing mobility and reducing congestion can be considered for funding. Municipalities submitted more than 194 applications, totaling approximately $41.5 million.
Projects were selected by an eight-member committee based on criteria such as benefits and effectiveness, cost, local and regional impact, and cost sharing.
This investment brings the total dollars awarded through the ARLE funding program since 2010 to $45.4 million, funding 298 safety projects.
