Governor Tom Wolf today announced that Highmark will continue to cover pregnancy and related care at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC in 2015, despite it no longer being in their network of providers. Coverage for these services will be at in-network rates.
"Any woman who became pregnant and sought treatment in 2014 and has Highmark insurance will have in-network access to Magee-Womens Hospital in 2015," said Governor Tom Wolf. "The needs of patients must always come first and I am pleased that we have reached a swift and necessary resolution in this matter."

Under Governor Tom Wolf's administration, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance and the Pennsylvania Department of Health will work diligently to continue to enforce the consent decree between Highmark and UPMC.

"We are pleased that expectant mothers will continue to receive the access to the care they need," said Acting Insurance Commissioner Teresa Miller. "Ensuring greater access to care and transparency for Western Pennsylvania patients is a top priority for this administration."
