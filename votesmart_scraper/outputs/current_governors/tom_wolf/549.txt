The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) and the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) announced today that Maryland accepted its offer of resources to assist with the State of Emergency currently active in the City of Baltimore. Pennsylvania offered assistance in response to an Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) request that was put out by Maryland this week.
"Our troopers and emergency personnel are sources of pride for our commonwealth," Governor Tom Wolf said. "Our thoughts will be with them and their families as they help our neighbors in Baltimore during this difficult time. We hope that with their assistance, calm will prevail and the Baltimore community can begin to move forward."
