Press Release

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today announced the successful transition of 121,234 individuals from the previous Healthy PA plan to a traditional Medicaid expansion plan called HealthChoices. This transition provides greater health care coverage in a simpler and streamlined manner to Pennsylvanians who are most in need. In addition to those existing clients who were transitioned, all future applications will now go through the new simplified HealthChoices system.
"Today is a critical step in the transition to a traditional Medicaid expansion. The changes put in place today will make it easier for hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians to get access to the health care they need. These changes get rid of the unnecessary red tape and complex processes that existed in the previous system," said Governor Tom Wolf.
The HealthChoices expansion moves Pennsylvania to a single, comprehensive Adult benefit package that provides individuals enhanced coverage for both physical and behavioral health. The Department of Human Services (DHS) completed the update to its data systems that enabled the transition to HealthChoices this weekend.
"Thank you to all the DHS staff that worked some very long hours to implement this phase of the Medicaid expansion," said Acting DHS Secretary Ted Dallas. "Their teamwork is a great example of what the Governor means when he says that his Administration will be a government that works."
The transition to HealthChoices is taking place in two phases, with Phase One beginning today.
"As of noon today, we have authorized 1,108 applications in the new system," said Dallas.
