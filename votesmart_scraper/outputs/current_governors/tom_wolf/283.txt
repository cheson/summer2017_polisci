Governor Wolf released the following statement regarding the Verizon strike:
"Today, I spoke with Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam and urged a quick resolution to this challenging situation. As a former CEO, I understand that businesses have difficult decisions to make, but all employees deserve to be treated with fairness, dignity and respect.
"When workers are treated fairly, business, employees, families, and our communities thrive. We need to make sure we are protecting good paying jobs and not eliminating them."
