After calling for a reduction in Wall Street management fees more than a year ago, Governor Wolf released the following statement regarding progress made by SERS and PSERS to achieve this goal:
"I have been pushing for more than a year to significantly reduce the excessive Wall Street management fees paid by SERS and PSERS as part of pension reform. This important step saves money for Pennsylvania's hardworking taxpayers. I am pleased that PSERS has reduced management fees by $103 million and SERS has reduced the fees it pays by $16 million, and I applaud both systems for their work in this area.
