Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: June 7, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Wolf released the following statement in support of Senate Bill 1202, an act amending the Achieving Better Care by Monitoring All Prescriptions Program (ABC-MAP) Act:
"I want to thank Senators Yaw and Wozniak, and their colleagues, for continuing to find solutions to combatting the opioid abuse crisis in Pennsylvania, and I am committed to working with the legislature to eradicate this issue that is plaguing the commonwealth and killing our residents.
"This amendment to ABC-MAP would require pain management and prescribing practices to be included in continuing medical education credits for those licensed to prescribe and dispense in Pennsylvania. I am hopeful it is sent to my desk, and I will sign it into law.
"The magnitude of the addiction and overdose death epidemic in Pennsylvania is astounding, and a collaborative effort on the federal, state, and local levels is crucial. That is why the leadership that Senators Yaw and Wozniak have shown is integral to our efforts. I am hopeful to continue to find ways to improve and strengthen ABC-MAP, as well as work together to reach solutions to fight this public health emergency."
