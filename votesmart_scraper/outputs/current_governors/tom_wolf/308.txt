Governor Wolf released the following statement:
"I want to thank the members of the Senate for their passage of the medical marijuana legalization bill and I am urging the House to take quick action in order to send this bill to my desk for a signature. It is finally time to provide long overdue medical relief to patients and families who could benefit from the legalization of medical marijuana. We should not deny doctor-recommended treatment that could help people suffering from seizures or cancer patients affected by chemotherapy."
