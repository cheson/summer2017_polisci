Office of Governor Tom Wolf Statement on Stopgap Budget
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Dec. 21, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

The Office of Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement:
"A stopgap budget does not solve Pennsylvania's problems, and if the legislature sends a stopgap to Governor Wolf, he will veto the entire bill. A stopgap budget does not change the status quo that Harrisburg has accepted for too long. It does not restore funding to our schools, and it does not begin to fix our deficit. The governor reached a five-party agreement on a full-year budget that makes historic investments in our schools, and everyone needs to get back to work to get this done now."
