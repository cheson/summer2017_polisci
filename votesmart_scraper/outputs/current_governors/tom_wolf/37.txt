Governor Tom Wolf today announced seven new project approvals through the Commonwealth Financing Authority (CFA), totaling more than $20.7 million in funding to support business growth in Pennsylvania that will lead to the creation and retention of more than 1,145 jobs.
"Projects like those approved today not only propel business development efforts across the state, but they also enhance the quality of life of Pennsylvanians, all while creating and retaining jobs," said Governor Wolf. "Specifically, through our new Pipeline Investment Program, we are finally able to provide access to low-cost, clean-burning natural gas to unserved areas in Susquehanna County, saving families and businesses thousands each year and giving the area an advantage when attracting new business. Today's approvals are a win for these regions -- and a win for the commonwealth."
