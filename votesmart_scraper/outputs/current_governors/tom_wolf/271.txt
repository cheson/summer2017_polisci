Wolf Administration Investing $25.1 Million in Projects to Protect and Improve Pennsylvania Water Resources
Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: May 18, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf announced today the selection of 114 projects to receive $25,143,294 in funding from Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), for the protection of Pennsylvania's water resources. The selected projects enhance watersheds, mitigate acid mine drainage, and support water pollution cleanup programs.
"The Growing Greener program, and this year's funding, is an investment in our future and proof that when state government works collaboratively, we achieve long-lasting results," said Governor Wolf. "The Environmental Stewardship Fund has helped spark innovation and coordinate partnerships to tackle some of the most challenging environmental issues in our state."
The 114 selected projects range from a wetland basin restoration in Chester County to sustainable outreach programs in Erie County. Projects focus on both statewide initiatives, like improving the health of the Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay, and local projects, such as riparian buffer enhancement and erosion prevention in Four Mile Run, Westmoreland County. Every project supports DEP's mission of protecting Pennsylvania's waters.
"DEP is proud to support local and regional water quality projects throughout the state," said Secretary John Quigley. "These investments are essential to protecting and conserving the rivers, streams, and watersheds of Pennsylvania."
The grant awards are made possible by the Growing Greener Grant Program, the largest single investment of state funds that address Pennsylvania's environmental concerns. Growing Greener encourages partnerships between counties, municipalities, county conservation districts, watershed organizations, and other organizations to restore and protect the environment.
The Growing Greener program is supported by the Environmental Stewardship Fund, which receives its funding from landfill tipping fees. Twelve projects this year received their funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 319 Nonpoint Source Grant Program, created by the Clean Water Act to reduce water pollution. Four projects received funding from the Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) Set Aside Program, funded by the Surface Mining Conservation and Reclamation Act and designed to abate AMD pollution. Of the 208 grant applications received for consideration this year, more than half of the proposed projects were awarded grant funding.
