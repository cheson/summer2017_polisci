Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: May 3, 2017
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf responded to reports of the President's plans to sign a sweeping "religious liberty' executive order that could open the door to nationwide discrimination against LGBT Americans and women and released the following statement urging President Trump to not sign such an order:
"Freedom of religion is already protected under the Constitution and it is unconscionable to open the door for national discrimination of LGBT citizens and women under the guise of furthering what is already protected. If the President is even considering signing this executive order, I urge him to stop and focus on protecting all Americans, rather than further dividing the country.
