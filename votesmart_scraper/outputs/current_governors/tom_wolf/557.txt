Governor Wolf Talks Jobs, Workforce Development at Lehigh and Bucks County 'Jobs that Pay Tour' Stops
Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: April 17, 2015
Location: Bristol, PA

Today, Governor Tom Wolf discussed job creation and workforce development on his "Jobs that Pay" tour in Schnecksville at the Lehigh Carbon Community College Tech Center and the Advanced Manufacturing Training Center at Bucks County Community College in Bristol.
Governor Wolf's budget makes significant new investments in manufacturing, economic development and workforce training aimed at rebuilding Pennsylvania's middle class while reducing the corporate net income tax by 40 percent immediately. In addition, the 2015-2016 budget provides a $15 million increase to community colleges. This reinvestment restores 75 percent of the cuts made to community colleges' funding since 2011.
"When I ran a business, finding talented people with the right skills was my highest priority. It's what made us competitive in the marketplace," Governor Wolf said. "My budget proposal recognizes that our responsibility to provide a great education does not end with high school. Reinvesting in higher education and community colleges will help prepare people for jobs that pay. Rebuilding the middle class and creating a better future for all Pennsylvanians depends on a skilled workforce and a pro-job creation business climate."
In addition to increased funding for high school career and technical education programs and the reinstatement of the dual enrollment program, the Governor's budget proposal encourages school districts, employers and postsecondary institutions to work together to create a seamless bridge for students transitioning from high school to college or a career.
