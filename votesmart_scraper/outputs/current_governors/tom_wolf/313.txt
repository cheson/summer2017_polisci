The Office of Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement about the governor's plan to sign two non-discrimination executive orders:
"Governor Wolf tomorrow will sign two executive orders -- one pertaining to commonwealth employees and the other to the commonwealth grants and procurement process -- that each say no agency under the governor's jurisdiction shall discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, gender expression, and identity, among other areas. This is an important step in ensuring equality, but Pennsylvania must do more and the governor will also call on the legislature to finally pass non-discrimination legislation. What happened in North Carolina, and what is going on in other states, should be a call to pass non-discrimination legislation in Pennsylvania now. The governor wants to make clear that Pennsylvania is inclusive, welcoming, and open for business for everyone."
