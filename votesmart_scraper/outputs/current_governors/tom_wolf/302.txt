Blog: Celebrating One Year of Medicaid Expansion
Press Release

Since my first days in office, I vowed to transition Pennsylvania to a simple, traditional Medicaid expansion plan, in order to simplify a previously complicated process and ensure that hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians would have greater access to the health insurance they need.
Last April, we did just that by launching the expansion of Pennsylvania's Medicaid program known as HealthChoices. This expansion alleviated confusion, removed unnecessary red tape, and streamlined the system so that people can see a doctor when they are sick and healthcare professionals have more time to concentrate on providing quality care.
One year later, more than half a million Pennsylvanians who were not previously covered now have healthcare coverage. The commonwealth's uninsured rate has dropped more than six percentage points in the last three years, and state General Fund costs have been reduced by more than $500 million.
I am thrilled to see the success of this expansion in the one year since its announcement. Because of the expansion of Medicaid, hundreds of thousands of people have a brighter future and better potential health outcomes. We are excited to enroll even more Pennsylvanians in our next outreach efforts.
