VIDEO: #SchoolsThatTeach: "It's Just This Simple"
Statement

Over the last four years schools across Pennsylvania have suffered from $1 billion cuts that led to massive layoffs, huge property tax increases, and the elimination of valuable programs. The data also shows that as education classroom funding fell, so did student scores in reading and math.
"Since taking office, I have traveled our state visiting schools, talking with teachers and parents, and sitting with students in classrooms," said Governor Wolf. "I've seen dedicated teachers and committed students who simply do not have the resources they need. That's why my budget reprioritizes education in Pennsylvania and gives our kids the tools they need to learn and succeed in the 21st century. It's just this simple: our state is never going to get stronger as long as we make our schools weaker."
