Governor Wolf: CBO Score Confirms Fears of Bipartisan Governors
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: June 26, 2017
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement on the Congressional Budget Office score of the Senate Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act:
"The CBO score confirms the fears that I have shared with Republican and Democratic governors from across the country. Along with Republican Governors Kasich, Baker and Sandoval, I have asked the Senate to slow down and engage with governors on real solutions to improve health care delivery, lower costs and expand coverage."
"This bill will raise costs for Pennsylvanians, including both higher premiums and higher deductibles, who wish to maintain the same level of coverage now. Those over 50 would now be charged an age tax of five times more just for the same coverage. Even Pennsylvanians with employer coverage could lose coverage and protections for essential health services, pre-existing conditions and the ban on lifetime or annual limits will be at risk. Patient advocates like AARP and the American Medical Association, and now the CBO, have confirmed that this will be our new, unfortunate reality."
"This bill is simply not solving any of the problems that bipartisan governors know exist in our health care system. It is time for Washington to start a process that's bipartisan, open and fixes the problems in our health care system."
