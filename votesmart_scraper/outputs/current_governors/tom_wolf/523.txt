Governor Tom Wolf today announced that 92 percent of Pennsylvania school districts across the commonwealth submitted funding impact plans to the state Department of Education, outlining how the $400 million basic education funding increase proposed in his 2015-2016 budget will be invested directly in classrooms. The governor's budget provides a $1 billion investment in education at all levels through a severance tax on natural gas.
"I have traveled across Pennsylvania and listened to educators and administrators detail their plans to ensure additional education funding is invested in the classroom to benefit our children," said Governor Wolf. "Through a commonsense severance tax on natural gas, my budget invests $1 billion in education at all levels, including an additional $400 million in basic education funding. In turn, my administration asked school districts to submit plans that are tied to proven strategies for learning and will enable districts to maintain full-day kindergarten, bring back valuable programs, reduce class sizes, and hire back educators."
