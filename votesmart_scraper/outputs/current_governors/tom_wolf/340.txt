Governor Wolf released the following statement regarding House Majority Leader Dave Reed's decision to hold a vote on legislation that would legalize medical marijuana in Pennsylvania:
"I want to thank Majority Leader Dave Reed for addressing medical marijuana in the House of Representatives so we can finally provide much needed relief to families and children. As I have said for years, I support the legalization of medical marijuana and I believe it is long past time to provide this important medical relief to patients and families across the commonwealth. I have met with patients and families, held roundtables, and urged action on this legislation since taking office. Additionally, my administration pushed forward with a program to expand research into the use of Cannabidiol for the treatment of children with intractable seizures. It is time to legalize medical marijuana because we should not deny doctor-recommended treatment that could help people suffering from seizures or cancer patients affected by chemotherapy. I urge quick action by the legislature to legalize medical marijuana."
