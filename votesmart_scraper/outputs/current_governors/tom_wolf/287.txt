Remarks by Governor Wolf at Franklin & Marshall College Commencement

Location: Lancaster, PA

I am pleased to be here with you today
As a result of this grand ceremony, I now join my wife in holding a degree from F & M
I am truly honored
I know you are honored too
And your families, friends, and professors who are with you here today
They are honoring you by their presence
This is after all a magnificent college with a long and glorious heritage
And you have accomplished a great thing by earning your degree here
The question for you is: "Now what?"
What comes next for you?
I know this is probably the most over-asked question in commencement addresses
On the other hand you have to admit there is a clear timeliness to the question
I mean you're at a real pause in your life
I know that many of you have already launched on a life path
Still, it's the perfect time to ask:
What do I want to do?
How do I want to live my life?
When I'm old what will I want to say I've accomplished in my life?
Believe me you'll have a lot less time to reflect on such things once you become immersed in the minutiae that will so quickly come to dominate your lives
So now is the perfect time to think these broad thoughts and ask these broad questions
One of the broad things I want you to think about is our democracy
It really needs your attention
It needs it because that's the way self-government works
It thrives only when it gets the attention of the people it serves
It needs the attention of good people like you
Curious seekers
Thoughtful dreamers
Practical doers
It needs the attention of people who categorically reject the notion that our democracy is beyond our control
It needs the attention of people dedicated to the task of building and sustaining a political system worthy of the trust of the people it serves
And it needs this attention now
The problem is that too many people simply don't trust their government
They despair of it; they suspect they can't make it work
And so they avoid it
This is a problem
Democracies can survive neither the indifference nor the scorn of its citizens
They are founded on the consent of the governed
It is we who create and sustain our system of government
And we must have confidence in that system we create and sustain
So, if we say we don't trust our government
We are pretty much saying we don't trust ourselves
And that's exactly what too many of us are saying just now
For example, the National Election Study has been taking the political pulse of Americans since 1958
It shows a steadily declining trust in our government
It has been asking respondents things like:
Do you think you can trust your government in Washington to do what is right?
Does the Federal Government "care much about what people like me think?"
Is the Federal Government "pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves?"
Up until the early 1970's a majority of respondents said they believed they could in fact trust the government to do the right thing
Since then, not so much
Except for a brief blip around 9/11, trust has consistently been at a steep discount
A number of Rasmussen polls taken recently show much the same thing
In 2014, 63% of a sampling of Americans said they believed that most representatives in the US Congress "were willing to sell their votes for either cash or campaign contributions"
And 59% believed their representatives had already done this
And look at voter turnout at election time
Most people are so disaffected that they don't even exercise the most basic act of citizenship -- voting
As Robert Reich observes in his most recent book, the largest political party in the United States is not the Republican or Democratic Party
It's the party of those who don't vote
For example, turnout of eligible -- not registered -- voters in the 2014 mid-term election was only 33.2% nationally
This was the lowest turnout in a mid-term election in the United States since 1942 -- during World War II
Anyway, you get the point, Americans are frustrated
And this frustration can show itself in destructive ways
The late V O Key -- an eminent political scientist of my era -- suggested that throughout much of the post-Civil War era, Southern politics displayed a peculiar dysfunction
Low voter turnout
A political process that kept the lid on most of the time
But that every once in a while boiled over with some really weird results
Another political scientist, Walter Dean Burnham suggests that by the 1970's, American politics was beginning to look a lot like Key's Southern politics
Burnham even compared the emerging pattern of American politics to that of Weimar Germany in the 1920's and 1930's
And you know who came out of that period of political alienation and turmoil
So, back to the question, "What are you going to do about all this?"
Remember, a democracy is about self-rule
We're in charge
And given my age this is less and less my generation's problem
And more and more yours
As I see it, you have only two options
On the one hand you can conclude that there's really nothing you can do so "let's just forget about it"
Shrug your shoulders
Do your own thing
Live in the moment
Whatever
Or you can conclude that you really ought to do something to make our -- your -- democracy better
I'd suggest the latter
But you have to decide for yourselves
You do have a choice
The first choice is a seductive one
It is truly tempting to throw up your hands and proclaim, "It's not my job"
I'm reminded of a scene in the movie "Animal House" -- and I really hate to make such a low-brow allusion to such an exulted group
In that film, the Delta House members have just been expelled by the harried and frustrated Dean Wormer
One of the characters looks at his colleagues and suggests, "This is a time that calls for an entirely futile gesture on someone's part, and we're just the guys to do it"
I also remember when I was a first year student at Dartmouth and I voted along with a majority of my peers to abolish student government
"That'll show "em," we thought
After we won -- by electing Mickey Mouse, I believe -- we congratulated ourselves on what we had done
For about 15 minutes
Then we looked at each other and asked, "Now what?"
A futile gesture indeed!
In any case, a futile gesture is a real option for you
And you could possibly justify to yourselves this course
After all, things really are screwed up
And it's not your fault
But then what?
Your futile gesture certainly makes a vivid point
But it is also a clear abdication of the responsibility thrust upon every citizen in a democratic system to do just the opposite
Non-involvement doesn't really solve any problem
It simply passes on the responsibility for solving the problem to someone else
Someone whose policy preferences you might not like
Someone who won't deliver the real improvements we need
So, I would ask, encourage and beg you to take the alternative course of action
Do what too few of us do today
Reject the easy pessimism
Drop the cool cynicism
Get involved and make our government better
This course is hard and success is not inevitable
As President Obama said in a recent speech in Great Britain, "It will require struggle, discipline and above all faith in making a difference"
But if you do not take up this particular challenge
Your government will not get better
Nor will the policies that government promotes
Nor will the people who make those policies
Nor will our world
Nor will your lives
If you don't get involved, you will prove those kings and queens of 18th century Europe right
They're the ones who scoffed at our ancestors for suggesting that ordinary human beings could govern themselves
By abdicating your responsibility as a citizen, you're essentially affirming their noxious prophesies
You're turning our system over to people who will not make self-government work
So this is your challenge; this is your chance
Keep in mind, I'm not asking that you embrace my policy preferences
This is not about the design of public policies
This is about the design of the system within which those policy preferences are:
Expressed
Debated
Chosen
Or implemented
This is about the way our democracy works
Not the decisions it makes
The assumption is, however, that better public policies will come out of a political system that is open, transparent, representative and responsive
Than from one that is none of these things
And the only way that system will be open, transparent, representative, and responsive is if its citizens make it so
OK I know I've just presented you with a very depressing prospect
I've basically told you it's your turn to try to turn a dysfunctional democracy into a functional one
It will not be an easy task
In some ways, it might even be a thankless and painful task
Also you probably have better things to do
But you would be wrong
This is a great chance to do something spectacular something important
It's actually an exciting time to be alive and engaged
Just think of the times that were most interesting in American history
The people we remember -- the Franklins and Marshalls and the Washingtons, Lincolns, Tubmans, Roosevelts, and Anthonys -- were active at times precisely like these
Those times were messy, challenging and full of friction, turmoil and angst
Just like ours
The people we respect were those who lived and struggled in those interesting times
Who got involved
Who were controversial
And who ultimately made a difference
They built and rebuilt our nation
You can do no less
We needed them then
We need you now
Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about
First, vote!
This is the fundamental obligation of a citizen in a truly democratic system
Such a system can be neither truly democratic nor legitimate if it speaks for a mere minority of its constituents
And it will only include you in its activities if you vote
Second, choose wisely when you vote
Vote for good people
Or better yet, run for public office yourself
Insist on candidates who are honest, trustworthy, smart and competent
Look for people who will serve as able stewards of our noble tradition of self-government
Reject people who you know are simply trying to tempt you with tantalizing illusions
And patronizing happy talk
Third, care about the traditions that sustain and protect our democratic process
Interact with people of different political beliefs
Avoid certainty; but hold onto your beliefs
On the other hand, be willing to consider alternative points of view
Sharpen your own ideas by testing them against those of others
And use the logic you honed here at F&M to do this
Finally, get involved with enthusiasm
Take pride in improving the system that is yours to improve
Find real joy in doing what our founders asked us to do
Make our union more perfect
These are the kinds of things an engaged citizenry must do to make sure our government works as we need it to work
These are the kinds of things people like you must do
If our government becomes as good as it should be
It will be to your everlasting credit
So here's the deal
I would love to stand here and tell you that my generation is passing a perfect world -- including a perfect democracy -- onto you
But we all know that simply isn't true
The world you are about to inherit has its obvious challenges
Things could clearly be better
Including our democratic system of government
And whether or not they become better is up to you
What I would like is for one of you to stand here where I standing -- say 30 years from now
And I'd like you to be able to look at those smart Franklin and Marshall's graduates who are sitting where you sit now
And tell them that you gave your all to improving the government you're handing off to them
That you took a flawed system and made it better
That you made a difference
You have the ability to do this
Thanks to Franklin and Marshall, you have the tools
And thanks to your impeccable timing, you have the chance
Congratulations on getting to this brilliant point in your lives
Be good to the institutions that matter
Remember your friends, teachers and families
Remember this glorious institution that has left such an imprint on your lives
And remember our democracy
Dedicate your brilliant lives to enriching them all
Congratulations and good luck with the tough, important, and yet satisfying tasks that lie ahead for you
