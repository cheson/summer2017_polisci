Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement on the passing of legendary football player and former State Athletic Commission Chairman Chuck Bednarik:
"Frances and I are deeply saddened by the passing of Chuck Bednarik. In addition to his storied career in the National Football League as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles, Chuck was truly a 'hall-of-famer' as a long-time member and the chairman of the State Athletic Commission. During his tenure, SAC dramatically changed many of its safety regulations to ensure competitive and safe match-ups in all sports, among many other accomplishments. We are grateful for Chuck's service to the Commonwealth and our country in World War II. Our thoughts are with his family, friends and fans."
