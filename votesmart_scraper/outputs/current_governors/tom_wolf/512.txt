Press Release

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf signed a bill into law today that would generate additional needed revenue to support local and regional 9-1-1 systems. The Governor also signed a separate bill that would enhance eligibility for military personnel and their families to attend state-related and state-owned institutions of higher learning and community colleges.
"Local governments have struggled to maintain adequate funding for 9-1-1 systems for far too long," Governor Wolf said. "I commend the General Assembly for passing a bill that will bolster these institutions that are vital to maintaining public safety in our communities."
Act 11 -- HB 131, introduced by Representative Stephen Barrar, amends the act of December 15, 1982, entitled, as amended, "an act conferring limited residency status on military personnel, their dependents and civilian personnel assigned to an active duty station in Pennsylvania," further provides for attendance at State-related and State-owned institutions of higher learning and community colleges; and provides for applicability and eligibility.
"The pursuit of higher education for military members and their families is vitally important," Governor Wolf said. "This legislation will make Pennsylvania more welcoming to those serving in our state and provide an important resource at the lower rate for our military families."
Act 12 -- HB 911, introduced by Representative Stephen Barrar, amends Title 35 (Health & Safety) to further provide for emergency telephone service and that establishes the 911 Fund.
