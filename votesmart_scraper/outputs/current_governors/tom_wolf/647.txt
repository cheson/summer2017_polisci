Tom Wolf last night delivered remarks at the Pennsylvania Environmental Council's Annual Environmental Partnership Dinner, where he urged Governor Corbett and lawmakers in Harrisburg to pass a 5 percent severance tax to fund our schools and take care of our environment.
Governor Corbett continued his refusal to support a severance tax yesterday, despite support from Republicans and Democrats along with a majority of Pennsylvanians. Corbett told WPVI-TV in Philadelphia that the oil and gas companies are paying their fair share.
