Remarks by Governor Wolf at Historic Liquor Reform Bill Signing
By: Tom Wolf
Date: June 8, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Today I am following through on a promise I made during my campaign to modernize our wine and spirits system
This bill is truly historic
It is the most significant step we've taken in this area in 80 years
This bill will improve the customer experience
It will make pricing more competitive
It will make the purchase of these products more convenient
It will produce more revenue for the commonwealth of Pennsylvania
And it shows that we can do things here in Harrisburg that matter to our fellow citizens
This bill also shows -- once again -- that Democrats and Republicans can work together
Today, we are changing a system that many people in Pennsylvania have wanted to change for a long time
And it has come about because members of both parties have cooperated with each other
I promised to modernize our state store system when I ran for governor
This bill delivers on that promise
Six packs of beer will now be sold in convenience stores as part of this law
Wine will be sold in supermarkets
I want to pay special tribute to a number of people
Speaker Mike Turzai
Representative Paul Costa
Sen. Chuck McIlhinney
Leader Dave Reed
Leader Frank Dermody
Chairman Bill Adolph
Chairman Jor Markosic
The citizens of Pennsylvania have called for change in the way our system works
This bill responds to that call
I am pleased to join with my colleagues here to sign it into law
And I have every confidence that the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board -- and especially its board members -- are deeply committed to making this work
