Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today joined Secretary of Education Pedro A. Rivera, Secretary of Health Dr. Karen Murphy and Secretary of the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs Gary Tennis to announce support for the use of the life-saving drug antidote naloxone at schools across the commonwealth. Naloxone is administered to individuals suffering from an opioid overdose, such as heroin, and reverses the effects of the ingested drug.
"Across the country and in Pennsylvania, the rate of deadly heroin and prescription opioids overdoses is unprecedented," Governor Wolf said. "In light of this tragic fact, we would encourage any person or entity in a position to help individuals who are vulnerable to an overdose to obtain naloxone."
