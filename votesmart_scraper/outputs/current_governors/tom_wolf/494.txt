Press Release

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today applauded PennVEST (Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority) for its enactment of a gift ban. The board's vote at its most recent meeting yesterday was unanimous.
"I am committed to making government work so we can restore the public's trust and make sure we are being open and transparent," said Governor Wolf. "That is why I signed executive orders banning gifts for all employees of the executive branch and reforming the way the commonwealth contracts with outside legal firms.
"I commend the PennVEST board's action in following my lead to ban gifts. This is an important step."
In February, Governor Wolf urged independent state agencies to ban gifts. PennVEST joins major independent agencies, including the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, in banning gifts.
