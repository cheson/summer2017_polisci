Today, Governor Tom Wolf and Jay Wright, head coach of the NCAA National Championship Villanova team, held an "It's On Us PA" press conference to discuss the importance of combatting sexual assault on college campuses. "It's On Us PA" is a statewide campaign that invites everyone to play a role in ending sexual assault. Pennsylvania was the first state in the nation to launch an "It's On Us" campaign.
"As we all know, a man in a high-profile assault case at Stanford University was recently found guilty of rape but received as his sentence only six months in county jail with probation. Meanwhile, his victim will have to live the rest of her life with the feeling of violation and danger that he caused," said Governor Wolf. "These kinds of leniencies send a message to the community that we are not serious about preventing sexual assault. These kinds of leniencies are unacceptable. "It's On Us PA' is delivering that message across the commonwealth."
