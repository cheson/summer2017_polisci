Date: Nov. 9, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

The Pennsylvania Commission for Women today joined the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape (PCAR) and Pennsylvania's State System of Higher Education to host a screening of the documentary The Hunting Ground, followed by a panel discussion focused on sexual assault on college campuses. The event, which took place at the Governor's Residence, was held in conjunction with the It's On Us campaign's 2015 National Week of Action.
"Pennsylvania is home to some of the best colleges and universities in the country, and we must ensure that our students are not only being academically enriched but also cared for and protected emotionally and physically as well," said Governor Tom Wolf. "It is a priority for my administration to ensure that sexual assault on our campuses is not tolerated and that our schools are promoting the best possible academic and social environment for our students. Today's event was an important step toward that goal and we will continue this discussion with key stakeholders throughout the commonwealth to ensure that this issue is being addressed and that our students' safety is protected."
