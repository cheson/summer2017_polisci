"The Senate seems bent on pushing through the most radical and unconstitutional bill to prohibit a woman from exercising her own right to make decisions regarding her own health.
"It's unconstitutional. Senate Bill 3 is moving forward without even a hearing, and I will veto if it gets to my desk.
"Over the last two weeks, millions of women have marched all across the country to make it clear to politicians that they want to retain control and the freedom to make their own health care decisions. This flies in the face of that.
"It does one thing and that is -- it eliminates a woman's right to make choices as to her own health care.
"It's wrong, it's unconstitutional, it flies in the face of everything I stand for, and I will veto it."
