Tom Wolf will work to change Harrisburg by reforming campaign finance rules and instituting ethics reforms such as strict limits on gifts so that all residents and businesses have an equal access to state government - not just those with well-connected lobbyists.
Tom Wolf believes a true leader must lead by example, and that's why as Revenue Secretary, Tom turned down the perks, donated his salary to charity, and drove his own Jeep all across Pennsylvania to meet with more than 2,000 workers and learn about their jobs.
