Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: March 23, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Today, Governor Tom Wolf announced that he would let the Republican 2015-2016 budget become law. Although the budget cuts expenditures by another $238 million, and remains $290 million out of balance, in order to move forward and address a looming 2016-2017 deficit of $2 billion, Governor Wolf is allowing the budget to become law without his signature.
"I am going to allow the 2015-2016 budget to become law without my signature," said Governor Tom Wolf. "This will allow for funding to go out to schools and other services in the short term, but we still face enormous problems that this budget does not even pretend to address.
