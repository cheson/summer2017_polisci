Governor Tom Wolf today released the following statement regarding David Meckley's resignation as chief recovery officer of the York City School District:
"I am thankful to David Meckley for his service to the York City School District.
"The fact of the matter is that school districts across Pennsylvania are struggling as a result of misguided funding cuts that have starved our classrooms of resources and put our children at a disadvantage. The York City School District, which has been forced to the brink of financial collapse, is no different.
"My proposed budget makes historic investments in education and directs money straight to classrooms to equip students with the skills they need to compete in a modern economy. My budget would provide a $5.6 million increase in funding and more than $29 million in property tax relief for the York City School District. These investments will result in greater classroom resources and a tax cut for middle-class families and seniors.
"My budget also includes strong accountability measures and delivers on the promise of a high-quality public education for all Pennsylvanians. I look forward to working with elected officials and community leaders to move the York City School District forward."
