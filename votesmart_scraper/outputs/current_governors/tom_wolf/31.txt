Today, the Wolf Administration's Department of Human Services (DHS) announced that it has awarded approximately $5.6 million in onboarding grants to help connect inpatient hospitals/ facilities, outpatient practices/providers, and other eligible providers to the Pennsylvania Patient & Provider Network (P3N) or Public Health Gateway.
The P3N enables electronic health information exchange (eHIE) across the state through the connection of health care providers to health information organizations (HIO), and the connection of HIOs to the P3N. The P3N resides in DHS' eHealth Partnership Program.
