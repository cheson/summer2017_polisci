Governor Wolf Statement on GE Transportation Announcement
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Nov. 6, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

"My office had been in contact with GE Transportation and is currently working with the Department of Community and Economic Development Secretary Dennis Davin and the Governor's Action Team, and the Department of Labor & Industry Secretary Kathy Manderino on a plan to address potential negative economic impacts for the Erie region and to provide assistance to the workers affected by today's announcement.
"Labor & Industry's Rapid Response Coordination Services has initiated outreach to offer the potentially affected workers with the information and services they need to successfully return to the workforce. The Rapid Response unit provides workers who are facing a layoff with information on retraining, continuing education, job-seeking, health insurance and unemployment benefits to help them transition to re-employment.
"Labor & Industry will suggest and facilitate on-site job fairs, affected-employee meetings, and will work with GE to customize programs that best fit the needs of the affected employees. All services are offered at no cost to the employees or the company.
"My administration will work to identify new opportunities for the affected employees, or to determine a plan for them to return to their current positions as soon as economically feasible."
