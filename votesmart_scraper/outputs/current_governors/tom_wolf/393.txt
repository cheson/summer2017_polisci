Today, National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, is our opportunity to show support for all law enforcement officials who put their lives on the line and pledge to keep the Commonwealth safe. Yesterday's assault on Officer Jesse Hartnett in Philadelphia reminds us how important this moment is for us all to take.
The health and safety of all Pennsylvanians is important to the well-being and prosperity of our Commonwealth's families and communities.
Many have offered the ultimate sacrifice, and, for this, we are all grateful. Last year, five law enforcement officers in Pennsylvania died in the line of duty, including St. Clair Township Police Officer Lloyd E. Reed, Jr., Scranton Patrolman John James Wilding, Ligonier Township Lieutenant Eric Alan Eslary, Allegheny County Detective Paul John Koropal and Philadelphia Police Sergeant Robert Francis Wilson, III. The sacrifice of these officers and their families shall never be forgotten.
Great sacrifices are made on a daily basis by officers and those who support them, along with their families, while protecting the lives of our citizens and ensuring the safety of our communities.
I want to thank the 4,400 officers in the Pennsylvania State Police and all of our nearly 23,000 municipal officers. These men and women continue to uphold the "Thin Blue Line" as they serve our Commonwealth, whether that be through education, community outreach, or public safety.
