Governor Wolf announced today that the Commonwealth Financing Authority approved the allocation of more than $10.76 million in gaming funds to support community improvement, economic development and public interest projects in Monroe, Carbon, Lackawanna, Northampton, Pike and Wayne Counties.
"The projects approved by the CFA will directly impact the citizens of Monroe County and the surrounding area," said Governor Wolf. "Investments that support community improvement and economic development help build a stronger workforce, and spur job creation."
A total of 13 projects in Monroe County were awarded funds that originated from the Local Share Account (LSA), which included $731,660 to support community improvement, $1.05 million to support economic development and $2.5 million to support public interest projects.
In addition, 55 projects in Carbon, Lackawanna, Northampton, Pike and Wayne Counties were awarded funds from the LSA, which included $2.99 million to support community improvement, $800,331 million to support economic development and $2.68 million to support public interest projects.
The PA Race Horse Development and Gaming Act established the Pennsylvania Gaming Local Share Account under the CFA for the purpose of distributing funds to support economic development, community improvement and public interest projects.
Under state law, licensed gaming facilities are assessed a fee to support and enhance their host communities and mitigate the impact of gaming. Funds in the account are generated by licensed gaming facilities operating in the state.
