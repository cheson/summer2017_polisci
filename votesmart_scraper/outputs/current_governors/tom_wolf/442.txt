Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Nov. 5, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf signed House Bill 874, sponsored by Representative Ron Marisco (R-Dauphin), into law. The legislation, now Act 59 of 2015, removes exceptions to the offenses of stalking, harassment and threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction from those involved in labor disputes.
"I believe it is important to allow men and women to come together and have their voices heard," Governor Wolf. "I also believe that any form of harassment by employees or employers is unacceptable."
