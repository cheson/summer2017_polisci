Governor Tom Wolf announced today that Oak Hill Veneer, Inc., a manufacturer of spliced hardwood veneer, will expand its operations in Troy, Bradford County. The expansion will create 73 new, full-time jobs.
"Manufacturing has a $79 billion economic impact in Pennsylvania, and is vital to the growth of the middle class," Governor Wolf said. "Manufacturers like Oak Hill Veneer, Inc. are creating good jobs in the commonwealth, and my budget supports manufacturers by increasing funding to programs like the Made In PA job creation tax credit, workforce development, and industry partnerships. In order to continue to thrive, we must highlight the sector that so much of our state's history is based on."
