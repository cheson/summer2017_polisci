Governor Wolf Signs Bill Protecting Victims of Rape into Law
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Oct. 1, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today signed Senate Bill 663, sponsored by Senator Randy Vulakovich, into law, which would enhance protections for victims of rape. Wolf also signed Senate Bill 678.
Senate Bill 663, now Act 40, amends Title 23 (Domestic Relations) to allow a court to terminate the parental rights of a convicted rapist, thereby eliminating the abuser's access to full, partial, or supervised custody of a child conceived by rape. The bill does maintain the offender's obligation to pay child support even if parental rights are terminated.
"This is an important fix to what was clearly an imperfect law and we can now ensure victims that their children are not punished economically because of a parent's crime or placed in a potentially unsafe environment," Governor Wolf said. "I applaud Sen. Vulakovich and bi-partisan colleagues in both houses for their efforts to get this done."
