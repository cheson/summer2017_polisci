Location: Philadelphia, PA

Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement on the contract agreement reached between the State System and APSCUF:
"Throughout this process, and during my conversations with both sides, the students and families were my focus. Coming to a final agreement was challenging, and it took a lot of effort from everyone involved, but I appreciate PASSHE and APSCUF coming together to reach a final agreement on a contract that is fair for professors and university faculty and the State System.
"We all agree that the higher education of our students is a top priority, and I am thrilled that today students can go back to class and professors can teach them.
"I will continue my fight for greater investment in higher education and affordability for Pennsylvania families. We must ensure that we all work together to strengthen the State System financially -- after years of underfunding -- while providing our professors and students with the resources necessary to train a future workforce to compete in the modern economy."
