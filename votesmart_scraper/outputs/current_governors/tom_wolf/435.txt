Governor Wolf Names New Members to the Governor's Advisory Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Nov. 18, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today announced the appointment of thirty dedicated business, civic and community leaders to serve on the Governor's Advisory Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs. The commissioners were sworn in by Secretary of State Pedro Cort√©s prior to convening the first meeting of the Commission, which was held at The Governor's Residence.
"In Pennsylvania today, our Asian American and Pacific Islander population represent one of the fastest growing racial groups in our Commonwealth. This population is a community of contrasts because overall as a racial group they contribute significantly to the economy through job creation, business ownership, and consumer spending." Governor Wolf said. "Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders continue to face challenges to language access, diverse educational needs, they are disproportionately impacted by disease and many are uninsured, and there are increasing numbers of unemployment and those living below the poverty line. These are just a few of the issues that I hope this Commission will look at improving over the course of their service.
"I know that this passionate group of leaders and professionals will act as tireless advocates on behalf of Pennsylvania's diverse Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Each of these individuals will be a tremendous asset to the Commission, and people across the Commonwealth will be well-served by their commitment to improving the lives of our Asian American and Pacific Islanders.
