Governor Wolf Signs Bill Strengthening Child-safety Seat Protections
Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: June 13, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today signed three pieces of legislation into law, including Senate Bill 1152, now Act 43, sponsored by Senator Pat Browne, which requires a child under 2 years of age be securely fastened in a rear-facing child passenger restraint system, which is to be used until the child outgrows the maximum weight and limits designated by the manufacturer. Currently, the law does not require small children to be rear-facing in the passenger restraint system.
"We have no greater responsibility as public servants than protecting our most vulnerable, including especially young children," Governor Wolf said. "I commend Senator Browne, Representative Schlossberg and their colleagues for their efforts to ensure children in vehicles are safer and more secure."
Governor Wolf also signed the following two bills into law:
Act 41 -- Senate Bill 590, sponsored by Sen. Tomlinson, clarifies current law so that State-owned universities and employees of State-owned universities have the authority to enter into economic development agreements.
Act 42 -- Senate Bill 847, sponsored by Sen. Aument, requires that the State Veterans' Commission also include a representative of the Korean War Veterans Association, Inc.
