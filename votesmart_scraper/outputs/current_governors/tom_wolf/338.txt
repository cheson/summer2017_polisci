Governor Wolf Statement on Federal EEOC Lawsuit against Pittsburgh-area Medical Facility for LGBT Discrimination
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: March 2, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf released the following statement on the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lawsuit alleging that a Pittsburgh-area medical center engaged in anti-gay discrimination:
"The allegations of discrimination in the federal complaint are disturbing, yet legal under current Pennsylvania law. These allegations illustrate the urgent need for non-discrimination protection legislation. For far too long, Pennsylvania has failed to protect all of our citizens from acts of discrimination in employment and housing. A recent report ranked our commonwealth among the lowest group of states for these protections, which is unacceptable and counter to our place in history. I urge the General Assembly to pass and send me the Pennsylvania Fairness Act to sign upon its return to Harrisburg later this month."
