As part of Governor Tom Wolf's historic commitment to public education, his administration today sent a letter to superintendents across the commonwealth detailing accountability measures to ensure the education funding proposed in his 2015-2016 budget is spent directly on students in the classroom to allow them to compete in a modern economy.
"Pennsylvania ranks near the bottom of the country in state investment in kindergarten through 12th grade education. We need to change that," Governor Wolf said. "My proposed budget makes historic investments in education at all levels and includes essential accountability measures to make sure these new resources are spent in classrooms."
Governor Wolf's plan proposes a $400 million increase in basic education funding, the largest in Pennsylvania history, as well as a $100 million increase in special education funding.
In the letter, Acting Secretary of Education Pedro Rivera called on districts to submit plans to ensure new investment reaches the classroom and to measure results for Pennsylvania's students.
"After years of deep classroom budget reductions, Governor Wolf's proposed budget holds the promise of reinvestment in our schools, our students and our future," said acting Secretary Pedro Rivera. "This plan puts us on a path to meet the State's responsibility for education funding while ensuring that State funds are used appropriately."
