Governor Tom Wolf today announced that Axalta Coating Systems, LLC, a global developer and supplier of coatings and application tools, will establish a new research and development facility at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

On behalf of the governor, Labor & Industry Secretary Kathy Manderino joined Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and Axalta Chairman and CEO Charlie Shaver, as well as other state and local officials, to make the announcement.
"The Axalta project demonstrates positive momentum for Pennsylvania's ability to continue to attract new jobs," Governor Wolf said. "Axalta is showing a true commitment to our commonwealth by bringing nearly 200 high-paying jobs here, along with the promise of future growth. This is exactly the type of investment in our future that I am confident will help our middle class thrive."
Axalta will relocate its existing research and development operations to the Philadelphia Navy Yard where it will construct a new 175,000-square-foot facility. The company has committed to the creation of 190 new, full-time jobs and the retention of 372 current positions upon completion of the new site.
Axalta received a funding proposal from the Department of Community and Economic Development that includes a $400,000 Pennsylvania First Program grant.
