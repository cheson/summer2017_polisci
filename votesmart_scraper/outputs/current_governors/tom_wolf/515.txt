Governor Tom Wolf today released the following statement in response to the Supreme Court's ruling in King v. Burwell:
"I am extremely pleased with the Supreme Court's ruling in King v. Burwell. As a result of this decision, roughly 382,000 Pennsylvanians will keep their much-needed assistance to help them afford health care.
"I took steps to protect Pennsylvania's consumers by putting in place a contingency in the event the Supreme Court ruled people are not eligible for subsidies, but I am pleased to say that we will no longer need to rely on this plan.
"My administration will be notifying the federal government that we will be withdrawing our plan to set up a state based health insurance marketplace in Pennsylvania."
