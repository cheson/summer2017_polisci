In appreciation of the important work that state employees perform for Pennsylvania and its residents, Governor Tom Wolf proclaimed today, May 6, as "State Employee Recognition Day.'
"State employees deserve the utmost appreciation and admiration for the great work that they do every day to deliver important and vital services to their fellow citizens," Governor Wolf said. "Serving as revenue secretary and now governor, I know that state employees are some of the hardest working Pennsylvanians across our commonwealth. Because of that, I know that we can achieve great things together and create a government that works for everyone."
"As governor, it is my honor to support and work alongside tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians who have chosen careers in public service."
In his proclamation, Wolf gives examples of the many duties state employees fulfill, such as protecting public safety and health, caring for the less fortunate, maintaining safe roads, enforcing laws, safeguarding the environment, licensing professionals and businesses, preserving our historical, natural and cultural resources.
The governor also lauded state employees for their generosity through the annual State Employee Combined Appeal (SECA), which raises approximately $3 million for charitable organizations each year.
"State employees are the key to having government that works," said Wolf. "Through our GO-TIME initiative, we want to engage state employees at all levels in our efforts to do things better and more efficiently across government."
