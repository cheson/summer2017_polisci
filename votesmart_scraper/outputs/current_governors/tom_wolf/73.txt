Today, Governor Tom Wolf announced plans for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) to invest more than $2 billion in roadway maintenance and highway and bridge capital projects over the next 10 years through its new Road Maintenance and Preservation (Road MaP) program.
"We've made significant progress on our roadway and bridge needs and the Road MaP program will amplify our efforts statewide," said Governor Wolf. "We're bringing an even bigger focus to our interstates and to the lower-volume roads where many Pennsylvanians live and work."
