Governor Wolf Names New Members to the Pennsylvania Commission for Women
Statement
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Oct. 7, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today announced the appointment of twenty-six dedicated business, civic and community leaders to serve on the Pennsylvania Commission for Women. The commissioners were sworn in by Secretary of State Pedro Cort√©s prior to convening the first meeting of the Commission, which was held at The Governor's Residence.
"In Pennsylvania today, women earn just 76 cents for every dollar a man earns, they make up 75 percent of our minimum wage workforce, and they are two times less likely to work in STEM occupations than men in the Commonwealth," Governor Wolf said. "These are just a few of the issues that I hope this Commission will look at improving over the course of their work.
"I know that this passionate group of leaders and professionals will act as tireless advocates on behalf of Pennsylvania's women and girls. Each of these individuals will be a tremendous asset to the Commission, and people across the Commonwealth will be well-served by their commitment to improving the lives of our women and girls."
