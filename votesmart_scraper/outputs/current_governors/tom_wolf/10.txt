Governor Wolf Statement on Opioids and Health Care Cuts
Statement

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today released the following statement on Senators Bob Casey and Joe Manchin's focus today on how the Republican approach to cutting health care would worsen the opioid and heroin crisis:
"I want to thank Senators Casey and Manchin for raising awareness on the urgent need for the Washington Republicans to reverse their current course on health care cuts. Slashing Medicaid and rolling back consumer protections for pre-existing conditions would hinder people from seeking substance use treatment and may mean people losing access in the midst of their treatment. I have travelled Pennsylvania and spoken with people in recovery, parents, law enforcement and community advocates and they need more resources, not less. There is no doubt deep cuts to Medicaid and rolling back Medicaid expansion would mean less people in treatment, more overdoses and more pain for families and communities across Pennsylvania. I am proud of the work my administration has done to increase access to treatment and I will fight every day to keep hope alive for people in recovery and their families."
