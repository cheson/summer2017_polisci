Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today signed Senate Bill 290 into law, which makes the ignition interlock program mandatory for first-time DUI offenders with high blood alcohol levels.
"Drunk driving is a deadly crime that puts Pennsylvania families at risk and this legislation will help prevent people from driving drunk and endangering themselves and putting other lives at risk," Governor Wolf said. "We owe it to both motorists and pedestrians to keep them safe and hold people who break DUI laws accountable."
The following bills are now law:
Act 33 -- Senate Bill 290, sponsored by Sen. Rafferty, makes the ignition interlock program mandatory for first-time DUI offenders with high blood alcohol levels while at the same time reducing suspension requirements in certain cases.
Act 34 -- Senate Bill 1108, sponsored by Sen. Scavello, establishes a more appropriate definition under Title 75 for a new subtype of federally-certified motorcycle currently being registered under the general definition of a motorcycle. This legislation was the result of recommendations issued by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), an internationally respected group of motor vehicle administrators and law enforcement officials.
