Location: Harrisburg, PA

On Monday, Governor Wolf, joined by Lt. Governor Mike Stack, Secretary of Drug and Alcohol Programs Gary Tennis, and Physician General Dr. Levine, thanked police officers across the Commonwealth for reaching a milestone of 1,000 overdose reversals. The overdose reversal drug Naloxone was made available to law enforcement and emergency responders in April 2015. Fighting the current opioid abuse epidemic plaguing Pennsylvania is a top priority for the Wolf Administration.
"Our effort to make naloxone available to first responders is a key part of our strategy, and it is paying dividends in lives saved," said Governor Wolf. "I am proud of the work of my administration, and I am proud to stand here today with the people who have made this life-saving work happen, most especially our police officers."
In addition to the governor and members of his administration, the event was attended by police officers, representatives from the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency, Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association, and individuals in the recovery community.
