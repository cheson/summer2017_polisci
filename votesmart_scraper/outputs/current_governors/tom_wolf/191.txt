Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: July 20, 2016
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today announced that the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) approved his request to declare Fayette County a disaster area after severe storms and flooding caused significant damage to homes and businesses on June 17.
Citizens in Fayette County, as well as neighboring Pennsylvania counties Greene, Somerset, Washington and Westmoreland may be eligible for low-interest disaster loans through the SBA Disaster Loan Programs.
After the storms, staff from the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, along with local and SBA officials, conducted damage assessments within Fayette County. The governor used the damage assessment results to support his assistance request to the SBA.
Low-interest loans of up to $200,000 are available to homeowners to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate. SBA regulations permit loans up to $40,000 to repair or replace personal property. Businesses and nonprofits can borrow up to $2 million to restore damaged or destroyed buildings, inventory, equipment and assets. Loan amounts and terms are set by the SBA and are based on each applicant's financial qualifications.
