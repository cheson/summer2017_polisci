Governor Wolf Rejects Republican Plan to Cut Education; Releases Emergency Funding
Press Release
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Dec. 29, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Governor Tom Wolf today rejected the Republican budget that cuts $95 million from education and is out-of-balance, while directing emergency funding for key services. Last week, Republican leaders walked away from a historic bipartisan budget agreement and passed an irresponsible budget so they could return home to their districts and take holiday vacations.
"I'm vetoing the Republican plan to cut $95 million from education, and I'm also vetoing other items that they don't pay for," said Governor Wolf. "I'm calling on our legislators to get back to Harrisburg -- back to the work they left unfinished last week. At the same time, I'm allowing emergency funding for our schools to get out. I'm also letting funding go out to our human service agencies and to our counties. But this is on an emergency basis only."
"In doing this, I'm expressing the outrage that all of us should feel about the garbage the Republican legislative leaders have tried to dump on us. This budget is wrong for Pennsylvania. And our legislators -- the folks we elected to serve us -- need to own up to this. They need to do their jobs. This budget is wrong for so many reasons, but especially because it does not balance, increases our deficit and fails to invest in our schools and our future."
