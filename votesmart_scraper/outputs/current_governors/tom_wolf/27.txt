Location: Harrisburg, PA

Nine airports will make safety upgrades and expand operation opportunities with the assistance of $10 million in state investments, Governor Tom Wolf announced today.
"Maintaining and expanding opportunities in our transportation system includes the more than 400 airports in our state," Governor Wolf said. "Hundreds of thousands of jobs are supported by aviation in Pennsylvania and these investments will help them operate safely, expand to meet demands, or attract more growth."
The funds are administered by PennDOT's Bureau of Aviation through the Aviation Transportation Assistance Program, which is a capital budget grant program funded with bonds. The program complements the state Multimodal Fund, which dedicates $6 million to aviation in this fiscal year alone. The fund was created by Act 89, a far-reaching transportation funding program that clears the way for significant investments in all transportation modes.
Following is a by-county list of approved aviation projects under the programs with the state share:
Allegheny County: Allegheny County Airport -- $112,000 in state funding for a total project cost of $224,000 to rehabilitate an equipment storage building.
