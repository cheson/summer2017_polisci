Governor Wolf announced today the Commonwealth Financing Authority (CFA) approved the allocation of more than $12,772,180 in gaming funds to support 54 community and economic development projects in Luzerne County.
"The projects approved today through the CFA will provide a much needed impact to the citizens of Luzerne County," said Governor Wolf. "Investments that spur economic development through transforming blight and supporting community improvements help build stronger communities, and spur job creation."
A total of 54 projects in Luzerne County were awarded $12,772,180 by the Commonwealth Financing Authority from funds that originated from the Local Share Account (LSA).
The PA Race Horse Development and Gaming Act established the Pennsylvania Gaming Local Share Account under the CFA for the purpose of distributing funds to support public interest projects.
Under state law, licensed gaming facilities are assessed a fee to support and enhance their host communities and mitigate the impact of gaming. Funds in the account are generated by the licensed gaming facility Mohegan Sun.
