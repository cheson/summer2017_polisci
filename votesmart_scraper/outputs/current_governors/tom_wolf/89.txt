"It's just this simple: our state is never going to get stronger as long as we make our schools weaker."
-- Governor Tom Wolf
Over the past two years Governor Wolf has fought to increase funding for Pennsylvania schools by nearly $640 million while implementing a fair funding formula. This is a good start toward reversing the devastating $1 billion in cuts made to schools five years ago, but there is still work to do.
Governor Wolf has made clear his strong commitment to education in Pennsylvania by fighting to restore critical education funding cuts, provide unprecedented support to high-quality pre-k programs, and ensure students are college and career ready. He has fought for more education funding since day one and he has made investment in our schools and our children his top priority.
Working with the legislature, the governor has secured historic increases in his first two years:
*$415 million in basic education funding
*$60 million for early childhood education
*$50 million in special education funding
*$14.6 million for early intervention
*$81.4 million for PASSHE and state-related schools
*$16.4 million for Community Colleges
Additionally, on June 2, 2016, Governor Wolf signed House Bill 1552 into law, which established a fair funding formula and provided emergency funds for two of the commonwealth's financially distressed school districts. House Bill 1552, now Act 35, establishes a fair, equitable formula for allocating new state funds to Pennsylvania schools. The Basic Education Funding Formula accounts for district-based factors including the wealth of the district, the district's current tax effort, and the ability of the district to raise revenue.
Governor Wolf continues to advocate for increased funding for Pennsylvania schools to deliver high-quality education to every student across the state, regardless of zip code. We must make investments to adequately and fairly fund our education system in order to lay the foundation for long-term economic growth in Pennsylvania.
"Since taking office, I have traveled our state visiting schools, talking with teachers and parents, and sitting with students in classrooms," said Governor Wolf. "I've seen dedicated teachers and committed students who simply do not have the resources they need. That's why I have fought to increase school funding by nearly $640 million while implementing a fair funding formula."
