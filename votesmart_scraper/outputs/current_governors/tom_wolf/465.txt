Remarks by Governor Wolf at the World Meeting of Families, Visit of Pope Francis
By: Tom Wolf
Date: Sept. 26, 2015
Location: Harrisburg, PA

Welcome to Philadelphia, and welcome to Pennsylvania. I am very proud to welcome you all to this great Commonwealth. And I am especially grateful to the Holy Father for visiting this city and this state. By his visit -- and by his many actions as Pontiff -- he is reaffirming the noble values this place symbolizes
Behind me is Independence Hall. This was the home of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for many years. The Liberty Bell once rang out from its tower. The second Continental Congress met here. The Constitution of 1787 was drafted here. This is a place of freedom.
