Following Governor Corbett's press conference to announce his decision to advance funds to the Philadelphia School District and urge legislators to pass the cigarette tax, Tom Wolf released the following statement:
"After four years of underfunding our schools, Governor Corbett is playing political games while still avoiding the tough decisions. Governor Corbett's misguided policies have decimated schools across Pennsylvania, with few schools districts getting hit harder than Philadelphia. Now Pennsylvania needs new funding and real leadership, but Governor Corbett is simply failing to lead.
"The funding announced today is only an advance on money already owed; it is not a restoration of the funding Governor Corbett has taken from our schools, and it does nothing to close the Philadelphia School District's $81 million budget gap. Without new, sustainable funding, more than a thousand school district employees are at risk of losing their jobs, class sizes will increase, and children will return to schools that the superintendent has described as unsafe.
"Philadelphia schools should never have been placed in a position where they have to rely on cash advances and cigarette taxes, but Governor Corbett's complete mismanagement has forced the school district into turmoil.
"Unfortunately for Pennsylvanians, Governor Corbett's failed policies have not only affected Philadelphia; across the state we have seen increased property taxes, massive layoffs, larger class sizes, and the elimination of valuable programs. Pennsylvania's children, and our schools, cannot afford another four years of Governor Corbett's misplaced priorities."
