Location: Harrisburg, PA

The Wolf Administration, through the Department of Education (PDE) and Chester Upland School District (CUSD) Receiver Dr. Francis V. Barnes, submitted a revised amended financial recovery plan to the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas late this afternoon.
"My administration is committed to putting the Chester Upland School District on solid financial footing so parents and students no longer have to worry each year that the doors of the school may not open," said Governor Wolf. "The amended plan filed today represents an agreement reached with three brick-and-mortar charter schools that will enable the district to pay a reduced special education tuition rate to charter schools. This will help the district eliminate its structural budget deficit, and I want to thank Vahan Gureghian, the CEO of Chester Community Charter School, for his leadership on this matter, along with all of the charter schools who were a part of reaching this compromise."
