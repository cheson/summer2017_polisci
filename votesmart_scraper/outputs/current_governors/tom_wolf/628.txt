Today, the Tom Wolf for Governor campaign released a new television ad holding Tom Corbett accountable for his four years of failed leadership and highlighting Tom's plan to get Pennsylvania moving in the right direction. Under Governor Corbett, Pennsylvania has dropped from 9th to 47th in job creation and public schools have faced $1 billion cuts which have caused higher property taxes, massive teacher layoffs, and larger class sizes.
"Four years of Tom Corbett's mismanagement is enough," said Beth Melena, Wolf Campaign Spokesperson. "It's time for Pennsylvania to stop heading in the wrong direction. We need a governor with a vision for our state's future. Tom Wolf's plan to restore jobs and fund education will get Pennsylvania moving forward again."

TOM WOLF: "At the bottom in job creation. Massive cuts to education. And higher property taxes. Under Governor Corbett, Pennsylvania's been heading in the wrong direction. There's been no leadership and no vision. That's got to change. As your governor, I will lead. And we'll move Pennsylvania forward. We'll restore manufacturing jobs. Close corporate tax loopholes. And make the gas companies pay up to fund our schools. After all, it's time to get Pennsylvania moving again."
