Following several incidents involving racism and religious intolerance at Pennsylvania schools, the Wolf Administration developed a response plan that includes outreach from the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) Safe Schools office and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC).
When an incident occurs, the Wolf Administration has directed school districts and officials to contact the Office of Safe Schools, who can send counselors to the schools and work with the PHRC to determine if additional resources are needed. Pennsylvania State Police will continue to monitor threats and take action as appropriate in support of victims and other law enforcement agencies.
