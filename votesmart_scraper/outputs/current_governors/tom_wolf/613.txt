Governor Wolf Applauds Liquor Control Board's Enactment of Gift Ban
Statement

Location: Harrisburg, PA

Today, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (LCB) unanimously voted to revise its employee Code of Conduct to conform to Governor Tom Wolf's recently signed executive order banning gifts. The move comes on the heels of the same change made by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission earlier this week. Governor Wolf released the following statement:
"I am committed to making government work so we can restore the public's trust and make sure we are being open and transparent. That is why moments after I was sworn in, I signed an executive order banning gifts for all employees of the executive branch, and also why I required members of my staff and cabinet to undergo ethics and open records training on my first full day in office.

"I commend the Liquor Control Board's action following my lead to ban the acceptance of all gifts by its employees. Like the Turnpike Commission, the LCB has had its share of issues in the past. This is the latest step forward for toward restoring the public's trust and creating a government that works."
