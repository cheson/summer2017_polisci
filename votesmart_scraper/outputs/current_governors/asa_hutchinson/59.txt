Thank you, and I salute you as well. It is good to be back with you.
Mr. Lieutenant Governor, President Dismang, Speaker Gillam, Members of the General Assembly, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court--I see Cabinet Members here as well that are key parts of my administration.
This is an occasion that is meaningful to me, personally, but it is also significant for the state of Arkansas because we are gathered together as Arkansans, as people who are devoted to the public good. And so, those of you who are new here, congratulations. Those of you who are returning, congratulations--and I'll tell you, there are surprises in both categories.
I also see our constitutional officers that are here, and that makes this a particularly auspicious occasion to kick off the 91st Session of the General Assembly.
Another year is upon us, and the year 2017 brings historic opportunities for our state and the people we serve.
Speaking of history, 50 years ago today on January 10, 1967, Winthrop Rockefeller was inaugurated as the 37th Governor of Arkansas. In addressing the 67th General Assembly, he said this:
"It is true that you have been allotted an unusual moment in the history of Arkansas, as have I a moment subject to special scrutiny laden with special challenges and rich with special opportunities. I believe that together we can become worthy of the moment."
Today, ladies and gentleman, we have our own moment in history and we can only be worthy of this moment if we work together.
We, together, have been chosen by the people of Arkansas to govern and to lead in three, coequal branches of government--all represented here today. And we must govern and lead, not only with a spirit of cooperation, but within the context of our time--our time in history.
