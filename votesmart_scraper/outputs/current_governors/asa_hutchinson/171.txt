Location: Little Rock, AR

Today, Governor Asa Hutchinson directed the Department of Human Services to terminate its existing agreements with Planned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma. Termination will be effective thirty days from the date of the letter attached (see below).
Governor Hutchinson released the following statement:
"It is apparent that after the recent revelations on the actions of Planned Parenthood, that this organization does not represent the values of the people of our state and Arkansas is better served by terminating any and all existing contracts with them. This includes their affiliated organization, Planned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma.
"I appreciate the legislature's leadership on this important issue, especially that of Senator Eddie Joe Williams and Representative David Meeks."
