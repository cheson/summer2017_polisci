Asa Outlines Agenda To Support Arkansas Seniors
GOP Gubernatorial Candidate Emphasizes Importance of Aging With Dignity, Security and Independence
Mountain Home, Ark. - Asa Hutchinson, Arkansas' 2006 Republican candidate for Governor, today outlined his plans to expand lifestyle options for Arkansas seniors and to ensure that the senior population is well-served by state government.
"Arkansas continues to have one of the fastest growing populations of seniors in the nation, a trend that will only accelerate in the coming years as the Baby Boomers approach retirement age," Hutchinson said. "As Governor, I will work to ensure that Arkansas seniors have the opportunity to enjoy their senior years with dignity, security and independence."
Speaking at a community forum at the Van Matre Senior Center in Mountain Home, Hutchinson laid out the proposals for Arkansas seniors that he will implement as Governor, including designating an advisor on seniors' issues in the Governor's office and working to allow greater flexibility and independence to Arkansans in their senior years.
