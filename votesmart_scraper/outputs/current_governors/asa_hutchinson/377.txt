Gambling And Lotteries
Asa Hutchinson is opposed to expanded casino gambling and lotteries. He believes that neither is the right direction for Arkansas. "Many Arkansans have moral concerns about gambling and lotteries. But just as importantly, I believe that advocates of expanded gambling promise more for these initiatives than they can deliver, while downplaying or ignoring the problems that gambling causes for families and communities," Asa says.
However, Asa realizes that Arkansas voters will likely have an opportunity to vote on a lottery through a ballot initiative. He has stated that, should the voters approve a lottery, he would work as governor to ensure that the bulk of the proceeds go toward improving education in Arkansas.
