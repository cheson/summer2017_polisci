Gov. Hutchinson Issues Statement on Appellate Court Opinions on Executions
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: April 17, 2017
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson today issued a response to the decisions handed down by the Arkansas Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.
Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"Once again last minute court rulings have changed the course of justice. Today, the 8th Circuit ruled the state could proceed with the death penalty sentence and expressed no concern over the execution schedule and the legislatively mandated means to carry out the lethal injection protocol. However, the State Supreme Court went a different direction and ruled that the execution of Don Davis and Bruce Ward could not proceed based upon the potential of some future direction of the U.S. Supreme Court that is unknown at the present time.
"This decision was not unanimous and the dissenting opinions reflect the harm the delays cause the families of the victims and it also expresses my frustration in the continued delayed justice. We have asked the US Supreme Court to overrule the Arkansas Supreme Court and hope to get a decision later tonight."
