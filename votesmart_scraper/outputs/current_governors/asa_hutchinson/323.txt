Asa Endorsed by Arkansas Right to Life

Fort Smith, Ark. - Asa Hutchinson, the 2006 Republican candidate for Arkansas Governor, received the formal endorsement of Arkansas Right to Life Political Action Committee today in recognition of his longtime support for the pro-life cause and for being the candidate who will stand up to protect the lives of the unborn in Arkansas.
At a news conference at the Pregnancy Help Center in Fort Smith, Hutchinson said he was proud to have the support of Arkansas Right to Life and praised the organization and its leadership for their record of service to the pro-life community.
"Protecting the sanctity of human life is not a Republican value or a Democrat value; it's an Arkansas value," Hutchinson said. "It's important that the next Governor respect the views of Arkansans, and be firm in his commitment to defending life. I'm honored to accept the support of Right to Life, an organization that has spent decades fighting for the rights of the unborn."
Hutchinson, who received a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee based upon his pro-life voting record in Congress, contrasted his own pro-life record with that of his opponent, Democratic Attorney General Mike Beebe.
"My opponent and I have differed on many issues in this campaign, but this is one of the most important issues on which we disagree," said Hutchinson. "Mike Beebe believes that Roe v. Wade should stay on the books. I do not. There are clear differences between the candidates on this issue, and voters must decide whether they want a pro-life Governor or a pro-choice Governor leading this state forward. As Governor, I will continue the strong foundation laid by Gov. Huckabee to defend the lives of the most vulnerable among us."
