Governor Asa Hutchinson today released the following statement in response to the attack on Nice, France that left 84 dead and over 200 injured:
"Our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and families of the victims and all those affected by the yesterday's horrific attack in Nice. This cowardly act of terror, targeting crowds of innocent French people as the country gathered to celebrate their independence day, was a direct attack on the values and freedoms that both the French and Arkansans hold dear.
"I speak for all of Arkansas when I say that we stand in solidarity with France against hatred, violence, and terrorism. Our hearts go out to French people as they seek to heal from yesterday's horrendous attack."
Flags have been ordered to be flown at half-staff in remembrance of the victims of yesterday's attack. Flags will remain at half-staff until sunset, July 19, 2016.
