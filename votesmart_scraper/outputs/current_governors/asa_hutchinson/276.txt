Republican gubernatorial nominee Asa Hutchinson released a new television ad on Monday starring his granddaughter, Ella Beth. The new TV ad highlights Asa's plan to have all high schools across Arkansas offer computer science courses that include coding or software programming.
Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"This new ad is about creating opportunities for our kids. Students that learn computer coding learn to think logically and systematically about problems. The opportunities are almost endless for students that have these skills because the demand in the workplace is growing; and a boy or girl like my granddaughter Ella Beth can even use this knowledge to express their own ideas and create businesses. That's how we can create jobs in Arkansas, by growing entrepreneurs with skills in demand across the country.
If only 20% of our high school students learn computer science, we will be graduating almost 6,000 students per year that can do computer programing. This has the potential of changing the economic future of Arkansas and creating thousands of high paying jobs."
Script:
Asa: I'm Asa and that's my granddaughter, Ella Beth. Not only does she play basketball and is on the swim team, but she also taught herself basic computer programming. She even created an app you can download on your phone. She's my inspiration for putting computer science, particularly coding, in every Arkansas high school. It is a high-paying skill and it's the future for many Arkansas boysÂ… and girls. Right, Ella Beth?
