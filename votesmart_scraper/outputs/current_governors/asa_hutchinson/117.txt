Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement on the passing of United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia:
"Justice Antonin Scalia's passing is a devastating blow to the country. He was a passionate defender of the Constitution, a stalwart conservative and an overall brilliant jurist.
"I had the privilege of knowing Justice Scalia. His humor and love of life allowed everyone to see the human side of a great Jurist, and I particularly appreciate his fondness of duck hunting in Arkansas.
"The United States is a better place having had Justice Scalia serve on its highest court and he will be missed, to say the least. Our prayers are with his family during this difficult time."
