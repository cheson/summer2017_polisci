Executive Branch Employment Shrinks by Approximately 3% Announces Gov. Hutchinson
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: April 18, 2016
Location: Little Rock, AR

Executive-branch state agencies ended March with almost 800 fewer positions than in January of 2015, according to data released Monday by the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. Salary savings resulting from these increased efficiencies are anticipated to save the State an estimated $7 million by June 30, the end of Fiscal 2016.
The data, compiled by the Department of Finance and Administration's Office of Personnel Management, measures the number of people employed by agencies who answer directly to the governor as March 31st, the end of the first quarter of calendar 2015. At that time, executive-branch agencies employed 25,733 people, or 795 fewer than were employed in January 2015, a decline of about three percent.
Governor Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"We are working hard to find efficiencies and to make our government more accountable to the taxpayer. So far, we are on the right track. But we are far from done, and I expect our State agencies to continue finding increased efficiencies and lowering the cost of operating State government."
Executive-branch agencies are those agencies, boards and commissions under the direct oversight of Governor Hutchinson. Data for the report was drawn from the state accounting system AASIS. The decline in total employment is largely the result of attrition and the governor's statewide job-freeze, as well as an increased focus on efficiency in State operations.
