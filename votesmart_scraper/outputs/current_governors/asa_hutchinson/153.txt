Governor Asa Hutchinson announced the newest computer science numbers at an event in Fort Smith earlier today. To date, 3,973 students are enrolled in computer science courses, with more than 550 students taking more than one course.
2,004 students are currently enrolled in the new course, Essentials of Computer Programming -- created under the direction of the Governor. The Governor has set an initial goal of seeing 6,000 high schools students take this course each year.
More detailed information can be found below.
Governor Hutchinson released the following statement:
"The numbers are very promising. To have a 260 percent increase over last year in the number of students taking computer science courses tells me that there is a hunger for this curriculum.
"Through our computer-science initiative, Arkansas's students, teachers and educators have gotten the word that computer coding is an essential skill necessary to compete in any 21st century field. These first-year numbers send a message to businesses and entrepreneurs that Arkansas will lead the way when it comes to computer literacy."
