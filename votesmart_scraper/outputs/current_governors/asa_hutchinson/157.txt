Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson launched a statewide plan today to improve the health of all Arkansans. The plan, titled Healthy Active Arkansas, contains nine focus areas all tied to increasing the health of Arkansans through healthy dietary choices and increased physical activity.
The nine focus areas are Physical and Built Environment; Nutritional Standards in Government, Institutions and the Private Sector; Nutritional Standards in Schools--Early Child Care Through College; Physical Education and Activity in Schools--Early Child Care Through College; Healthy Worksites; Access to Healthy Foods; Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Reduction; Breastfeeding; and a Marketing Program.

"Healthy Active Arkansas is about the future of our state," Hutchinson said. "We want to create a state where all Arkansans can lead healthy, happy and fulfilling lives."
Hutchinson pointed out the many benefits of improving health outcomes in Arkansas, including benefits to businesses through lower health care costs for employers and employees and increased productivity; lowering the burden of chronic disease treatment, such as obesity and diabetes, on the health care industry; and strengthening the state's economic development potential by establishing Arkansas as a place with a healthier workforce.
"It's all connected," Hutchinson said. "We have more than $1 billion annually just in obesity-related expenses. The more we do to improve healthy lifestyles in our state, the more we reduce costs and the more we improve our workforce and quality of life."
