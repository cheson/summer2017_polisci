Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: July 8, 2016
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson today released the following statement in response to the attack overnight in Dallas, Texas that left five police officers dead and seven more wounded:
"My heart is with the City of Dallas, its people and the law enforcement community today. This was a senseless act of hatred -- the deadliest attack on law enforcement since 9/11 -- and should serve as a reminder that our first responders put themselves in harm's way every day. We are grateful for their service and sacrifice.
"My prayers are with all the victims of violence from this last week. My hope for Arkansas is that we will be united in reducing violence, supporting law enforcement and restoring civility and respect in our communities."
