Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson today released the following statement in response to President Obama's executive order on gun control:
"On the issue of violent attacks from armed gunmen, my background has allowed me the opportunity to examine closely this issue from every side and I disagree with the President's approach. Today, the President reinforced what we've come to expect: he would rather circumvent the American people, Congress and the Constitution in an effort to accomplish his agenda. The actions outlined in his executive order are largely the same new restrictions that Congress has already rejected.
"I, too, agree that the safety and security of Americans should come first. That's why I would encourage the President to use his last year in office in developing a more effective strategy and action plan against ISIS and other terror threats targeting the United States. He has an opportunity to lead and unify but instead the President has opted to attack the Second Amendment and law abiding citizens through a divisive plan that will not save any lives."
