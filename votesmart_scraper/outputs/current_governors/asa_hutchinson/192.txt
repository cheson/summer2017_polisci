Governor Asa Hutchinson Praises Passage of TPA; Applauds Congressional Action
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: June 24, 2015
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the statement below following the final passage of the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA):
"I congratulate Congress for getting this trade authority passed so that we as a state can continue forward as a global competitor on a more level playing field. During my recent trade mission to Europe, I heard first-hand how this country's lack of a better trade agreement with Europe is costing us jobs and business, especially in the auto industry.
"This trade authority is good for the United States and good for Arkansas. It will create jobs here, and I strongly support it."
