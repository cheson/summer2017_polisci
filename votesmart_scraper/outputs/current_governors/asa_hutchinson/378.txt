Investing In Workforce Education
As part of his GROW ARKANSAS initiative, Asa has proposed redirecting state surplus funds currently used for a variety of local projects around the state and instead invest that money in jobs and education.
"We need to quit thinking in terms of short-term spending, and think more in terms of long-term investments that will lay the foundation for a thriving economy that will create more jobs and better-paying jobs," Hutchinson has noted in speeches around the state.
There is perhaps no more critical foundation to bringing more and better-paying jobs to Arkansas than investing in education and creating an educated workforce that will not only spur the growth of home-grown businesses and jobs but also attract industries looking to relocate to Arkansas.
That is why Asa has proposed using the state's General Improvement Fund -- excess unbudgeted dollars traditionally divvied up among legislators for local projects in -- and investing those funds in workforce training at two-year colleges in communities around the state.
Whether we are talking about West Memphis or Helena, Magnolia or Texarkana, Russellville or Mountain Home, or any other of the various communities with local colleges that are prepared to train Arkansas workers ... whether we are talking about a single mom in Searcy looking to get a new degree or a young worker in Helena-West Helena looking to raise his income or start a business or a factory worker in Texarkana wanting to use his skills to land a new job working with computers ... we need to invest in our workers in every region of the state so that they can seize the new opportunities available to them.
