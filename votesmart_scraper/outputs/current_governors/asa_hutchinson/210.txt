Governor Asa Hutchinson today issued a proclamation declaring Franklin, Garland, Howard, Izard, Johnson, Montgomery, Newton, Pike, Pope and Searcy counties a disaster area.

The governor issued the proclamation upon touring the affected areas Monday afternoon.
Governor Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"It's always difficult to see the damage inflicted by deadly storms and tornadoes. Our hearts and prayers go out to those in the Nashville area who were affected by the recent weather, especially the family of those who died from Sunday's tornado.
"As Arkansans, we all hold our breath when we hear about severe weather. Sadly, we've been through this before, and we know how devastating these storms can be. But Arkansans help out each other. We always have. We always will. And I know the compassion of Arkansans will reach those in these difficult circumstances."
