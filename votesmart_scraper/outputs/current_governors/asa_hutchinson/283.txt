Issues ranging from the minimum wage, private option, and prisons/jail overcrowding to same-sex marriage, the Buffalo River watershed/hog farm controversy and control of the lottery took center stage in a debate this afternoon between the four men running for governor of Arkansas.
The Green Party's Josh Drake, Libertarian Frank Gilbert, Republican Asa Hutchinson and Democrat Mike Ross squared off on the issues before the summer convention of the Arkansas Press Association.
At the beginning of the debate, each candidate discussed their mains areas of concern. For Hutchinson, it's education, business growth, healthcare reform that works and regulatory reform.
Drake said he wants to win 3 percent of the vote as a victory for his party. He also shared that he believes in tax reform and is environmentally conscious.
Ross told the crowd he believes in Arkansas and its people and that we can do better. As he's said before, Ross wants to be the education governor. Today he touched on Pre-K programs and Vo-Tech training.
Gilbert began by touting his party, saying that Hutchinson and Ross will spend millions trying to point out significant differences in their parties. He said there would be no difference if either candidate is elected but there would be with a Libertarian in the governor's office.
