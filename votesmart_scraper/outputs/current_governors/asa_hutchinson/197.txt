Governor Asa Hutchinson Comments on Board of Education's Vote on Statewide Assessment
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: June 11, 2015
Location: Little Rock, AR

Today, the State Board of Education voted against adopting a recommendation by the Governor's Council on Common Core Review to terminate the state's contract with Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) assessment and to enter into a contract with ACT and ACT Aspire.
Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"I'm disappointed the state Board of Education rejected the recommendation for student assessment for the next school year. The recommendation was based on the conclusions reached by the Common Core Review Council, a 16 member council made up of teachers, administrators, business leaders and students from all over the state.
"The legislature had directed through Act 1074 that the current PARCC contract not be renewed long term and for the State Board to consider a change for the 2016-17 school year. I determined it best to make the change for the next school year for the sake of long-term stability for the teachers, school districts and for the sake of our students.
"In the coming days, I will work closely with Commissioner Key and the Board to determine the best guidance we can provide our students, teachers and administrators as to the next steps in student assessments."
