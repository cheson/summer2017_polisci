Independent Group FactCheck.org Finds Democratic Governors Association Ad Attacking Asa Hutchinson False
Press Release

Last week, the Democratic Governors Association released a new attack ad that makes accusations regarding Asa Hutchinson's tenure at the Department of Homeland Security. The accusations center on the premise that Asa authorized wasteful government spending within the Transportation Security Administration.
After a thorough review of the facts, FactCheck.org found that the ad "falsely accuses GOP nominee Asa Hutchinson of allowing wasteful spending of taxpayer funds for employee bonuses and a lavish "birthday party.' In fact, Hutchinson wasn't running the agency in question, and wasn't cited by the report that brought the expenditures to light." The review went on to say that "the IG report found the spending to be "excessive,' but it found no fault with Hutchinson, who isn't even named in the report except as one of many homeland security officials on the distribution list to receive a copy. As we've already mentioned, Hutchinson wasn't running TSA and had no responsibility for internal department matters such as budget or spending."
The fact that longtime Democratic Congressman Mike Ross and his allies at the Democratic Governors Association would run such a patently false ad speaks volumes about their desperation and credibility in this race.
Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"I am pleased that FactCheck.org has confirmed that I had nothing to do with any of the claims made in this false and desperate ad. I have stated from the beginning that the ad is false and the voters of Arkansas deserve to know the truth. I have always fought against wasteful government spending and will continue to do so as Governor of Arkansas."
