Asa: New Approach To State Taxes Will Drive Jobs Growth, Higher Wages
Â‘New Thinking' Needed On Taxes To Encourage Business Recruitment, Expansion; Hutchinson Also Urges Arkansas To Embrace New Economy

- Jobs growth and higher wages in Arkansas will follow if the state takes a fresh approach to tax reform, Asa Hutchinson, 2006 Republican candidate for Governor, said Wednesday.

Hutchinson, speaking at the closing luncheon of the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce/Associated Industries of Arkansas Annual Conference in Hot Springs, expanded upon themes he has discussed in recent weeks, tying tax reform and technology expansion to economic development, jobs growth and higher wages in the state.

Instead of focusing on new revenues driven by new tax increases, Hutchinson said, we must look at reducing the state's tax burden as a way to spur the economy, attract job-creating industries and boost wages. After creating a more economically vibrant environment in Arkansas, the revenue will flow from a broader and more economically healthy tax base.

"Historically, when the state needed revenue, we had a single answer - we raised taxes," Hutchinson said. "Today, we must do as Abraham Lincoln challenged the American people to do: We must think anew and we must act anew."

To illustrate how tax reform could lead to growth in state revenues, Hutchinson pointed to the example of New Mexico, where Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson, elected in 2002, worked with the Democratic-controlled legislature to cut the top marginal tax rate from 8.2 percent to 4.9 percent over a five-year period and reduced taxes on capital gains. The reductions resulted in economic growth that led to $216 million in new revenues in 2005.

Hutchinson also emphasized that the state must adapt to the new global economy that is driven by the information, technology and service industries. He pointed out that the state has lost some 38,000 manufacturing jobs in the last five years.

"This isn't anybody's fault. It is a result of the changing nature of the global economy," Hutchinson said. "And although we in Arkansas have made some great strides, we must not be passive when it comes to moving our economy forward."

Hutchinson pointed out that many Arkansas industries already lead in the technology field -- from retail to transportation to energy exploration - and that Arkansas universities have produced some of the nation's cutting edge technology.

"The challenge is to retain investment capital in these industries inside of Arkansas," Hutchinson said. "Too many businesses and entrepreneurs are leaving Arkansas, or refusing to locate here, because our tax burden is too great compared to surrounding states. We must make Arkansas an attractive place to do business, and then we will enjoy more jobs, better jobs and higher paying jobs."

Hutchinson emphasized two initial goals for tax reform related to job creation and higher wages in Arkansas:

1) Creating a more business friendly and competitive tax structure that would allow Arkansas to retain its in-state industries and small business, as well as recruit and support new industries. To that end, Hutchinson said he would support an exemption on sales taxes on utilities for Arkansas industry in order to reduce the cost of doing business and to encourage business expansion and jobs growth.
2) Encouraging the investment of capital in Arkansas to support, recruit and retain jobs in the state.

On Oct. 14, Hutchinson addressed the Pulaski County Bar Association in Little Rock on Oct. 14 and suggested that the state debate on taxes should focus on tax reform, rather than tax increases, in order to drive job creation and revenue growth.
