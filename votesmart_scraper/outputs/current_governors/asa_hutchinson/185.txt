Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement in response to the Board of Education's decision earlier today to seek a contract with ACT and ACT Aspire:
"I applaud the Board of Education for its vote in switching from PARCC to ACT/ACT Aspire. The board members were thoughtful and deliberate on this issue and reached a final decision that I think is best for our students and teachers over the long term. It provides stability and aligns Arkansas with a nationally recognized testing system.
"I appreciate the hard work of the Board and the meaningful discussions it held on this issue. Its willingness to move away from PARCC and seek this new contract is an indication of the Board's continued dedication to putting Arkansas's students first. I especially want to thank Commissioner Key, the Department of Education and members of the Common Core Review Council for their hard work in addressing this matter."
