Press Release

Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson launched the state's MyIdea project at a news conference on Thursday, a direct line to state agencies that will give Arkansans a chance to contribute ideas for ways to improve services, increase efficiencies and streamline state government.
Starting today, Arkansans may submit ideas online at www.myidea.arkansas.gov or by phone at (844) 7MY-IDEA or (501) 683-IDEA. The process is quick and easy, and while contact information will be requested for any necessary follow up, MyIdea will accept anonymous suggestions.
Current employees of the Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) will staff the MyIdea telephone line and website. DFA will determine which agency is best equipped to assess an idea, then forward it to the head of that agency. The governor has directed each agency to report back on an idea within 30 days. DFA and the Chief Transformation Officer, housed in the Governor's Office, will track the responses.
"I am truly excited about the launch of MyIdea," said Governor Hutchinson. "This is a great opportunity for the customers of state government to be heard. I encourage everyone with an idea, however large or small, to submit suggestions to streamline state government and to maximize the efficient use of their tax dollars. I want to lead the way in reducing the cost of state government, and what better source of ideas than the taxpayers who will benefit. By working together, we can cut costs and improve state government for all Arkansans."
