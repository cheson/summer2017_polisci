Governor Asa Hutchinson has submitted the name of Johnny Key to the State Board of Education to act as the new Commissioner of Education and to serve as the administrative head of the Arkansas Department of Education.
Governor Hutchinson issued the following statement on Johnny Key:
"I am extremely pleased to submit Johnny Key to act as the next Commissioner of the state Department of Education. Johnny has always exhibited a passion for improving education, from his work as a legislator who focused on educational issues to his current position as associate vice president for the University of Arkansas system.
"In the General Assembly, where he served as chairman of the Senate Education Committee, Johnny was noted for his leadership, consensus-building and bipartisan approach. We are lucky to have someone with his skill set as the next Education Commissioner, especially someone whose reputation is as impressive as his résumé.
"I also want to thank outgoing Commissioner Tony Wood for staying on during this transition and working hard for the people of Arkansas. His leadership has been invaluable.
"There may be no more important confirmation I make as governor than Education Commissioner, and I am fortunate that Johnny Key is willing and eager to take on the challenge of improving education for all Arkansans. I know he will do an outstanding job."
