Gov. Hutchinson Issues Statement on United States Supreme Court Decision
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson

Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson today issued a response to the U.S. Supreme Court's denial of the motion to vacate the Arkansas Supreme Court's stay on the execution of Don Davis.
Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to vacate the Arkansas Supreme Court decision in reference to Don Davis. I am disappointed in this delay for the victim's family. However, the 8th Circuit decision today overturning Judge Baker's stay and the Arkansas Supreme Court ruling vacating Judge Griffen's temporary restraining order mean that the courts have once again cleared the state to proceed with carrying out the sentences of the other inmates. While this has been an exhausting day for all involved, tomorrow we will continue to fight back on last minute appeals and efforts to block justice for the victims' families."
