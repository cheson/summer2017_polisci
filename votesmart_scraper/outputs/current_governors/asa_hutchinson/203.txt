Gov. Hutchinson on the Passage of the Proposed Lockheed Martin Super Project; Details Bill Signing
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: May 28, 2015
Location: Little Rock, AR

Passing with broad, bipartisan support from both chambers, the proposed Amendment 82 Lockheed Martin super project in south Arkansas (HB 1003 and SB 6) will head to Governor Asa Hutchinson's desk for his signature. If Lockheed Martin is awarded the contract to produce the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle for the Department of Defense, this project would create, over time, almost 600 new jobs at the Highland Industrial Park in East Camden while securing more than 1,100 jobs for the life of the project. (See below for "Quick Facts.")
Governor Hutchinson released the following statement upon final passage:
"This is an important next step in our attempt to help Lockheed Martin secure a federal Defense contract and create hundreds of new jobs in South Arkansas. The state of Arkansas is doing its part by overwhelmingly passing the Amendment 82 legislation. We are on board with bipartisan support. I've called this a golden opportunity for Arkansas, and it is not just for us to expand our economy but to contribute to our nation's defense."
