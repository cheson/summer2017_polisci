Gov. Hutchinson Issues Statement on Recent Court Decisions Regarding Scheduled Executions
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: April 15, 2017
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement in response to the recent court decisions regarding the scheduled executions:
"When I set the eight execution dates in accordance with the law and my responsibilities, I was fully aware that the actions would trigger both the individual clemency hearings and separate court reviews on varying claims by the death row inmates. I understand how difficult this is on the victims' families, and my heart goes out to them as they once again deal with the continued court review; however, the last minute court reviews are all part of the difficult process of death penalty cases. I expect both the Supreme Court of Arkansas and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals to review the decisions quickly, and I have confidence in the Attorney General and her team to expedite the reviews.
"I'll be meeting with the Attorney General and the Arkansas Department of Correction on Monday to determine next steps."
