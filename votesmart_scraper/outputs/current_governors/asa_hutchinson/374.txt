Asa Urges Action On Property Rights
Hutchinson Warns Against Passive' Approach To Property Rights, Urges Legislature To Act
Comments Come in Reaction To Attorney General Opinion
Asa Hutchinson today renewed his call for the Arkansas Legislature to act decisively to protect private property rights in Arkansas. Hutchinson's comments came in reaction to an Attorney General's opinion on eminent domain issued this morning.
"The state of Arkansas needs to show leadership and take steps to actively protect our property rights," Hutchinson said. "I don't think we can afford to take a wait-and-see approach and let the courts decide for us."
The Attorney General's opinion was issued in response to a request from State Senator Denny Altes asking, "In light of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Kelo v. New London  can a city in Arkansas use its power of eminent domain to take private property for private enterprise?"
The Attorney General concluded that "the answer to your question is generally no' under existing Arkansas case law and the Arkansas Constitution."
Hutchinson, a former U.S. Attorney and Arkansas congressman, stated that the Kelo ruling altered the traditional interpretation of "public use" to include the taking of private property for private re-development, if a state so defined it. Previously, "public use" was typically limited to uses such as the building of roads and schools, not purely private economic development projects.
