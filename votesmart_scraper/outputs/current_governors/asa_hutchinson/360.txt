Asa Hutchinson Statement On Halter Withdrawal From Governor's Race
- Asa Hutchinson, 2006 Republican candidate for Governor, issued the following statement today in response to Bill Halter's withdrawal from the Democratic primary race for Governor:
"Bill Halter never really engaged in this campaign, so his dropping out doesn't change our strategy or significantly impact the race. When I first announced, I expected to have a difficult primary, and that Mike Beebe would not have one. So right now I feel like we're in pretty good shape.
"I will say this, though. Bill Halter first came onto the scene recognizing that Mr. Beebe does not offer the new kind of ideas needed to grow jobs and improve education. I agree with that. Mike Beebe has been a fixture in Little Rock for 20 years. I offer a bolder vision for Arkansas' future, and folks know where I stand on issues."
