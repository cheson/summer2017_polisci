Statement

Location: Little Rock, AK

Governor Asa Hutchinson applauds Walmart's bold, new initiatives that would, in part, raise pay for all current associates to $9 an hour starting in April and $10 an hour or higher by early next year. Other initiatives announced by the Arkansas-based company and world's largest retailer include a promise to provide career opportunities for its associates, as well as a commitment to work with their schedules.
Governor Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"The Walmart story has always been about the American Dream. Sam Walton embodied that dream, building the world's largest retailer through hard work, vision and exceeding the expectations of his customers. He would be proud of the forward-thinking plan announced by Walmart today to raise the pay of all current associates, provide those who want it the training and clear path to career success and work with associates on schedules that best fit their busy lives. This is especially good news for Arkansas and its 51,000 Walmart associates.
"Walmart understands that a company is only as strong as its employees. And its visionary new plan makes the company an even stronger, better place to work and advance in a career. I often talk about individuals having the opportunity to climb the economic ladder. Most of us hunger for that chance to earn our success. Walmart provides it."
