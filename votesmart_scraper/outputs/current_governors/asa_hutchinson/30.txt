Governor Hutchinson Comments on Trump-Xi Jinping Meeting
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: April 4, 2017
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson today issued a response to President Trump's meeting with President Xi Jinping:
"The work we have done to recruit direct investment from China has resulted in the commitment of more than $1 billion in new capital investments with more than 650 new jobs. We are confident President Trump's meeting with President Xi Jinping will only strengthen the United States' relationship with China as they discuss any unresolved trade issues.
"This relationship is important for the United States as a whole and Arkansas specifically because of the growing level of interest from Chinese companies that are considering doing business in the state. President Trump's appointment of Governor Terry Branstad of Iowa as Ambassador to China is another positive step in improving relations between our countries. The significant investment China is making in Arkansas will continue to strengthen our position on the global stage."
Governor Hutchinson led trade missions to China in 2015 and 2016 to recruit foreign investment and to advocate for Arkansas agricultural exports. After his 2015 visit, Sun Paper agreed to invest $1 billion to build a facility in Arkadelphia that will employ 250 people. After a second trade mission in October of 2016, Suzhou Tianyaun Garment Company signed an agreement to invest $20 million to establish a clothing manufacturing facility in Little Rock that will create 400 new jobs.
