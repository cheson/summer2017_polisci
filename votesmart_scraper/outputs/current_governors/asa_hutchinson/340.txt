The Beebe Campaign: One Year And No Substance
One-Year Anniversary of Beebe Campaign Announcement Passes With Few Proposals
Hutchinson Urges More Vigorous Exchange of Ideas
Little Rock - The one-year anniversary of Attorney General Mike Beebe's announcement of his gubernatorial campaign came and went last week, highlighting the dearth of concrete policies or ideas offered up by the Democratic candidate as to how he would govern Arkansas.
Asa Hutchinson, the 2006 Republican candidate for Arkansas Governor, today noted the anniversary and the lack of any clear vision in the Beebe campaign. He said it emphasized the marked differences between the two candidates, and was indicative of the very different kinds of leadership each would provide.
"Other than a $50 million dollar slush fund he wants to put under his control, Mr. Beebe has offered few specific policies for how he would govern Arkansas," said Hutchinson. "As part of a larger body, a legislator can get by with generalities, but a chief executive must make decisions and lead. At some point, you have to ask: Why are you running for this office? Do you have a vision for moving Arkansas forward?"
Hutchinson observed that while he continues to lay out a broad, varied and specific platform of policies and to inform the public as to where and how he will lead Arkansas, his opponent has either relied on vague generalities or has offered up a few specifics with escape clauses and loopholes that would allow him to wriggle out of his commitments once in office.
An example of Beebe's lack of commitment to the few policies he has proposed is his suggestion that he would eliminate the utility tax on manufacturers - but only if and when "resources allow." Hutchinson, on the other hand, has said that bringing better jobs to Arkansas is his top priority, and he will eliminate the tax outright, without qualifications.
"If a projected $600 million surplus doesn't Â‘allow' for tax relief, what does?" he asked. "Mr. Beebe spent 20 years in the state senate in Little Rock and never seemed to find a time that would allow for substantive tax reform."
Hutchinson pointed to education reform as another clear contrast between the candidates. While Hutchinson has laid out a detailed package of reforms to strengthen schools across Arkansas, his opponent has not offered a single concrete proposal other than to indicate vague support for teacher salaries and pre-K programs, which Hutchinson also supports.
"My opponent says he believes in good education, but who doesn't? He has offered no plan, no specific ideas, on how he would improve education. I have laid out a very detailed package," said Hutchinson. "Arkansas voters will be deciding the direction of this state for up to a decade when they cast their votes in November. This is a truly watershed election. Our voters deserve a clear understanding of the choices being presented to them. Good government depends upon good choices by voters, which is based on well-informed decisions. Our job as candidates is to tell voters how we will govern - not hide our positions from them."
Hutchinson concluded that the only time Beebe takes a position on anything is when he is forced to react to ideas laid out by Hutchinson.
"The few positions we know for sure are those where he has reacted to me," said Hutchinson. "We know he is opposed to my call for a supermajority before you can raise the sales tax again. We know he is opposed to my call for strengthening private property rights. We know he is opposed to my call for requiring busing standards to protect children in rural communities. We know what he is against, but what is he for?"
