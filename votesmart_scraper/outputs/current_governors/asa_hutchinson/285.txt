Democratic Governors Association Propping Up Desperate Mike Ross, Airs Misleading and False Attack
Press Release

The Democratic Governors Association released yet another false and misleading attack ad against Asa Hutchinson, the Republican nominee for governor, in a continued sign of Mike Ross' desperation in lagging behind in this race.
The ad falsely claims that Asa Hutchinson authorized wasteful spending on a birthday party for the Transportation Security Administration. In fact, Asa Hutchinson did not authorize the spending and when the Inspector General reported the questionable spending, Hutchinson took action to stop the waste. The Transportation Security Administration, one of several agencies under the newly formed Department of Homeland Security, was criticized by the IG for an awards ceremony that was held in 2004.
Asa Hutchinson stated:
"Mike Ross' time in Congress is an illustration of how to waste government money such as his vote for "cash for clunkers," the auto bailout, the Wall Street bailout and the stimulus package. I left Congress after lowering taxes and balancing the nation's budget. When Mike Ross left congress, he left the country $10 trillion dollars deeper in debt."
