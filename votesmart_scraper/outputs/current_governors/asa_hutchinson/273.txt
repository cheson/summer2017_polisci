Asa Hutchinson Releases New Ad: Trusty Truck; Highlights Fiscal Conservative Values
Press Release
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: Sept. 10, 2014
Location: Little Rock, AR

Republican gubernatorial nominee Asa Hutchinson released a new television ad Friday titled, "Trusty Truck". The new TV ad highlights Asa's fiscally conservative mindset and his ability, as governor, to say no to wasteful spending. Asa believes this approach is the only way to control the size of government and lower taxes.
Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"Corner to corner, Arkansas is full of economic potential with plenty of opportunity for job creation, which means a better future for all Arkansans -- but responsibility is key. As governor, I understand the importance of a state living within its means. Throughout my campaign, I have listened to Arkansans and shared with them my plan to reach our economic goals, but one thing I have never done is make empty promises. Going around the state promising millions in new or expanded programs and vowing to cut taxes for every group one comes across for political gain is, quite frankly, misleading.
"As governor, I am committed to keeping our state financially sound, while being direct and straightforward with Arkansans. Together we can accomplish these goals for our state, but empty promises get us nowhere."
Mike Ross Can't Say No:
He won't tell us how he plans on paying for it all, but Mike Ross promises to:
Phase out state's sales and use tax on partial replacements and repairs of manufacturing machinery and equipment (Ross's Estimated Cost: $38.25M/yr)
Expand state's already underfunded pre-k program (Ross's Estimated Cost: $37.48M/yr)
Income Tax Plan (Ross's Estimated Cost: $574.5M/yr)
FOR AN ESTIMATED GRAND TOTAL OF: $650.23 MILLION A YEAR (And that's just the proposals he has estimates for.)
It's clear, Arkansas just can't afford Mike Ross.
Script:
Asa: My truck has over 130 thousand miles on it.
Susan: And my car? It has even more.
Asa: If there's one thing I don't believe, that's wasting money. So while there's a lot of ideas on how government can spend more, as governor, sometimes you just have to say no. It's the only way to control the size of government and be able to reduce taxes. I'm Asa Hutchinson. As governor, we'll hit the ground running and never look back.
