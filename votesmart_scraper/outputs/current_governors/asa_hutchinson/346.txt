Asa Hutchinson Outlines Arkansas 'First Teachers Foundation'
Emphasizes Importance of Parents, Local Community In Education
Little Rock, Ark. - Asa Hutchinson, Arkansas' 2006 Republican candidate for Governor, said today that, as Governor, he would establish a statewide private foundation to assist parents and local communities in supporting their children's education.
In a forum with local teachers, parents and educators at Baker Elementary in Little Rock, Hutchinson discussed his "First Teachers Foundation" as a vehicle to achieve his statewide goal of promoting, enhancing and supporting the critical involvement of parents and local communities in creating a strong and effective educational system.
"I've made creating more and better-paying jobs my number one policy goal, and you cannot do that without creating a strong education system that produces an educated workforce capable of competing in today's global economy," Hutchinson said. "That's why education reform is an indispensable element of my GROW ARKANSAS campaign."
Hutchinson noted that the First Teachers Foundation would be funded by private sector contributions, which would be used to launch a public awareness campaign focused on promoting the importance of education in Arkansas - not only for the success of the individual children, but for the goal of growing Arkansas's economy and attracting the best-paying jobs to our state.
In addition, the foundation would be charged with developing programs to assist parents and guardians and local communities in their active and ongoing involvement in local education efforts. The Foundation would work with local community involvement programs in existence but work to establish programs in communities where such involvement may be lacking.
