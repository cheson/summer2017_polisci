Asa knows that a strong economy needs strong infrastructure. Asa supports Arkansas roads and highways and understands that we need smart and efficient investments. Major projects like I-49 through Fort Smith need to be completed. The navigable channel on the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System needs to be deepened to 12 feet. This will allow commercial river traffic to operate at full capacity and help make Arkansas a competitive place to do business.
