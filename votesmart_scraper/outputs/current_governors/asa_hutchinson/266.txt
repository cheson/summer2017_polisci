Press Release

Location: Little Rock, AR

Republican gubernatorial nominee Asa Hutchinson released a new television ad Fridaytitled "Fight For Arkansas". The new TV ad highlights Asa's plan to stand up to the federal overreach that hurts our state and its residents. President Obama has helped raise millions to attack Asa, because Asa opposes Obamacare, Asa wants to cut taxes for middle class Arkansans, and -- as it states in the ad -- unlike President Obama, Asa's number one priority will be jobs and the state's economy. We need a governor who will fight for Arkansas, and Asa promises to do just that.

Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"I love Arkansas, and I firmly believe our best days as Arkansans are ahead of us, but we need a governor who will fight for our state every day against President Obama and the enormous overreach from the federal government that impacts our state and its economy.
"My plan for Arkansas has remained consistent, and it starts by lowering income taxes for our middle class. I want to create jobs and grow our economy by properly training our workforce, bringing in new industry and preparing our students for the modern workplace, including computer science and computer coding classes in every Arkansas high school within four years."
