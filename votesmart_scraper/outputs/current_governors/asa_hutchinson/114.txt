Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement on the passing of former First Lady Nancy Reagan:
"Nancy Reagan was a First Lady of grace and dignity, who loved and supported both her husband and country in all that she did. There's no doubt the Ronnie and Nancy love story will continue to inspire generations to come. And, as President Reagan's U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, I can appreciate firsthand Nancy's determined and passionate approach to the country's anti-drug effort and the critical role she played in that endeavor. She will forever be a source of pride for all Americans and will be greatly missed."
