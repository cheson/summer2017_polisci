Hutchinson Focuses On Illegal Immigration
Republican gubernatorial candidate Asa Hutchinson on Thursday focused his campaign on illegal immigration and said prisons should verify the immigration status of all inmates before release.
Hutchinson, who as a federal Homeland Security official oversaw border security, detailed several steps he said the state could take to fight illegal immigration.
"There are still too many who say that immigration is a federal matter only, and that states have no role in enforcing our laws," Hutchinson said. "That's an old way of thinking, and one that simply isn't acceptable anymore."
Hutchinson, who also is a former congressman, faces Democratic Attorney General Mike Beebe in the Nov. 7 election.
Hutchinson announced the proposals at the Springdale Police Department earlier Thursday. In an interview with The Associated Press, he said his proposals were partly driven by President Bush's push for immigration reform.
"The president sent the signal that there's more that needs to be done and that there's a role to be played by the states," Hutchinson said. "That really is consistent with what I'm saying today."
Hutchinson said the state should take part in an agreement with the federal Department of Homeland Security that would hand over some authority for enforcing immigration law to state police. Hutchinson, who backed the agreements while at Homeland Security, said states such as Florida and Alabama already have entered into these arrangements.
