Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson today announced the formation of a new statewide initiative to support and promote the state's military installations and related economic development interests.
The Governor's Military Affairs Committee will bring together public and private leaders around the state who will prepare and advocate for Arkansas on both a national and state level to accomplish short- and long-term economic objectives for our military installations. The Governor has committed an up-front amount of $400,000 in funding for the purpose of establishing the statewide organization and commissioning an economic impact analysis.
Objectives include:
Grow and protect our state's military installations, utilization, and missions.
Advocate at state and federal levels on behalf of our state and local economic development interests.
Position Arkansas as a priority State in our national defense plan.
Appoint a public-private partnership steering committee to accomplish short-term and organizational goals.
"The nation's military presence in Arkansas through our bases and our defense contractors plays a vital role, not only in the defense of our country, but also in the economic stability of our state," said Governor Hutchinson. "We have several groups around the state who have an interest in seeing our military prosper, and this pro-active initiative will allow us to combine our strengths and pursue common objectives and opportunities. I'm proud of the steering committee we've assembled and challenge them with directing this initiative successfully."
