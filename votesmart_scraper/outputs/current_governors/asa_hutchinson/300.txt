"If we are serious about growing Arkansas's economy, then we have to be serious about training our workforce. We have an opportunity to create a competitive edge in recruiting industry to Arkansas. We are competing for jobs in the global marketplace and the jobs will flow to those states with the skilled workers and with an educational system that matches the training to the technology of the workplace." -- Asa Hutchinson
Arkansas needs jobs and Asa has an effective and concrete plan to bring jobs to Arkansas. This plan will help Arkansas attract and keep businesses, encourage entrepreneurship and provide the economic growth we need.
Tax Plan - To become more competitive, Asa proposes to reduce income taxes on those earning between $20,400 and $75,000. This will not only help Arkansas's middle-income families, it will also make Arkansas more attractive for businesses to locate and stay in Arkansas.
Workforce Education - With manufacturing returning to the United States it is essential that Arkansas has an effective workforce education plan and coordinate with educators and industry to assure that we are providing the training needed for the workforce of today's world, including manufacturing, technology, construction and other skilled professions.
Computer Science - Only one in ten high schools across the country teach computer science courses, including coding. This means Arkansas has an opportunity to provide students with the skills needed to bring hi-tech jobs to Arkansas and to have the ability to become entrepreneurs themselves.
