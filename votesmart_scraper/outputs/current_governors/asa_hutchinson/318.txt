Asa Challenges Beebe on Property Rights
Little Rock -- Asa Hutchinson, the 2006 Republican nominee for Governor, called on Attorney General Mike Beebe today to revise the official Attorney General's opinion he issued last year asserting that Arkansas has no need for stronger property rights.
Hutchinson issued the challenge to the Attorney General today after Beebe appeared to have changed his position, telling the Arkansas Realtor's Association in Memphis that he is now working on legislation to strengthen property rights.
"The Attorney General seems to have done a complete flip-flop on the issue of property rights, and I welcome him to our position, but if he is sincere then he should change the official opinion he released last year saying that no such action was necessary," Hutchinson said.
The issue became a point of contention between Hutchinson and Beebe last year after the Supreme Court ruled that local government could seize private property - including homes, farms, small businesses - in the name of "public use" for purposes of increasing tax revenues or economic development.
Hutchinson said that this ruling distorted the traditional definition of "public use," and called for legislation to define "public use" in a way that would prevent such abuse. Beebe responded that such action was unnecessary, and subsequently issued a formal opinion as Attorney General declaring that such action was unnecessary.
Hutchinson applauded Beebe for his change of position, but said that unless the Attorney General revises the official opinion he issued last year contradicting his new position, it was "empty politics."
