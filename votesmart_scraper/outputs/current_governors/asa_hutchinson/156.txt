One of the elements identified by Governor Asa Hutchinson for health care reform in Arkansas is to strengthen Medicaid program integrity. To that end, the Department of Human Services Division of Medical Services (DMS) and the Office of Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG), at the request of the Governor, have proposed the establishment of a new Payment Integrity Unit within the Department of Human Services (DHS), and a corresponding division within OMIG.
Governor Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"Among the seven elements of healthcare reform that I outlined to the legislative task force was improving the integrity of the Medicaid program. This is an important step in that direction. We have an obligation to the taxpayers of Arkansas to make certain public programs like Medicaid are run efficiently and with integrity."
