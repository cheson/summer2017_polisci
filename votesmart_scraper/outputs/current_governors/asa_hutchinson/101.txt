Gov. Hutchinson Responds to Obama Administration's "Guidance" on Gender Identification in Schools
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: May 13, 2016
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson today released the following statement in response to the "guidance" on gender identification in schools issued by President Obama, the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department:
"The recent letter from the federal government providing guidance to Arkansas schools on gender identification is offensive, intrusive and totally lacking in common sense. There is no recognizable problem in Arkansas on this issue. The federal government is stirring the pot and meddling in the local control and administration of our schools.
"As Governor, I recommend that local school districts disregard the latest attempt at social engineering by the federal government and continue to use common sense to ensure a safe and healthy environment in Arkansas schools. While the letter implies federal money could be withheld, the letter is nothing more than guidance and is not legally binding."
