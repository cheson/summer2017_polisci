Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson today issued the following response to the execution of Jack Jones:
"This evening the rule of law was upheld when the sentence of the jury for Jack Jones was carried out after 20 years of review. The victim's family has waited patiently for justice during that time. The jury sentenced Jack Jones to death, and his sentence was upheld by judges and reviewed thoroughly in courts of appeal at each level.
"A governor never asks for this responsibility, but I accept it as part of the solemn pledge I made to uphold the law. Jack Jones expressed his willingness to proceed today, and we hope this will help bring closure to the Phillips family."
