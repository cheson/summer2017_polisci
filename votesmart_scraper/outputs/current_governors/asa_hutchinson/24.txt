Gov. Hutchinson Issues Statement on Arkansas Supreme Court's Decision to Stay Johnson Execution
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson

Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement in response to the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to stay the execution of Stacey Johnson:
"I am both surprised and disappointed at the last minute stay by the Arkansas Supreme Court. When I set the dates, I knew there could be delays in one or more of the cases, but I expected the courts to allow the juries' sentences to be carried out since each case had been reviewed multiple times by the Arkansas Supreme Court, which affirmed the guilt of each. The minority opinion was clear in its dissent, but I know the families of the victims are anxious for a clear-cut explanation from the majority as to how they came to this conclusion and how there appears to be no end to the court's review. I will continue to work with the attorney general as we evaluate our next steps."
