Republican gubernatorial nominee Asa Hutchinson welcomed former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Arkansas Tuesday morning as the two toured and observed STEM demonstrations at LISA Academy in Sherwood.
Governor Bush released this statement following the news conference:
"I wholeheartedly support Asa's efforts to bring education into the 21st century. Asa's plan to have computer science as a core credit for graduation in every Arkansas high school no matter where that school is located is a spectacular idea. From an economic perspective, the possibilities are abundant. It's truly a serious and thoughtful campaign promise, as is his entire education plan. The children of Arkansas will do well with his leadership, which is why I am proud to be here in support of his campaign."
Asa Hutchinson released this statement following the news conference:
"I am delighted to welcome Governor Jeb Bush to Arkansas and for the opportunity to show off our talented students.
"I am committed to leading this state to heights we've never seen before. It is my firm belief that, based upon the work ethic of Arkansans and our shared passions for this beautiful state, together, we can lead the region in job creation and economic growth. I have a plan that will not only create jobs and better pay, but it will provide our students with more opportunity by emphasizing technology education in Arkansas classrooms. This alone has the potential to create opportunity for all Arkansans."
