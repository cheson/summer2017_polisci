Beebe Got Facts On Arsenal Program Wrong, Hutchinson Says
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mike Beebe on Monday called for the federal government to restore funding to a program at the Pine Bluff Arsenal.
His Republican opponent, Asa Hutchinson, said Beebe "is wrong on the facts," including not getting the cut program's name right.
"If you take out the fact that he's dealing with the wrong issue and the dealing with the wrong facts and referencing the wrong information with [a congressional ] report, then I think everything else [with Beebe's news release ] is fine," Hutchinson said.
Hutchinson said his firm, The Hutchinson Group, has a client who is a contractor at the program that was cut.
Beebe's news release said he was calling for the federal government to replenish an $ 8 million cut from the budget of the Clara Barton Center for Domestic Preparedness.
"The priorities at the Department of Homeland Security are the problem," Beebe said in the release. "Saving the center and the work it does would only take a tiny fraction of what has been wasted on insider deals and kickback contracts."
"We need to be telling people not to be cutting money for the Clara Barton program at the arsenal," Beebe said in an interview.
But a spokesman for the arsenal said the program Beebe cited wasn't the one that was cut.
"The Clara Barton Center is completely different [from the program that was cut ]," said Cheryl Avery, public affairs officer at the arsenal. "It has nothing to do with," the program cut, she said.
The Clara Barton Center no longer exists at the arsenal, she said. Someone else at the arsenal said the Barton Center has been closed about a year.
The program that was cut, Avery said, is the Domestic Preparedness Equipment Technical Assistance Program. It was cut from $ 13 million to $ 5 million in January and 49 people were laid off, she said.
That program helps emergency responders across the country regarding chemical, biological, nuclear and explosive disasters, she said.
Beebe referred questions to whether he had the wrong name to his campaign spokesman, Zac Wright, who said the news release was accurate. "The Clara Barton center is what houses" the program that was cut, he said.
Avery didn't immediately return a message regarding Wright's explanation.
Beebe's release cited $ 34 billion in combined contracts at Homeland Security that were questioned in a recent congressional report.
He said in an interview that the "insider deals and kick-back contracts" were referred to in that report.
But the report cited problems of waste and mismanagement.
"I'm not alleging any kickbacks," Beebe said. "If Â‘kickback' is an inappropriate word, we'll revise it."
Beebe said he wasn't making any criticisms of Hutchinson, a former undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
Avery said U. S. Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., is trying to get money restored for the program. Tracy Henke, the Homeland Security official responsible for the program, visited the arsenal Monday and met with representatives of the state's congressional delegation.
Hutchinson said his former chief of staff at Homeland Security, Betty Guhman, also met with Henke on Monday.
"One of the people that does work there we have a relationship with," Hutchinson said.
Hutchinson spokesman Dave Kinkade said the Hutchinson Group represents General Physics Corp. of Elk Ridge, Md., a company that does work on the program. He didn't know the amount of that contract.
Hutchinson said he didn't have anything to do with the cuts at the arsenal. He left the department in March 2005 to run for governor.
He said the overall disaster training program was cut by Congress as part of a Bush administration request, which he didn't fault because the administration is trying to reduce the federal deficit.
He said Congress will have to add the money to the program during the budget debate, which will continue in September. Then, it would be up to the department to add back the money cut in Pine Bluff. He said he had lunch with Henke to make a "good case" for the program.
Of Beebe, Hutchinson said, "He's wrong on his facts and he's wrong on his politics. It's an example of him sitting on the sidelines and pointing the finger and doing nothing while everybody else is pitching in and trying to get the funding restored."
Regarding "insider deals and kick-back contracts," Wright later cited things that weren't in the congressional report.
He pointed to a Federal Emergency Management Agency inspector pleading guilty to getting a $ 3, 000 kickback for inflating property damage estimates and a limousine company run by a felon that had $ 25 million in Homeland Security contracts.
