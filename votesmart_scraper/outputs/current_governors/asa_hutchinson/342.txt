Asa Hutchinson Statement On Funeral Protests
Statement From Asa On Military Funeral Protests In White County, Ark.
Asa issued the following statement today in response to protests at the funeral of a soldier, a native of Beebe, Ark., killed in Iraq:
"It's reprehensible that these protesters would make a spectacle of a soldier's funeral, at a time when family, friends and community should be allowed to honor the fallen. The men and women in uniform who sacrifice in service to our country deserve better than that, and their families are entitled to privacy and peace in their time of loss."
