Asa, Beebe Square Off On Rural Schools:
Mike Beebe puts out an education plan (finally!), but Asa notes that Beebe's work to shut down local schools serving rural and small towns puts him at odds with the educational interests of children in a rural state. "I don't think putting kids on buses for up to four hours and undermining local involvement by parents and communities is a positive vision for improving education in Arkansas," Hutchinson says.
