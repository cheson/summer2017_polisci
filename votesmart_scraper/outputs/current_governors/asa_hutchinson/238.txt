Governor Asa Hutchinson released the following statement upon final passage of HB1183, which fulfills his campaign promise to provide computer coding classes to all Arkansas high schools:
"I am very pleased that the General Assembly has passed my plan to offer computer-coding classes in high schools across the state. I especially want to thank Rep. Bill Gossage and Sen. Missy Irvin for their leadership in guiding it through the Legislature. By passing this bill, Arkansas will become a national leader in computer-science education, and we'll be preparing a workforce that's sure to attract businesses and jobs to our state.
"Of all the big-ticket items we've dealt with this legislative session, this relatively small-ticket item may have the greatest long-term impact."
