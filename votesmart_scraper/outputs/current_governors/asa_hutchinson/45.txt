Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson today announced the creation of the Transformation Advisory Board, another step toward transforming state government by identifying efficiencies and cost-savings to better serve the Arkansas taxpayer.
The Transformation Advisory Board will continue to examine the recommendations for potential efficiencies and cost-savings from a report by the Arkansas Policy Foundation released last year. In addition, the advisory board will also be charged with evaluating additional efficiencies within state government and prioritizing the state's plan of action for transformation.
The advisory board is a volunteer group of citizens from both the public and private sectors, who will make policy recommendations to the state's Chief Transformation Officer, Amy Fecher. No taxpayer money will be spent on the board. A full list of the advisory board members can be found HERE.
Governor Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"I am pleased to announce the creation of the Transformation Advisory Board. This advisory board will continue my administration's efforts in identifying potential efficiencies and cost-savings. Transformation is a key priority of mine, as Governor, and I will continue to maintain that focus as we look for better ways to run state government, reduce bureaucracy and increase the level of savings to the state and taxpayer."
Greg Kaza, Director of the Arkansas Policy Foundation, issued the following statement:
