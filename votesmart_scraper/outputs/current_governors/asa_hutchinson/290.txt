Asa supports raising Arkansas's minimum wage and he believes that raising the minimum wage should be addressed by the legislature at the earliest opportunity. As to an initial amount of a raise, Asa believes that a good starting place would be to increase the Arkansas minimum wage to match the current federal minimum wage of $7.25. Any further changes should take into account the strength of the economy and the economic indicators at that time.
