Asa Hutchinson Statement On Gay Foster Parenting
On Thursday, June 29, the Arkansas Supreme Court struck down a state ban on foster parenting in gay and lesbian households. Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement in response, expressing his disappointment in the court's decision and his commitment to seeking a legislative remedy in 2007:
"I disagree with the court's decision to override the judgment of the state's child welfare board. The children in need of foster care are coming out of difficult circumstances, ranging from child abuse to drug abuse. They need a stable home environment, and the decisions on placement should be based on what is best for the children. I will be reviewing the decision to see if there is an appropriate legislative response."
