Arkansas's curriculum standards should always reflect Arkansas values. The decision to move to the Common Core State Standards was done in a hasty and non-reflective manner and denied key stakeholders the opportunity to adequately determine if it was right for the students, parents, and business community of this state. I pledge to call for a full review of not only the standards but also the process by which we decide what we want our kids to know. I will include parents, board members, students, teachers, administrators and the business community in this review. If we conclude we don't want Common Core, we must be ready to decide what we do want kids to know for success in college or the workforce of the 21st Century.
As governor I will encourage Congress, and specifically the US Senate, to pass H.R. 5, The Student Success Act (http://edworkforce.house.gov/studentsuccessact/), which protects state autonomy and prevents the Washington bureaucracy from dictating education policy. Then the states will be truly free to create an education system that meets the needs of the states, and ALLOWS, not FORCES, the states to collaborate where appropriate.
As our campaign moves forward I will continue to share our ideas for a world-class education that provides high levels of learning for ALL students. Rest assured these ideas will be based on Arkansas values and will emphasize reading, writing, math and the technical skills needed for success in a 21st Century workforce.
