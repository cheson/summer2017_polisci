Location: Little Rock, AR

Nearly three months to the day after being elected, Governor Asa Hutchinson's campaign promise to cut $100 million dollars in taxes for the state's middle class is now a reality.
Governor Hutchinson released the following statement upon final passage of SB6, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2015, which would lower the income tax rate for middle class Arkansans:
"I want to thank the legislators for their diligent work in passing this tax cut for working Arkansans. I am especially grateful to the leadership of both houses for their efforts on this bill. They truly did the work of the people -- and the people of Arkansas will benefit.
"This is an encouraging first step in making Arkansas's income tax rates more competitive with surrounding states, which will only enhance our reputation as a state that is eager to attract and accommodate new jobs and businesses. Arkansas has been an island of high taxation for too long, and I'm pleased that we are doing something about that."
