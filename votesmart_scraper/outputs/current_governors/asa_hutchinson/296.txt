As a former National Director of the National School Shield Initiative sponsored by the NRA, Asa understands the importance of defending the 2nd Amendment rights guaranteed to us by the U.S. Constitution. The 2nd Amendment guards the right to use firearms for personal protection, for sporting and for hunting.
Open Carry (Act 746) - Although this question is likely to be decided by the courts, Asa believes that the law passed in 2013 by the Arkansas General Assembly is clear: carrying a weapon without the intent to commit a crime is legal. Asa supports open carry.
Endorsed by the NRA - Asa has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association.
