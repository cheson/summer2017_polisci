Embracing The New Economy
As part of his GROW ARKANSAS initiative, Asa has proposed redirecting state surplus funds currently used for a variety of local projects around the state and instead investing that money in jobs and education.
"We need to quit thinking in terms of short-term spending, and think more in terms of long-term investments that will lay the foundation for a thriving economy that will create more jobs and better-paying jobs," Hutchinson has noted in speeches around the state.
There is perhaps no more critical foundation to bringing more and better-paying jobs to Arkansas than investing in education -- building an educated workforce and laying the foundation for citizens to seize the high-wage opportunities emerging in the New Economy, including new job opportunities in the technology, information, and service industries.
To help prepare Arkansas workers for these emerging opportunities, Asa has proposed channeling some of the funds previously divvied up among local projects into the technology, research and development programs at the state's universities.
We are seeing remarkable work done all around this state - from groundbreaking aqua-research in Pine Bluff to nanotechnology in Fayetteville to research in developing bio-products from Arkansas's natural resources in Jonesboro.
With a greater state commitment to these priorities, Arkansas can help to create a more skilled and educated workforce, bring industry and capital to the state, and attract more federal research dollars to institutions of higher learning.
