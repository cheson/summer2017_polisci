Governor Asa Hutchinson has completed his one-year term as chair of the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) for the 2015-2016 year. Under Governor Hutchinson's leadership, computer science education became one of the central focuses for the SREB, which created the Commission on Computer Science and Information Technology. This commission, also chaired by Governor Hutchinson, was tasked with studying market demand for jobs requiring computer science degrees or certificates and providing recommendations to strengthen and expand computer science education in member states.
The commission is expected to release its findings in the near future. Governor Jon Bel Edwards of Louisiana will serve as chair for the 2016-2017 year.
Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"It has been my pleasure to serve as the Chair of the Southern Regional Education Board for the 2015-2016 year, and I want to congratulate Governor Edwards on his selection as chair for the 2016-2017 year," said Governor Hutchinson. "I am proud of the fact that Arkansas's computer science initiative served as a shining example for the SREB, specifically in the formation of the Commission on Computer Science and Information Technology, which will release its report soon. I have no doubt that the strides we have made in just the last year pushing for new and innovative ways to further computer science and STEM education will continue. Preparing our students for high-paying, in-demand careers in the computer science and IT fields is critically important to the future of our economy at home and abroad."
