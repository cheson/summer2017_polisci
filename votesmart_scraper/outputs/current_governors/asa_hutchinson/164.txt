I'm taping this radio address on the morning of Friday, September 11th. As a fellow American, I don't have to remind you what that date means.
And as Americans, we have a duty to remember what happened 14 years ago today.
To remember the lives that were lost.
To remember the first responders, the heroes who sacrificed for others.
To remember our brave servicemen and women who heeded the call of duty and fought for us on foreign soil.
And to remember where we were when the towers fell . As if anybody could ever forget.
I certainly remember that morning. I was then head of the DEA, and I had spent the previous night in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where I had participated in a debate on the issue of drug legalization at the University of New Mexico.
We were at the airport the next morning when everything happened.
We called back to headquarters. They wanted us back fast, but all the commercial flights were grounded, so a National Guard plane was sent to pick us up.
