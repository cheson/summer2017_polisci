Location: Little Rock, AR

Gov. Asa Hutchinson was named vice chair of the National Governors Association (NGA) Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee by NGA Chair Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and NGA Vice Chair Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe.
The Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee handles issues dealing with homeland security; the National Guard and homeland defense; criminal justice and public safety; and veterans affairs. Members of the committee ensure that the governors' views are represented in the shaping of federal policy.
Gov. Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"I look forward to serving on the NGA leadership team as Vice Chair of the Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee. With my background as the first Undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, helping the Bush administration get that agency off the ground and running effectively in the wake of 9/11, I believe I have much to offer.
"The tragedies of late across the country -- shootings that range from those at a Charleston, S.C., church to a recruiting center at Chattanooga, Tenn., to a movie theater in Lafayette, La. -- serve as a sober reminder that seeing to the security of our homeland and the public safety of our citizens is the most important thing we do as elected officials.
"I am eager to put my experience to work for this committee. As governors, we are uniquely positioned to influence federal legislation and regulations. This should be especially true when it comes to laws that affect the safety of our states and our nation."
