Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: April 3, 2017
Location: Little Rock, AR

With today's adjournment of the 91st General Assembly, Arkansas has concluded one of the state's most successful pro-growth and pro-business legislative sessions in recent history.
Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"Over the past 84 days the Arkansas General Assembly has worked hard to institute policies that make our state a better place to live, work and raise a family. I applaud the legislature's work this session to spur economic development, improve education and raise the quality of life for all Arkansans.
"Our successes this session will have a positive impact on the lives of all those we serve. I am glad that we avoided unnecessary battles and were able to focus our attention on the issues that matter most to Arkansans like improving education, lowering the tax burden and creating an environment that encourages job growth. I am pleased that we can close the 91st General Assembly as one of the most pro-growth legislative sessions in recent memory."
Gov. Hutchinson signed into law numerous proposals aimed at job creation and economic growth this session, including Act 165, which coupled with the state's computer science initiative, will bring financial technology start-ups to the state. Hutchinson also signed two tax relief bills into law earlier this year. Act 78 reduces the tax burden on individuals who make below $21,000 annually and Act 141 exempts military retirement pay from the state income tax.
In addition to signing Act 280 to establish a funding mechanism for natural gas infrastructure projects, Hutchinson also signed bills lowering Arkansas's soda tax and reducing sales tax on manufacturing machinery.
