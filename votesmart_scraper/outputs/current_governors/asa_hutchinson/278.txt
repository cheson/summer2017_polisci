Hutchinson: "There He Goes Again" on Congressman Mike Ross' Desperate & False Scare Conference
Press Release
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: Aug. 14, 2014
Location: Little Rock, AR

Longtime Democratic Congressman Mike Ross held the first attack press conference at his headquarters in Little Rock today, continuing his false attacks against his Republican opponent Asa Hutchinson in an attempt to scare Arkansas's senior citizens.
Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, there he goes again. For Mike Ross to read from the tired old Democratic playbook and use false attacks to scare our senior citizens is shameful and underestimates the people of Arkansas.
Mike Ross' most recent attack does not create one job in Arkansas and does nothing but mislead the voters. I have always supported a strong social security system and I have fought hard for our senior citizens and I will continue to do so as governor. If Mike Ross wants to make social security an issue he should run for congress. I am running for governor to create jobs and strengthen education."
