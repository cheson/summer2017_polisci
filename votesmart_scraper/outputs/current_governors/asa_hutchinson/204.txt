Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: May 28, 2015
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson's government efficiencies initiative (HB 1001 and SB 1) has passed both chambers of the Arkansas General Assembly with unanimous consent and will head to the Governor's desk for his signature. (See below for "Efficiencies Fact Sheet.")
Governor Hutchinson released the following statement upon final passage:
"I'm very pleased with the broad-based, bipartisan support for our efficiencies measures. It signals to the taxpayers of Arkansas that the executive and legislative branches of government are of one mind when it comes to finding smarter, more efficient ways to deliver services. It makes sense. If we can do a better job for the taxpayers at less cost, we should."
