Our veterans have sacrificed so much for us and they deserve our best. As governor, Asa will be an advocate for the nearly 250,000 veterans living in Arkansas. Asa previously served on the Veteran's Affairs Committee in Congress and was supportive of the development of out patient clinics for our veterans in Arkansas. Asa has also previously served as an attorney admitted to practice before the Court of Veteran's Appeals and has represented veterans in pursuing service connected disability claims. He understands the frustration of veterans in dealing with an overburdened and slow system of processing veterans claims.
