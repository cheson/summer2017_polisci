Asa Launches GROW ARKANSAS Statewide Jobs Tour
GOP Candidate Says More and Better-Payng Jobs For Arkansans Is Number One Priority
- Asa Hutchinson launched the GROW ARKANSAS Tour, saying that bringing more and better-paying jobs to Arkansas will be the number one issue for his campaign and the guiding focus of his administration as Arkansas Governor.
Hutchinson said that GROW stands for Growth, Reform, Opportunity and World Class Education -- all of which he described as key ingredients to bringing more and better-paying jobs to Arkansas.
"As I have traveled every part of the state, the first concern voiced by most folks is the need for more and better-paying jobs," Hutchinson said. "Young people want to know they can earn a living after graduation. Parents and grandparents want to know that their kids won't have to look outside the state for work. The primary focus of my administration will be to create an economy that offers opportunities for every Arkansan, regardless of his or her background."
Hutchinson asserted that success in growing Arkansas' economy depends upon a willingness to "think anew." He noted, for example, the need for reforms that would strengthen the state's educational system, and hold schools more accountable for results, as well as for reforms that would improve the current tax structure, which is one of the highest in the nation and is strangling economic growth and job creation in Arkansas.
During the course of the next few months, Hutchinson will hold forums and meetings in communities across the state to share his vision for Arkansas by outlining eight principles he believes are necessary to bring jobs to the state and drive economic growth in terms of personal income and state revenues.
