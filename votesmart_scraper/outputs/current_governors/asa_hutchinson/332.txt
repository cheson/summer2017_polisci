Benton, Ark. - Asa Hutchinson, the 2006 Republican candidate for Arkansas Governor, today laid out a six-point plan he would implement as Governor to fight the spread of methamphetamine and other dangerous drugs in Arkansas, including creating a Bureau of Drug Enforcement in the Arkansas State Police while also beefing up support for drug treatment courts.
Hutchinson, who led the national fight against illegal drugs as head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), emphasized the need to give state law enforcement the tools necessary to fight illegal drug traffic in the state, as well as the need for helping non-violent addicts get off drugs and return to the workforce.
"As a prosecutor and Congressman in Arkansas, and as head of the DEA, I've seen first-hand the kind of misery and damage meth and other dangerous drugs inflict on our communities and schools, on our youth and families," Hutchinson said. "As Governor, I'll reduce drug abuse in Arkansas by putting the dealers behind bars and helping non-violent victims of these drugs beat their addictions."
Hutchinson's plan for fighting illegal drugs adopts the balanced approach similar to the one he implemented at DEA and for which he received broad and bipartisan praise.
Specifically, Hutchinson's six-point plan includes strengthening the State Police's role in combating the drug trade by creating a Bureau of Drug Enforcement; expanding drug treatment courts and treatment options to help non-violent drug users beat their addictions; and strengthening partnerships between local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.
