Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: Aug. 11, 2015
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson announced the latest numbers regarding the state's computer science initiative as the new school year approaches. To date, more than 1,300 students have signed up for the Essentials of Computer Programming course through Virtual Arkansas -- a number Virtual Arkansas expects to grow. This summer alone, more than 130 teachers from all over the state have received training and professional development to teach computer science this year. The Arkansas Department of Education (ADE) will have full enrollment numbers for all courses, face-to-face and online, by mid-October.
As the Governor has stated previously, his goal within the next four years is to have 6,000 students taking computer coding classes each year, and, as the numbers suggest, we're well on our way.
Governor Hutchinson released the following statement:
"This is an exciting time in Arkansas education. Computer coding not only provides our students with an advantage over other states in the modern workplace, but the potential economic impact for Arkansas is limitless. If you're a high school student, and you haven't signed up for computer coding classes for this year, I want to personally encourage you to do so. Tell your counselor -- tell a teacher. Be part of history, and help Arkansas lead the nation in coding!"
