Asa: Expand State's Nuclear, Refining Might
By Wesley Brown, Arkansas News Bureau
LITTLE ROCK - To keep a campaign promise, Asa Hutchinson would have to attract the equivalent of a Toyota plant to Arkansas as governor.
However, odds are against the Republican gubernatorial candidate living up to the pledge he made last week that, if elected, he would seek to entice industry to build a new nuclear power plant or oil refinery in Arkansas. No U.S. president, much less a governor, has persuaded the private sector to invest in building a new nuclear plant or gasoline-conversion refinery in three decades.
The economic impact of such a project would be on par with an auto manufacturing plant, state economic development officials say, easily surpassing the requirements for superproject status set by public referendum in 2003 - a $500 million investment creating at least 500 jobs.
But Hutchinson said Arkansas needs to look at these "super-project" options because skyrocketing energy costs could reverse any economic gains the state experiences in the future.
"I have talked a lot about economic growth in this campaign. What could undermine any growth is the soaring cost of energy," Hutchinson said after a candidate forum sponsored by the Arkansas Farm Bureau. "This is not only a serious concern for our nation, but also for Arkansas. (High energy prices) really affect our rural economy."
