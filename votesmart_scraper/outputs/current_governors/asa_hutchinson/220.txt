Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson

Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement on the passing of former Arkansas Third District Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt:
"John Paul Hammerschmidt was an icon of Arkansas and Washington politics. For years, he was the lone Republican member of Arkansas's congressional delegation, representing the Third Congressional District for 13 terms. As such, he balanced his conservative convictions with a unique ability to work across party lines and accomplish great things for the people of Arkansas. His was the voice heard most clearly and often in the bipartisan effort to preserve the Buffalo as the first National River in the United States.
"Congressman Hammerschmidt was also a leader on transportation issues, helping to build Arkansas's roads and highways and making the state more competitive nationally. On a personal note, John Paul was a mentor of mine. I was privileged to hold his seat in Congress, and I called on his wise counsel and advice countless times. I will miss him greatly. The state has lost a true statesman and a good man."
