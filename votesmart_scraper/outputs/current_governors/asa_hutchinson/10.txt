From the day I took office in January 2015, one of my primary goals has been to cut out unnecessary government and to streamline the parts of government that are worth keeping. I want to transform Arkansas state government.
On Thursday, we launched a program we are confident will accelerate that transformation. I am confident this will succeed because we are tapping into the best resource available: the 3 million people who live in Arkansas.
We call this project MyIdea. MyIdea is a statewide high-tech suggestion box that allows anyone with an idea and access to a computer or a telephone to submit tips for trimming government or improving government service.
Some of the nation's most successful products were discovered in employee suggestion boxes, including 3M's Post-it notes and Amazon-dot-com's Prime membership program.
But MyIdea is not an employee suggestion box. It is for every citizen to make suggestions on how we can do better in state government.
To quote Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart: "There is only one boss. The customer. And he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else."
MyIdea gives you a direct line to tell us how we can improve the delivery of services for the customer.
The three-step process is simple: Go to the website, which is MyIdea.arkansas.gov.
