"I know further reform in health care is needed, and I look forward to working with our health care professionals and the legislature to determine what changes will be needed in the future. The reforms I will advocate will reflect those needed changes while balancing the need for a stable budget." - Asa Hutchinson
Obamacare - Asa has consistently opposed Obamacare from day one and will continue to do so. It is a terrible job killing policy that is fatally flawed and it should be repealed.
Private Option - Asa has consistently said that the issue of the Private Option should have been handled in a special session because Obamacare is changing on almost a daily basis. Ultimately, Asa would have designed the health care plan for Arkansas differently. But as governor, Asa will inherit the decisions the governor and General Assembly made in the fiscal session.
Medical Marijuana - Until the medical community has a consensus in favor of medical marijuana, Asa does not support efforts to legalize marijuana for medical use without a prescription.
