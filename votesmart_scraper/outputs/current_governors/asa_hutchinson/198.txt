Governor Asa Hutchinson today announced that Elizabeth Thomas Smith, currently the administration's chief legal counsel, will become the state's next Medicaid Inspector General.
"Given her background in healthcare law and as a former prosecutor, Elizabeth is a perfect fit as the next Medicaid Inspector General," Governor Hutchinson said. "She has been an invaluable member of our team as my legal counsel, and I know she will do a great job in her new role, which is critical to Arkansas."
"I'm honored and appreciative of the trust the Governor has placed in me," Smith said. "It's been a privilege to serve as his legal counsel, and I am eager to take on this new challenge to best serve the people of Arkansas."
Smith has more than two decades of experience practicing law, including more than 15 years combined as a prosecutor and later as associate general counsel for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Smith served as deputy prosecuting attorney under Larry Jegley for the 6th Judicial District. She also served as an assistant attorney general of Arkansas under Mike Beebe and with the firm of Mitchell Williams Selig Gates and Woodyard, specializing in healthcare.
The office of the Medicaid Inspector General, created in 2013, prevents, detects and investigates fraud and abuse within the medical assistance program.
