Governor Asa Hutchinson today announced that Duncan Baird will fill the position of State Budget Administrator at the Department of Finance and Administration.
"I appreciate Duncan's work as we crafted our first budget and worked with the legislature to enact it into law," Hutchinson said. "In his new role, he'll continue to play a critical part in both the budget process and our efforts to reform state government."
"Duncan's experience as Budget Director and his previous work with the budget as a legislator make him a great fit for this position," said Larry Walther, Director of the Department of Finance and Administration.
"It's been an honor to be a part of the Governor's staff through the transition and the Regular Session," Baird said. "I look forward to the opportunity to put my budget experience to work as part of the team at DFA."
Baird was as a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 2009 until he was term-limited in 2015, where he served as the House chairman of the Joint Budget Committee. Before being elected to the legislature, Baird was in the investment industry, working as a licensed securities trader for Arvest bank in Northwest Arkansas. He holds a degree in Finance and Accounting from the University of Arkansas.
