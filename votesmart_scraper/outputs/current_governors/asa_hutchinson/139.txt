At an event today in Charleston, Governor Asa Hutchinson provided an update on the progress of the state's foster care system. "There's plenty of work to do to address the foster care crisis in our state, but we are taking the right steps," said Hutchinson to those in attendance at the dedication of the Maggie House, one of the many faith-based organizations that are stepping up to fill a critical need. "I am optimistic about the progress we are making to improve foster care services in Arkansas."
Governor Hutchinson issued an additional statement below following the dedication:
"Following my Restore Hope Summit, real efforts have been made by the public and private sectors to improve our foster care system. Since August, the state has increased its number of foster homes by 109 and increased its number of available beds for children by 232. We are making progress, but we must do better. The Division of Children and Family Services has made several procedural improvements and has expanded its statewide partnerships. In addition, DCFS has successfully eliminated the backlog of more than 1,200 foster parent inquiries. This is a good start, but there is still more to be done.
"In November alone, there have been more than 50 foster family homes opened, which brings our statewide total to 1,385. Small things matter, and as a state, we are heading in the right direction. It is up to us to help our children start their lives on the right track, and I want to do everything possible to ensure we are providing them with every opportunity for success."
