"Our hearts break at the news of another senseless act of violence and terror, this time out of Chattanooga," Governor Hutchinson said. "Our prayers go out to all the families of the victims, especially the family of Staff Sgt. David Wyatt of Russellville, one of Arkansas's own.
"I want to join in those who are calling for greater security at our recruiting stations and military installations. We've had numerous instances of attacks. Clearly they are a target, and for us to have unarmed military personnel makes no sense, which is why I am directing Major General Mark Berry to arm full-time personnel as he deems necessary at military installations."
