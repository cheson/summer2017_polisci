Crime - As a former U.S. Attorney appointed by President Ronald Reagan, Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Under Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, appointed by President George W. Bush, Asa has always strongly supported law enforcement. As governor, they will have Asa's support. We must ensure that our citizens enjoy safe neighborhoods and communities.
Death Penalty - As a former federal prosecutor, Asa understands that there are certain heinous crimes that justify the use of the death penalty. Asa supports the death penalty when there are sufficient aggravating circumstances that justify the ultimate punishment.
Act 570 - Asa recognizes the need to make adjustments to Act 570 in order to give prosecutors more flexibility in prosecuting property and drug crimes.
Parole Reform - There are serious problems with Arkansas's parole system. Asa will fight to improve the way that we hold our parolees accountable and also to improve our reentry program so that ex offenders have the best chance to successfully reenter society and return to being a productive and tax paying citizen.
Illegal Drugs - Asa is opposed to the legalization of marijuana and other currently illegal drugs
