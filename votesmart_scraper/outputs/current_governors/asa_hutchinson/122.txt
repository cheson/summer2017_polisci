SIG Sauer will open a new premium ammunition manufacturing facility that employs more than 50 people in Jacksonville and Remington Outdoor Company will add 84 new jobs at the ammunition manufacturing facility in Lonoke.

A news release for each project is below:
Governor Hutchinson announces SIG SAUER to open manufacturing facility in Jacksonville
Company to create approximately 50 new jobs
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson today announced SIG SAUER, a manufacturer of premium ammunition, is finalizing plans to locate a new ammunition manufacturing facility in an existing building in Jacksonville, Arkansas, where it anticipates creating about 50 new jobs.
The company's plans were announced today in Las Vegas at the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show (SHOT Show).
SIG SAUER was one of the six prospective companies Governor Hutchinson called on his first day in office. Hutchinson is the first Arkansas governor to attend the SHOT Show.
"Firearms and ammunition is a growing industry, and we came to Las Vegas to share the many reasons Arkansas is a natural fit for this sector," said Governor Hutchinson. "SIG SAUER was one of the first calls I made as Governor, and I am delighted they chose our state when making the decision to expand. The fact that a world-class company like SIG SAUER is choosing to do business in the state adds to our momentum in manufacturing and we appreciate this significant commitment they are making to locate in Arkansas."
