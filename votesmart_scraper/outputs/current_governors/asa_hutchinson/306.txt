"My dad was a farmer and it was on our farm near Gravette that I learned the importance of hard work, discipline and caring for the land. I was an active member of 4-H and Arkansas farm values have guided me all my life." - Asa Hutchinson
Importance of Agriculture -- Asa understands the importance of agriculture to our economy in Arkansas. Whether cotton, soybeans or rice, our commodity row crop farmers are national leaders in production and world exports. In addition, family cattle, horse or poultry farms have been the lifeblood of many of our farmers for generations. Arkansas's berry farms are also a successful part of farm operations across the state.
Research - Agricultural research will continue to be a state priority in order to assist our farmers in the latest technologies and conservation best practices. Asa fully supports the agricultural research programs at our major universities and various marketing programs.
Exports - While in Congress, Asa supported expanding markets worldwide for Arkansas farm commodities and Asa will continue to do so as Governor. In Arkansas, our farmers are efficient and have the latest technologies. We produce far more than we consume and we must compete in the global marketplace to protect our agricultural economy in Arkansas.
Small Farms - Whether a berry farm, cattle, poultry or horse operation, small farms in Arkansas provide a livelihood and wonderful quality of life for many families. Asa supports the continued research work of the Dale Bumpers Small Farms Research Center in Booneville. Asa also understands the need for disease control for our livestock and farms.
