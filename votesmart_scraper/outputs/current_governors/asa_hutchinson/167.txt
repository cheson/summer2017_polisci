Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: Sept. 1, 2015
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson joined Dr. Brett Powell, Director of the Arkansas Department of Higher Education (ADHE), today to announce the "Closing the Gap 2020: A Master Plan for Arkansas Higher Education." This draft plan focuses on six key points, including: (1) Closing the educational attainment gap; (2) Improving college readiness of students; (3) Reducing remedial education enrollments; (4) Concentrating efforts on adults and underserved populations; (5) Improving college affordability through reduced time to degree and institutional efficiencies; and (6) Directing state resources toward achievement of these goals.
This objective and draft of proposed goals, which can be found HERE, provides a starting point to determine and address challenging yet achievable goals for improving Arkansas's higher education. A final master plan will be released at the end of October.
Governor Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"If you look at the data, adults in Arkansas who don't get any education beyond high school don't get ahead. If we hope to grow our economy, attract jobs and businesses and improve the quality of life in our state, we have to address this. I'm pleased that Dr. Powell has set some ambitious goals to bridge the educational attainment gap in Arkansas, and I know he'll work together with our higher education institutions to determine the best way to meet those goals."
