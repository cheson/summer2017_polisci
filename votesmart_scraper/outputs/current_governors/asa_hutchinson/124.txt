Governor Asa Hutchinson today announced his support of the Employment First initiative which supports the hiring and retention of individuals with disabilities in state jobs. A memorandum calling state agencies to action has been issued by Governor Hutchinson which outlines specific goals and timetable for implementation. Arkansas has one of the nation's highest disabled populations.
Governor Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"I am pleased to take on this vital initiative to help support our Arkansans with disabilities by allowing them increased opportunities to attain and maintain employment. Although legislative strides have been made to support individuals with disabilities seeking employment without losing vital healthcare benefits, there is still more to be done. Individuals with disabilities are underutilized in our workforce and I am calling on our state's agencies to lead this important effort by example."
