Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: Nov. 6, 2015
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson and Arkansas Economic Development Commission (AEDC) Executive Director Mike Preston will travel to Japan and China November 15-24 on a business recruitment trip.
The purpose of the trip is to meet with prospective companies considering locating or expanding in the United States. In addition to meeting new prospects, Governor Hutchinson and Mr. Preston will also meet with representatives of companies that already have a presence in Arkansas.
"In order to demonstrate Arkansas' interest in Japanese and Chinese companies considering investing in the United States, it is important we meet face to face with leaders of these companies," Governor Hutchinson said. "Through this trip, we will build new relationships while ensuring those companies headquartered in Asia that already do business in the state have what they need to stay and grow in Arkansas."
