"My number one priority is economic growth and job creation in Arkansas. I commit to the people of Arkansas three things as their governor: I will maintain a balanced budget; I will ensure that we continue our commitment to a world-class education and together we will create stronger job growth. Across the board tax reduction and being more competitive in our tax structure is a key part of job growth." - Asa Hutchinson
Asa's number one priority as governor will be job creation. One way to spur job growth is through tax reduction and Asa is committed to providing across the board tax relief to all Arkansans. Asa will start this tax relief with the middle income wage earners and his goal is to gradually reduce the income tax for all Arkansans. Tax cuts are an effective method to spur economic growth and create jobs, and Arkansans are long overdue for income tax relief.
Tax Plan - To become more competitive, Asa proposes to reduce income taxes on those earning between $20,400 and $75,000. This will not only help Arkansas's middle-income families, it will also make Arkansas more attractive for businesses to locate and stay in Arkansas.
