Gov. Hutchinson Responds Potential Cuts to Foster Care System if Arkansas Works Funding Not Passed

Governor Asa Hutchinson warns that if Arkansas Works funding is not passed, a $10.9 million funding cut to the state's foster care system is possible as indicated by the House's proposed alternative budget released today.
In order to achieve a $10.9 million reduction, the Department of Human Services (DHS) would be forced to cut the current number of Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS) staff by approximately 255 positions -- 168 caseworkers and investigators, 31 supervisors and 56 program assistants. Those cuts would cause average caseloads to go from 29 to 48.
It's important to note that DCFS was sued in the early 1990s, in part because of the high caseloads. That suit resulted in the state being under court-ordered monitoring for several years.
