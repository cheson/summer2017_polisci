Gov. Hutchinson's Statement on Amazon's Decision to Collect Sales Tax in Arkansas Starting in March
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: Feb. 10, 2017
Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement in response to Amazon's announcement that the Seattle-based company will begin collecting sales tax in Arkansas beginning in March:
"The announcement from Amazon to start the sales tax collection for Arkansas in March is laudable and good news for the state. Arkansas will join the other 38 states in which Amazon is collecting and remitting sales tax. This step by Amazon has been voluntary and reflects the new landscape in which retailers recognize the practicality and fairness of sales tax being treated equally between online sales and in person store sales. This decision also shifts the responsibility of sales tax payment from the customer to the retailer at the time of checkout--providing further clarity and efficiency to the current and often misunderstood Arkansas law.
"As everyone knows, lowering our state's income tax rate has been a priority of mine from day one. This strengthened revenue stream will allow us to continue to make progress in cutting the income tax rate, making Arkansas more competitive with our surrounding states, and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking Arkansans."
