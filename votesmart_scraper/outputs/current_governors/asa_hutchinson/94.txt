Governor Announces Statewide Initiative to Increase Access for Computer Science and STEM Careers
Press Release
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: June 15, 2016
Location: Little Rock, AR

Today, Governor Asa Hutchinson announced the Learning Blade initiative, supported through a $400,000 grant from the Arkansas Department of Education to the Arkansas Public School Resource Center, to increase student awareness and interest in computer science and STEM careers.
Learning Blade challenges students to take on game-based projects that expose them to different aspects of science, technology, engineering, and math education -- commonly referred to as STEM. Arkansas is the second state to implement Learning Blade statewide and, at the Governor's request, Arkansas is the first ever state to deploy Learning Blade with a computer coding aspect.
In the program, students are taught computer science skills through engaging academic exercises. Lessons are self-guided, allowing students to work on STEM-based activities at their own pace in the classroom or during after-school programs at no cost to Arkansas's middle schools. The program will be implemented across Arkansas beginning in the 2016-2017 school year.
Governor Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"The Learning Blade's focus on STEM education will offer Arkansas's students new and exciting opportunities to learn real-world computer science concepts. This program will help our young learners master the fundamentals required for an array of specialized and highly-competitive STEM careers.
"This effort, along with my computer science initiative, is putting Arkansas's students in an even better position to land tech-driven jobs. As the computer coding movement in Arkansas continues to gain momentum, I look forward to even greater numbers of students taking on the skills needed for these challenging and rewarding fields."
