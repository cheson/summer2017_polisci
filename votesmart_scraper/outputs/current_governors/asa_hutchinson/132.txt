The holiday season is a magical time of year. Christmas brings back fond memories and helps us create new ones we treasure with family and friends.
Susan and I love getting ready for Christmas. She enjoys decorating our home with "pretty things," as she calls them, putting up everything from brightly-lit Christmas trees to singing reindeer. But even the most beautiful decorations can't compare with spending time with our families. Nothing beats celebrating the holidays with our children and grandchildren. And each year, the greatest gift we receive by far is simply being together.
Everyone has their own special holiday traditions. At the beginning of the Hanukkah season, I had the privilege of being the first governor to light the first candle of the Little Rock Chabad Menorah. The Menorah Lighting Ceremony was a humbling experience. Lighting the first candle was a bright reminder that it only takes one small light to illuminate the darkness.
I also had an opportunity last week to host the "Christmas at the Capitol" event where we collected gifts for our state's foster children. I want to personally thank everyone who took the time to donate a Christmas gift. It's a simple gesture, but it will make more of an impact than you'll ever know. After all, giving is a big part of what Christmas is all about. Wherever you go and whatever you do this holiday season, make it a priority to give back to someone else.
Take advantage of every opportunity to make a difference in someone's life this holiday season. Cherish this time with your family, give back to others and share the joy of the season wherever you go.
God bless, and Merry Christmas.
