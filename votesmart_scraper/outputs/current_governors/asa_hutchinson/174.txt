Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: Aug. 4, 2015
Location: Little Rock, AR

As a result of the hiring freeze implemented at the direction of Governor Asa Hutchinson, the state has saved $2.5 million in salaries in the last half of Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 from January 13, 2015 to June 30, 2015. To date, there are 297 fewer state employees as a result of the freeze. Each position, on average, was frozen for 59 days. Currently, 433 freeze requests are pending a response from the Governor's office.
Governor Hutchinson released the following statement:
"We want to be good stewards of the taxpayers' money, and this is an example of carrying out that philosophy. My first act on my first day in office was to institute a hiring freeze so that we could be more efficient and prudent in how we staffed state government.
"Instead of just filling open vacancies because government had in the past, I wanted my agency directors to determine whether we still needed these positions. In some cases, we did not. In other cases, we restructured to make better use of our personnel and public money. The end result is a savings so far of some $2.5 million. Small things matter -- and small things add up quickly."
