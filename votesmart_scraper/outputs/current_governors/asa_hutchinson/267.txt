Republican gubernatorial nominee Asa Hutchinson has received the official endorsement of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. The two long-time friends met Thursday morning before holding a news conference with members of the Arkansas media at the Republican Party of Arkansas.
Governor Huckabee released this statement following the news conference:
"This is an exciting time in Arkansas politics, and this election means a great deal in moving our state forward, which is why I am supporting my good friend Asa Hutchinson in his bid to become the next governor of our great state.
"While his opponent continues to run a negative campaign and throw out empty promises without explaining how he plans on paying for them, Asa remains focused on job creation, economic growth and improving education for our students across the state.
"I know the pressures of being governor and I know the next governor will face tough decisions on day one. There's only one candidate in this race with both the experience and resume who's equipped to deal with these issues, and that's Asa."
Asa Hutchinson released this statement following the news conference:
"One of my great sources of pride in politics is that I helped recruit Mike to run for state office. As governor, he provided a model in promoting our state's tourism industry and his work preserving our natural heritage has made a long-term difference in our state.
"His leadership has continued to help influence the culture, debate, and direction of our party, even after his time as Governor. Mike Huckabee knows what's at stake in this election, and I'm honored to have my good friend's support as we head into November."
