Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson

Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson announced today an organizational review of the Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS). The effort will be led by Lt. Governor Tim Griffin.
As part of the review, Governor Hutchinson has asked Lt. Governor Griffin to assess the organizational structure of DHS and look at any duplicative services. The review will also include identifying ways to achieve greater efficiencies and areas needing to be strengthened if they currently lack sufficient resources.
The timeline for completion of the DHS organizational review is set for March 1, 2016, as the new DHS director assumes his role. The project does not include a review of the IT structure or contracts. Those areas will be reviewed separately by the Governor's Office and the legislature.
Governor Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"As we continue the search for the next director of DHS, it's important we take a look at the organizational structure to achieve any new possible efficiencies. I have asked the Lieutenant Governor to lead this effort, because I know he will conduct a substantive review of the department at this critical time and will do so with integrity and the due diligence needed."
