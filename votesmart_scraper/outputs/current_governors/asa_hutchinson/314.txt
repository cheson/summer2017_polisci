Press Release - Asa Lays Out Contrasts In Little Rock Debate
GOP Candidate Lays Out Differences On Immigration, Gay Foster Care, and Other Issues
Asa Hutchinson, the 2006 Republican nominee for Governor, said tonight that there are clear contrasts between him and his opponent when it comes to showing leadership and laying out clear plans for the future of Arkansas.
Hutchinson and Beebe squared off in Little Rock for their third and final debate in the Governor's race at the Clinton Presidential Center before a crowd of about 250 people. The questions focused on a wide range of issues, including education, health care, the use of the Governor's clemency powers and fighting illegal immigration and drugs.
To address the problem of illegal immigration in Arkansas, Hutchinson discussed his four-point plan for giving the state a stronger role in fighting illegal immigration by training state police to enforce the law, cracking down on hiring of illegals and cracking down on document fraud. Beebe criticized Hutchinson's plan, arguing that "the bulk of the responsibility" for immigration enforcement is on the federal government.
"What you have just heard is no solution," Hutchinson said of Beebe's response. "He has not offered a plan. I have presented a specific plan. It is matter of leadership. I think leadership is about solutions and not casting blame."
Hutchinson was blunt in his assessment of Beebe's stance.
"You don't understand immigration enforcement at all," Hutchinson said. "Don't mischaracterize it, misrepresent it, or make light of a solution when you offer no solution to this problem."
Hutchinson also criticized Beebe's plans for fighting meth as incomplete after Beebe noted that as Attorney General, he supported legislation to move cold tablets, a common ingredient in meth, behind sales counters. Hutchinson noted the vast majority of meth - 70 percent - comes from outside Arkansas borders.
"Mr. Beebe has just presented a 30 percent solution," Hutchinson said. "He has no solution that he has addressed for the 70 percent of the problem. I have
addressed that" through proposals to create an Arkansas Bureau of Drug Enforcement and expand drug treatment courts in Arkansas to get non-violent offenders off drugs and back into the workforce.
Hutchinson also noted that Beebe "dropped the ball" in failing to step up to defend Arkansas values when the ACLU challenged a state agency's ban on gay foster care.
"He refused to step in" to defend the state in the case, Hutchinson said. "I believe that is dropping the ball."
In a question about divorce rates, the candidates debated the issue of covenant marriage, with Hutchinson calling the arrangement an excellent program for strengthening marriage in Arkansas. He emphasized the value of covenant marriage for young couples.
"It helps send a signal to our young people that marriage is serious," Hutchinson said. "It's a way for couples to reinforce their vows."
Hutchinson noted that, as a state Senator, Beebe voted against the covenant marriage act, and said that Beebe was wrong to have done so.
The candidates were also asked about how they would use the Governor's clemency powers for convicted felons, and Hutchinson emphasized that these powers should be used sparingly, with deference to the jury system and with full notification of crime victims and law enforcement.
"I've been a federal prosecutor. I've put people in jail, I've prosecuted terrorists, I understand what it is for a jury to agonize over a life and death decision," Hutchinson said. "I've heard confessions in the courtroom. And I say, Â‘God will forgive you, but there is accountability, and that is our system of justice."
In his opening statement, Hutchinson noted that Beebe has attacked his record of service at the Department of Homeland Security in recent television ads and defended his service at the national level.
"I believe that public service is not about taking the easy path, but about taking on the hard missions of life," Hutchinson said. "He has attacked my national service. That's fine - leaders understand that goes with the turf. I've been in the arena, not on the sidelines."
