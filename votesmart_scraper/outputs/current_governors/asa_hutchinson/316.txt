Asa Calls For Education Reform
Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement today in response to the release of the Arkansas Supreme Court's Special Masters' report on education, which suggested that the state needs to make further progress in improving public schooling:
"I have said repeatedly that we cannot solve the educational challenges we face in Arkansas by simply spending more and more money to solve the problem," Asa said. "We must be bold and look at genuine reform - whether we're talking about greater school choice, greater accountability and transparency, or making better use of new technologies.
"However, we must also set priorities for our state's limited budget," he continued. "Our legislators did not set the right priorities when they decided to fund dozens of pet projects all across the state while not providing for cost-of-living increases to help our schools keep up with rising costs. They showed the wrong priorities whenever they funded increases for themselves, but failed to provide adequate funding for new education mandates they put on our schools. My hope is that this report will help establish those priorities with greater clarity and foresight for the future."
