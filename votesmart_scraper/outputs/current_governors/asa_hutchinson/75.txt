Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson
Date: Sept. 12, 2016
Location: Little Rock, AR

Today, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, alongside Arkansas Surgeon General Dr. Greg Bledsoe, Arkansas Dept. of Health Director Dr. Nate Smith and other members of the medical community, including Dr. Rick Smith, Psychiatrist and Addiction Specialist at the University of Arkansas for Medical Science, spoke out against the marijuana ballot proposals. Those organizations include, among others: Arkansas Medical Society; Arkansas Hospital Association; Family Physician Association; Pharmacy Association; UAMS; Arkansas Children's Hospital; Arkansas Center for Health Improvement (ACHI); Arkansas Department of Health (ADH); and Arkansas Heart Hospital.
Governor Hutchinson issued the following statement:
"As you know, I have expressed my opposition to the two marijuana ballot initiatives based on a number of concerns, but today, the focus is on the primary concern. The initiatives do not lead to good medical practice and is not best for patients. Those who stand with me today are in the medical profession because they care and they want the best for their patients. If there is new medicine or a new product to alleviate suffering they want it available.
"We all want those who are ill or suffering to have the right kind of medicine, but there is a reason we have an FDA approval process for new medicines. We don't vote on cancer cures and we should not set a new pattern of determining what is good medicine at the ballot box."
