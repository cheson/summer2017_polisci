Governor Asa Hutchinson Issues Statement on Same-Sex Marriage Ruling
Statement
By: Asa Hutchinson

Location: Little Rock, AR

Governor Asa Hutchinson released the statement below following the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage:
"Today the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision requires the State of Arkansas to recognize same-sex marriage. This decision goes against the expressed view of Arkansans and my personal beliefs and convictions. While my personal convictions will not change, as Governor I recognize the responsibility of the state to follow the direction of the U.S. Supreme Court. As a result of this ruling, I will direct all state agencies to comply with the decision.
"It is also important to note that the Supreme Court decision is directed at the states to allow and recognize marriage between two people of the same sex. It is not a directive for churches or pastors to recognize same-sex marriage. The decision for churches, pastors and individuals is a choice that should be left to the convictions of conscience."
