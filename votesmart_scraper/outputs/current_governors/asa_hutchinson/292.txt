Regulatory - The constantly changing regulations from federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency are a burden to agriculture, energy and manufacturing producers in Arkansas. Asa stands for responsible stewardship of Arkansas's natural resources and beauty but also knows that the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality can provide a greater balance between protecting our environment and our need for economic growth.
Affordable Care Act - Asa has consistently opposed Obamacare from day one and will continue to do so. It is a terrible job killing policy that is fatally flawed and it should be repealed and replaced with a health care system that is not totally defined by the federal government
