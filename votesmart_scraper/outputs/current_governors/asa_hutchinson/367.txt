Asa: 'Look Forward' On Education Reform
Asa Hutchinson issued the following statement today in response to the release of the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision ordering the state to address remaining problems in the public school system by December 2006:
"Despite my belief that the court should not re-enter this case, I'm pleased that the court has shown restraint and given the Governor and the legislature maximum flexibility to address the challenges faced by our public schools.
"The decision states the obvious. The state failed to explain in court proceedings why the $5,400 per pupil funding wasn't increased to keep pace with inflation; why an interim report on adequacy wasn't provided to the legislature; and how the amount for facilities funding was determined.
"But it's time to look forward. I'm confident we can continue building on the progress our state has made in recent years, but only if we continue on the path of reform. We simply can't continue to do the same old thing - judging progress by how much money is being spent - when it produces the same old results.
"It's critical that we bring new thinking to the debate on education reform. I'm pleased that the court has given the state broad discretion to determine how best to achieve that for our students."
