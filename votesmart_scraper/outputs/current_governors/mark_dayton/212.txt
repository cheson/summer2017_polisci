Statement

Location: St. Paul, MN

Lt. Governor Tina Smith and Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman joined seniors at the State Fair today to urge Minnesotans to protect themselves against phone scams by "hanging up on fraud." Lt. Governor Smith also presented Governor Dayton's proclamation declaring "Fraud Awareness and Prevention Day" in Minnesota.
Lt. Governor Smith and Commissioner Rothman also met with members of the AARP Minnesota Fraud Fighters, who are trained volunteers who help educate their fellow seniors about scams and fraud.
"Prevention is the best defense against fraud," said Lt. Governor Smith. "And the best way to prevent fraud is to avoid getting drawn into a scam to begin with, whether it comes your way on the phone, online or one your front doorstep. We are working with AARP and the Better a Business Bureau to give Minnesotans common sense tips for avoiding troublemakers to begin with."
