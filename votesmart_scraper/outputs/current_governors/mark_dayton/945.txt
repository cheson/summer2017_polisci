Dayton: Bush Administration is More Concerned with Protecting Big Business than Protecting Public Health
U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today criticized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for ignoring scientific evidence and regulatory requirements when setting limits on mercury pollution. The EPA's inspector general - the agency's internal watchdog - released a report late last week which indicated that Bush Administration officials instructed agency staff to set only modest limits on mercury pollution and to understate the degree to which emissions could reasonably be reduced.
"Minnesota is one of 48 states which has issued a fish consumption advisory for mercury," said Dayton. "Mercury is highly toxic, and once it reaches our waterways, it builds up in the fish we eat. It is shameful that this Administration continues to ignore scientific facts, and instead allows mercury pollution to jeopardize our health and way of life in Minnesota."
Dayton has been a longtime advocate of reducing mercury emissions. Last year, Dayton led a bipartisan group of 45 senators in sending a letter to EPA Administrator Michael Leavitt urging him to withdraw the mercury proposal and re-propose something stronger.
It is expected that the EPA will release the final mercury rule next month.
