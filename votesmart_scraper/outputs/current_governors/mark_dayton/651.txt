Governor Mark Dayton today sent a letter to Legislative Leadership, calling for action to stop the delay of tax refund payments to Minnesota businesses as a budget-balancing tool. The Legislature enacted this delay of $150 million in tax refunds during the 2010 legislative session.

In the letter, the Governor urges legislators to "act now to return this capital to businesses and help put more Minnesotans to work." The Governor has directed the Minnesota Department of Revenue to assist in drafting the necessary language to achieve this repeal, and requests that it be included as part of the adoption of federal tax conformity.

The Governor's letter notes that the repeal of the tax refund delay will have no impact on the state's budget deficit for FY 2012-13, and is no longer needed for cash flow management purposes.
