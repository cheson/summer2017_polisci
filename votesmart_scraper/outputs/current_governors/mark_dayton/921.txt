Dayton Joins with Senate Democrats in Fight to Protect Social Security from Benefit Cuts
Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Mark Dayton joined with Senate Democrats in supporting several Social Security amendments which call on Congress to reject any Social Security proposal that will deeply cut benefits or increase our national debt.
The budget plan submitted to Congress by the Bush Administration proposes making tax cuts for the wealthy permanent, despite a record national debt, and does not include the President's $2 trillion Social Security privatization plan.
"Social Security is far too important to those depending on it and to those who will need it in the future for Congress to make a hasty decision," said Dayton. "This Congress needs to put its priorities in order. Instead of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, we should be focusing on finding a way to secure Social Security benefits for future generations.
"The President's proposal to Â‘fix' Social Security would result in drastically reduced benefits for a majority of future retirees, and would add trillions to our national debt. As we are already in the midst of a $412 billion federal deficit, such a "solution" is simply unacceptable."
