Dayton Calls for Action to Curb Global Warming
U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today joined with a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues, led by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), to reintroduce legislation which would curb greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation, transportation, industry, and commerce, and would create a market for individual companies to trade pollution credits. The legislation, the Climate Stewardship Act, crafted in close consultation with industry leaders and supported by the environmental community, would require, by the year 2010, a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions to the level of 2000. According to a United Nations study, every ton of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere costs each American up to $160 - and the United States is currently emitting billions of tons each year.
"Last year, my older son Eric, traveled to the Arctic with world-renowned explorer, Will Steger, and a team of environmental experts on a six-month polar expedition to study global warming," said Dayton. "During their 155-day trek, the explorers saw firsthand evidence of receding ice packs and other significant environmental damage being done by global warming.
"I commend Senators McCain and Lieberman for introducing this important legislation, which we must pass in order to preserve our precious natural resources for future generations."
