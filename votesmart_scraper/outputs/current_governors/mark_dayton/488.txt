Press Release

Location: St. Paul, MN

Today, Governor Mark Dayton recognized the 19 Minnesota athletes preparing to compete in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games. Governor Dayton issued a proclamation today declaring February 7, 2014, to be Minnesota Winter Olympians Day, and called on all Minnesotans to support our athletes at the Winter Games1.
"I am one of many Minnesotans, who grew up dreaming of making the U.S. Olympic team. Few athletes, however, have the exceptional talent and extraordinary dedication needed to reach this sports zenith," said Governor Dayton. "For all Minnesotans, I send our state's Olympians our heartiest congratulations for their amazing achievements. We are proud to send our very best wishes to Minnesota's athletes and to the entire Team USA."
Minnesotans have a proud tradition of representing the United States at the Winter Olympics. This year is no exception, with 19 Minnesotans representing the United States in a variety of competitions at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. This is more than all neighboring states combined, and ties Minnesota for the second-most Winter Olympians of any state in the nation, behind only California (a state with more than 38 million residents).
