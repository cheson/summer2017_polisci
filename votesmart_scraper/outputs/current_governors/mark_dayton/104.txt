Today, Governor Mark Dayton issued a proclamation declaring the month of July to be "Hire a Veteran Month" in Minnesota. Governor Dayton and Lt. Governor Tina Smith encourage all Minnesota employers to help connect military service members with employment opportunities during the month of July, and to continue hiring veterans throughout the year. As part of "Hire a Veteran Month," the Governor and Lt. Governor also encourage members of the military and Minnesota veterans to participate in the state's largest Veterans Career Fair being held July 13, 2016, in Brooklyn Center.

"Hiring a veteran is one of the best investments a business can make," said Governor Dayton. "Veterans have the skills Minnesota employers need including leadership, intelligence, and dedication. They also have demonstrated their abilities to perform under challenging conditions."

"Minnesotans are grateful for the service of the nearly 400,000 veterans who live here. The State of Minnesota offers a variety of employment and educational services to help veterans find good jobs," said Lt. Governor Smith. "I encourage all Minnesota veterans to take advantage of these resources during "Hire a Veteran Month' and throughout the year."
