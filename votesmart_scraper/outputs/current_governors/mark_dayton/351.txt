Press Release

Location: St. Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton issued a proclamation declaring the week of Oct. 19 to be Minnesota Manufacturers Week -- highlighting the importance of the industry to the state's economy. The annual event is designed to educate the public about manufacturing's role in the state's economy and to highlight opportunities for employment in the industry.
"Last year, manufacturing contributed over $43 billion to our state's economy and employed over 300,000 workers," said Governor Dayton. "This week we celebrate the hard work and many accomplishments of Minnesota's manufacturers, and reaffirm our commitment to their continuing success."
Throughout the week, plant tours of manufacturing facilities around the state and speakers and educational activities are planned in recognition of Minnesota Manufacturers Week.
"Manufacturing accounts for one in nine jobs in the state, and each manufacturing job supports nearly two additional jobs elsewhere in the economy through supplier purchases and employee spending," said Commissioner Katie Clark Sieben of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED). "It's crucial that we continue to support our manufacturers that are key to the overall health and growth of the Minnesota economy."
As a part of Manufacturers Week, Commissioner Sieben will be the keynote speaker at the Brainerd Lakes Chamber Manufacturing Alliance in Merrifield and will visit Schaefer Ventilation in St. Cloud on Wednesday, Oct. 22.
Job seekers will be interested in mn-manufacturing.jobs, a new manufacturing jobs microsite developed by DEED in partnership with Direct Employers. The microsite is mobile-enabled and search engine-optimized and has social media-sharing capabilities.
