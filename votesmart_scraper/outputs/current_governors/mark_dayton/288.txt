Governor Dayton's Remarks on His Supplemental Budget Proposal
Statement

Governor Mark Dayton delivered the following remarks today in laying out his supplemental budget proposal. A news release and fact sheets detailing the Governor's supplemental budget priorities are available online.
Last month's state Budget and Economic Forecast projected a $1.867 billion surplus for the next two fiscal years. That is $831 million more than the surplus predicted by the November 2014 Forecast, just three months before.
Surpluses are a welcome change for Minnesota. Before last November, ten of the previous twelve state Budget Forecasts had projected deficits. They followed right after the last "Give It All Back" tax cut frenzy in 1999, 2000, and 2001. As the saying goes, "Those, who fail to learn the lessons of history, are doomed to repeat its mistakes."
As we consider what to do with this new surplus, let's remember how we got it. It resulted primarily from more Minnesotans working than ever before, earning more income, buying more goods and services, and, thus, paying more state income and sales taxes.
Last year, the legislature and I cut state taxes for over two million Minnesotans through adopting federal conformity, marriage penalty relief, estate tax relief, and homeowners and renters' property tax credits. We did increase state taxes in 2013 by $2.1 billion; however, over $2 billion of that increase came from the wealthiest 2% of Minnesotans, large corporations, and smokers. The Effective Tax Rate on middle-income Minnesotans actually dropped as a result of the combined 2013 and 2014 tax changes.
So let me repeat: This current surplus resulted primarily from more Minnesotans working than ever before, earning more, buying more, and, thus, paying more income and sales taxes.
