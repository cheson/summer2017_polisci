DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004Â—CONTINUED
Mr. DAYTON. I sympathize with the predicament the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has expressed. He has been a stalwart in support of increased funding for many of these educational efforts over the years, and I note that his independence and integrity have resulted in his being cited by yet another prominent publication today.
If those qualities of an independent mind, intelligence, experience, and real compassion for people are considered to be detriments, then it is a sad and unfortunate day for the Senate. I think the Senator's record shows clearly to the contrary.
Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator would yield for a question.
Mr. DAYTON. I would be happy to yield.
Mr. SPECTER. I ask him what publication he is referring to. Independence has its price, and I am prepared to pay it.
I thank the Chair.
Mr. DAYTON. The Senator's distinguished record speaks for itself.
I rise on a matter related to what the Senator just described, the quandary regarding funding for education programs.
Yesterday, for the fourth time, I attempted to obtain 40 percent of Federal funds for special education to fulfill a promise that was made by the Federal Government to States and school districts 27 years ago, which today, and if we pass the appropriation measure that is before us, would be less than half of that 40 percent share. Every one of my colleagues in the Republican caucus voted against this amendment, evidencing that special education funding in the scheme of everything else is simply not a high enough priority.
