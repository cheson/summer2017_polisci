Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Mark Dayton and Congressman James Oberstar sent a letter to Governor Tim Pawlenty urging him to contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Ann Veneman to request emergency disaster assistance for major crop loss suffered from an unexpectedly early frost. Crop loss estimates range from 20 to 100 percent across Minnesota.
"Congressman Oberstar and I have heard from many Minnesota growers who are going to have an impossible time recovering from significant crop loss due to the unseasonably cool weather this season and the unexpected early frost," said Dayton. "I urge Governor Pawlenty to contact USDA as soon as possible so we can help our farmers through this difficult time."
"Farmers in Minnesota have to deal with a number of weather-related problems, but an August frost has been a very unwelcome surprise," said Oberstar. "I cannot recall a pre-Labor Day frost that devastated crops like this one has. I have heard from farmers in my district who say that the early frost has destroyed 80-100% of their crops. I, along with my colleague Senator Dayton, urge Governor Pawlenty and the USDA to act quickly to help these farmers."
USDA's Farm Service Agency is working with Minnesota state officials to collect loss information in order to submit a damage assessment report in the next few days.
