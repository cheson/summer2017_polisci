Dayton: Drug Companies and HMOs Celebrate Passage of Medicare Bill
Washington, D.C. - Today U.S. Senator Mark Dayton expressed disappointment in the passage of the Senate Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 because the bill provides a skimpy prescription drug benefit that does not go into effect for two years. It also excludes drug reimportaiton and will privatize Medicare, so that many seniors will be forced into HMOs. Dayton joined 43 of his colleagues in voting against the bill, which will negatively impact over 600,000 Minnesotans.
"This bill is a failure," said Dayton. It fails to even begin providing coverage until January, 2006, and seniors get only a drug discount card until then. Then, it fails to provide decent coverage, as the average senior will have to pay over $4,000 of the first $5,100 he or she spends for prescription drugs each year. And it fails to provide coverage for our seniors that is as good as Members of Congress enjoy, which is why my amendment limiting Congress' benefits to what we provide seniors was left out of the bill.
"Furthermore, the bill fails to restrain rising drug prices. It expressly prohibits the federal government from 'interfering' in the prices fixed by corporate drug dealers, prices which will only go higher and higher. And the bill effectively fails to permit reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada at prices one-fourth or less than in the United States.
"The bill fails our senior citizens and other Medicare recipients in every important respect. But it's a grand success for drug company profiteering and their continued rip-offs of all Americans, who must pay four or five times more than anywhere else in the world for the prescription drugs they need.
"Minnesota seniors and Minnesota taxpayers deserve much better than this."
