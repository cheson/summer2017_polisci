Statement
By: Mark Dayton
Date: April 3, 2015
Location: St. Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton released the following statement today concerning recent actions in the State of Indiana.
"I am proud of Minnesota for the progress we have achieved to protect the rights and dignity of all people in our state.
"The most recent actions taken by the Governor and Legislature of Indiana may conform to the standards of federal law, but they do not meet the high standards of equal protection we have enacted in Minnesota. Still, based upon their corrective actions, I do not believe a travel ban to Indiana is necessary at this time."
