With thousands of students across the state returning to school this month, Governor Dayton visited Brainerd today, meeting with kindergarten students and teachers at Garfield Elementary.

Since 2011, the Governor and the Minnesota Legislature have invested $895 million in schools. This year, more than 55,000 of Minnesota's youngest learners will benefit from free all-day kindergarten, while others will benefit from high-impact initiatives designed to increase literacy and close the achievement gap.
"As Minnesota's students and teachers return to the classroom, I wish them all a successful school year," said Governor Dayton. "During the past four years, the Legislature and I have worked to make high-impact investments that will improve academic achievement and prepare our students for future success."
