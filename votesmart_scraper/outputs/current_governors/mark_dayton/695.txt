Dayton Announces Additional Counties Eligible for Natural Disaster Assistance
Assistance still not enough to help struggling farmers
Earlier today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that three additional Minnesota counties, Douglas, Otter Tail, and Swift counties, have been designated primary natural disaster areas due to losses resulting from persistent drought conditions. Farmers in these counties are now eligible to apply for low-interest emergency loans from USDA's Farm Service Agency. Farmers in the following 13 contiguous counties are also eligible to apply for the loans: Becker, Big Stone, Chippewa, Clay, Grant, Kandiyohi, Lac Qui Parle, Pope, Stearns, Stevens, Todd, Wadena, and Wilkin counties.
"Almost half of the counties in Minnesota have been declared federal disaster areas this year. The crisis is real; the suffering is acute," said Dayton. "We need to do more for these farmers and their families to provide comprehensive relief."
Recently, Senator Dayton joined with national farm groups and dozens of senators and members of Congress to continue the fight for emergency disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers. They called on their colleagues and President Bush to support an agriculture disaster assistance package that would cover both 2005 and 2006, and provide direct compensation for losses in addition the current program of low-interest loans.
