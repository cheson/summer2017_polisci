Senator condemns blockage of emergency funds required to help heat Minnesota homes.
Washington, D.C. - This year Minnesotans can expect a sharp jump in natural gas prices, making it more expensive to heat their homes this coming winter compared to past years. An amendment defeated today would have provided necessary emergency assistance to help families pay their heating costs. These funds would have specifically been directed to families on fixed incomes, such as seniors and people who have lost their jobs, in Minnesota and across the country.
"Minnesotans can expect to have much higher gas bills this winter. Families on fixed incomes, including our seniors and those who have lost their jobs, are already financially strained. Providing them with funds to heat their home this winter is essential. I am disappointed these funds were not approved today, but I am pleased the Senate bill includes $2 billion in regular Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funds, which is a record amount. I will continue to push for additional emergency assistance funds to help Minnesotans as we face soaring gas prices."
