The following is a statement from Lt. Governor Tina Smith on Equal Pay Day.

"We have made important progress in Minnesota to close the gender pay gap, but too many women -- especially women of color -- still face barriers to equal opportunity in our workforce. Equal Pay Day serves as an important reminder of the work we have left to do to ensure Minnesota is a place where all women can succeed."
