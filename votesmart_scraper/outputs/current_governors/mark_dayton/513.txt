Location: St. Paul, MN

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton regarding Minnesota's new Olmstead Plan, which will improve opportunities, choice, and services for Minnesotans with disabilities:
"All Minnesotans deserve the opportunity and quality services to live with dignity, be valued members of their communities, and make choices to improve the quality of their own lives. Minnesota's new Olmstead Plan will help empower Minnesotans of all abilities to do exactly that.

"I want to thank Lieutenant Governor Yvonne Prettner Solon for her outstanding leadership and months of hard work that made this accomplishment possible. And I want to thank Commissioner Lucinda Jesson, the entire Olmstead Subcabinet, and the hundreds of Minnesota citizens who contributed to the creation of this plan. Their commitment to this important effort will surely improve the lives of countless Minnesotans for years to come."
In January 2013, Governor Mark Dayton issued an executive order, forming an Olmstead Subcabinet and directing identified agencies to develop and implement an Olmstead Plan. A complete news release providing an overview of this project is available online.
