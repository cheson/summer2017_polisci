PAUL WELLSTONE VETERANS HOSPITAL
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation to name the Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis, MN, after the late Senator Paul Wellstone. It would be a great tribute to my departed friend and colleague, who worked tirelessly to improve the lives of veterans throughout Minnesota and across our Nation.
During the August recess, I met with the leaders of major veterans' organizations in Minnesota. Several have formally expressed their support for bestowing this honor on Senator Wellstone. Others, while not taking official positions, are now aware of the legislation and our intentions to proceed with it. So, I believe that the path is clear in Minnesota for this legislation to be enacted with very broad support.
Senator Wellstone served for seven years on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, where he fought tirelessly for more generous benefits and expanded services, including health care, for the men and women who served our Nation with great courage and dedication, and who now deserve far better than many are receiving or not receiving. In addition, he and his dedicated staff enabled countless veterans individually to receive benefits, medical care, and other services which were wrongly denied them. While living, and after his tragic death last year, Senator Wellstone has been a hero to many thousands of veterans throughout Minnesota and across our Nation. Many of them have provided the impetus and support for this legislation.
It is my hope that this measure might receive swift and favorable consideration by the Senate, and that it then be sent to the House for its concurrence and to the President for his signature, prior to the first anniversary of Senator Wellstone's death.
