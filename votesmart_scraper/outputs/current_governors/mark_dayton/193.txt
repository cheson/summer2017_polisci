Location: St. Paul, MN

Today, following the announcement of Minnesota's projected $1.87 billion state budget surplus, Governor Mark Dayton announced that he will propose a $100 million investment in competitive broadband infrastructure grants. The proposal will be considered in the upcoming legislative session. Lt. Governor Tina Smith, who has traveled the state over the course of the last year engaging communities across Greater Minnesota in discussions about the need for broadband investments, released the following statement today regarding the Governor's proposal.

"High-speed, reliable broadband infrastructure is essential for the economic and social vitality of Minnesota communities. Unfortunately, far too many people in Greater Minnesota lack basic access to this essential need. Whether you are a doctor, a student, a teacher, or a small business, you can't do your job without broadband internet access.

"The Governor's proposal to invest an additional $100 million in broadband will attract significant private and local matching dollars. Together, that funding will be a significant step forward in achieving the Governor's goal of border-to-border broadband."
