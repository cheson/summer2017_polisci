Minnesotans still have a few more hours to file their taxes today, and claim millions of dollars in middle class tax cuts signed into law by Governor Mark Dayton less than one month ago. The $508 million in tax cuts enacted early this session by Governor Dayton and the Legislature are slated to benefit over 1.2 million middle class Minnesotans and thousands of businesses across the state.
"Many thousands of Minnesota families and businesses have already received the tax cuts, which the Legislature and I enacted last month," said Governor Dayton. "Those tax cuts are putting more money into the pockets of middle-class Minnesotans, and will help boost Minnesota's growing economy."
Some Minnesotans are deducting their tuition expenses and student loan interest. Others are receiving tax-free employer assistance for adoptions and college tuition. Still others have avoided tens of thousands of dollars in state taxes after losing their homes to foreclosures or short sales. The Working Family Tax Credit is saving low-wage Minnesota workers and their families hundreds, and in some cases thousands of dollars this year alone. These tax cuts, and dozens of others, are providing real savings to real families. Take for instance these Minnesotans' stories.
