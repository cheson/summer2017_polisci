In conjunction with a State of Minnesota trade mission to Mexico led by Governor Mark Dayton, Minnesota State Colleges and Universities is developing partnerships with several universities in Mexico. The partnership agreements provide a foundation for collaboration among the institutions such as student and faculty exchanges, research collaborations, and more.
"As Minnesota's second-largest export market, Mexico is a very important trading partner for businesses and farmers throughout our state," said Governor Dayton. "But Mexico is also an important partner in sharing knowledge, culture, and mutual understanding. I thank MnSCU and the people of Mexico for their commitment to these important educational exchanges."
