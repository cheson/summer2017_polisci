The Minnesota Department of Education today reported that Minnesota's high school graduation rates reached a record at 82.2 percent in 2016. Below are statements from Governor Mark Dayton and Lt. Governor Tina Smith.

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton:

"This is good news. We have made significant progress over the last five years. Despite this improvement, disparities between students of color and white students persist. These gaps underscore the need to invest in quality preschool, early education initiatives, and K-12 funding to stop these disparities before they start. All Minnesota students need and deserve excellent educations. I look forward to working with the Legislature this session to make needed investments to help all students succeed."

The following is a statement from Lt. Governor Tina Smith:

"Minnesota students continue to make steady progress. The graduation rate for students of color has increased by 19.6 percentage points since 2006. However, significant opportunity gaps still limit far too many young people. That is why we must continue investing in high-impact strategies to close Minnesota's opportunity gaps, and ensure every student leaves high school prepared for career training and higher education. Our state expects to face a workforce shortage of more than 100,000 workers by 2020. We cannot afford to leave a single Minnesota student unprepared for the job opportunities of the 21st Century economy."
