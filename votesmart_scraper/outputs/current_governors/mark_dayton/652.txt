Location: Washington, DC

Following a forecast showing a nearly $1.2 billion improvement in Minnesota's budget deficit, Governor Mark Dayton today moved quickly to revise his proposed budget to promote economic growth and maintain his commitment to a fair, responsible and balanced budget.

Dayton's revised budget will eliminate his proposed surcharge, thus fulfilling his promise to keep Minnesota's top tax rate below the nation's highest, while improving progressivity. In addition, Dayton's revised budget, to be presented formally in the coming weeks, will: significantly reduce approximately $200 million in proposed cuts to the Department of Human Services for seniors' long --term care including nursing homes and home health care, Minnesota Care, and community action grants; restore the funding for metro and rural transit to eliminate any state-imposed need for fare increases; restore cuts to fire safety training; increase the research and development credit to promote Minnesota job growth; and provide $5 million to the Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) for the Minnesota Investment Fund (MIF) and the DEED Redevelopment Fund.

Dayton will offer comments and answer media questions about the forecast and his plans for a revised budget at a media availability, to be held today at approximately 5:00pm in the Governor's Reception Room.
