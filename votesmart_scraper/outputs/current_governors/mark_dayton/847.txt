STATEMENT BY SENATOR MARK DAYTON ON THE RETIREMENT OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR
July 1, 2005
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's impressive legacy will not end with her being the first woman appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. She will also be remembered for her impartial judgment and independent views on many controversial issues that came before the Court.
That legacy is precisely why this vacancy is so important. Her successor will impact the rights and protections of every American for decades to come; the President must choose his nominee carefully.
I urge President Bush to avoid a bitter, partisan battle over this critically important nomination by providing meaningful consultation with members of both parties in the Senate. I believe that Democrats and Republicans ultimately share the same goal in this process: To appoint a person who is superbly qualified to uphold our Constitution and who has demonstrated the ability to apply wise, impartial judgment to all aspects of our society. Such a goal cannot be achieved, however, unless President Bush follows the precedent set by so many Presidents before him and consults with the Senate during the nomination process.
