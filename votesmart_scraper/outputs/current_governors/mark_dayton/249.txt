Governor Mark Dayton tonight released the following statement to members of the press regarding his budget offer to legislative leaders.
"The House, the Senate, and myself -- along with our staffs -- continued working to reach a budget agreement until approximately 4:00pm this afternoon. At their request, Speaker Daudt and Senator Bakk then began working on the framework of an offer they believed their caucuses could support. Approximately two hours later, they outlined their tentative offer to Lt. Governor Tina Smith and me -- before speaking with the press.

"After having the chance to fully review their offer, I made it clear to Speaker Daudt and Majority Leader Bakk that I will accept nothing less than $550 million for E-12 Education. My offer includes no less than 1.5 percent increases in the K-12 funding formula in each year of the biennium, and no less than $173 million for half-day universal prekindergarten, starting in September of 2016.

"With a $1.8 billion surplus, there is no excuse not to make this critically important investment in Minnesota's children and our collective better future."
