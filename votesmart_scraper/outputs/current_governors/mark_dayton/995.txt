SEN. MARK DAYTON (D-MN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, gentlemen, for your candor and your persistence here today. The discrepancy between what we were told just prior to the war beginning in terms of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction stockpiles and the absence thereof is really, to me, staggering. And I want to just put it in for the record, the statement that Secretary of State Colin Powell made before the United Nations on February 5th, 2003. He stated, "Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agent. That is enough to fill 16,000 battlefield rockets." He also cited 18 trucks of mobile-from mobile biological agent factories. Your report indicates that there were none of these supplies, as did Dr. Kaye on the battlefield, stashed, or anywhere physically to be found in Iraq.
On the nuclear weapons question, Vice President Cheney stated on August 29th, 2002, "On the nuclear question, many of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire such weapons fairly soon." Just before the war began, he said on "Meet the Press" on March 16th, 2003, "And we believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons." Your report, your testimony today says the analysis shows that despite Saddam's express desire to retain the knowledge of his nuclear team as it attempts to retain some key parts of the program during the course of the following 12 years, after the Gulf War, Iraq's ability to produce a weapon decayed. So he had less capability than he did in 1991 to produce a nuclear weapon.
