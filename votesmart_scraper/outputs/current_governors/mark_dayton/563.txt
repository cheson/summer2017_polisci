Today, Governor Mark Dayton released the following statement on the Supreme Court ruling to uphold the Affordable Care Act:
"I am very pleased with the Supreme Court's decision to fully uphold the Affordable Care Act. Today's ruling will be met with relief by the Minnesotans whose lives have already been improved by this law. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, affirmed by the Supreme Court today:

Minnesotans can no longer be denied coverage for preexisting conditions.
Seniors pay less for prescription drugs
Small businesses will have affordable insurance options for employees
Young people can continue to be covered by their parents' health insurance until age 26.

"This ruling is also an affirmation of the reform efforts currently underway in Minnesota to improve the quality and lower the cost of health care. We have long been a national leader in healthcare reform --a reputation that will be enhanced as we work with private and public sector leaders to implement the Affordable Care Act in Minnesota."
