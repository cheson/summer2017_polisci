Statement by U.S. Senator Mark Dayton on Federal Aviation Administration Investigation AND Letter to Marion Blakey, Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration
On Wednesday, August 31, 2005, at 1:00 pm, my office received information raising airline safety concerns. I cannot evaluate these allegations and, therefore, I have forwarded them to proper investigative authorities.
My office has contacted the Federal Aviation Administration and the Inspector General for the Department of Transportation and asked both agencies to look into this situation. My office will refer all questions to the FAA and the Inspector General.
Contact information:
Federal Aviation Administration -Greg Martin, Director of Public Affairs (202) 267-3883
Inspector General for the Department of Transportation -David Barnes, Communications Director (202) 366-6312
