Issue Position

Location: Unknown

I will transform the present Minnesota Pollution Cooperation Agency into a new Pollution Reduction Agency, by appointing a Commissioner and Board Members who will enforce environmental regulations and reduce pollution. All state environmental protection agencies and boards will again put people before polluters. I also support the current law, which prohibits the building of new nuclear power plants in Minnesota.
