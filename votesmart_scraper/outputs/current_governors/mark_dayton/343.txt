Governor Dayton to Convene Minnesota Rail Summit
Press Release
By: Mark Dayton
Date: Oct. 31, 2014
Location: St. Paul, MN

On Monday, November 17, Governor Mark Dayton will convene a Rail Summit with railroad, agriculture, and industry leaders from across Minnesota. Elected officials, emergency managers, and key members of the Governor's Cabinet will also participate in the discussion.

The Governor's Rail Summit -- which follows a series of railway safety meetings convened by Governor Dayton in communities across Minnesota -- will focus on strengthening Minnesota's railway safety measures, easing the backlog of essential commodities on the state's crowded railways, and identifying needed improvements in Minnesota's freight rail infrastructure.

"Minnesota's crowded railways pose a number of very serious challenges to the safety of our citizens, and the continued vitality of our commerce," said Governor Dayton. "From ensuring adequate supplies of coal to utilities we rely upon for heat and electricity, to shipping harvested grain and other agricultural products to markets, the capacity and safety issues on our railways affect all Minnesotans."

A recent analysis showed that railway backlogs cost Minnesota farmers over $100 million between March and May of this year. And recent crude oil explosions on railway routes in North Dakota and Quebec have led to increased concerns about the hundreds of loaded rail cars carrying millions of gallons of crude oil through Minnesota communities.
