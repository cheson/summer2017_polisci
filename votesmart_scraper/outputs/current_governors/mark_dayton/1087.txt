Dayton: Record Number of Judicial Nominations Confirmed
By: Mark Dayton

Location: Washington, DC

95% of federal judicial seats filled; vacancy rate lower than U.S. employment and poverty rates.
Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today commended his colleagues for working in a bipartisan fashion to fill 160 federal judicial seats, blocking only three nominations in less than three years. Today, 95% of federal judicial seats are filled. This 5% vacancy rate is lower than the U.S. unemployment rate and the poverty rate. In addition, the number of judicial vacancies is at its lowest in 13 years, despite the creation of 15 new seats in 2003.
"In less than three years, the Senate has confirmed 160 judicial nominees of President Bush," said Dayton. "There are more lifetime-appointed federal judges serving now than at any time in American history."
"There seems to be a misinformation campaign out there , making it appear that we are experiencing a judicial crisis right now because Democrats are working to block many of President Bush's judicial nominations. This just is not the case," said Dayton. "I will continue to scrutinize judicial nominees, based on their background, their experience, and their judicial records; and I will work to fill these vacancies with qualified candidates as quickly as possible."
