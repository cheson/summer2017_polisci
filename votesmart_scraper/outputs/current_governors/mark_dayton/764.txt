More Funding Necessary For Veterans Medical Research Program -- 62 Senators sign on to bipartisan letter for veterans FY07 appropriations
April 26, 2006
Washington, DC - Today Senators Larry Craig (R-ID) and Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Chairman and Ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, sent a letter to its appropriations subcommittee urging an increase in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs' Medical and Prosthetic Research Program.
Tomorrow the Veterans' Committee will hold a hearing to shed more light on VA research breakthroughs and development needs.
The President's budget for 2007 proposed decreasing VA research by $13 million. The senators' letter supports increasing the VA budget by $20 million over last year's level - a 5 percent increase.
The letter states: "The proposed level of direct funds does not keep pace with inflation and will compel VA to cut numerous projects. Therefore, we support a FY07 funding level of $432 million, in order to cover inflation, sustain current VA research and development commitments, and allow critical new research initiatives to move forward."
Craig and Akaka joined forces in hopes to sustain VA research programs which are instrumental in developing innovative and effective methods of treatment. Modern warfare has unfortunately resulted in many wounded servicemembers who stand to benefit from enhanced VA research in the areas of prosthetic limbs, rehabilitation, and traumatic brain and spinal injuries.
