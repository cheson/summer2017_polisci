Dayton Statement on the FY04 Budget Resolution
WASHINGTON, DC - Senator Mark Dayton today released the following statement on the Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Resolution:
"The Republicans are practicing 'budget bigamy,' because they can't decide between the two. So the House Republicans get the numbers they like and the Senate Republicans pick the numbers they like. And like marital bigamy, its indecent and irresponsible.
"It is symptomatic of a much bigger problem: the budget numbers have lost their meaning because they have lost their mooring to reality. From a balanced budget to a $400 billion deficit in three years; it's a $600 billion deficit before raiding the Social Security Trust Fund surplus. Fiscal responsibility is in shambles, so what does another $75 billion in war spending or another $36 billion in tax cuts even matter? But watch out when those numbers become a real financial crisis in about 12 years."
