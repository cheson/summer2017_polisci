With the first month behind them, thousands of students across the state are settling into their classrooms for the 2014-15 school year. Governor Dayton visited Duluth today, meeting with kindergarten students and teachers at Congdon Park Elementary.

Since 2011, the Governor and the Minnesota Legislature have invested $895 million in schools. This year, more than 55,000 of Minnesota's youngest learners will benefit from free all-day kindergarten, while others will benefit from high-impact initiatives designed to increase literacy and close the achievement gap.
"As Minnesota's students and teachers return to the classroom, I wish them all a successful school year," said Governor Dayton. "During the past four years, the Legislature and I have worked to make high-impact investments that will improve academic achievement and prepare our students for future success."
