Today, the Minnesota Department of Health and the University of Minnesota released a new report showing that Minnesota cut its uninsured rate nearly in half between 2013 and 2015, with the rate of Minnesotans without health insurance now at an all-time low. The report cites recent health reform efforts and an improved economy as key factors that drove down the state's uninsured rate, as more than 200,000 Minnesotans across all demographics -- including 35,000 children -- gained health insurance coverage between 2013 and 2015. The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton.

"This report is further evidence that President Obama's and my administration's health reforms are working. We have covered more than 200,000 Minnesotans, cut our state's overall uninsured rate by over 47 percent, and saved $1.65 billion through managed care and other health reforms.

"We have made great progress, increasing insurance coverage across all demographic groups, but there is more work to do. I look forward to working with the Legislature to make certain all Minnesotans have the quality health care they need to live healthy, productive lives."
