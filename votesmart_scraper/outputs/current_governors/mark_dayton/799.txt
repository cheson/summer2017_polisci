Senate Rural Health Caucus Calling for Retention of Funds for Rural Health
Senators negotiating rural healthcare funding with House members should take a strong stance for these important provisions, according to U.S. Senator Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP Committee) and fellow members of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.
Enzi and other members of the Caucus including its chairman Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., requested the Fiscal Year 2006 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill retain the Senate-passed funding levels for rural health programs when the conference committee resumes negotiations.
"It is vital that rural health care programs receive proper funding," Enzi said. "These programs play an important role in providing health services to those who live in medically under served areas, such as Wyoming."
In a letter addressed to Senator Arlen Specter, R-Penn., Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Senator Tom Harkin, D-Iowa the Subcommittee's Ranking Member, Enzi, Thomas and others, wrote that "while current spending for all rural health discretionary programs is relatively small, it plays a critical role in solidifying the fragile health care infrastructure common in rural communities."
"More than forty of my colleagues signed this letter. They know there is a lot at stake for rural America. I am hopeful the House will also realize that and go with the Senate numbers," said Enzi.
