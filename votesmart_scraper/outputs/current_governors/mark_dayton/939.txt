STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I salute my two colleagues, Senator McConnell and Senator Bond, for their leadership in this very important area, along with Senator Dodd. They spearheaded the improvements that were made to our election, registration, and voting procedures in the aftermath of the 2000 election difficulties. Clearly, the experience over last November's election shows that we have more work before us that has to be bipartisan. They have shown strong leadership, combined with others, and I look forward to being part of that as a member of the Senate Rules Committee. Senator Lott, the chairman of that committee, will hold hearings in the very near future on this and other proposals. I believe it is imperative that we get that process underway so, as Senator Bond knows, every American knows they have the right to vote, and vote expeditiously, and every one of those votes is going to be counted.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:
