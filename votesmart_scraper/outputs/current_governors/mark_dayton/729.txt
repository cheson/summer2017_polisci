Senate Passes Dayton Measure to Add 236 More Patrol Agents to US-Canada Border
Number of agents has decreased since 2004, despite Congressional mandate for 20 percent increase
The U.S. Senate today approved a measure by Senator Mark Dayton to put an additional 236 patrol agents along the U.S.-Canada border. The Dayton amendment, part of the Homeland Security Appropriations bill (H.R. 5441), provides $44 million for the hiring of additional agents. Dayton offered the legislation in response to concerns by rural northern Minnesota communities.
"They say they can't rely on our federal border patrol agents, because there aren't any there," Dayton said. "So, these five or six-person local law enforcement departments are nearly entirely on their own."
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is required, by the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, to increase the number of border patrol agents along the northern border by 20 percent each year until 2010. Yet, today there are 44 fewer agents there than in 2004, and there are few, if any, signs that will change.
Dayton's amendment aims to close the gap.
"My amendment will increase the number of northern border patrol agents across the northern country by 24 percent, while taking nothing from our southern border," Dayton said.
Since last year, an additional 2,000 border patrol agents have been funded, but there has been no indication that any of them will be sent to the north, especially with National Guard troops, including those from Minnesota, being sent for duty along the southern border.
