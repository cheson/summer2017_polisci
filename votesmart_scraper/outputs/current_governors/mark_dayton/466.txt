Minnesota Department of Revenue officials today told all taxpayers to file their tax returns NOW. The news comes one day before the original target date. For over one million taxpayers who have not yet filed, they can file now with forms and software that include the new tax law changes passed on March 21.
"Many thousands of Minnesotans will benefit from the tax cuts that were passed by the Legislature just over one week ago. I urge Minnesotans to file their taxes now, and claim all the tax cuts and credits for which they are eligible," said Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton.
"Completing the update one day early was a big accomplishment for Revenue staff working closely with our partners in the private sector" said Revenue Commissioner Myron Frans.
