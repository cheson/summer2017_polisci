STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR MARK DAYTON ON DEMOCRATS' "NO CONFIDENCE" IN SECRETARY RUMSFELD
U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today made the following statement on the Senate floor. I join today with many of my colleagues in expressing "no confidence" in Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, and urging President Bush to replace him.
I respect the Secretary's commitment to public service and I recognize that he has one of the most difficult jobs hereÂ—or anywhere in the world.
He's a stand-up, tell-it-as-he-sees-it man, the kind we need more of in Washington.
Unfortunately, the way he sees it has too often been wrong.
The disastrous failures in prosecuting the war in Iraq have left our courageous American troops mired in a quagmire there with no end in sight.
And his shameful rhetoric last week comparing critics of his failed policies to the appeasers of Hilter was clearly a desperate attempt to divert attention away from his own failures.
Recent polls show the number of Americans who support the Administration's policies in Iraq is down to 39 percent compared to a high of 76 percent in April 2003.
