Statement from Governor Dayton on Mille Lacs Working Group
Statement
By: Mark Dayton
Date: Aug. 13, 2015
Location: St. Paul, MN

"It is extremely disappointing that today's chair of the Mille Lacs working group is playing games, rather than providing help to the businesses and people suffering there. His latest move is unprecedented in my two terms as governor. Previously, when there have been naturally-caused disasters, whether an ice storm in Worthington or a flood in Duluth or an avian influenza epidemic in central Minnesota, elected leaders have set aside politics to provide bi-partisan aid.
"Tragically, the leaders of this working group have allowed its focus to become problem avoidance, rather than business assistance. If they do not want to help Mille Lacs resorters and residents in a special session, they should say so. Otherwise, they should immediately make their changes to the financial aid package that I have proposed, submit it to their caucus leaders for their approval, and I will call a special session."
