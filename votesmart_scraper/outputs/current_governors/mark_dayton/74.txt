Statement

Location: St. Paul, MN

Today, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources announced that it has denied a permit application for the proposed Fargo-Moorhead Flood Risk Management Project. The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton.

"The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has determined that this project does not meet Minnesota's standard of being reasonable and practical to protect public safety and promote public welfare. Additionally, the project application failed to demonstrate sufficient measures to mitigate the negative impacts of this project on the surrounding area. While 60 percent of the lands newly flooded by this project would be in Minnesota, we would receive only 14 percent of its benefits. North Dakota would receive 86 percent of the benefits, while hosting only 40 percent of the newly flooded land."
"For these reasons, I support the decision of the Department of Natural Resources to deny the Diversion Authority's permit application."
