Statement by U.S. Senator Mark Dayton on the Sentencing of Zacarias Moussaoui
"I strongly disagree with the jury's decision not to sentence Zacarias Moussaoui to death. If anyone deserves the federal death penalty for his horrible crimes, it is Moussaoui."
Zacarias Moussaoui was sentenced to life in prison today for his role in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The federal jury also had the option to sentence Moussaoui, a member of the al Qaeda terrorist group, to death by lethal injection.
