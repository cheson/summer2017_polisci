Senator cites inaccuracies, insists Act scapegoats schools for broader social problems with the support of local lawmakers and residents.
(Minneapolis) - Last month, the Minnesota Department of Education publicly listed 259 Minnesota public schools as "under performing." Yesterday the department's "updated list" cited 144 schools, 115 less than a month ago. Ninety-three schools were wrongly accused because of faulty data.
"Who is under-performing?" Dayton asked. "The number of schools falsely accused of 'under performing' in Minnesota is disgraceful. Thousands of teachers, students, parents and administrators have been embarrassed publicly because of bad data, not poor performance. What are the penalties for testing-administrators whose errors damage other people's reputations?"
"This experience should serve as a warning to the politicians and education critics obsessed with testing as a means to scapegoat public schools for broader social problems. When the testers are incompetent, look at the harm that's done. And look at the demographics of the schools that have 'under performed' for the third straight year. Can there be any doubt that poverty and social dysfunction are the principal determinants of academic achievement levels? Are we going to punish schools for where they are located?"
"First, we should provide students and educators in Minnesota with the resources to be successful. Then, we should measure their success. Instead, we withhold funding and measure failure. It's a failed approach, and evidently, not an accurate one."
