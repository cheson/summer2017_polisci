On the Special Education Amendment
March 26, 2003
This amendment increases spending for America's schoolchildren and reduces the tax cut for millionaires. It finally fulfills a promise Congress gave 28 years ago, that we would pay 40 percent of special education costs. The President deserves great credit for proposing, and Congress for passing, increased special education funding. We have raised the federal share to 17 percent nationwide, but that is still less than half of what we promised.
It's good, but it's not enough.
We've increased spending for defense and homeland security over the last several years, and when it wasn't enough, we increased it even more. We responded to urgent needs. Can't we - for once - meet an urgent need that is not military? Better education for America's children: Our ultimate homeland security. It's so urgent that surely we can postpone half of the tax cut this budget provides the richest people in America.
The President's proposal would give people whose annual incomes exceed $1 million tax cuts averaging $85,000 each year. That's in addition to the $45,000 they're already getting from the 2001 tax bill.
So who comes first? Schoolchildren or millionaires?
Yes is a vote for our children.
