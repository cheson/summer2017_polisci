2005 COUNTRY REPORT ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES IN THE PHILIPPINES -- (Senate - December 06, 2006)
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep distress about the human rights violations reportedly committed in the Philippines. The U.S. Department of State's 2005 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in the Philippines, released in March 2006, is a very troubling account and, at times, a cynical report on the current state of Philippine human rights problems. The Report cites the Philippine National Police as the worst abuser of human rights in the country, and it describes numerous violations, including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and physical abuse of suspects and detainees. It cites instances of torture, arbitrary arrests, trafficking of persons, and harassment of human rights personnel and political activists.
In light of the report's troubling findings, I respectfully urge my colleagues to review this document and recognize the significance of these extremely serious transgressions.
