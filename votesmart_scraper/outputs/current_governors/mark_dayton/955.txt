Dayton Fights Meth Plague by Joining Colleagues in Introducing Bill Limiting Access to Key Ingredient Used in Making Drug
At a press conference this afternoon, U.S. Senator Mark Dayton joined with his Senate colleagues in introducing legislation which would make it more difficult for methamphetamine producers to purchase over-the-counter products used in making the drug methamphetamine (meth). The "Combat Meth Act" would place new, strict requirements on the sale of pseudoephedrine - one of the key ingredients used to produce meth in labs - and would provide new resources and tools to states and local law enforcement officials to combat the production and distribution of the drug methamphetamine (meth).
"In 2003, over 300 methamphetamine labs were seized and shut down in Minnesota - nearly triple the number seized in 2000," said Dayton. "The Hazelden Institute, a leading drug treatment facility located in Minnesota, has stated that almost 10 percent of the patients admitted to their facilities are meth addicts, many of whom are under the age of 17. Meth is a highly potent, cheap, and very addictive drug that is invading neighborhoods and schoolyards across Minnesota. We must stop this plague."
In April, 2004, Oklahoma banned over-the-counter sales of cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine. Ten months later, meth lab seizures in Oklahoma are down more than 80 percent.
"We need to make it impossible for meth producers to merely visit their local pharmacy and buy in large quantities, right off the shelf, the ingredients used to manufacture meth. Our bill would eliminate this convenience for meth cooks.
"Minnesota's police officers and law enforcement officials tell me how important federal funding for law enforcement programs - such as Byrne Grants and COPS programs, crucial to fighting the meth plague infiltrating our communities - continues to be cut by President Bush. I look forward to working with Minnesota law enforcement and public health officials in eliminating our state's meth problem and will continue fighting to restore federal funding for important law enforcement programs."
The Combat Meth Act would:
· Provide critical resources to local law enforcement and prosecutors
· Expand the ability of local prosecutors to bring methamphetamine distributors to justice
· Restrict the sale of necessary ingredients for making meth
· Increase the awareness and involvement of businesses that legally sell pseudoephedrine, which is needed to make meth
· Provide services for children affected by the spread of meth
· Enhance treatment options
Methamphetamine is one of the deadliest, most fiercely addictive, and rapidly spreading drugs in the United States. During the past decade, while law enforcement officers have continued to bust record numbers of labs, meth use in communities has increased by as much as 300 percent. Meth is cheap, potent, and available everywhere.
