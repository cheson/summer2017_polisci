Tonight, members of the Minnesota Nurses Association (MNA) voted to ratify the tentative agreement reached by MNA and Allina Health earlier this week, resolving all outstanding contract issues between the two groups. The two groups came together with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service earlier this week to negotiate at the Governor's Residence, at the request of Governor Dayton and Lt. Governor Smith.

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton and Lt. Governor Tina Smith:

"Minnesota's nurses are on the front lines of health care, where they work tirelessly and professionally to take care of all of us. We are grateful that the members of the Minnesota Nurses Association have ratified this contract and will return to work soon, and we are grateful this long and painful strike has ended. We again thank the leaders and negotiating teams representing the Minnesota Nurses Association and Allina Health for working so hard to resolve this very challenging dispute."
