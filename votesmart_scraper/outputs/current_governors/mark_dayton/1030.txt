PENSION CONFERENCE REPORT
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota, the Presiding Officer, for a letter I just signed with him to the employees of Northwest Airlines and also the steel companies in northeastern Minnesota on his initiative. This letter indicates both of us support the pension conference report which, fortunately, is going to be voted upon tomorrow in the Senate. I thank the Senator for his initiative on that, his calls imploring me to do what is in the best interest of important companies in Minnesota and the thousands of employees whose pensions depend upon those companies. I concur with my colleague and appreciate his giving me the opportunity to send that joint communication out to the thousands of Minnesotans for whom we will be acting tomorrow, in a bipartisan way, to protect for the future.
