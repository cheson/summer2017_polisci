The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton, on the attack that took place in St. Cloud last night.

"I am appalled at the terrible attacks on innocent Minnesotans in St. Cloud last night. If true that they were motivated by religious bigotry, I condemn them even more strongly. There is no place in Minnesota for intolerance of all Americans' constitutional right to worship according to their beliefs.
"I am deeply grateful to the heroic law enforcement officer, whose swift response prevented an even worse attack. And I extend my very best wishes to the victims for their swift and complete recoveries. I ask everyone in the St. Cloud area and throughout Minnesota to rise above this atrocity and act to make religious and racial tolerance one of the ways in which Minnesotans again lead our country.
"Tomorrow morning, I will travel to St. Cloud to offer my support to city officials and its citizens."
