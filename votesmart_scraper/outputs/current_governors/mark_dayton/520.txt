Today, Governor Mark Dayton released the attached audio statement on the news that Minnesota gained 12,200 jobs in August.
"Twelve thousand additional jobs -- we're farther than we were before the Great Recession in employment overall. It's terrific for news Minnesota, it's terrific news for over 12,000 Minnesotans who are working, who weren't a month ago. So I am very pleased with the progress.

"We're have about 120,000 jobs more than when I took office, but we're not there yet. We still have too many who are out of work, too many people who are unemployed or underemployed. We're going to redouble our efforts, we're going to keep making overtures to every business we can to put these projects together so that more and more Minnesotans so that they can have better jobs and better opportunities in the future."
