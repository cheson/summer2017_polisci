Today, the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) released a jobs report showing that total employment has topped 2.8 million for the first time in state history. Following the release of today's report, Governor Mark Dayton released this statement.
"We now have over 2.8 million jobs in Minnesota, the most jobs ever in the history of our state -- nearly 150,000 more jobs than when I first took office just a little over three years ago. The credit belongs with Minnesota businesses and employees, who are driving economic growth and creating new jobs in our state. This is good news and the work we are doing is paying off, but we are not satisfied yet. To make further progress, I urge the legislature to pass and send me an income tax reduction bill by next Wednesday, March 19. Meeting this deadline will help ensure thousands of Minnesotans receive tax relief this year."
