TRIBUTE TO PAUL AND SHEILA WELLSTONE ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR DEATH
October 25, 2004
Today is the second anniversary of the terrible plane crash that took Paul and Sheila Wellstone away from us. Also killed in that horrible tragedy were their daughter, Marcia; Associate Chair of the state DFL, Mary McEvoy; two close aides, Tom Lapic and Will McLaughlin; and the two pilots.
Words cannot express the loss I feel every day, because of Paul's death. He was my friend for over 20 years, my colleague for two years, and my inspiration for the rest of my life. His courage of his convictions, his willingness to take a stand, his passion, his eloquence, and his tireless caring about people combined to make him an outstanding and very special United States Senator.
Paul was an astute politician, and he practiced the trade with great skill. However, he never forgot that getting elected was just the means to the end (or the beginning): the chance to serve people, to improve their lives, and to create a better world for today and for future generations. Paul would never sacrifice his principles or convictions to expediency. He never stopped caring about every person and every cause, which were dear to him. He had an unlimited capacity to include another, and another, and another person or cause to his already overloaded agenda; yet, he always did so unhesitatingly and compassionately.
Paul could not abide the duplicity and hypocrisy that he often witnessed around him. I remember one day, when he was fuming, because a colleague had failed to keep a promise to vote for one of his bills: "She said it was a tough vote for her, like that was an excuse. What am I supposed to say, 'Well, that's OK, just be with me on the easy votes.'?"
