Today, Governor Mark Dayton visited Apple Valley's Westview Elementary, continuing his push to ensure every Minnesota four-year-old has access to high-quality preschool. Governor Dayton's preK proposal would provide universal access to voluntary half-day preschool programs, helping ensure that every Minnesota child gets a great start -- preparing them for kindergarten, and future success in school and life.
"We have already seen the tremendous successes of all-day kindergarten, which got underway just this year," said Governor Dayton. "But we have a lot more work to do to narrow Minnesota's achievement gap, and provide excellent educations for every student in Minnesota. That work has to start now, and it must begin with our youngest learners."
During the stop, Governor Dayton visited with students in a preschool classroom, before hosting a discussion with several teachers, parents, and administrators. A recent survey conducted by Rosemount-Apple Valley-Eagan Public Schools found that 81 percent of district parents believe preK is essential or very important in determining a student's academic success. The Governor was joined at the school by Education Commissioner Brenda Cassellius, District Superintendent Jane Berenz, and Westview Principal Tami Staloch-Schultz.
