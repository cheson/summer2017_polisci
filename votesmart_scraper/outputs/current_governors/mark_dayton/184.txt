Governor Mark Dayton today introduced a Jobs Bill that would invest $1.4 billion in infrastructure projects statewide, creating an estimated 39,900 Minnesota jobs*. This new Jobs Bill would help address many of the state's critical infrastructure needs, including essential water infrastructure, while strengthening Minnesota's economy and putting thousands of people to work.
"My proposals would put thousands of Minnesotans to work throughout our state," said Governor Dayton. "This bill will help deliver clean, affordable water to Minnesota communities, and prioritizes projects that have been delayed for many years. These projects are essential to improving our state's infrastructure. I ask the Legislature to join me in working to pass a capital investment bill this session that will support our local economies and create jobs."
"Our top priority is building an economy that works for everyone, everywhere in Minnesota," said Lt. Governor Tina Smith. "This bill will help accomplish those goals by investing in classrooms for our students, affordable housing for more Minnesotans, and helping farmers expand and improve their operations. The many investments included in this bill will strengthen our communities and improve the lives of Minnesotans."
The Governor's Jobs Bill includes critical infrastructure projects distributed across Minnesota. It balances the needs of the state, with 35 percent of projects in Greater Minnesota, 35 percent in the Twin Cities Area, and 30 percent having impacts statewide. And Governor Dayton' Jobs Bill is designed to make state resources go further, by leveraging more than $600 million in private, local, and federal dollars.
