Letter to George W. Bush, President of the United States - Immediate Investigation into Failure to Order Armor for Troops
Letter

Dear Mr. President:
During the past eighteen months, Senate Committee on Armed Services Chairman John Warner has held public hearings and non-public briefings on the shortages of armored vehicles for our military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a member of the Committee, I have attended those meetings.
The most recent of them was a classified briefing, held on November 10th. Committee members repeatedly asked the presenting military officers and Pentagon officials whether everything possible was being done to retrofit unarmored vehicles already in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to produce new armored vehicles for those theaters.
Again and again, we were assured that everything possible was underway, and that Congress had provided all of the funding necessary to fill those terrible deficiencies as rapidly as possible.
Now, however, there are published reports, which quote the manufacturers of those armored vehicles and of the armor retrofit kits that they have had the capacities to produce more of them during the past year, but have not received the orders to do so. Those disclosures directly contradict what we had been told repeatedly by Department of Defense representatives during that time. Courageous American soldiers, who could have been protected if the additional orders had been placed, have been maimed or killed as a result of that negligence.
I respectfully urge you to order an immediate investigation into the disastrous failures to order and distribute the maximum possible numbers of armored vehicles and armor retrofit kits since the war in Iraq began. I also urge you to obtain the resignations of everyone responsible for those failures.
Sincerely,
Mark Dayton United States Senator
