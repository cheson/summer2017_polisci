Governor Mark Dayton signed the disaster relief bills passed earlier today in a Special Session of the Minnesota State Legislature, and he released the following statement:
"I am very pleased that the legislature has passed the disaster relief bill to assist Minnesotans whose homes, businesses, and communities were ravaged earlier this summer by severe natural disasters. I have just received this legislation, and I have signed it into law.

"I commend legislators for honoring their promise to limit this special session to disaster relief, which they passed with overwhelming bi-partisan support. This help to Minnesotans, who have suffered terrible misfortunes, is a shining example of the spirit which makes our state so very special."
