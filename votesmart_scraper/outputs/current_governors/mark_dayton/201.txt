Governor Mark Dayton and Lt. Governor Tina Smith were joined by state and local officials in breaking ground on a $30 million expansion of the Minnesota Children's Museum today. For more than 30 years, the Minnesota Children's Museum has been dedicated to providing children with a fun, hands-on and stimulating environment to learn and discover.
"I was honored to serve in the group that founded the Children's Museum. I am delighted to join the museum today, as it launches its exciting new chapter," said Governor Mark Dayton. "The Children's Museum understands the great benefits to kids of early, hands-on learning experiences, and to families of sharing quality time together. This expansion will enable the Museum to help children and parents learn together for many years to come."
