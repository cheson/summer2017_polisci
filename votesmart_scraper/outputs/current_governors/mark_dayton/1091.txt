Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to LTG Emil R. "Buck" Bedard, who will retire Monday and return to private life after more than 36 years of selfless service to our Nation as a United States Marine. I have had the pleasure to work with Lieutenant General Bedard on matters of importance to the U.S. Marine Corps and to our Nation's defense. His experience and expertise will be missed by many of us in the Senate, as will his integrity, keen insight, and good judgment.
