THE PATRIOT ACT -- (Senate - December 16, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the great Senator from West Virginia, and he is a great Senator. His 47 years of experience here and wisdom have made him an invaluable Member of this body, a leader of this body, an invaluable mentor to newcomers such as myself, and his fidelity to the Constitution, his understanding of history, his understanding of the appropriate relationship of this body, as an independent branch of Government, with the executive branch has been patriotic, courageous, and right.
I thank him for his remarks and for his kind words.
I also want to share the outrage that he expressed, and the previous speaker, the distinguished Senator from California expressed, about these disclosures. Yet another one today, reading in the New York Times about the secret spying on American citizens by the National Security Agency, in contravention of law and in contravention of previous policy under Presidents, Republican and Democrat.
That, on top of the revelations about secret torture camps being conducted, again extra-illegally, by this administration, to the detriment of the great name of the United States of America.
I see that the outstanding Senator from Arizona is on the floor and will follow me with his remarks. To his enormous credit, he has been the champion of putting the United States back on track and assuring that we set the example, the proper example, for the rest of the world in how to conduct itself even under adverse circumstances.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from Arizona is recognized.
