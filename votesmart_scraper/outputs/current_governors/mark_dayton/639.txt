Governor Mark Dayton today offered the following statement regarding a new stadium proposal announced by legislators:

"I have consistently said that jobs - putting Minnesotans back to work - must be our top priority, along with balancing the State's budget. Building a "people's stadium' will provide good jobs for several thousand Minnesotans. This bill is a good start, and gets the stadium discussion started within the Legislature. It includes what I view as essential elements of a stadium bill, particularly that no general fund dollars be used to pay for it. It's up to the Legislature to move this forward, but I am ready to work with them to create a "people's stadium.'"
