Statement by Senator Mark Dayton on the Agreement to End the Fillibuster Fight
There is little I like in the content of the agreement of the 14 Senators, who acted independently of their Caucuses. It was more of a capitulation than a compromise. They preserved the right to filibuster judicial nominees by promising not to do it. One analyst termed it, "kicking the can down the road."
The agreement also saved the Republican Leaders from their excesses. It prevented the spectacle of Vice President Cheney's overruling the Senate's professional Parliamentarian and its Rules to set a precedent that would greatly benefit future Presidents.
Both sides believed there were important principles at stake in this debate. I believe that policy positions may need to be compromised in the legislative process, but principles should not be forsaken. I personally would have preferred a final vote today, accepted either outcome, and proceeded to the important legislation, such as Defense Authorization and Energy, before us.
