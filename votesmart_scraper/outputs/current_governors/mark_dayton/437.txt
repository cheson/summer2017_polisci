It just got easier for military veterans to become police officers in Minnesota. Governor Mark Dayton today signed a bill eliminating unnecessary barriers in state law that prevented some military police officers from transitioning into service on civilian police forces.
While the typical length of service for a military service member is four years, state law previously required individuals to have five years of active duty experience in military law enforcement before qualifying to take a police officer reciprocity exam. Veterans who held a two-year college degree needed a minimum of three years of military police experience before they could take the exam.
The bill (Chapter 268, HF1915) signed today by Governor Dayton changes these experience requirements to four, and two years respectively, making them more consistent with typical military commitments. The new law builds on reforms enacted last session that allowed military police officers to take their reciprocity exams while still on active duty, helping them transition more quickly into civilian employment.
"The common sense reforms we have made over these last two years will help Minnesotans who have served their country honorably in the military, to continue that service here at home in our communities," said Governor Dayton. "I thank these veterans for their remarkable commitment to service, and pledge my continued support to help all Minnesota veterans find employment."
