Dayton Urges Paid Sick Leave for Working Minnesota Families
Currently, no U.S. federal law guarantees even a single day of paid sick leave to employees in the private sector.
U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today became one of the first supporters of a bill to help Minnesota families take time off from work to care for a sick family member, without incurring a loss in salary. The bill, the Healthy Families Act, would provide seven days of paid sick leave annually to full-time employees of companies with 15 or more workers. Almost 47 percent of all full-time employees in the private sector currently lack paid sick days of any kind.
"Providing working Minnesotans with at least seven days of paid sick leave every year is the right thing to do to," said Dayton. "It benefits our families and helps our businesses become more worker friendly and family friendly."
The Healthy Families Act would also provide part-time employees with paid sick days, depending upon the number of hours worked.
Jim Koppel, Director of the Children's Defense Fund of Minnesota, said, "The Children's Defense Fund is grateful to Senator Dayton for cosponsoring this important legislation, which would help Americans to care for their families' health at home, without losing pay or jeopardizing the family's economic stability."
