Dayton Statement on Senate Passage of the
Renewable Fuels Standard
WASHINGTON, DC - Senator Mark Dayton today released the following statement in response to Senate passage of a Renewable Fuels Standard as part of the 2003 Energy Bill:
"Today's passage of a Renewable Fuels Standard is an important step toward boosting farm income, improving national energy independence, providing cleaner air, and strengthening rural communities.
"Unfortunately we could only get a majority in the Senate to agree to an ethanol mandate in ten years that is only a fraction of Minnesota's ten percent today. I currently drive a Ford Explorer which uses E-85 fuel, 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. Just imagine the enormous benefits if every car in America did the same. The corn is available. Why not now?"
