Today, Governor Mark Dayton and Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith hosted a breakfast at the Minnesota Governor's Residence to welcome David Johnston, the Governor General of Canada to the State of Minnesota. Governor Dayton was joined by Education Commissioner Brenda Cassellius, Higher Education Commissioner Larry Pogemiller, and Canadian officials, for a discussion on innovation and education in Canada and Minnesota.
"It was my great honor to welcome Governor General David Johnston to Minnesota today," said Governor Dayton. "As Minnesota's largest export market and closest neighbor to the north, Canada is a vital trade and business partner for our state. Our conversation this morning focused on what Minnesota and Canada can do together to further improve the education of our citizens."
"This is my first visit to the Midwest as governor general, and my fourth to the United States," said Governor General David Johnston. "Minnesota and Canada have so much in common, from our shared border, waters, history and culture - to our shared passion for hockey! I thank Governor Dayton and Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith for welcoming me to the State of Minnesota."
