Governor Mark Dayton today issued Emergency Executive Order 17-03, after two canoeists went missing in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) this week. After the canoeists did not return from the BWCA on Monday as they had planned, a search was launched by air, land, and water to find the missing canoeists.

"I am very thankful that the two canoeists have been found, and are now recovering after their very trying week," said Governor Dayton. "I thank the members of the Minnesota National Guard, and the law enforcement officials of the Department of Public Safety, for their heroism in this successful search and rescue."

In consultation with Public Safety Commissioner Mona Dohman and Adjutant General Richard Nash, Governor Dayton last night directed the Minnesota National Guard to assist with the search and rescue of lost canoeists in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. Early this morning, the canoeists were located after signaling a Department of Public Safety airplane with a flashlight.

The Governor's Executive Order will allow the Minnesota National Guard to be properly reimbursed for their assistance in the successful search and rescue.
