Statement on Halliburton Kickback Revelations
"Once again, Halliburton has shown itself to be untrustworthy. Yet the Bush Administration continues to shower Vice President Cheney's former company with multibillion dollar contracts," said Dayton. "Awarding one company $600 million in contracts reveals a serious lack of internal financial controls.
"At a minimum, the Pentagon should place future payments to Halliburton or its subsidiaries under existing contracts in escrow. They should also refrain from awarding any future contracts to Halliburton until all irregularities have been investigated.
"I repeat my earlier demand that the appropriate Senate committee undertake its own investigation, as I would if these questionable practices were occurring under a Democratic Administration. Ensuring the legal and proper expenditure of funds is our bipartisan responsibility."
