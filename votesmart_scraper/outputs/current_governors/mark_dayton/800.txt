TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2005 -- (Senate - November 17, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment would provide a Federal tax credit to farmers for 30 percent of their 2005 energy costs up to $3,000 per farmer. Qualified energy costs are those for fuels, utilities, fertilizers, heating and drying used in farming businesses of taxpayers during calendar year 2005.
As my colleagues know, farmers have been especially hard hit by soaring energy prices. In addition to skyrocketing energy costs, many farmers have been hit with higher transportation costs. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, American farmers desperately need relief.
The estimated $3 billion cost of this measure is more than offset by closing the tax loophole that gives a foreign oil and gas income tax credit for oil companies that provides $4.1 billion over 5 years.
I ask for the yeas and nays.
