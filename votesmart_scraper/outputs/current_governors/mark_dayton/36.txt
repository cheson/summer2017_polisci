Today, the Minnesota House of Representatives is set to vote on a bill concerning power plants in Becker. Governor Dayton today indicated that he expects to sign the Senate version of this bill, as it was amended last week.

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton.

"I have very serious concerns about other proposals in the Legislature to weaken the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). However, in this instance, I believe that the critical importance of this project for Becker, the surrounding area, and our entire state, requires certainty that the protracted PUC review process cannot provide. Thus, I expect to sign this bill as amended by the Senate last week, when it reaches me.

"I have directed the Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) to study how the state can partner with the Becker area, as their local economy and job market absorb the impacts of the Sherco plant closures. Good jobs, healthy local economies, and cleaner energy should not be at odds in Minnesota. My Administration will do all it can to assist Becker and other communities across the state undergoing similar transitions.

"The PUC plays an essential role in Minnesota, safeguarding the interests of Minnesota utility customers now and in the future. As Legislators consider additional proposals regarding the PUC this session, they should know that I will not accept any bill that limits or weakens the Commission's authority to protect the interests of Minnesota's energy consumers. I will, however, consider any serious proposal to improve the functioning of this essential public body.
