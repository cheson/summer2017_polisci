Continuing his work to improve water quality and wildlife habitat, Governor Mark Dayton today submitted a $795 million proposal to the United States Department of Agriculture for a Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) for Minnesota. This federal, state and local partnership would work with farmers and other landowners across Minnesota to implement conservation practices on up to 100,000 acres of land to restore and protect water quality. Funding provided through CREP would provide additional financial support for farmers and landowners as Minnesota works to implement bipartisan buffer legislation enacted last session.

"This CREP funding would help tremendously, as Minnesotans work together to be even better stewards of our land and water," said Governor Dayton. "We have begun to reverse the serious deterioration in the quality of water in parts of our state. But much more remains to be done. This is everyone's challenge and everyone's responsibility."
