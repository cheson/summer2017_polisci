BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
MISSED SENATE VOTES
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, on May 11, 2005, I was necessarily absent from the Senate to attend the funeral of St. Paul, MN police officer, Sergeant Gerald Vick, who tragically lost his life in the line of duty on Friday, May 6, 2005. I joined over 2,000 Minnesotans in paying our final respects to this heroic peace officer, community leader, and devoted husband and father.
Had I been present to vote on the amendments to the Transportation Equity Act, I would have voted as follows:
On the motion to waive the Congressional Budget Act, in relation to amendment No. 605 and H.R. 3, I would have voted ``yea.''
On the motion to table Corzine amendment No. 606, I would have voted ``nay.''
On the Lautenberg amendment No. 625, I would have voted ``nay.''
On the Harkin amendment No. 618, as modified, I would have voted ``yea.''
