The Filibuster Compromise
Recently, seven Republican and seven Democratic Senators, acting independently, reached their own agreement to prevent the so-called "nuclear option"Â— a change in Senate Rules which would prevent filibusters, endless debates on the Senate floor to prevent votes on judicial nominees.
The issue underlying the agreement is a critical one: how will the expected Supreme Court vacancies be filled? The agreement is a good faith effort to promote cooperation and preserve Constitutional checks and balances in the Senate. It also seeks to encourage more consultation between the President and the Senate on nominees. Should this fragile agreement hold, it is hoped that fierce partisan rivalry on judicial nominations will ease and that the nominees themselves would reflect the values of most Americans and not those of an extreme few.
Unfortunately, the 14 Senators' bipartisan agreement was more of a surrender than a compromise. The Democratic Senators preserved the right to filibuster judicial nominees by promising not to do it, except under "extraordinary circumstances." The Republican Senators agreed not to change Senate Rules, but only if the Democrats refrain from filibustering under any other circumstances. Thus, their agreement effectively restricted the use of a filibuster to block judicial nominations. Whether this is a good or bad result depends upon whether you believe those nominees should become federal judges.
Most Republican Senators have supported all of President Bush's judicial nominations and have argued that the Constitution requires all of them to receive "up-or-down votes by the full Senate." They did not support this principle, however, when Bill Clinton was President. Republicans controlled the Senate for six of the eight years during his two terms, and they prevented 69 of his judicial nominees from ever receiving votes by the full Senate.
The best feature of the 14 Senators' agreement is that they unanimously urged the President to consult with Senators from both parties before selecting his nominees for lifetime appointments as federal judges. The Constitution calls for "the advice and consent of the Senate" in confirming Presidential nominations. If this President or any President would genuinely consult with Senators from both parties, his or her nominees would be far more easily confirmed.
Perhaps the best reason for preserving the filibuster option is that a nominee needs the support of 60 rather than 51 Senators to be confirmed (since 60 Senators must vote to end a filibuster). That usually requires a few votes from Senators of the Minority party. Presidents who need only 51 Senators of their own party to confirm their nominees make far more partisan and ideologically extreme choices, and most Presidents will be pressured by their activist supporters to do so. Needing support from Senators of the other party helps ensure that nominees are closer to the moderate center than either the far left or far right of American society. That moderation is especially important for federal judges, who receive lifetime appointments and who are supposed to be independent of both the President and the Congress.
Again, as the Senate is almost certain to consider nominees for the U.S. Supreme Court in the near future, the Constitutional checks and balances in the Senate will be more critical than ever.
This agreement could easily unravel. That's why I would urge my fellow Minnesotans to get involved by letting your Senators know how important it is to confirm nominees who can be fair and who can refrain from using their ideology to legislate from the bench.
