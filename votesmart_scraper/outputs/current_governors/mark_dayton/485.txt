Governor Mark Dayton today released the following statement regarding Minnesota's minimum wage.

"Minnesotans who work full-time should be able to earn enough to lift their families out of poverty, and through hard work and additional training, achieve the middle-class American dream. I strongly support increasing Minnesota's minimum wage to $9.50, which would put $472 million each year into the pockets of over 350,000 Minnesotans. Economic experts tell us that low- and middle-income Minnesota workers will spend that money at local businesses on basic necessities, goods, and services -- benefiting Minnesota's entire economy."
