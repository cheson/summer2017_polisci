Governor Mark Dayton released the following statement, in response to President Obama's address to a joint session of Congress this evening:

"The President's speech was the best I have ever heard him deliver. He was exactly the decisive, strong, and forward-looking leader our nation needs at this critical moment. He properly called upon all of us to set aside our partisan differences and to unite in support of the best ideas and initiatives for the people of America, for now and for the future.

"The President's vision should inspire Americans and galvanize Congress. As he stated so eloquently, the time to act is NOW. His American Jobs Act will put thousands of Minnesotans back to work; they need Congress to act NOW.

"As we learn more in the days ahead about the details of the President's plan, I am confident we will find even more initiatives that will help Minnesota's citizens, businesses, and economy. I look forward to rolling up my sleeves to support the President's proposals and to put them to work for Minnesota."
