The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) awarded South Central College two Minnesota Job Skills Partnership (MJSP) grants totaling $69,542 to address regional workforce training needs.
"Investments in job training are critical to ensuring that all Minnesotans have the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow," said Lt. Governor Tina Smith. "These Job Skills Partnership grants are a win-win for our state's economy -- providing workers in southern Minnesota access to high-quality jobs, and employers the workforce they need to grow."
"As the demand for technical skills grows among manufacturers, the Minnesota Job Skills Partnership program is seeking to support the needs of our businesses," said DEED Commissioner Katie Clark Sieben. "We are grateful for the Mankato area manufacturers' commitment to Minnesota, and are happy to assist them in their efforts to expand operations."
A $48,943 grant will support advanced training for 80 All Flex Flexible Circuits employees to help the company reduce operational costs and continue to grow.
A $20,599 grant will be used to increase the skills of 21 manufacturing employees from six Mankato area manufacturers.
