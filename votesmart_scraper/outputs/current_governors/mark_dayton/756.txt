Statement by U.S. Senator Mark Dayton on Dissent of HSGAC Katrina Investigative Report
Washington, DC - Speaking from the Senate floor today, U.S. Senator Mark Dayton explained his lone dissenting vote against approval of the final report on the federal government's failed response to Hurricane Katrina. Dayton is a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which released the Katrina Report last week. The Minnesota Senator, who released his "dissenting views" on the report Tuesday, said the document was incomplete, because it lacked key documents and testimony from Bush Administration officials, which the White House refused to provide. Dayton blamed partisan politics for the missing information, and charged that the Committee had failed in its oversight responsibility by not subpoenaing the information from the White House.
