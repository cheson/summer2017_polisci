WASHINGTON, DC - Senator Mark Dayton today released the following statement in response to President Bush's Monday night speech to the American public:
"The president has issued his final ultimatum to Saddam Hussein. I continue to believe that our national security would be better protected by continuing diplomacy , containment, and inspections with the support of a broad international coalition. Nevertheless, I pray that the president's decision will turn out right for our country and our world. I pray for the courageous men and women in our armed forces, and I will do whatever I can to support them and the president until the war is won.
"Now, however, I say once more to my colleagues in the Senate: the United States Constitution authorizes Congress, and only Congress, to declare war. We must not turn on our ultimate responsibility at this fateful moment. We must commence that debate and make that decision immediately."
