NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS -- (Senate - September 21, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It addresses the severe crisis in counties in northwestern Minnesota that were flooded last June after they had planted their crops. Many farmers in that region of my State lost most or even all of their crops. So the preventive planting program has been established which allows them to plant alfalfa and other cover. It says, after November 1, they may harvest the crop or graze on the crop. That works well for most of the country, but whoever wrote that date into law some time ago forgot to check the weather maps as they pertain to northern Minnesota which, by November 1, is often under snow.
The intent of the program is to provide for the ecological covering of the affected acreage, then allowing for farmers to salvage something off the land in addition to the preventive payment from the Government by harvesting it or allowing grazing on it. The effective date is too late to benefit Minnesota farmers.
This amendment would simply say, for those counties in Minnesota and elsewhere across the country that have been declared an agriculture disaster in this calendar year by either the President of the United States or by the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to their authorities, that they would then, for the purpose of this year only, be able to use that acreage for harvesting or grazing effective October 15. It moves up the timetable.
I think it preserves the original and actual intent of the program, and it means it applies to northern Minnesota, as it does to the rest of the country.
