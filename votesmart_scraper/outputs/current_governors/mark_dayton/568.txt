Today, Governor Mark Dayton signed three bills into law:
Chapter 294, House File 2690, including modifications to several tax-related provisions. Governor Dayton included the following statement (also attached) when he signed this bill:
"I have signed H.F. 2690, despite my serious reservations about the Legislature's reallocation of LGA funding. Since relatively little additional money is added, the bill would create many "winners" (i.e., cities which would receive more aid than was allocated under the LGA formula), but also some very serious "losers," who would receive considerable less money under current law. I am left wondering whether those consequences were realized by all legislators when they voted on the bill.
Despite my concerns, I am persuaded to sign the bill because of the $4.1 million of property tax relief it provides to homeowner, who experience increases greater than 12%. To be clear, those drastic property tax increases are due to the legislative majority's ill-advised elimination of the Homestead Market Value Credit and reductions in Local Government Aid last year. As a result, many more Minnesotans will be burdened with significantly higher property taxes.
While this program aids only those homeowners affected most severely, and only for one year despite permanent property tax increases, it is virtually the only aid this Legislature has provided them in this session. It, therefore, requires my support."
Chapter 295, Senate File 1653, modifying provisions for independent contractors, and includes other initiatives from the Department of Labor and Industry.
