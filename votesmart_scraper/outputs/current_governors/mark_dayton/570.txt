Governor Dayton's Statement on Upcoming People's Stadium Vote
Statement
By: Mark Dayton
Date: May 3, 2012
Location: Saint Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton released the following statement today:
"I am very pleased that the Republican legislative leaders have agreed to my request for up-or-down votes in both bodies on a new "People's Stadium" that would provide jobs for several thousand Minnesotans and keep the Vikings here. Now everyone will be able to hold legislators accountable for that momentous decision.
"I will continue to do all I can to convince them that this is a good deal for Minnesota, the best deal available, and much better than the alternative: losing thousands of jobs, losing the Vikings, and losing the "Can Do" spirit, which is Minnesota.
"I ask all Minnesotans, who care about the stadium, to contact their legislators and urge them to vote "Yes" next Monday."
