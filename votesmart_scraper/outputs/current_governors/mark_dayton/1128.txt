PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2003
AMENDMENT NO. 1030
    Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.
    Madam President, I thank Senator Durbin. I commend my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, who has spearheaded the development of this amendment, and for the leadership he has shown in this and so many other areas. I stand proudly with the Senator today.
    The Durbin amendment is the essential test for this body. It is going to be the measure of our commitment to seniors and to other Medicare beneficiaries all over America. It is going to be a test of our sincerity of what we said we intend to do for those people who are either disabled, through no choice of their own and are required to be on Medicare at an early age, or senior citizens who have worked throughout this country who have served this country so well and now are in their retirement years, the largest users by age of prescription drug medicines. So they are the ones most dependent on the quality of coverage we provide for them.
    I heard again today from colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as I have heard others say throughout this Chamber, and as I have said many times in Minnesota, that our senior citizens deserve prescription drug coverage that is as good as Members of Congress receive; that is as good as the Federal employees receive through the plan of which we are all part. Yes, we pay into that plan, but it is also very well covered"subsidized" would be the right wordby our employer, the Federal Government; the same in the case of Senator Durbin's amendment, at a level of parity to our plan.
    If we want to provide senior citizens and other Medicare beneficiaries with the same level of coverage that we get in Congress, then Senator Durbin's amendment is the way to do that.
