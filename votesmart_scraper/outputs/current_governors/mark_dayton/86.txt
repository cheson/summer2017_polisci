Top financial analyst Fitch Ratings announced today that they are upgrading Minnesota's credit rating to AAA, the highest rating awarded by the analyst. Fitch Ratings had previously downgraded Minnesota's rating to AA+ in 2011, reflecting years of financial instability in the state.

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton:

"This upgrade, to Fitch's top credit rating, is a testament to the hardworking Minnesotans and businesses across our state who have led our economic recovery, and to the work our state has done over the past six years to right the fiscal ship."

The following is a statement from Lt. Governor Tina Smith:

"Everyone does better when our state's economy is on solid ground. Businesses have the certainty they need to expand operations and hire more workers. Minnesota families have better access to good jobs, affordable housing, and the peace of mind they need to invest in their family's future. This top rating by Fitch is a testament to the fiscal responsibility that has been our guiding light from the beginning of our term. Now we need to keep working, so our economy works for everyone, everywhere in Minnesota, not just those at the top."
