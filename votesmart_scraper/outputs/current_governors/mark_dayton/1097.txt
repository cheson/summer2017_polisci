Senate Armed Services Committee Holds a Hearing on U.S. Military Commitments Worldwide
By: Mark Dayton
Date: Sept. 9, 2003
Location: Washington, DC

DAYTON:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
General Myers, I respect enormously what you've outlines, in terms of the requirements for victory.
DAYTON:
I just want to assure you that the will to win does not differ from one side of this aisle to the other. And my recollection is all my colleagues have accepted the president and Ambassador Bremer and others's description of what constitutes the elements of victory, so that we can get our troops out after winning that victory and with a lasting victory that will endure and make it worth the enormous sacrifices that have been made.
In terms of commitment, I think that everything the president and the secretary of defense, the Joint Chiefs have requested has been approved by the Senate and by the Congress in an overwhelming bipartisan support.
And if there's any message to come out of today's events, they ought to be that, as the news media reported, I think accurately, earlier today, this latest request will be approved with overwhelming support.
I will certainly support whatever the president demonstrates is necessary to achieve this victory.
But with regard to patience, sir, the sense of urgency that I bring toward my assessment of this situation actually came from my time in Iraq about six weeks ago now.
General Sanchez briefed us there, as did Ambassador Bremer and others, and they all basically said the same thing: that the next 60 to 90 days would be crucial to show progress toward achieving the conditions necessary for bringing this to a successful conclusion as quickly as possible.
And they said, furthermore, a direct quote, "Time is not on our side," and the failure to show progress sufficiently would be likely to have very serious consequences.
So what were those elements of victory as they outlined?
One was getting Saddam Hussein and his two sons permanently eliminated from the country and preferably the planet,
which you've achieved two-thirds ofand that's just one short of perfection, and hopefully will be realized very soon.
The second was to install a successor Iraqi government as soon as possible. Now, when we met with Ambassador Bremer six weeks ago, my recollection was that he said that the goal was to have that government established and elected by the Iraqi people within six months, by the end of the year. Now, it's being said that it will be a year, practically, from a short while ago.
So in terms of patience, again, if that's a precursor to our being able to extract our troops successfully, then we're talking about an extension there for reasons that, I must say, I don't understand.
Third was the domestic law and order. And I can't assess the overall circumstances in the country. What I do know is U.S. casualties were evidently up 35 percent in August compared to the month before.
That was information gleaned by going into a top secret briefing last week and looking at a sheet marked Top Secret and seeing the information that had been reported the day before in The Washington Postwhich I guess means I'm better off reading the newspapers than I am to go to those briefings.
If that information is not made available or intended to make available it's very hard for someone like myself, much less the American people, to make a realistic evaluation. And I would urge that the facts be allowed to speak for themselves, whether they're good facts or not good. No one expects us to go easily. But I think we have a right as Congress, and more importantly the American people, to know what the real situation is.
And the fourth condition for victory was that the social and economic rehabilitation under way. That's, again, an area where I guess there are differing reports. One of my colleagues said earlier that they're talking about improvements in basic services, but that's contrary to what I've been told in other settings.
And The Wall Street Journal says today continued sabotage against oil pipelines and power stations has plagued Iraq. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recently did a helicopter survey of Iraq's high- voltage distribution wires. Over about 700 miles they found 623 destroyed towers, up from fewer than 20 just after the war.
Obviously that's an act of sabotage and retaliation, whatever, but it's still of concern, when it means that American troops have to be stationed there longer.
And I believe their figure now of 140,000 or 138,000 contrasts to what was expected at one point of the planning process of being only about 60,000 U.S. troops needed at this stage. So those, as you well knowand I know you feel just more responsibility for them than anyone else, the lives of our constituents' sons and daughters.
DAYTON:
And they're over there with their lives on the line, and we going to figure out how to get them back as quickly as possibly but after achieving that success.
So I hope there's no misunderstanding about the shared resolve. And I think we would be derelict in our responsibilities if we didn't try to explore what needs to happen and how it's going and what, if anything, needs to be done to make it more successful as soon as possible.
Along those lines, I just say that the "Today Show" this morningI try to watch the TV and to read the papersthey reported that the intent of the administration is to provide combat pay for soldiers in Iraq but not in other places, such as Afghanistan or other, I would call them, combat areas. Is that information correct or not?
WOLFOWITZ:
The supplemental assumes both Iraqi and Afghanistan, Senator.
DAYTON:
In those two areas?
WOLFOWITZ:
Yes.
DAYTON:
Thank you.
Maybe this goes better to you, Mr. Secretary. Regarding the president's assertion the other night that it was a terrorist attack against the U.N. headquarters that caused the attack, has that been definitively established?
WOLFOWITZ:
Well, obviously, it's terrorism and suicide terrorism. It's deliberately killing innocent civilians. I don't think the president meant to say that we know where it came from precisely. There is some belief that it was Baathists, some belief it could be terrorists; they could be working together.
I know of more evidence, actually, in the case of Najaf than in the case of the U.N. bombing, but the FBI is working on both of these.
DAYTON:
OK. So, when the president said the other night, "Terrorists in Iraq have attacked representatives of the civilized world and opposing them must be the cause of the civilized world," he's referring to terrorists who could be foreign terrorists or who could be Iraqiremnants of Saddam Hussein's army or whatever.
WOLFOWITZ:
(inaudible)
DAYTON:
OK. Thank you.
And just one last, because my time is up here. With regard to Afghanistan, I note the reconstruction budget for Iraq is expected to cost $20 billion to $30 billion of expenditures next year. The supplemental request for Afghanistan, however, is $1.2 billion, I think, combined, but $800 million additional, and then $400 million from unspent funds previously. That's a fraction, 5 percent, of whatless than thatof what is being undertaken for Iraq. And Afghanistan, by many accounts, is in far worse, more backward conditionand we're two years into that after winning that military victoryand we don't even have a road completed from Kabul to Kandahar. And it seems that we have underfunded that effort. And the international community bears that responsibility.
But is your assessment, sir, that we're going to approach a sufficient effort there to show some positive results?
WOLFOWITZ:
Well, actually, you've put your finger on something that is a problem and is a concern in any of these operations. The road network in Afghanistan is not, in our view, being stood up fast enough. And it is an international community responsibility, which means it tends to get diffused and there's a lack of what the military would call unity of command, to put it charitably.
We are, in this proposal, putting some money so that we can push that effort along faster. It's a bit like the electricity in Iraq: When you think of it as a purely economic development project, time isn't that critical.
WOLFOWITZ:
But your point doesn't contradict the chairman's point about patience. We need a sense of urgency about those things that can be fixed that will relieve the strain on our troops and make them safer. And roads on Afghanistan are one of those things; electricity in Iraq is another.
The disparity you point out is an interesting one and I think a lot of it stems from the fact that the one country is just much more advanced than the other, so the requirements become bigger.
DAYTON:
Well, electrical capacity, I was wondering if his lack about putting full force behind this basicI think we're missing a terribly important opportunity.
WOLFOWITZ:
I would agree with you on that. In fact, looking at the two numbers side by side the other night, we said, "Let's take another look at whether we got the balance right."
MYERS:
Chairman Warner, can Ijust 30 seconds, if you don't mind?
WARNER:
You bet.
MYERS:
On the point of the bipartisan support, clearly, it's the reason we've been successful to date, and we appreciate that. And I think I made that very clear I think in my opening remarks. And it's really apparent at the troop level; they know that. And I think that's why we're successful.
On patience, I was referring not specifically to Iraq, but the broader war on terrorism. There are some things, as Secretary Wolfowitz said, we ought to have a terrible sense of urgency about because it does help our security. And I don't disagree with what Ambassador Bremer and other have said about the urgency of getting the infrastructure stood up and in governance and so forth. That's exactly right on track.
And the last point, if there's ever anything in a briefing thatif you don't think we're being forthcoming, then we have failed. Because we have made a very large effort to try to bring everything we have. And just like the embedded reporters, we knew there would be the good, the bad and the ugly, but that's what the American people expect, that's what you deserve on this committee.
I don't have the specifics on that case. If you can show it to me, I'd be happy to search it down.
DAYTON:
I will. Thank you.
And I also would point out again, that reading in the paper this morning about extending the tour of duty for reservists and guardsmen and women, those are folks back home we hear from. We appreciate also, being a member of this committee, given that information directly.
MYERS:
You bet.
DAYTON:
Thank you, sir.
