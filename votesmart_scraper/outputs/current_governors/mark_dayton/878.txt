Dayton Applauds Over $3 Billion for Minnesota Transportation Needs
Long overdue funding will help alleviate current crisis
Today U.S. Senator Mark Dayton voted in support of a five-year transportation bill which will provide Minnesota with $3.05 billion, a 46 percent increase in transportation funding over the next five years. The transportation bill (S.732), also includes an amendment offered by Dayton and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) which requires all automakers to display decals inside the gas tank covers and windshields of vehicles that have the capacity to run on the 85 percent ethanol-based fuel known as E85, beginning in model year 2007. Many of the people who already own one of the five million flex-fuel vehicles on the road are not aware that their vehicles are capable of running on E85.
"Our state's highways, bridges, mass transit systems, and rail lines are in terrible condition and getting worse every day," said Dayton. "This bill, long overdue, will increase Minnesota's federal transportation funding to by 46 percent over the next five years, helping to alleviate what has become a transportation crisis, by getting important projects underway."
Dayton urges the President not to veto this important legislation which will help create jobs, relieve congestion, and help spur economic development throughout Minnesota. The President has threatened to veto any bill larger than $284 billion; the Senate bill is $295 billion.
