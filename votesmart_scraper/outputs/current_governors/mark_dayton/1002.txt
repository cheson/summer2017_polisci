DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005-CONTINUED
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment is necessary to protect the health care benefits of security guards who are protecting our security at Federal buildings in Minnesota and in other States.
In this instance, private contractors have low-bid these security contracts, and they unilaterally have shifted the employees' health payments to 401(k) contributions. The company thereby increases its profits by not paying taxes at the expense of their own employees, with no consultation, no negotiation, just cold-blooded profiteering. No wonder a company like this can underbid its competitors. The bids can go lower and lower every time they cut wages or benefits. That is why there should be employee protections-protections that were eliminated, unfortunately, over the objections of many of us when this Department of Homeland Security was created just 2 years ago.
This amendment simply requires that if a company takes over a contract, it must negotiate changes in health benefits with its employees. I think that is the least we can do on behalf of those who are risking their lives to protect our lives.
I yield the remainder of my time.
