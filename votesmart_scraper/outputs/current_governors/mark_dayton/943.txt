Statement of U.S. Senator Mark Dayton on his Decision Not to Seek Re-Election
I am announcing today that I will not seek re-election to the Senate next year. God willing, I will complete my present term to the very best of my ability.
It has been a tremendous honor to serve the people of Minnesota during the past four years. Everything I have worked for and everything I believe in depend upon this Senate seat's remaining in the Democratic Caucus in 2007. I do not believe that I am the best candidate to lead the DFL Party to victory next year. I cannot stand to do the constant fund-raising necessary to wage a successful campaign, and I cannot be an effective Senator while also being a nearly full-time candidate. Thus, I am choosing to devote all of my time and energy to the job Minnesotans have elected me to do.
As I am removing myself from the political fray, I have informed St. Paul Mayor Randy Kelly that I must also withdraw my support from his Re-election Committee.
I want to thank everyone who has supported me and especially the people of Minnesota who have given me the greatest honor of my life, the chance to be their United States Senator.
I have done my utmost to uphold that high honor, and I will continue to do my utmost to represent our great state to the very best of my abilities until January 3, 2007.
While I have no specific plans, I intend to remain in Minnesota thereafter and continue to be involved in service.
