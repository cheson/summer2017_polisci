Dayton Offers Plan to Cut Taxes for Working
Families, Extend Unemployment Benefits
Says Bush Plan Drives up Deficits to Benefit Wealthiest Americans
WASHINGTON, DC - Senator Mark Dayton today introduced a tax plan that will cut taxes for lower- and middle-income wage earners and freeze rates for the wealthiest earners at current levels. and extend unemployment benefits for part-time workers and those who have exhausted their current benefits.
Dayton released the following statement on his tax plan:
"Congress is now considering one of the most important bills we will debate and pass this year. President Bush's current tax proposal would give them another tax cut averaging $85,000 per year for the decade. I believe that is too much for the rich of America and not enough for the rest of America.
"I prefer a tax cut which would be much fairer to all federal income taxpayers and a better economic stimulus. My plan would triple the amount of income taxed at the new 10-percent rate. I also support the President's proposal to increase the child tax credit immediately from $600 to $1,000 per child.
My proposal would provide a larger tax cut to all but the richest Americans than the President's plan; yet, mine would cost the federal treasury less than half of his. Less to the rich and more to the rest of America is too good to pass. But I intend to try."
