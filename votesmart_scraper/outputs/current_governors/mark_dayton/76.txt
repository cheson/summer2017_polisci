Governor Mark Dayton today joined six other Midwestern Governors in urging federal action to implement better government reform and remove a significant regulatory obstacle, to expand opportunities for E15 and other mid-level ethanol blends.

Governor Dayton joined Governor Terry Branstad of Iowa, Governor Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota, Governor Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, Governor Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Governor Sam Brownback of Kansas, and Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri, in a letter sent today to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy.

In the letter, Governor Dayton and the other Midwestern Governors note that they "share common goals of eliminating unnecessary regulatory barriers, strengthening the free market, and expanding consumer choice by increasing access to E15 and higher ethanol blends."

Currently, more than 300 fuel stations across the U.S. offer drivers the choice of E15, but that is only a small fraction of the more than 150,000 fuel stations nationwide. A major factor preventing fuel station owners from adopting E15 is the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) standard, which hits E15 and other mid-level ethanol blends harder than E10, despite these mid-level blends having lower volatility than E10 when blended with the same base gasoline.

Governor Dayton and the six other Midwestern Governors are strongly urging the EPA to take immediate action to establish a uniform regulation for ethanol blends.
