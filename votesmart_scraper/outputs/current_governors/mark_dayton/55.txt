Statement from Governor Dayton on Federal Twin Metals Mineral Lease Decision
Statement
By: Mark Dayton
Date: Dec. 15, 2016
Location: St. Paul, MN

Today, the United States Departments of Agriculture and the Interior announced their decision to deny an application for renewal of two hard rock mineral leases held by Twin Metals near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BCWAW), and to initiate steps to withdraw key portions of the watershed from new mineral permits and leases. Earlier this year, Governor Mark Dayton directed the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources not to authorize or enter into any new state access agreements or lease agreements for mining operations in close proximity to the BWCAW.

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton.

"Today's announcement is tremendous news for the protection of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BCWAW), a crown jewel in Minnesota, and a national treasure.

"It is important to note that this decision is not in opposition to mining, but in defense of a pristine and priceless environmental wonder. We must continue doing all we can to support good jobs and a strong economy in Northeastern Minnesota, while ensuring the protection of our greatest natural resources. I thank Secretary Vilsack and Secretary Jewell for their exceptional leadership, to protect the BWCAW for all Minnesotans and for our country."
