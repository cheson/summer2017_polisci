Governor Mark Dayton today honored three high school student athletes for their outstanding sportswomanship at the Girls Class A State Cross Country Running Championship in early November.

Governor Dayton welcomed Jessica Christoffer, a freshman from Jackson County Central High School, Kailee Kiminski, a senior from Esko High School, and Tierney Winter, a junior from Waterville-Elysian-Morristown High School, to the Governor's Residence for lunch. The student athletes were joined by their coaches and families.

"Like their parents and coaches, I am very proud of these three tremendous young women," said Governor Dayton. "Their outstanding character, integrity, and sportswomanship are an example for all athletes, and all Minnesotans."

During the State Tournament this month, Ms. Winter and Ms. Kiminski noticed Ms. Christoffer fall to the ground just 100 yards from the finish line. The two stopped to help Ms. Christoffer up and began to run, arm in arm, once she was on her feet. The three crossed the finish line together in an outstanding display of character and good sportswomanship.
