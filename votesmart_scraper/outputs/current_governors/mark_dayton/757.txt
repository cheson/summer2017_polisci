BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
REPORT ON HURRICANE KATRINA
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, last week the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, of which I am a member, approved its report titled ``Hurricane Katrina, A Nation Still Unprepared.'' The committee's distinguished chairman set today as the deadline for additional views.
I reluctantly voted not to approve that draft of the report last week because it is seriously incomplete. While it is still lacking all of the information, documents, and testimony which President Bush and his subordinates denied the committee, last March 15 the ranking member asked the chairman to subpoena witnesses and documents that have been withheld by the White House. Regrettably, she declined to do so.
Earlier this year, on January 12, the chairman and ranking member wrote the White House Chief of Staff, Mr. Andrew Card, regarding the information they had previously requested. Their letter stated, in part:
This practice (of withholding information) must cease.
