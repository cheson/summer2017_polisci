Statement from Governor Dayton on Minnesota's Next Generation Energy Act
Statement

Location: St. Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton today issued the following statement regarding Minnesota's Next Generation Energy Act.

"I strongly disagree with the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to strike down an essential part of Minnesota's Next Generation Energy Act.

"I will continue to defend the State of Minnesota's right to protect the quality of the air our citizens breathe. The State Statute does not prevent anyone from building and operating a new power-generating facility, whose emissions will affect Minnesota's air quality. It only requires that those new emissions must be offset by the same or greater reduction in emissions from other plants. In other words, Minnesota's law encourages the replacement of older, more-polluting power plants with more efficient, cleaner facilities.

"I will need to review this ruling with the Attorney General before further consideration of how to proceed."
