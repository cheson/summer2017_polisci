Dayton Champions Major Reform to Medicare Bill; Senator's Legislation Would Lower Rx Drug Prices for 41 Million Seniors
Today U.S. Senator Mark Dayton was joined by members of Minnesota's leading senior advocacy organizations at the Minnesota State Capitol, where he announced that he will introduce legislation which would allow the government to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for 41 million Medicare beneficiaries. Dayton's bill, which he will introduce in the Senate this afternoon, would eliminate the current ban on negotiating lower drug prices and would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers for lower prices if private health plans are not able to obtain prices comparable to those arranged by federal agencies. Currently, government agencies such as the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense have the ability to negotiate directly with vendors.
"The existing Medicare prescription drug law passed last year, which I voted against, does little to provide seniors with the financial relief they desperately need from the exorbitant price of prescription drugs," said Dayton. "That costly legislation does more to protect the profits of drug companies than it does to protect our seniors' pocketbooks.
"Later today, I will introduce a bill that would put America's seniors before special interests. My bill offers commonsense solutions to help Medicare's 41 million beneficiaries obtain lower priced medicines. In Minnesota alone, this legislation would help the nearly 120,000 retirees, who currently pay for drug coverage but will see their coverage jeopardized as a result of the existing Medicare law."
In addition to allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, Dayton's bill would:
· Lower premiums for some Medicare recipients by eliminating HMO subsidies
· Protect seniors from gaps in coverage
· Protect retirees from losing drug coverage
· Ensure that seniors are not forced into HMO's
· Eliminate late penalties for seniors making decisions about health coverage
· Protect six million low-income beneficiaries, who will have to pay more for
their medicines under Medicare starting in 2006.
