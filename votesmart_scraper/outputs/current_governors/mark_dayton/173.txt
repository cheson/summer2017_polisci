Statement

Location: St. Paul, MN

The Governor's Diversity and Inclusion Council recently issued its 2016 report updating policymakers and Minnesotans on the Council's efforts to improve diversity in the state's workforce and business supplier chain, and to more equitably engage diverse people, communities, and businesses in the work of state government.

"Ensuring that all Minnesotans have equal opportunities to work for their state government, to do business with the state, and to participate fully in our democracy remains a top priority for my administration," said Governor Mark Dayton. "The work we have accomplished together over the last year is an important starting point; but we have much more work to do."
