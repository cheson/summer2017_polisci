Statement by U.S. Senator Mark Dayton on Election in Iraq
U.S. Senator Mark Dayton released the following statement today on Iraq's first free election in 50 years:
"The successful election in Iraq was an important step toward establishing an independent democracy in that country. Tremendous credit should go to the U.S. Armed Forces, who made voting possible throughout much of the country, and to the millions of Iraqi citizens, who risked their lives to vote."
