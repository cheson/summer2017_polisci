Location: St. Paul, MN

At 12:00pm on Wednesday, April 28, 2015, Governor Mark Dayton will host a Minnesota-grown turkey lunch at the Governor's Residence for interns who are working this spring in the Office of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. To kick off the lunch, Governor Dayton will carve a 25-pound turkey, which was raised in Glenwood, Minnesota. Members of the press will be invited to film and photograph the turkey carving and the initial portion of the lunch at the Residence, beginning at 12:00pm.
Minnesota is the nation's largest producer of turkeys, with 450 farmers raising approximately 46 million turkeys annually, and generating nearly $800 million in economic activity every year.
"As turkey farmers across our state deal with the devastating effects of avian influenza, it is more important than ever for all Minnesotans to support the Minnesota turkey industry," said Governor Dayton. "Our turkey growers need more than our help in stopping the spread of this disease; they need our full support as consumers to buy and eat good Minnesota turkey."
According to the Minnesota Department of Health, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, and the nation's leading health experts, despite the discovery of avian flu in some turkey flocks, turkey is 100 percent safe to eat. Properly handled poultry and poultry products, such as eggs, are absolutely safe to eat. There is no public health risk for any humans who have not had direct contact with infected birds.
