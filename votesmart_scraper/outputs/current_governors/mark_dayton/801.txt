Statement by Senator Mark Dayton on FAA's Northwest Airlines Investigation Report
U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today announced that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released the preliminary findings of its investigation of maintenance operations at Northwest Airlines (NWA). The investigation was launched in September, after one of FAA's own investigators raised concerns about NWA maintenance to Dayton.
Below is Senator Dayton's statement on the report's findings.
"I met today with James Ballough, Director of Flight Standards Service at the FAA, Nicholas Sabatini, Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety at the FAA, and David Balloff, Assistant Administrator for Industry and Government Affairs at the FAA. They briefed me on the FAA's investigation into allegations regarding the safety of Northwest Airlines' flight operations. They assured me that after their review, they believe Northwest flights are being operated consistent with the FAA's safety standards for the commercial airline industry.
"The FAA officials stated that their review corroborated some of the findings of the inspector who contacted my office. They informed me that he is one of 80 FAA inspectors assigned to Northwest's operations, and that their conclusions were based upon all 80 inspectors' reports and findings. They assured me that the FAA's careful oversight of Northwest's operations will continue."
