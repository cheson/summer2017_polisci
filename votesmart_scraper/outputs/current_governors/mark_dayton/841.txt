Dayton Fights to Protect Minnesota's Lakes From Harmful Asian Carp
Senator's legislation would add three species of Asian carp to the injurious species list
Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Mark Dayton yesterday joined with seven Senate colleagues in cosponsoring a bipartisan bill to keep Asian carp out of the Great Lakes and other waterways in Minnesota. The Asian Carp Prevention and Control Act (S. 1402) would add three species of Asian carp to the established list of injurious species, under the Lacey Act of 1990, which prohibits the interstate transportation of certain animal species, without a permit.
Asian carp are voracious eaters that can grow to as long as six feet and can weigh 110 pounds. The introduction of Asian carp to the Great Lakes could be devastating, as the species is known to dominate water systems and eliminate competing species, threatening food supplies for native fisheries. The bighead, black, and silver carp, which eat plankton, were originally brought to the United States as a management tool for aquaculture farms and sewage treatment facilities. As a result of major flooding, those species were released into the Mississippi River, prompting concerns that the fish would move into the Great Lakes. Dayton's legislation would control the Asian carp population, by requiring permits to buy, sell, import, or transport the fish. Permits would be issued only for scientific, medical, and educational purposes.
"Asian carp pose a very serious threat to the delicate ecosystems of our Great Lakes and to the local economies that rely on the lakes' many fisheries," said Dayton. "It is imperative that we act now to prevent the Asian carp population from spreading further and causing permanent damage to these vital natural resources."
