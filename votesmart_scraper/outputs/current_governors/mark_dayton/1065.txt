DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004
Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator and the chairman of the subcommittee. I know these two leaders have been under the greatest of pressures and financial strictures. They both have performed heroically in getting the money for veterans.
My colleague is right. My former colleague, Senator Wellstone, would be happy beyond belief for the veterans of Minnesota and of America. I thank you for your extraordinary efforts. I salute the efforts of both distinguished colleagues and I thank them for this matter.
I certainly meant no disrespect to anyone yesterday in my remarks. My distress was primarily because I felt that again my friend Paul's memory would not be well served by having the folks in Minnesota or anywhere else losing out. So his memory would be served, I wanted this memorial, this tribute from the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the President of the United States, and they have been very supportive and gracious throughout all this. We finally fulfill that.
I thank the chairman and ranking member for making this possible, and I yield the floor.
Ms. MIKULSKI. I further say to my unflagging colleague from Minnesota, this $500,000 will not come out of other Minnesota projects. OK? The memorial to Senator Wellstone is a national project of national impact and, therefore, will not impact upon the Minnesota projects which are also so important and needed.
Mr. DAYTON. I thank my colleague.
