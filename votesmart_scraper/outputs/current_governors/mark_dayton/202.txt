Statement from Governor Dayton on Health Insurance Rates

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton regarding health insurance rate increases in Minnesota's private individual market.
"I am extremely unhappy with these extremely high insurance rate increases. The insurance companies, who are responsible for them, will force Minnesotans into plans with less complete coverage or drive them out of the insurance market entirely. Given these large rate increases, I strongly encourage Minnesotans to shop on MNsure so they can access tax credits to help reduce their costs.

"If health insurance companies make good coverage unaffordable for Americans, I believe citizens will soon demand that insurers' excessive administrative overheads be eliminated, and that they be removed as the providers of health insurance."
