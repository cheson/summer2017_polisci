Governor Mark Dayton released the following statement today regarding the federal Clean Power Plan.
"While the Court's temporary stay is disappointing, it does nothing to diminish our resolve in Minnesota to keep moving forward on clean energy initiatives, including the development of our state's Clean Power Plan. President Obama's strong leadership, the nation-leading initiatives of some of our state's utilities, and my administration's commitment will assure our state's continued progress.
"We shouldn't need a federal edict to understand how vital it is that we keep doing everything in our collective powers to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and advance Minnesota's clean energy economy."
