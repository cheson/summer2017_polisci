TRIBUTE TO KENNETH N. DAYTON
    Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of Minnesota's leading citizens who passed away last Saturday, a man who also happens to be my uncle, Kenneth N. Dayton.
    Kenneth Dayton was one of five brothers who returned from their service in World War II, and when their father died in 1950, took ownership and operating control of a single department store in Minneapolis which was then known as the Dayton Company. Ken was instrumental, along with my father, Bruce Dayton, in building that small family-owned business into what is now Target Corporation, the second largest retail company in America.
    Last year, Target Corporation owned and operated some 1,500 stores in 48 States under the names Target, Marshall Fields, and Mervyn's. The week I took office in January 2001, the company announced that it was changing the name of its upper midwest Dayton's department stores to Marshall Fields. I have always suspected they did so because they were concerned I was going to generate so much bad publicity for the Dayton name that they better make that change while they could.
    Kenneth Dayton, however, added only stature and respect to our family name. He was a brilliant retailer who understood merchandise, marketing, and consumers. He served as president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board during two decades of expansions and acquisitions in the 1960s and 1970s, which transformed the company into a publicly owned corporation and a national retailer.
    Early on, the five brothers established a practice of contributing 5 percent of pretax profits to charitable organizations. It was one of their ways to give back to and enhance the communities where the stores were located.
    Kenneth Dayton became a national spokesman for this 5 percent club, and he persuaded many other leaders of American corporations to adopt the practice of contributing, if not 5 percent, at least some designated amount of their profits to worthwhile social causes.
    Ken and his wife of over 50 years, Judy Dayton, practiced what he preached. They have been two of Minnesota's leading philanthropists during the last half century, contributing, by their own account, over $100 million to charitable organizations. The Minneapolis symphony orchestra, a world class symphony orchestra, which performs in a world class orchestral hall, has been a principal beneficiary and great love of Ken and Judy Dayton. But hundreds of other organizations, large and small, engaged in all kinds of important work, have been also recipients of their wonderful sense of social responsibility.
    That wide variety of causes reflected Ken Dayton's wide breadth of interests. He had enormous enthusiasm for life, and he brought that enthusiasm to everything he did, along with a keen intellect and a world of life experience.
    Because of his stature as a civic leader in Minnesota and the importance of his many contributions to the city of Minneapolis, to the State of Minnesota, and to our country, I would be making this tribute to Kenneth N. Dayton were he not my uncle, but I am proud he was. He inspired, supported, and guided our family and so many others whose lives he touched. I am fortunate to have been one of those blessed by his life and his love.
    John Kennedy, as President in 1961, said for those to whom much is given, much is required. And when at some future date the high court of history sits in judgment of each of us, our success or failure will be measured by the answers to four questions: First, were we truly men of courage? Second, were we truly men of judgment? Third, were we truly men of integrity? Finally, were we truly men of dedication?
    By those four measures, Kenneth Dayton was a successÂ—a great success. He was a great man and, more importantly, he was a good man.
    Well done, good and faithful servant. May you rest in peace.
    I yield the floor.
