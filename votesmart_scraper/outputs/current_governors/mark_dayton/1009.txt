SEN. WARNER: Well, I hope that you'll be present --
SEN. DAYTON: Certainly it's well placed with the chairman and the ranking member. They will pull us all through, I have no doubt. And I look forward to supporting both of your nominations, and thank you for your service to our country.
And, Admiral, I'm impressed with your success in improving retention, and both my colleagues have touched on a couple of those areas. And you cited also in your answers some of the key ingredients.
