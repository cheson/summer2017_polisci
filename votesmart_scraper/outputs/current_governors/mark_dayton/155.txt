At the Freshwater Society's 2016 State of Water Conference today in Alexandria, Minnesota, Governor Mark Dayton called for a Year of Safe Water Action in Minnesota. Starting this summer, Governor Dayton and his Administration will begin a statewide, year-long push to inform Minnesotans about the serious challenges facing Minnesota's waters, gather input and ideas to address those challenges, and propose legislation to be considered in the 2017 Legislative Session to improve the quality of water in our state for generations to come.

"It is no longer responsible for us to look the other way, or ignore the facts of what is happening around us. They did that in Flint, Michigan. It is my responsibility -- and it is all Minnesotans' responsibilities -- to assure that catastrophe is not repeated here in Minnesota," said Governor Dayton. "I want Minnesotans to spend the next year focused on the problems facing our waters, and on developing solutions to them. So I am proclaiming that the year beginning on July 4, 2016, be a "Year of Safe Water Action' in Minnesota. I want all of us to ask what can we do, everywhere, to broaden public awareness about the quality of our water, recognize the responsibility we all have for it, and determine what we can all do, working together, to make it better."
