Today, MNsure announced that it has surpassed its enrollment goal, helping more than 136,000 Minnesotans access quality, affordable health care coverage. Following today's announcement, Governor Dayton released this statement.
"Surpassing the enrollment goal demonstrates the significant progress MNsure has made since December. This is a major achievement, but more must be done to improve MNsure's functionality and customer service for Minnesotans.
"I want to recognize all the employees who have worked countless hours to help more than 136,000 Minnesotans enroll in affordable health coverage. I encourage Minnesotans who have not yet enrolled in health care coverage, to do so by March 31st."
