Dayton Applauds Preston-Area Citizens for Persistence in Securing Environmental Impact Study of Tire-Burning Plant
Today, U.S. Senator Mark Dayton applauded Preston-area citizens for securing a commitment from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Citizens Board to conduct a thorough environmental impact study of a proposed tire-burning plant in Southeastern Minnesota. The plant would be the largest facility in the world to rely exclusively on waste tires for its fuel -- burning 375 tons of tires per day.
"Last night, after seven hours of citizens' testimony, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Citizens Board voted to require that an environmental impact study be done on the proposed waste tire burning plant in Preston," said Dayton. "I am proud that hundreds of Minnesotans stood up for what they believe in. All these citizens want is the highest possible level of environmental review. If the largest tire-burning facility in the world doesn't warrant a comprehensive environmental impact study then I don't know what project does.
"I applaud the action of the independent Citizens Board for doing the right thing for the people of Preston."
Dawn and Brian Schomisch and other members of the Southern Minnesota Action Committee praised Dayton's efforts on behalf of southeastern Minnesota residents: "Senator Mark Dayton's position to help citizens in requesting an environmental impact study for the tire burner proposed in Preston was the catalyst for many other elected officials and organizations to come forward and state their position for an environmental impact study as well. We want to thank Senator Dayton for his tenacity in standing with the people of Minnesota, in helping us protect ourselves."
