VISIT TO THE SENATE BY MEMBERS OF THE U.S.-CHINA INTERPARLIAMENTARY GROUP
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, reserving the right for a minute, I note that Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye performed a magnificent service to our Senate and to our country by hosting our distinguished guests from China in such a superb manner. They and their staffs put on a superlative discussion over these 2 days, and Senator Stevens recognized with his foresight the two countries will determine the future of the world. I commend Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye in particular for recognizing that and initiating these exchanges which are now in their second year. On behalf of the Senate and the country, we are in their debt.
