The U.S. Department of Transportation assured the State of Minnesota today that the state will receive up to $5 million in "Quick Release" emergency relief funds to help fix the state's flood-damaged roads. These funds, which will reimburse the state for emergency repair work done in the aftermath of statewide flooding, will supplement $750,000 in federal transportation funds the state received on June 23.
Governor Mark Dayton, who in June declared a peacetime state of emergency after heavy rains caused extensive flooding statewide, reached out to the Federal Highway Administration this week requesting additional help to repair flood-damaged Minnesota roads. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) will make these funds available to local agencies to assist with cash flow, and to help expedite local flood-related road repairs.
"The flood damage recently inflicted on Minnesota roads, highways, and bridges has been severe and widespread," said Governor Dayton. "These funds will speed up important repairs statewide."
Over the last several weeks, Governor Dayton has visited flood-affected communities in more than a dozen counties to meet with local emergency responders and asses flood damage across Minnesota. During the Governor's visits, local officials have frequently noted flood damage to local roads and bridges, emphasizing the need to repair that damage as quickly as possible. MnDOT repairs on state-owned infrastructure are already underway.
