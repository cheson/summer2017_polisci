The National Export Initiative today announced that it will conduct a national "New Markets, New Jobs" tour to help small businesses expand exports. The tour's first stop will be Minneapolis, Minnesota on February 17th. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk, Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills and Export-Import Bank Chairman Fred Hochberg will join Governor Dayton and Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak in working directly with local small and medium sized businesses at the day-long forum to talk about how they can expand their markets and create new jobs.

Governor Dayton is pleased to welcome the New Markets, New Jobs tour to Minnesota, and reiterated his Administration's focus on building a climate for economic growth and job creation.

"Delivering Minnesota products to expanded markets represents a tremendous opportunity for growth," said Governor Dayton. "Choosing Minnesota as the launch pad for a national focus on increasing exports underscores the entrepreneurial spirit of our state, and gives us yet another opportunity to expand local businesses and increase jobs. We will work directly with our local businesses, to help them leverage the public and private resources available to them to help expand into new markets. I look forward to working with Secretary Locke and the members of the National Export Initiative to create New Markets and New Jobs here in Minnesota."

More information on the tour and on the National Export Initiative are outlined below, in a news release from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The U.S. Department of Commerce is working in partnership with the Minnesota Trade Office on this initiative.
