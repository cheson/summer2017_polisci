Today, Governor Mark Dayton and Lt. Governor Tina Smith proposed a supplemental state budget that would protect Minnesota's financial future, while making critical investments in an economy that works better for all Minnesotans. Their plan would ensure long-term fiscal stability for Minnesota, protect the state's finances from future economic downturns, and secure needed investments for Minnesota children, families, and communities.

"When I took office in 2011, Minnesota faced a $6 billion budget deficit, and Minnesota's children, families, and communities suffered the consequences," said Governor Dayton. "The Supplemental Budget that Lt. Governor Smith and I are proposing would protect the financial stability of our state government, while making essential investments to continue to build a better Minnesota."

The budget proposed by Governor Dayton and Lt. Governor Smith would deliver tax cuts for over 400,000 Minnesota families, make needed investments in early learning to eliminate achievement gaps, rebuild the state's aging infrastructure, assure clean and affordable drinking water in our communities, and expand economic opportunity for all Minnesotans.
