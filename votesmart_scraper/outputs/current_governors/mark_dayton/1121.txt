WASHINGTON, DC - Senator Mark Dayton today released the following statement on the Medical Malpractice bill currently before the Senate:
"When the Senate reconvened today after a ten-day recess, I learned that the Majority Leader has scheduled floor action tomorrow on Medical Malpractice legislation. I am currently reviewing the proposed bill. I believe that something must be done to reduce the costs of medical malpractice insurance for doctors, hospitals, and other health-care providers, while not harming the unfortunate victims of serious medical errors. I will assess whether the proposed legislation would accomplish this goal."
