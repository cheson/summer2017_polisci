Today, the University of Minnesota released a new study showing that 180,500 Minnesotans have gained access to quality, affordable health insurance. Minnesota's uninsured rate fell by 41%, thanks in large part to the implementation of new health reforms. The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton.
"From offering the lowest health insurance rates in the nation, to securing the lowest uninsured rate in state history, health reform is working in Minnesota. Today, 180,500 more Minnesotans have affordable access to quality health insurance. We have more work to do to help ensure all Minnesotans are covered, but today's report demonstrates that health reform in Minnesota is headed in the right direction."
