Senate Passes Dayton-Coleman Resolution Commending Gopher Women's Hockey Team on Defending National Championship
Senate Resolution congratulates U of M women's hockey team on winning back-to-back NCAA National Championships
Today, the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Senators Coleman and Dayton, commending the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers women's hockey team for winning the 2004-2005 NCAA National Championship. With 1:08 remaining in the third period, Natalie Darwitz scored the game winning goal to catapult the Gophers to its second consecutive national championship, defeating Harvard University 4 to 3.
"On behalf of all Minnesotans, I congratulate the U of M Gophers women's hockey team on winning their second NCAA National Championship," said Coleman. "Their accomplishment is a huge addition to Minnesota's proud tradition of hockey. I am also pleased that these women have become a source of inspiration for young girls and boys throughout our country."
"I join with all Minnesotans in congratulating the University of Minnesota's women's hockey team on their second straight national championship title!" said Senator Mark Dayton. "I have written President Bush, asking him to once again host the team at the White House, and I have offered to host a Congressional reception as well."
In addition to defending the national championship, the Gophers finished this season with an astounding record, winning 36 games and only losing twice. "The Gophers truly had a phenomenal season. Watching it culminate in a championship was a thrill for all Minnesotans," Coleman added.
