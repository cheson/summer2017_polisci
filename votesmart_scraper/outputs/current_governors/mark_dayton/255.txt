In 2013, Governor Mark Dayton and the Minnesota Legislature passed legislation creating the framework for the Rochester Destination Medical Center initiative. The 20-year project is expected to help ensure that the City of Rochester remains a global destination for health and wellness, while creating 30,000 new jobs in Minnesota.
Today, the Destination Medical Center Corporation Board, chaired by Lt. Governor Tina Smith, announced that they have approved the first two development projects. Below is a statement from Governor Dayton on the news.
"I thank the Members of the DMCC Board for their outstanding leadership. The Chateau Theatre and the Broadway at Center project will create new jobs and bring decades of new investment to downtown Rochester. These projects are great news for the future of Rochester and for our state."
