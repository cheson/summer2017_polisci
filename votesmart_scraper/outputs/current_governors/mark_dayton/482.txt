This afternoon, the Minnesota Department of Revenue released a report showing that property taxes after refunds are going down for the first time in 12 years. Following the release of today's report, Governor Mark Dayton issued this statement.

"This drop in property taxes is good news for Minnesotans, who for years have been hammered by double-digit property tax increases. Thanks to the relief provided by the DFL Legislature last year, property taxes are actually going down statewide, for the first time in 12 years."
