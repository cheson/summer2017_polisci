Today, Governor Mark Dayton delivered his second State of the State address to a Joint Session of the Minnesota Legislature, laying out his vision for a better Minnesota. By stressing the need to make key investments to get Minnesota working again, Governor Dayton outlined a clear vision for future prosperity:
Invest in more jobs
Invest in a stronger education system
Invest in reform of government services
Governor Dayton called on business leaders and legislators to work with him to invest in more jobs in Minnesota. The Governor outlined investments that the legislature needs to make to promote job growth across the state. Excellence in education and quality infrastructure are essential to future growth and prosperity of Minnesota, and these investments make Minnesota communities great places to live. Governor Dayton also reaffirmed his commitment to reform government services, to make the government more efficient, and to lower procedural costs.
The Governor emphasized the importance of strong leadership during this time of economic recovery, saying "I often wonder how our children and grandchildren will judge our stewardship. Will they thank us for leaving our state, nation, and world in better condition than when we inherited it? Or will they ask, "How could you have left us with such a mess?" The answer is for us to decide.
"I am hopeful, because I believe in Minnesota. I believe in Minnesotans."

Dayton also emphasized the need to work together, noting that cooperation was the only path to solutions for the challenges we face: "If we cooperate, if we share our best ideas, if we exchange our rigid ideologies for our shared ideals, we will revitalize our state. And we will be doing the jobs the people of Minnesota sent us here to do."
