Press Release
By: Mark Dayton
Date: May 27, 2016
Location: St. Paul, MN

Today, Governor Mark Dayton has ordered all United States flags and Minnesota flags to be flown at half-staff at all state and federal buildings in the State of Minnesota, from sunrise until noon on Monday, May 30, 2016, in honor of those who have died while serving in the United States Military.

The United States and Minnesota flags are quickly raised to the tops of flagpoles, slowly lowered to half-mast, and then raised again to full height at noon. The time at half-mast is meant to honor American servicemen and women who have died for their country. Re-raising the flag is meant to symbolize the resolve of the living to carry on the fight for freedom so that the nation's heroes will not have died in vain.

Since 1868, Memorial Day has been observed in the United States of America to officially celebrate and honor the valiant sacrifice of those in the military who have given their lives in the name of service.

Across the nation, and in the State of Minnesota, Americans give thanks those who undertake the great responsibility of defending our liberties and protecting democracy. On Memorial Day, the United States of America and the State of Minnesota honor the spirit, courage, and tenacity of service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.
