Press Release

After eight Chippewa bands expressed strong concerns, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources announced today that the state will close the Mille Lacs Lake catch-and-release walleye season on Tuesday, September 6, 2016.

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton:

"Closing the walleye fishing season on Mille Lacs earlier this month would have devastated area businesses and communities. Thanks to the strong 2013 class of young walleye, we were able to keep the walleye season open on Mille Lacs without negatively impacting the health and future of the walleye fishery.

"I thank the Chippewa bands for their commitment to restoring the health of Mille Lacs and its walleyes. After assessing their concerns and the decreased economic impact on local businesses after Labor Day, I have directed the DNR to close Mille Lacs' catch-and-release walleye season on Tuesday, September 6, 2016.

"Mille Lacs continues to have world-class northern pike, muskie, and small mouth bass fishing. I invite Minnesotans and out-of-state tourists to enjoy excellent fishing for those species in the fall."
