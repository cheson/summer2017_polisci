SENATOR SUNUNU'S GOLDEN GAVEL
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I join the distinguished majority leader in expressing my appreciation for your presence here this evening. I assure the Chair I will not take him too far down the path to his next 100 hoursÂ—not tonight, anyway.
I was in the dubious position of being 100th in seniority for the previous 2 years. I did not achieve my golden gavel status as swiftly as the Senator from New Hampshire, but I did. I suffered through many hours when I would rather have been elsewhere in order to achieve that. I again thank the distinguished Chair and also commend him for the dignity and the stature with which he presides over what are, as we both know, occasionally unruly adults.
