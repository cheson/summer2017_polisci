AMENDMENT NO. 3097
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment numbered 3097 and I ask for its immediate consideration.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.
The legislative clerk read as follows:
The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton], for himself, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Menendez, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment numbered 3097.
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
The amendment is as follows:

Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent Senators Menendez and Clinton be added as cosponsors of this amendment.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment is a unique concept. It says the Senate will fulfill a 29-year-old commitment to fund 40 percent of the costs of special education. I appreciate the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, which was adopted by the Senate to bring us to 20 percent, which is half of that goal. That is an improvement.
But if we were to say the Defense Department was half funded, or national security or homeland security were half funded, we would find a reason to immediately increase that funding. So I respectfully submit that closing tax loopholes for corporations that are not paying taxes now and providing that money for special education for our students across this country is a worthy goal.
I urge adoption of the amendment. I will accept a voice vote.
