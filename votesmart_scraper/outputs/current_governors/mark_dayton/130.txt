As over 500,000 Minnesotans gear up to go fishing this weekend, Governor Mark Dayton is getting ready to host Minnesota's 69th Annual Governor's Fishing Opener at Big Sandy Lake in McGregor, Minnesota. Headquartered at Big Sandy Lake Lodge & Resort, the weekend's events will feature fishing, family fun activities, and a community picnic in downtown McGregor that is expected to draw a crowd of more than 2,000 Minnesotans.

The Governor's Fishing Opener has been a tradition in Minnesota since 1948. The event was designed to promote the development of Minnesota's recreation industry, and in recent years, it has served as a kick-off celebration for the summer tourism season. Fishing generates an estimated $2.4 billion in direct retail sales annually in Minnesota, supporting 35,000 jobs statewide. Minnesota has the second-highest angler participation rate of any state in the nation (32 percent).
