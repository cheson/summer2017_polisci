GULF OF MEXICO SECURITY ACT OF 2006--Continued -- (Senate - August 01, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an amendment I would have offered to the energy legislation that is before us. It should be my right as a Senator to offer such an amendment. It should be the right of any Senator to offer an amendment to legislation pending before the Senate.
Unfortunately, because of parliamentary maneuvering by the majority leader, Senators, including myself, will not be able to offer our amendments to this offshore drilling legislation. In the Senate vernacular, ``the tree has been filled'' with such gimmicks as changing the bill's effective date and then changing it back again. Those gimmicks restrict this legislation to being nothing more than a special interest boondoggle for the oil and natural gas industries, and for four Gulf States that would, for the first time, get a direct cut of that bonanza.
It is one thing to limit debate on a measure, as the Senate has chosen to do in this instance, and even though I voted against cloture, I can understand the desire of over 60 colleagues to proceed; but to prevent additional amendments related to our country's domestic energy production and consumption is uncalled for and unwise.
It makes a mockery of the Republican leader's promise on May 1 of this year, 3 months ago, that the Senate would vote this year on comprehensive energy legislation. His exact words were:
We [the Republican leadership] have presented a strong package that will give consumers relief at the pump and help bring down the high cost of gas. I'm hopeful that we will vote on this package in the coming days.
