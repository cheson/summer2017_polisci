Dayton: Senate Locks in Navigation Improvements to Upper Mississippi River in Water Resources Bill
Minnesota farmers stand to gain from long-awaited lock and dam modernization project included in today's Senate-passed water resources and development act
U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today announced that an important provision that would modernize the lock and dam infrastructure and provide for ecosystem restoration along the Upper Mississippi River is included as part of the Water Resources and Development Act ( S.728), which passed in the Senate. The renovation project, which would accelerate the shipping of grain along the Mississippi River to the Gulf Coast, has been long supported by Minnesota farming communities and the agricultural sector.
"The Mississippi River transports over 60 percent of all U.S. grain exports," said Dayton. "Modernizing the river's lock and dam system is vital to ensure that Minnesota grain farmers stay competitive in the global marketplace."
The legislation would authorize $1.8 billion in navigation improvements and $1.6 billion for ecosystem restoration on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway System. The lock system on the Upper Mississippi River is over 60 years old, and cannot accommodate modern barging practices, as barges have become larger than what the current lock and dams can hold. Congestion of barges occurs along the river, leading to delays in delivery and higher shipping costs for farmers.
The Upper Mississippi/Illinois project includes the construction of seven new 1,200-foot locks, five lock extensions, other navigational improvements and ecosystem restoration associated with the lock and dam upgrades.
