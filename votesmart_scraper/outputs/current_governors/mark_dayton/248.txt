Governor Mark Dayton today issued the following statement regarding the joint House and Senate E-12 education budget target.
"On E-12, I'll say it again, and I'll say it again, and I'll say it again: I'm going to veto $400 million because it's wrong for the people of Minnesota, the parents of Minnesota, the schoolchildren of Minnesota. It's wrong. It's totally unnecessary with a $1 billion bottom line and the $300 million coming down the pike.
They are saving that money for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, and property tax relief for large corporations. They are putting those as higher priorities than doing what's right for our school children and our young children. I'm just astonished that anyone would consider that. I'm sure as heck astounded that any Democrat would consider that."
