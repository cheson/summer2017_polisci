Revitalizing Minnesota's pheasant hunting tradition and improving pheasant habitat are goals of a four-year Pheasant Summit Action Plan resulting from the Minnesota Pheasant Summit convened by Gov. Mark Dayton in 2014.
"For 60 years, I have enjoyed pheasant hunting in Minnesota," said Governor Dayton. "The decisions we make today will determine whether future generations of Minnesotans will have those same opportunities. We must work together to increase the pheasant population in our state."
