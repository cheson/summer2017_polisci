Today U.S. Senator Mark Dayton joined 7 of his colleagues in voting against the nomination of Governor Mike Leavitt to be the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
"While I usually respect the President's nominations of individuals to fill key government leadership positions, I do not feel confident that his nominee for EPA Administrator is a candidate who would adequately protect the environment."
