Today, during a news conference at the Minnesota Judicial Center, Governor Mark Dayton announced his appointment of the Honorable Natalie E. Hudson as Associate Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. Judge Hudson will replace Associate Justice Alan C. Page, who will be retiring from the Court at the end of August.
Governor Dayton thanked Justice Page for his dedicated service to the State of Minnesota, especially for his service on the Supreme Court, where he has served as Associate Justice since 1993.
"Judge Natalie Hudson has served our state admirably as a member of the Minnesota Court of Appeals, and as Assistant Attorney General," said Governor Dayton. "During her distinguished 13-year tenure on the Court of Appeals, Judge Hudson has authored more than 1,100 written opinions, demonstrating clearly her unique aptitude for ruling on some of the most challenging legal issues facing our state today.
"Judge Hudson will be an outstanding new member of the Minnesota Supreme Court. I have great confidence that she will bring a valuable perspective to the Court, and continue the high standards of excellence, hard work, and fair-mindedness that Justice Page has embodied these last two decades."
"I am honored and humbled that the Governor has selected me to serve as the next Associate Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court," said Judge Hudson. "I am excited about the opportunity, and it is indeed a privilege to continue to serve the people of Minnesota in this capacity."
