Statement of Senator Dayton on the Nomination of Ambassador John D. Negroponte to become Director of National Intelligence
I voted to confirm Ambassador Negroponte, because he is well-qualified, and because I have been impressed with his service in his very difficult and dangerous role in Iraq.
I expressed my strong concerns about his reported activities while Ambassador to Honduras when I opposed his confirmation as Ambassador to Iraq. I believe that his performance in Iraq warrants this confirmation.
