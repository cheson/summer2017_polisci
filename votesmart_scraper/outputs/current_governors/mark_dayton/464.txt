Location: St. Paul, MN

Today, the Minnesota Senate passed a bill strengthening protections against bullying in Minnesota schools. The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton.
"There are presently only 37 words in Minnesota Statutes to protect our schoolchildren from the ever-increasing dangers of bullying. I support the stronger protections in the anti-bullying bill, which just passed the Minnesota Senate, to provide local school districts with the guidance and support they need to make it very clear that bullying will not be allowed in our schools."
