On Wednesday, December 30, 2015, Governor Mark Dayton was notified that Essar Steel Minnesota and its parent company, Essar Global Fund Ltd., have accepted his final offer for repayment of the state's $66 million loan.

"This project is tremendously important to the Iron Range, supporting more than 700 construction jobs and an expected 350 permanent jobs once the plant opens," said Governor Mark Dayton. "Essar Steel Minnesota CEO Madhu Vuppuluri's willingness to accept the state's final offer -- and repay the loan because it did not live up to the terms of its original agreement -- is an important step to move this project forward."
