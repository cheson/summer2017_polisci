AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004Â—CONTINUED
AMENDMENT NO. 2089
(Purpose: To provide emergency disaster assistance to Agricultural producers)
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is laid aside. The clerk will report.
The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:
The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. DAYTON] proposes an amendment numbered 2089.
Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
(The amendment is printed in today's RECORD under "Text of Amendments.")
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this summer farmers in my State of Minnesota suffered one of the worst droughts in the State's history. Throughout the critical months of July and August, Minnesota received no rain whatsoever. Those cloudless blue skies with lots of warm sunshine which are considered good summer weather become deadly when it becomes relentless. Ninety-five percent of Minnesota's crop acres suffered some loss as a result, and 62 of our 87 counties were declared by the Secretary of Agriculture to be disaster area counties. Yields, moisture content, and overall quality of crops were all adversely affected by this drought.
To add misery to injury, insect infestation attacked thousands of soybean acres in southern Minnesota, further destroying plants, lowering yields, and forcing already hard-pressed growers to spend $10,000, $20,000, or even more to spray their fields in order to fight off total devastation.
In total, Minnesota farmers lost more than $1.1 billion in expected crop revenues. That is over 30 percent of our State's total crop revenue.
Yet, tragically, another disaster afflicts those unfortunate farmers and thousands of other farmers who suffered similar losses in other States this year. That disaster is that there is no disaster aid funding in the current farm law which was enacted last year. The Senate bill that we passed here provided disaster aid. The House bill did not. The conference report, regrettably, took the House and the administration's position, with the result that if you are hurt by low prices, you are helped under the current law, but if you are devastated, you are on your own and receive no assistance whatsoever.
My amendment provides assistance when disaster does strike. It does so by starting with the formula that was used in last year's disaster aid bill; from losses exceeding 35 percent of total value, farmers received disaster aid payments equal to 65 percent of the losses above the 35 percent threshold. It is a survival payment. It is not a break-even and certainly not a profit payment.
My amendment also adds a lower reimbursement for losses between 25 percent and 35 percent of value. Formerly, those losses would have received no assistance whatsoever. This formula pays 40 percent of those losses between 20 percent and 35 percent of total value.
The amendment also covers unreimbursed losses during the 2001 and 2002 seasons. As my colleagues will recall, farmers who suffered disasters in both of those years were allowed to receive payments from losses in only one of them. In other words, disaster aid is Sophie's choice. This amendment would compensate those farmers for their losses in the second year.
My amendment as written covered program crop losses and specialty crop losses throughout the country. However, I have also added, at the request of other Members, losses suffered during the year, which means the amendment now covers losses of shrimp in Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas, and other losses which occurred in the States of Michigan, Florida, and California, as well as other national specialty crops.
The total cost of my amendment, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, is approximately $6.3 billion. Because it is, in my view, an emergency expenditure, I do not believe it requires, under the Budget Act, an offset, and I am not providing one.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, with due respect to the Senator from Utah, it seems to me that if we are going to measure whether something is an emergency by the extent of the emergency, we are misperceiving those situations.
I regret that the cost of this measure is estimated to be $6.3 billion, but that is a function of the extent of the disaster which has occurred nationwide. If disaster aid is not itself considered to be an emergency, frankly, I don't know what possibly could be under the Budget Act.
So, Madam President, I move to waive the budget point of order and ask for the yeas and nays.
