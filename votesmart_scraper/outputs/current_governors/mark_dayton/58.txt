Press Release

Location: St. Paul, MN

Reversing its original decision, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) today announced that it has approved assistance to individuals and households in southern Minnesota seriously impacted by heavy rainstorms and flooding on September 21-22, 2016. Governor Mark Dayton formally appealed FEMA's original decision to deny individual assistance on November 17, 2016.

"This aid is critical as Minnesotans work to rebuild their homes and communities after severe weather this fall," said Governor Mark Dayton. "I thank the Federal Emergency Management Agency for agreeing to my appeal to reverse its decision, and for providing this needed aid to Minnesotans who suffered significant flood and storm damage."

Governor Dayton originally requested the assistance for communities in southern Minnesota on October 19, 2016. The Governor's letter followed damage assessments by FEMA, HSEM, and local governments, which found $8.3 million in eligible public infrastructure damage and $10.1 million in estimated individual and household needs.
