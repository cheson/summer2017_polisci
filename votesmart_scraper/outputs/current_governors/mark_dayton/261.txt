Governor Orders DNR to End Practice of Collaring Moose in Minnesota
Press Release

Location: St. Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton today signed Executive Order 15-10, which requires the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to stop the practice of radio collaring moose in Minnesota, and to stop issuing new permits for moose radio collaring. Recent reports have brought to light that collaring of moose has resulted in the deaths of some adult moose, and puts calves in danger of abandonment by their mothers and may lead to a higher incidence of mortality. Governor Dayton's Executive Order requires that the DNR end the radio collaring practice immediately, and indefinitely.
"I respect that DNR researchers are trying to understand why our moose population is declining, " said Governor Dayton. "However, their methods of collaring are causing too many of the moose deaths they seek to prevent. Thus, I will not authorize those collaring practices to continue in Minnesota."
Since 2013, the DNR has used GPS tracking collars on adult and calf moose in order to learn more about the factors contributing to the declining moose population in Minnesota. Currently, more than 70 percent of young moose do not survive their first winter in Minnesota. Sixteen of the 74 newborn calves that have been collared by the DNR in their efforts to study the state's declining moose population have been abandoned by their mothers. Six of the 16 abandoned calves were placed at the Minnesota Zoo or other facilities.
