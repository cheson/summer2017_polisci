Press Release
By: Mark Dayton
Date: Jan. 31, 2014
Location: St. Paul, MN

This afternoon, Governor Mark Dayton and members of the state's Executive Council voted unanimously to extend Emergency Executive Order 14-02 for another 30 days. The order, initially issued by Governor Dayton on January 27, establishes a Peacetime State of Emergency in Minnesota to help relieve the severe shortage of propane and other home heating fuel supplies statewide. A peacetime emergency order cannot last longer than five days, but it may be extended by the Executive Council for up to 30 days (Minn. Stat., sec. 12.31, subdivision 2a).
At a news conference following today's meeting, Governor Dayton said: "The Executive Council was convened today because the Emergency Order I signed to deal with the propane crisis in Minnesota was set to expire after five days. The Executive Council needed to meet in order to extend that order for another 30 days, which we did unanimously this afternoon. We will continue doing everything necessary to help Minnesotans get through this crisis."
