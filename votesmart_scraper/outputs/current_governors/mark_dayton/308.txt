Today, the Minnesota Department of Education released a new report showing that Minnesota's graduation rate increased from 79.8 percent in 2013 to 81.2 percent in 2014. The report showed gains in graduation rates among all student groups over the last year. The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton.
"I congratulate Minnesota's students, teachers, and parents for this improvement. It is very encouraging; however, we must provide all our students with the quality educations and the support they need to graduate. Our new investments in all-day kindergarten and pre-K learning, which were approved by the Legislature last year, will help build upon this important progress."
