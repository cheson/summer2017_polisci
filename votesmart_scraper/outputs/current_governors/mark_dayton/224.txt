Statement
By: Mark Dayton
Date: Aug. 5, 2015
Location: St. Paul, MN

Thirty-six delegates representing Minnesota businesses, the state's agriculture industry, and education institutions will accompany Governor Mark Dayton on a trade mission to Mexico City and Guadalajara, beginning August 9, 2015. Governor Dayton will also be accompanied by Alberto Fierro, Consul of Mexico in St. Paul. During their visit, the delegation will meet with high-ranking Mexican business leaders and government officials, explore trade and investment opportunities, and renew common ties between Mexico and Minnesota.
"As Minnesota's second-largest export market, Mexico is a very important trading partner for businesses and farmers throughout our state," Governor Dayton said. "The goal of this trade mission will be to establish and build relationships that will help Minnesota companies and producers increase their exports to Mexico, and in doing so, create more jobs here at home."
