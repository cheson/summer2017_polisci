Statement of Senator Mark Dayton on Heartland Energy's Decision to Pull Plans for Preston Tire-Burning Plant
"The citizens of Preston won a tremendous victory yesterday, and they deserve all of the credit from stopping this tire-burning plant from threatening their future health and safety. They stood up against the corporation and the state agency, the Minnesota Pollution Cooperation Agency (MPCA), which, unfortunately, took the side of polluters rather than of the people. "I give the Preston community enormous credit for this success. I was very excited to be involved with them. They made the difference, and they showed what citizens united together can do on behalf of themselves, their children, and their environment."
