Location: St. Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton commended new federal rail safety regulations announced today by President Obama's U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx. The new regulations are a response to railway safety concerns in Minnesota, and across the country. Governor Dayton pushed the federal government to take action to improve railway safety standards, detailing the increasing volume of oil shipments through the state, and the dangers those shipments pose to Minnesota residents. Secretary Foxx and Governor Dayton spoke on the phone this morning to discuss the new federal regulations, and the impacts they will have in Minnesota.
"These new federal regulations are important steps toward improving the safety of Minnesotans," said Governor Dayton. "However, other improvements to rail safety are urgently needed to provide Minnesotans with the protections they need. I urge the Minnesota legislature to pass my Rail Safety legislation before their adjournment."
