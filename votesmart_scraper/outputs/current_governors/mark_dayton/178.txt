Today, the University of Minnesota and the State Health Access Data Assistance Center released a new study showing that between 2013 and 2104, 38,000 Minnesota children gained access to quality health care coverage. That is a 44 percent drop in the uninsured rate for children ages 0 to 18 in a single year. The greatest gains in insurance were among low-income kids, and children of color. According to the study, Minnesota now has the 8th-lowest children's uninsured rate in the country, with 48,000 Minnesota kids still lacking health care. The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton.

"This is fantastic news! This report is more evidence that the health reforms Minnesota has embraced are working. We have covered 38,000 more kids, cut our state's overall uninsured rate by over 40 percent, and saved $1.65 billion through managed care and other health reforms.

"Still, there are some who say we should roll back that progress, and shrink from our responsibility to help more Minnesotans access quality, affordable health care. Nothing would be more foolish or irresponsible.

"We have made great progress. But with 48,000 Minnesota kids still uninsured, we clearly have more work to do. I look forward to working with the Legislature to make certain all children have the quality health care they need to live healthy, productive lives."
