This afternoon, Governor Mark Dayton met privately with 11 individuals and family members who are advocating this legislative session for the legalization of medical marijuana. Following the meeting, Press Secretary Matt Swenson provided the following statement to members of the press:

"Governor Dayton was grateful for the opportunity this afternoon to spend time with these Minnesotans, and hear their stories. Following the meeting, the Governor said it was difficult to see that so many good Minnesotans are enduring such pain and suffering.

"During the two-hour meeting, Governor Dayton listened to the stories of each individual to better-understand their needs and concerns. The discussion also included a conversation about concerns that have been voiced by members of law enforcement and the medical community.

"Governor Dayton has directed his Chief of Staff Jaime Tincher, Senior Policy Advisor Joanna Dornfeld, and Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger, to continue working with medical marijuana advocates, and other groups, to see if a compromise agreement can be reached this session on this matter."
