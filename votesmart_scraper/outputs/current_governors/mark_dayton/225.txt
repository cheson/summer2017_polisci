Governor Mark Dayton has taken executive action to ensure citizen engagement in environmental regulatory decisions. Executive Order 15-15, signed today by Governor Dayton, creates the Governor's Committee to advise the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The Committee will provide input and recommendations prior to certain regulatory decisions made by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). It will be chaired by the Commissioner of the MPCA and include eight citizen members serving four-year terms. It will meet on a regular basis to guide the direction and enforcement of the state's environmental protection laws.
"As regulators make decisions, and enforce our state's environmental protection laws, Minnesota citizens need and deserve a seat at the table," said Governor Dayton. "I am proud to sign this Executive Order today, and look forward to appointing a group of qualified, committed citizen leaders to carry out this important work."
