Governor Dayton signed an executive order today establishing a Vision for Health Care Reform in Minnesota. To achieve that vision, the Governor charged a Task Force made up of state leaders in health care to begin developing an action plan outlining how to deliver Minnesotans better health care at a lower cost. As seen in the news release, Governor Dayton said:

"Minnesota historically has led the nation and the world in the quality of our health care systems and the healthiness of our residents. Minnesota also has been a leader in reforms that have expanded access to quality health care for all Minnesotans. We must continue to innovate, and there is real urgency to our mission. Health care costs are rising at unsustainable rate, undermining the budgets of Minnesota families, businesses, and our state and federal government budgets. The status quo is not good enough; we need to find new ways to delivering better quality health care at a lower price. The mission of this task force is to provide recommendations about how we best can accomplish this."
In a related effort, the Minnesota Department of Commerce also announced the formation of a Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange Advisory Task Force. This task force will focus specifically on managing how federal health care reform is implemented here in Minnesota via the development of a state-run Health Insurance Exchange.
These reforms are the latest in the Dayton Administration's broad work to build a Better Government for a Better Minnesota.
More information, including the names of the members of both task forces, can be found in the full announcement.
