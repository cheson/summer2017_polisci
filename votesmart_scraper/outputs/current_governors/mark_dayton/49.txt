Governor Mark Dayton today released his first budget proposal of the 2017 legislative session, calling for a 25 percent reduction in health insurance premiums for the more than 125,000 Minnesotans facing significant increases in the individual market.

"For more than two months, I have proposed this relief, so that 125,000 Minnesotans can better afford the health care they need and deserve," said Governor Dayton. "I urge the legislature to agree to health insurance premium relief immediately, so that we can get help to the Minnesotans who need it most."

The Governor's plan would reduce the average premium increase facing Minnesotans in the individual market from 55 percent to 16 percent. Under the Governor's plan, some families could save as much as $594 per month on their health insurance premiums. If approved today, Minnesotans could start seeing relief by March 1st, with subsidies being retroactive, to reimburse the high costs some Minnesotans are already paying. Governor Dayton is calling for legislators to approve this relief by this Friday, January 6, 2017.

Governor Dayton first proposed a premium relief plan in October. But legislative leaders were unable to come to agreement on the plan, leaving more than 125,000 Minnesotans facing rising health insurance premiums. If the Governor's proposal had been passed during a special session, it could have taken effect immediately in January, and would have given Minnesotans some certainty about what their premium costs would be, and what they could afford.
