Location: Saint Paul, MN

Today, Governor Mark Dayton signed House File 141/Senate File 121 into law. The new law increases the penalties for people who injure or kill police or other public safety dogs. He was joined at the signing ceremony by DPS Commissioner Ramona Dohman, Senator Dan Hall, Representative Tony Cornish, Roseville Police Officer John Jorgensen and his German Shepherd canine partner, K-9 Major.

Public safety dogs are valuable partners to police and peace officers, and they provide an irreplaceable service to the State of Minnesota. Like the police and peace officers they work with, these dogs face danger every day, for the sake of protecting the public.

The signing of this bill signals Governor Dayton's continued commitment to protecting Minnesota counties and cities, and the people, and canines, who work tirelessly to keep Minnesota cities safe.

Governor Dayton said "I am grateful for the service that police officers and their canine partners provide to Minnesota citizens, risking their lives to keep us safe. I want to thank Rep. Cornish and Sen. Hall for authoring the legislation. Roseville Police Officer John Jorgensen and his German Shepherd partner, K-9 Major, deserve special recognition. Major was stabbed four times in the back and was paralyzed as a result. This tragedy led to the passage of the bill I am proud to sign into law today."
