With the first day of school just weeks away for many districts, Governor Mark Dayton met yesterday with nearly 300 school superintendents from across Minnesota to discuss the status of education in our state. Governor Dayton reviewed the progress Minnesota has made over the last four years to reinvest in our schools, support our students and teachers, and ensure that all children have access to a world-class education.
"When I campaigned four years ago, I talked about a better Minnesota in general," said Governor Dayton. "In particular, with education I said that I would set aside money and increase spending in real dollars for education every year, with no excuses and no exceptions. I'm proud and pleased to say that I've kept that promise."
After a decade of stagnant funding and budget cuts, Governor Dayton has reinvested in our schools. Since taking office in 2011, Governor Dayton has invested $895 million in E-12 education, paid back all the $2.8 billion previously borrowed from our schools, and frozen tuition or increased financial aid for more than 482,000 Minnesota college students and graduates. These major investments will give Minnesota students the high-quality education they need to succeed in school and life and compete in today's global economy.
In fact, since 2011 the Governor increased the school funding formula by $371 million to provide more funding for every school in the state. This year, the Governor also passed legislation to invest in all-day Kindergarten to ensure that every Minnesota student has free access.
Alongside these historic investments for E-12 education, Mark Dayton also heavily invested in higher education in our state. Governor Dayton froze tuition for students at the University of Minnesota and MnSCU for two years, which helped make college more affordable for 282,000 students.
He also signed tax cuts to provide direct tax relief to Minnesota students and funded the largest increase in direct financial student aid in state history to increase State Grant awards and expand the program to make an additional 15,000 students eligible for financial aid.
By reinvesting in our schools and supporting our students and teachers, Governor Dayton has done his part in ensuring that all students in Minnesota have access to a world-class education and serve as contributing members of society.
