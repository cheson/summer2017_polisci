As Commissioner, I helped design and then implemented the MN Economic Development Authority, The Minnesota Fund, the legislature's "Enterprise Zones" and the Star City program. They helped bring thousands of new jobs, with good wages and benefits, to unemployed workers throughout Minnesota.
As Governor, I will use a state stimulus package, bonding for more highway and mass transit projects, and innovative economic growth initiatives to create new jobs throughout our state. I will travel throughout our state, nation, and world, asking businesses what they need to locate or expand in Minnesota.
