Below is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton regarding a 26-week extension of unemployment benefits for Iron Range workers.

"I am very pleased to finally sign into law today the bill, which provides 26 weeks of additional benefits to unemployed workers on the Iron Range. I salute the Senate Majority Leader, Tom Bakk, for his heroic efforts to pass this legislation. And I thank all of the Range legislators for their hard work to bring these urgently needed benefits to their constituents. I know they share my frustration that it took so long to accomplish.

"I support the reduction in unemployment taxes for Minnesota's businesses, provided in the other bill I have signed today, although I disagree with the tactics used to pass it. Nevertheless, I thank Speaker Daudt for resolving with Senator Bakk this legislative impasse. I hope today's results will show the way to the resolution of future legislative differences."
