Foreign Trade Deficit
In my last Dayton's Account, I described the drastic changes in the federal government's financial condition during the last three years, from a budget surplus in 2000 to a record-high deficit of $374 billion in 2003. An even worse deficit of almost $500 billion is predicted for 2004.
Our country is running another deficit of almost $500 billion a year, which is our foreign trade deficit. Our imports of goods from other countries cost us almost $470 billion more than the value of goods we exported during the past year. That trade deficit is over five times greater than just a decade ago.
One cause of this surge in foreign imports is the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"), between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Another is the expansion of trade with China. Those trade agreements were supposed to benefit all of the participating countries. Our exports into each country were supposed to increase as much as our imports from them.
Instead, the results have been very lopsided; our imports have increased far more than our exports. In 1993, the last year before NAFTA, we enjoyed a small trade surplus with Mexico; in 2002, we had a deficit of over $37 billion! Our trade deficit with Canada is over four times greater than before NAFTA.
Those imbalances, however, pale in comparison to our trade deficit with China. In 2002, we exported $22 billion worth of goods to China; we imported $125 billion worth of goods, mostly manufactured products, from China! This imbalance has been highly beneficial for China. In 2003, foreign countries invested over $53 billion in China; in 2004, total foreign investment is expected to reach $57 billion. These investments helped fund a 9.1 percent growth in China's economy last year. There was no recession over there!
