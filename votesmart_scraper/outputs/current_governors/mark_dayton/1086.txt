Dear Mr. Card:
We are writing to ask for your immediate and public assurance that the White House is taking every step necessary to preserve relevant evidence and ensure the full cooperation of White House personnel in the investigation into the apparently illegal disclosure of a covert CIA operative's identity.
Our government has no greater responsibility than to protect and advance our national security, and the people who work for our government have no greater obligation than to protect and defend those spending and risking their lives for our national security. Yet it now appears that one or more high level Bush Administration officials took it upon themselves to act contrary to that responsibility and that obligation. In an apparent reaction to Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson's credible allegations about the Administration's manipulation of intelligence information, some high level Bush Administration officials reportedly decided to identify the Ambassador's wife as a covert government operative. This action potentially endangered not just her, but the many people who may have associated with her and provided help to the United States. When people abroad worked with Ambassador Wilson's wife to aid our national security, many knew that they risked much to do so. But they undoubtedly never would have thought that the risks include the possibility that a high level Bush Administration appointee would intentionally put into the press information that would jeopardize their safety or their lives. Those individuals trusted our government, and someone in our government apparently breached that trust.
