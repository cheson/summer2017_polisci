AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION -- (Senate - February 08, 2006)
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Loring Community School, in Minneapolis, MN, which recently earned an Award for Excellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements in educating children.
Loring Community School is truly a model of educational success. This neighborhood elementary school, which educates children in kindergarten through fifth grade, is named for the distinguished Charles M. Loring, father of the Minneapolis Park System and first president of the Park Board.
Loring Community School prepares children for lifelong learning in a respectful environment that nurtures their growth into knowledgeable, skilled, responsible, and confident citizens capable of succeeding personally as well as professionally. The school is 45 percent African American, 29 percent white, and 22 percent Asian. Seventy-two percent of the children are from low-income families.
The school's success is firmly rooted in basic community values. Each child is treated like an important person, in the classroom and in the school, which sets high standards and expectations for all children, in order to foster growth academically, socially, and personally. Loring School also emphasizes the importance of family involvement, to encourage the educational success of their children.
Loring School goes well beyond the basics, offering a number of enrichment programs, including accelerated math and reading programs, a Math Master competition, a science fair, an art fair, band, and a fifth grade environmental camping experience. A special feature is the student-run radio station, KBEM Radio. All Loring pupils have opportunities to participate in dance, music, theater, and visual art enrichment programs.
