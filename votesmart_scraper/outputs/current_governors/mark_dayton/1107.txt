NOMINATIONS
DAYTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
General Schoomaker, my state does not have an active base so the Reserve and the National Guard are our A-team. All the active bases are in the states like Virginia and Michigan and Alabama, Hawaii, Nebraska, Georgia. We were going to change that (inaudible) order.

So I am a co-sponsor with Senator Graham, my colleague across the table there, his proposal to make the health benefits for the Reserves and National Guardsmen and women full time since so many of them are now being called into service almost full time.
