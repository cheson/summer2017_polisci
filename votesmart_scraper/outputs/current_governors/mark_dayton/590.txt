Today, Governor Mark Dayton released his bonding proposal for the 2012 legislative session, building on his jobs plan to get Minnesotans back to work. The Governor's bonding proposal is focused on making the kind of long term investments proven to create jobs. The bill would put up to 21,700 Minnesotans back to work by investing in improvements in infrastructure, our colleges and universities, and many other regional economic development projects.
"This bill is our chance to put thousands of Minnesotans back to work by investing in important projects throughout our state. My bonding proposal makes reasonable, focused investments on projects that are ready for immediate action. I hope that the legislature will join me in growing Minnesota's economy now by passing a bonding bill in the first month of the session. Doing so will enable many of the projects, and their jobs, to become realities this year," Governor Dayton said.
Governor Dayton was joined for today's announcement by representatives from the Hormel Institute in Austin and the Harriet Tubman Center East in Maplewood. The Governor's bonding proposal includes $13.5 million for an expansion of the Hormel Institute, which would create 125 high-paying bioscience jobs, in addition to hundreds more jobs related to construction and residual economic impact. The Tubman Center would receive $3.4 million in funding for improvements to their Maplewood location. The Tubman Center operates two metro-area domestic violence shelters and offers a range of legal, educational and mental health services to women children and families.
Investing in strong, reliable infrastructure is a critical part of building an environment where businesses can thrive. Repairing our roads, bridges and rail lines for the future with smart investments can not only give Minnesota the assets to attract businesses, but can also put hundreds of Minnesotans back to work in the construction industries that are suffering from high unemployment. Infrastructure investments in the Governor's proposal include:

· $30 million construction and repair of bridges
· $25 million for the Southwest Corridor Light Rail

The Governor's bonding proposal also includes investments in our state's education system to ensure that our workforce is prepared to fill the jobs available to them in the future. Highlights of the education projects in the proposal include:

· $63.5 million for MNSCU -- Including projects at Minneapolis Community and Technical College, Ridgewater College in Willmar, Century College in White Bear Lake, South Central College in Faribault, Southwest Minnesota State University in Marshall, St. Paul College, Anoka-Ramsey Community College, Minnesota West Community and Technical College in Worthington and Dakota County Community and Technical College.
· An additional $17.5 million in funding for construction of a new Bioscience and Health Careers addition at North Hennepin Community College.
· $78 million for the University of Minnesota system.

Projects, which enhance the downtowns of regional centers and create jobs, are also important parts of Governor Dayton's proposal. They include:

· $35 million for expansion of the Rochester Mayo Civic Center
· $10.1 million for design and construction of the St. Cloud Civic Center
· $14.5 million for an expansion of the Mankato Civic Center
· $27 million for the design and construction of a new regional ballpark in St. Paul
· $13.5 million for the expansion of the Hormel Institute in Austin for new research labs and technological improvements.
· $3.4 million for improvements to the Harriet Tubman Center East in Maplewood. The community center provides housing and support programs to individuals and families in crisis.
