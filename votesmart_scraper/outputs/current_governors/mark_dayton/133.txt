Governor Mark Dayton Signs Emergency Executive Order 16-03
Press Release
By: Mark Dayton
Date: May 6, 2016
Location: St. Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton today signed Emergency Executive Order 16-03, providing for emergency assistance to the Minnesota Interagency Fire Center (MIFC) from the Minnesota National Guard.

A wildfire is currently active in Hubbard County, threatening property near Lake Hattie Township. Most other counties in the northern two-thirds of the state currently have an active Red Flag Warning, with conditions of elevated fire danger present in all other counties. These conditions are expected to remain for the next several days.

Because the MIFC, State Emergency Operations Center, and Minnesota Department of Natural Resources do not have adequate resources for widespread wildfire suppression and have requested assistance, Governor Dayton has ordered the National Guard to provide the personnel and equipment necessary to support wildfire suppression in Minnesota, until their support is no longer needed.
