Today, Minnesota's Olmstead Plan, which is designed to ensure that people with disabilities are able to live, learn, work, and enjoy life in the most integrated setting of their choosing, was approved by US District Judge Donovan Frank. The plan charts a course that will change the way state government provides services and supports for Minnesotans with disabilities.

In his ruling, Judge Frank wrote, "The Court applauds the parties for their collaboration in developing this landmark Olmstead Plan. Simply put, this revision of the Olmstead Plan is unlike any other version submitted to the Court. The Court fully expects the State to act on its promises to ensure that the Olmstead Plan will truly put the promise of Olmstead into practice across the state."

"I thank the Court for approving Minnesota's plan," said Governor Mark Dayton. "We will continue to work hard to improve life opportunities for Minnesotans with disabilities."
