Dayton Joins in Rally to Protect Social Security and Stop Privatization
U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today released the following statement as he rallied with his Democratic colleagues in the Senate and the House against privatizing Social Security. Over 765,000 Minnesotans currently depend on Social Security benefits, receiving an estimated $7.4 million each year.
"The President continues to tour the country, attempting to sell his Social Security privatization plan to the American public, but the public is not buying," said Dayton. "People who have worked their whole lives contributing to the system, having played and paid by the rules, have earned those benefits.
"We need a plan that will strengthen the retirement security of all Americans, not one that will result in deep benefit cuts for retirees and balloon the federal deficit."
Recent figures show that the President's Social Security proposal would cost $754 billion over the next five years; $4.4 trillion over the next 20 years.
