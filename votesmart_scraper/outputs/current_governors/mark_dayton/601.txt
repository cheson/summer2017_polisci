Building on the Administration's success in streamlining the permitting process for businesses while preserving environmental protections, Governor Mark Dayton signed Executive Order 11-32 today, ordering the Environmental Quality Board to conduct an assessment and deliver recommendations to improve Minnesota's complex environmental review process.

The announcement builds on the Dayton Administration's successful model of permitting reform. In just seven months, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued more than 1,300 new permits within the Governor's goal of 150 days or less. This 96% success rate in new permits has played a critical role in ensuring the department is "moving at the speed of commerce" so businesses can grow and retain jobs in Minnesota.

"What we've shown is that Minnesota can promote job growth and industry development by approving permits in a timely manner, while protecting our natural resources at the same time. Applying the same approach to the environmental review process allows us to continue making common sense reforms that address the concerns of both the business and environmental communities in our state," Governor Dayton said.

Governor Dayton's Executive Order calls for three significant evaluations to be conducted by the Environmental Quality Board, including recommendations on simplifying Minnesota's environmental review process and governance, which are in line with the recommendations set out earlier this year by the Legislative Auditor. The order also directs the state to develop an environment and energy "report card' to track the state's performance and report results on environmental protections.
