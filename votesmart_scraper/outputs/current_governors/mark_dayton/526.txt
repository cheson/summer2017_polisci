When I was growing up, I heard a story about how the legendary University of Minnesota football coach, Bernie Bierman, recruited big, strong players for his national championship teams. Reportedly, he drove through Minnesota farm country in the springtime. When he saw a young man walking behind a plow, he stopped and asked for directions to a nearby town. If the young man pointed with his finger, the coach drove on. If, however, the farm boy lifted the plow to point the direction, Bernie recruited him to play football at the U!
Whether or not that story is true, it tells the truth about the strength and spirit of Minnesota farmers. Today's agriculture requires not only physical strength but also many other skills, to manage complex businesses, overcome all kinds of obstacles, and survive serious setbacks.
Last year, hot, dry weather caused severe drought conditions, which damaged some farmers' crops and destroyed others throughout our nation's farm belt. This year, cold, wet weather ruined hay crops and delayed other plantings.
And when it's not the weather, it's Washington. The continuing failure of Congress to pass a new farm bill, almost a year after the old one ended, prolongs the uncertainties for everyone whose livelihoods are affected by those policies and programs.
Nevertheless, throughout Minnesota's 155 years of statehood, through all kinds of weather and politics, two things have remained unchanged.
First, agriculture has remained the life-giving bedrock of our state's economy -- supporting more than 340,000 people and delivering over $7 billion in high-quality agricultural and food exports last year alone. When farmers do well, businesses on Minnesota's Main Streets do well; and our entire state economy grows stronger.
