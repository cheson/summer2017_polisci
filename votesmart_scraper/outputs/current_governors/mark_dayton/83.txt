Statement from Governor Dayton on Mille Lacs Lake Walleye Fishing Season
Statement

Location: St. Paul, MN

Today, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources announced that the most recent Mille Lacs Lake walleye harvest estimate indicates anglers have surpassed the state's 2016 walleye quota. The state, however, will not close the catch-and-release walleye season at this time.

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton:

"I have directed the DNR not to close the walleye fishing season on Lake Mille Lacs, and I have contacted tribal leaders to ask for their understanding and forbearance. The DNR has already imposed a very stringent, catch-and-release only, restriction on this season.

"Closing the walleye fishing season on Mille Lacs would devastate area businesses and communities. The State's fisheries experts have assured me that continuing catch-and-release on Mille Lacs will not negatively impact the health of the walleye fishery.

"We will continue to do everything possible, working with area business, community, and tribal leaders, to assure the long-term health and sustainable recovery of the Mille Lacs walleye fishery."
