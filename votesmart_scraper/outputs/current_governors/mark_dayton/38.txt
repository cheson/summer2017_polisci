Today, the Office of the Legislative Auditor released their findings regarding the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority (MSFA). The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton.

"I welcome the findings of the Office of the Legislative Auditor, and the recommendations this report has provided. I am confident the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority (MSFA), its Chair, and its Board will take care in responding to these recommendations, as they work to uphold the highest standards of accountability and public confidence in the stadium's operations.
"Chair Michele Kelm-Helgen, Executive Director Ted Mondale, their administrative team, and the MSFA Board have already demonstrated their exceptional dedication and ability in completing this world-class stadium. They built for the people of Minnesota a multi-purpose stadium on-time and on-budget, while employing over 7,000 workers, 39 percent of whom were minorities.

"The MSFA's successes have triggered over $1 billion in new business investments and several thousand new jobs in East Minneapolis. Today, the stadium's daily operations employ 3,000 people, 60 percent of whom are men and women of color. And one year from now, the stadium will host the premiere international event of the year: the Super Bowl, which is expected to bring more than $400 million to Minnesota.
"Nonetheless, I expect a handful of legislators will ignore these accomplishments, and instead deride and impugn the dedicated public officials who made these successes possible. Their attempts to use this single episode to achieve their own political objectives do nothing to benefit the stadium's operations or advance the public good."
