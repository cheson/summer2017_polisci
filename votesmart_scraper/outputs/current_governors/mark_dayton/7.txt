Location: St. Paul, MN

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton regarding local government preemption legislation.
"It is unconscionable that Republican legislators would pit the earned financial security of hardworking state employees and retirees against the rights of local officials to make the decisions for which they were elected by their citizens. Nevertheless, I have said that I will veto the preemption bill, and I will honor that commitment."
