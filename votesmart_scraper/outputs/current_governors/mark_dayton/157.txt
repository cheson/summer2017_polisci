Commissioner Hardy will succeed Katie Clark Sieben, who today announced she will step down effective Friday, April 22, to pursue other opportunities.

"Commissioner Clark Sieben's devoted service to the people and businesses of Minnesota has improved our state's economy. During her tenure, Minnesota was named "America's Top State for Business' by CNBC, and earned numerous accolades for job creation. I thank her for her excellent work, and wish her the best as she begins the next chapter of her career," said Governor Dayton.

"Shawntera Hardy will be an outstanding Commissioner of Employment and Economic Development," he said. "As a member of my senior leadership team, she has consistently demonstrated her exceptional ability to manage complex organizations and engage a wide variety of viewpoints in solving difficult problems. Ms. Hardy shares my commitment to eliminating economic disparities in our state, and building an economy that works for all Minnesotans, everywhere in Minnesota. I will strongly support her efforts to continue the progress that Commissioner Clark Sieben began."

Since her appointment to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff in the Office of the Governor and Lt. Governor in March 2015, Ms. Hardy has worked on a wide range of policy and operational issues. As a member of the Governor's senior leadership team, she has coordinated the Administration's response to crises impacting the state, including floods, fires, and public health emergencies. Ms. Hardy has been instrumental in advancing the Administration's policy initiatives, helping manage Minnesota's state agencies, and expanding the state's community outreach efforts. She has also helped lead the Governor's efforts to diversify the ranks of state government, and expand economic opportunity for Minnesotans of color.

"Minnesota has a strong and growing economy, made possible by the many successful businesses and hard-working people who call Minnesota home," said Commissioner Hardy. "Despite our nation-leading progress in business development and job creation, we have much more work to do to ensure all Minnesotans share in our state's economic prosperity. I am honored by Governor Dayton's appointment, and grateful for his confidence in me to lead this important agency. I look forward to working with the staff at DEED, employers, communities, and the hard-working people across our state to build an economy that works for all people, everywhere in Minnesota."

Prior to her service in the Office of the Governor and Lt. Governor, Ms. Hardy worked in senior leadership positions at several Minnesota companies and nonprofits, and she owns and operates two small businesses. Ms. Hardy worked as a policy director at Fresh Energy, where she worked on environmental and transportation policy, and as manager of government relations for HealthPartners' hospital division. Before joining HealthPartners, Hardy served as a city planner for the City of Saint Paul and as a legislative assistant in the Ohio House of Representatives. Additionally, Ms. Hardy is a co-founder and the director of strategic growth for Civic Eagle -- a civic technology and data analytics company committed to developing tools that bridge civic engagement and social networking. She is also the founder of PolicyGrounds Consulting, LLC -- a policy and planning strategy firm.

"Minnesota's businesses, our workforce, and our communities will be well-served by the leadership of Commissioner Shawntera Hardy," said Lt. Governor Tina Smith. "Commissioner Hardy's life-long commitment to organizational change and her experience leading in both public and private sector organizations have prepared her well for this important position. Shawntera will continue to be a great asset to our Administration and Minnesota as Commissioner. I am proud to serve with her."
