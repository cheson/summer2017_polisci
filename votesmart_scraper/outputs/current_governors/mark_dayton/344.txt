Today, Governor Mark Dayton invited Minnesotans to register for the state's first-ever Minnesota Pheasant Summit, which will be held at Southwest Minnesota State University in Marshall on December 13, 2014. The Minnesota Pheasant Summit will bring together hunters, farmers, conservationists, policymakers, key members of the Governor's Cabinet, and others. During the Summit, participants will discuss strategies to increase the state's pheasant population, improve pheasant habitat, and ensure that future generations of Minnesotans have opportunities to enjoy one of the state's most popular and iconic game birds. Governor Dayton first announced plans for the Summit at a Pheasants Forever event last month.

"For almost 60 years, I have enjoyed pheasant hunting in Minnesota," said Governor Dayton. "But the decisions we make today will determine whether future generations of Minnesotans will have those same opportunities. I look forward to convening this Minnesota Pheasant Summit, and developing strategies to improve the pheasant population in our state."

According to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the state's pheasant population index is up 6 percent over 2013. Despite this slight increase, the state's pheasant population is still 58 percent below the 10-year average, and 71 percent below the long-term average. The Minnesota Pheasant Summit will focus on why the pheasant population has declined in Minnesota, and what collaborative efforts can be undertaken to improve pheasant habitat statewide.
