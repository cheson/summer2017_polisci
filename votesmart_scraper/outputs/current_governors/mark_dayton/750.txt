Statement by U.S. Senator Mark Dayton on the President's Immigration Address
The President's proposals to secure our borders and end widespread employment of illegal immigrants should have started five years ago. Unfortunately, President Bush has not practiced what he preached tonight. He and the Republican-controlled Congress have refused to fund the 2,000 additional border security agents or the 8,000 additional detention beds that were authorized after 9/11. His audits of employers using illegal immigrants is only ¼ the number under President Clinton. That is why the 9/11 Commission gave him a "D" in its national security Report Card last year.
I do agree with the President that only comprehensive reform will be effective in stopping illegal immigration. I am hopeful that the Senate will pass such legislation during the next two weeks.
