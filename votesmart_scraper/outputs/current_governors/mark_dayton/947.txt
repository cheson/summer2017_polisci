Hearing of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry on Examining the Effects of BSE on U. S. Imports and Exports of Cattle and Beef
STATEMENT OF HON. MARK DAYTON, A U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA
Senator Dayton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Secretary, this, as the record should show, is not a policy of your creation, but you have inherited it. It
continues the very unfortunate pattern in U.S. trade policies of harming American businesses and workers and shifting
production and jobs to other countries. This policy that has been proposed creates a dream world for Canadian producers and
processors and nightmares for American cattle producers, processors, and the workers in those industries. It is no
wonder then that they are increasingly cynical toward and distrustful of their government. Today it is imperative, and we
still have the opportunity, to put this Federal Government policy back on the side of Americans rather than foreigners.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
