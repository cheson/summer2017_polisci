Location: St. Paul, MN

As Water Action Week concludes on Earth Day, Governor Mark Dayton today honored three Minnesota "Water Heroes" for their efforts to protect and improve the quality and availability of water in Minnesota, and around the world. Patty Hall, former teacher and co-founder of H2O for Life, Northfield farmer Dave Legvold, and Pentair Chairman and CEO Randall Hogan were honored for their water-saving work today at a ceremony in the Governor's Office. Governor Dayton offered his personal thanks to each recipient, and encouraged Minnesotans to learn from and emulate their exemplary actions.

"My father, Bruce Dayton, taught me that good stewardship is one of our most important responsibilities: to take what we have been given, or have acquired, and leave it in better condition for those who will inherit it from us," said Governor Dayton. "As Minnesotans, who have inherited this incredible state, we have no greater shared responsibility than our stewardship: to protect and improve the priceless natural resources, which we will pass on to our children and grandchildren. That wise stewardship is everyone's challenge and everyone's opportunity."

As Governor Dayton concludes his Water Action Week on Earth Day, he also called on Minnesotans to contact their legislators to urge them this session to enact new investments in clean water infrastructure to assure clean, affordable water for all Minnesotans.
