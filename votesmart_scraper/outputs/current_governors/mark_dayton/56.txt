Today, Governor Mark Dayton released details of proposals for bills, which could be passed in a special session, to provide a 25 percent health insurance premium rebate for Minnesotans facing significant premium subsidy, while completing the tax and bonding bills that went unfinished last session.

"The months spent negotiating every aspect of those three bills have passed," said Governor Dayton. "Now, in order to have a Special Session, they must be accepted by the four Caucus Leaders, along with a signed agreement to limit the Session to those three bills with no amendments added."

Together, the Governor's proposed bills would make health care more affordable, keep more money in Minnesotans' pockets, and invest in good jobs, schools, and infrastructure across the state. In a letter, the Governor called on Legislative Leaders to agree to a special session quickly to resolve these three issues for Minnesotans.

In addition to the Governor's letter, and details of the three bills, Governor Dayton today issued a proposed agreement which, if signed by Legislative Leaders, would set the date and parameters for a possible special session, for next Tuesday, December 20, 2016. The Governor is asking Legislative Leaders to sign onto this agreement by this Thursday, December 15, 2016.
