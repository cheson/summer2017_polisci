Dayton, Democratic Colleagues Urge Bush to Consult with Senate Before Nominating Next Supreme Court Justice
Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today joined with 43 of his Senate colleagues in asking President Bush to consult with the Senate before nominating the next Supreme Court Justice. Eighty-year-old Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who has been battling thyroid cancer, is expected to make a decision about retirement by the end of this month. If Rehnquist steps down when the Supreme Court's annual term ends, next week, President Bush would be required to nominate someone to fill the vacancy.
"We sincerely hope that you will consult meaningfully with Senators on both sides of the aisle well in advance, especially in the event of a Supreme Court vacancy," said the Senators in their letter to Bush. "It is what our Constitution requires, what our tradition favors, and what our citizens want."
A copy of the 44 Senators' letter to President Bush is attached.
