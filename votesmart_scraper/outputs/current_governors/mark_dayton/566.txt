Governor Dayton has proclaimed Monday, May 28, 2012 to be observed as an official Minnesota State holiday. Governor Mark Dayton released the following statement regarding the Memorial Day Holiday:
"On this Memorial Day, I ask all Minnesotans to take time to remember the courageous men and women, who have served our country, especially those fallen heroes who made the supreme sacrifice. They gave their lives for our freedom and security. We are forever in their debt.
"Let us also remember and comfort their families, who have had to bear the terrible burdens of losing their husbands and wives, their sons and daughters, their mothers and fathers. They, too, have made great sacrifices for our benefit.
"This spring, about 2,700 Minnesotans, members of the famed "Red Bulls," have returned home from their war zone assignments. They are especially deserving of our gratitude, our support, and our assistance, on this Memorial Day and the days following."
