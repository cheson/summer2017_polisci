NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005-CONTINUED
Mr. DAYTON. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Warner, and I certainly want to join in his remarks commending the husband of the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator Dole-both distinguished Senators Dole-and also to recognize Chairman Warner, who has been superb in his quest for the truth of what has happened in Iraq that has come to light in recent days.
I know it has been very difficult and there has been a high amount of pressure on him, but he and our ranking member, Senator Levin, have led us well on that committee, as they have throughout my 3Â½ years of service.
We are very fortunate that he has continued his distinguished leadership to our Senate and to our Nation throughout these years and continues to do so now.
This week we are debating the Defense Authorization Act for 2005 and will return to it after the Memorial Day recess. I thank the majority leader, Senator Frist, for not trying to rush us through this important legislation, because it is complex, and it is also very costly.
This bill authorizes $422 billion of taxpayer money and borrowed funds for our national defense purposes in fiscal year 2005. That does not count the $25 billion supplemental that the President has requested, and it does not count the additional supplemental that we know soon after the November election will also be requested for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq during the rest of that fiscal year, probably another $35 billion to $50 billion. That means a total of almost $500 billion authorized for military operations in the year 2005.
When I arrived 4 years ago, in fiscal year 2001, that comparable figure was $309 billion. That is an increase of over 60 percent in just 4 years.
