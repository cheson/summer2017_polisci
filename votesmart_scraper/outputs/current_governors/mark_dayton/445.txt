Today at the Minnesota State Capitol, Governor Mark Dayton signed into law the Women's Economic Security Act (CH 239, HF 2536), which will help expand economic opportunity for all women in Minnesota. The following is a statement from Governor Dayton regarding the new law.
"Today, as we honor our Mothers and Grandmothers, we have taken a giant step forward for Minnesota's working women and their families.

"It should not require a law to ensure that women are treated fairly in the workplace, or that they are paid equally for their work. However, too many women still experience serious economic disparities, unfair gender barriers, and other workplace discrimination in our state. For all of them, this law is vitally important and long-overdue.
"I thank the bill's authors, Senator Sandy Pappas and Representative Carly Melin, for their leadership on behalf of all Minnesota women."
