The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced the appointment of Minnesota Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) Commissioner Mary Tingerthal to the newly-created Community Advisory Council (CAC). Commissioner Tingerthal is one of only 15 members nationwide selected to advise the Federal Reserve Board on the economic circumstances and financial services needs of low- and middle-income consumers and communities.
"Commissioner Mary Tingerthal is a superb leader of the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency," said Governor Mark Dayton. "I hear again and again that she is the best housing commissioner in the country, and I agree. She has helped thousands of Minnesota families afford homes in our state. I know she will provide that same exceptional leadership in advising the Federal Reserve Board on the economic challenges facing Americans today."
