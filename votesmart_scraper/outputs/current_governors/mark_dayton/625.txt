Today, Governor Mark Dayton released the following statement regarding notices issued to state employees:

"Today, more than 36,000 state employees will receive a layoff notice. It is a grim reminder of a deadline that is just 20 days away, and the reality of what a lack of compromise and agreement will mean not only for those thousands of hard-working state employees, their families and their communities, but also for the important services they provide to Minnesotans in every corner of our state.

"I am standing up for a budget that protects students, protects seniors, and prevents more than a billion dollars in property tax increases. Those choices are too important not to take a stand, and I know I stand on the side of Minnesotans. I continue to hope that the Legislature will join me in compromising, in finding a balanced solution to our budget, and in standing up for Minnesotans."
