Location: St. Paul, MN

Gov. Mark Dayton joined officials on Tuesday to celebrate the groundbreaking of 800 West Broadway, a new employment, education and healthy living center in north Minneapolis.
The facility at 800 W. Broadway Ave. will contain several services under one roof, including the North Minneapolis WorkForce Center, NorthPoint Health & Wellness Center, Minneapolis Public Schools and retail space.
"This is an important step to improve economic opportunity for the people of north Minneapolis," said Gov. Dayton. "This community greatly needs and deserves these services. But we must and can do more. That is why I will continue pushing for a special session of the Minnesota Legislature to address the racial disparities in north Minneapolis and elsewhere in Minnesota."
