BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I take offense at the characterizations of the Democratic leader about obstructing this legislation, particularly from those from southern border States who, in addition to the culpability of the Federal Government, should take the blame for some of the failures of these last few years that have perpetrated these 11 million, 12 million illegal immigrants upon the United States. I respect the comments of the Senator from North Dakota, putting those responsibilities, some of them, on the businesses of Minnesota, but I must say that the businesses of Minnesota and perhaps other Northern States have, to their credit, resisted the imposition of workers from other countries upon themselves--again, to their credit. It is from the States of southern borders, those businesses which have allowed this illegal immigration to go unchecked and which have, I believe to their discredit, employed these individuals.
It surprises me--in fact, I would call it the rank hypocrisy of those who have stood here today representing these States whose businesses have allowed these illegal immigrants to be employed, who have benefited and profited from those employments, and who now are suddenly trying to take aggressive action to impose these sanctions upon all businesses. I believe strongly that Minnesota businesses and others in Northern States have been forced to accept illegal immigrants because of the failure of States on the southern border to stand up and to protect their borders, in addition to the Federal Government. I deeply object to those who are claiming that somehow that is the failure of Northern States such as Minnesota.
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
