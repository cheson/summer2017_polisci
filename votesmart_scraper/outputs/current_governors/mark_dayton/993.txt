DOBBS: Senator Mark Dayton of Minnesota tonight is under fire from his colleagues after announcing that he would close his Capitol Hill office because of his concerns and fears of a terrorist attack. Senator Dayton last night said his office would be closed until after the election out of what he called, quote, "extreme, but necessary caution." The Minnesota Democrat cites a top-secret briefing on national security for his surprising warning and decision.
The senator spoke a few moments ago about his decision.
