Minnesota is now a national leader in using technology to better help its citizens, boost operational efficiencies, and promote cooperation between state and local government agencies.
This finding is the result of the Digital States Survey, a biannual review of technology use in state governments by the Center for Digital Government.
Minnesota's grade for "electronic service delivery" was bumped to A-, from its 2010 grade of B+, and now sits behind only Michigan and Utah. Minnesota also joins a short list of states that are leaders in using technology to increase service delivery and obtain policy goals.
The focus of the survey was to discover how states are using technology to cooperate with citizens and make the goals of the government more apparent.
"When we talk about making government work better for the people of Minnesota, we mean it," said Governor Mark Dayton. "This is another success in our continuing effort to build a better government for a better Minnesota. I congratulate our Chief Information Officer, Carolyn Parnell, and her team for this outstanding achievement."
Last year, Minnesota underwent a merger across the executive branch that joined all technology function into a single IT agency, MN.IT Services. MN.IT now serves as the core IT service provider for all state agencies.
"We have found that we are stacking up well against similar efforts underway throughout the private sector," said Parnell.
Minnesota's submissions to the survey emphasized examples of tech innovation such as mobile apps like "Lake Finder" and "Fall Colors," as well as the Pollution Control Agency's online "What's in my neighborhood" tool.
