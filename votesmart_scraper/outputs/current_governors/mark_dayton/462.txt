At a State Capitol news conference Tuesday, Governor Mark Dayton discussed his support for additional funding this session to expand access to high-speed broadband across Minnesota. Governor Dayton said he was optimistic after meeting with Danna MacKenzie, executive director of the state's new Office of Broadband Development, that a legislative proposal for new broadband funding could be passed and signed into law this session.

"I am willing to agree to [new broadband] funding this year. The amount really needs to be in the context of the overall budget," Governor Dayton said, in response to a question about whether he would support additional funding for broadband infrastructure this session. "I have stressed that we need to start modestly, and prove the effectiveness of [these investments]. The goal of having border-to-border cell phone and high-speed internet coverage is something I said during the campaign. I have believed all along it is important to do."
