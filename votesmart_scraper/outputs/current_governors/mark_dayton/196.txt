Statement

Date: Nov. 18, 2015
Location: St. Paul, MN

"Today, Senator Bakk rightly expressed the urgency of the challenges facing communities of color in Minnesota. I thank Senator Bakk and his Caucus for their leadership. I agree that any special session concerning the economic hardships of steelworkers on the Iron Range, should also begin to address the serious economic disparities facing Black Minnesotans."
