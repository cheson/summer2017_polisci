Dayton released his own statement in response:
"I am appalled at the horrible statement made yesterday by Mr. Conner. It shows an arrogance, an insensitivity, and a profound misunderstanding of the conditions afflicting Minnesota farmers whose crops were partially or completely destroyed during the last two years.
"In fact, the Administration knew last fall that payments under the new farm bill were considerably less because of higher market prices. The counter-cyclical feature in the farm bill then lowered the subsidies and their costs to taxpayers. Yet, the Administration would not consider those savings to pay for disaster relief. As a result of the Administration's opposition, the disaster aid bill passed by the Senate was not considered by the Republican-controlled House.
"Those savings have now increased, and they should be reallocated to provide disaster relief. But still, the Administration opposes using them. Now, they are proposing 'self-reliance' to farmers who have been self-reliant all their lives and are now near bankruptcy because of acts of nature. The comment was heartless and senseless. Mr. Conner owes the farmers of America an apology."
