Statement by Senator Dayton on the final passage of CAFTA
"An attempt was made by the Senate leadership to get unanimous consent to re-approve CAFTA without a recorded, roll call vote. Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and I both objected to that request and required the Senate to vote again on CAFTA.

"I am deeply disappointed that a majority of Senators voted again for this treaty, which I believe is not in the best interests of most Minnesotans and most Americans.
"Once again Senator Coleman has betrayed his promise to Minnesota farmers, workers, and civic leaders by supporting CAFTA."
