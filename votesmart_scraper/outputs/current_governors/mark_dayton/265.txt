At a pep rally in Saint Paul today, Governor Mark Dayton called on hockey fans across the state to cheer on the Minnesota Wild as the team takes on the Saint Louis Blues in the first round of the 2015 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs.
Proclaiming Thursday, April 16, "Go Wild! Day" in Minnesota, Governor Dayton is encouraging Minnesotans to show their support for the Wild by wearing the team colors throughout the day on Thursday (forest green, Iron Range red, harvest gold, and Minnesota wheat), and during all upcoming playoff days.
"We are proud in Minnesota to call our state the State of Hockey," said Governor Dayton, who was an All-State high school goalie in Minnesota, and is an avid hockey fan today. "I congratulate the team on an excellent season, and wish them the very best of luck in the playoffs. Go Wild!"
Governor Dayton wore his Minnesota Wild jersey today in a show of support for the team. The Governor encourages Minnesota fans to seek permission, as necessary, from their employers, teachers, or supervisors to ensure their team gear is appropriate for work and school.
