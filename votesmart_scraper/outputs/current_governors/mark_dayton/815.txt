Statement by Senator Mark Dayton on Northwest Airlines Filing for Bankruptcy
September 14, 2005
"I deeply regret Northwest Airlines' decision to file for bankruptcy. Unfortunately, the company had little recourse, after its principal competitors had already done so.
"When I spoke against the Senate bankruptcy legislation last March, I said that it would not protect companies' workers, their retirees, or American taxpayers from indiscriminate bankruptcy filings. The Republican Senate leadership was indifferent to those concerns. Now, tragically, we are witnessing the consequences that have consumed the airline industry.
"Congress must act immediately to close this door before other major corporations use it to dump their obligations to their workers and retirees upon American taxpayers."
