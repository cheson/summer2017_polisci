Governor Mark Dayton today sent a letter to the Chairs of the House and Senate Education Committees regarding SF40, the Alternative Pathway to Teacher Licensing bill. The letter outlines a compromise and agreement regarding SF40 and the Governor's intent to sign the bill, if passed as outlined.
Dayton outlines in his letter: "While Commissioner Cassellius and I do not agree with every provision in the legislation, after much give and take on both sides, we accept those differences in order to accomplish our shared objective: to pass reforms that will close the achievement gap and raise the educational standard for all Minnesota school children."

Dayton also outlines how the compromise addresses three important aspects that should increase student achievement: creation of a "true' alternative pathway program to address projected teacher shortages; assures well-prepared teaching candidates with content expertise; and increases teacher diversity.
