U.S. SENATOR MARK DAYTON'S STATEMENT ON TERRI SCHIAVO CASE
Based on Senator Bill Frist's speech on the Senate floor Thursday night (please find text below), for which Dayton was present, Senator Dayton voted in support of a bill that allowed the parents of Terri Schiavo to seek federal judicial review of their case, instead of keeping it in the state courts, which had previously ruled to allow the removal of her feeding tube.
There were slight modifications to the bill this weekend. The final version was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate yesterday afternoon. Senator Dayton did not object. The House of Representatives voted 203-58 in support of the bill. The President signed the bill at 1:11am today.
