Governor Mark Dayton today signed Chapter 6, House File 30, a bipartisan bill to give liquor stores in Minnesota the option to open on Sundays beginning on July 2, 2017. The bill passed with bipartisan support in the Minnesota House (88-39) and Minnesota Senate (38-28).

"This new law reflects the desires of most people in Minnesota, who have made it clear to their legislators that they want to have this additional option," said Governor Mark Dayton.

Recent polls have shown that two-thirds of Minnesotans support giving liquor stores the option to open on Sundays. Individual liquor stores will still be able to decide when they would like to operate, and local governments retain the ability to set liquor laws that make sense for their unique local economies and needs.

"This commonsense change will give Minnesota consumers and communities more choice, and will give Minnesotans more opportunity to support businesses and economies across our state, rather than across the border," said Lt. Governor Tina Smith.
