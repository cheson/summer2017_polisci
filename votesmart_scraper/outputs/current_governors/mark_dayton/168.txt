Location: St. Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton and Lt. Governor Tina Smith today are visiting Kaposia Education Center in South St. Paul to meet with students, teachers, and parents, to discuss the success of PreKindergarten education at the school. This year, Governor Dayton and Lt. Governor Smith are proposing $25 million to move our state closer to voluntary PreKindergarten for all Minnesota families, everywhere in Minnesota.

Governor Dayton and Lt. Governor Smith's proposal would allow 3,700 more Minnesota four-year-olds and their families across the state to attend quality, affordable early learning programs. Added to existing preschool scholarships serving 5,600 kids, this additional investment in early learning would help about 12.6 percent of Minnesota four-year-olds attend a high-quality early learning program. This smart new investment would directly address Minnesota's achievement gap, and prepare more students for success in school and life.
