Governor Dayton released the following statement today, after the Ramsey County District Court ruled on the Executive Order issued last month to hold a union election among home childcare providers:

"I respect the decision of the Court today. I am pleased the Court was clear that I did not misuse my authority in issuing the Executive Order. I have asked to meet with the Attorney General to determine our next steps.

"I continue to believe that in a democracy, people should have rights to elections to determine their own destinies."
