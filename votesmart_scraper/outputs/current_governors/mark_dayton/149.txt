Location: St. Paul, MN

"I thank Senator Koenen and Senator Schmit for their leadership to expand high-speed, affordable broadband access in Greater Minnesota. We need to make progress for Greater Minnesota this year. If we don't, thousands of Minnesotans will continue to lack access to a basic necessity of the 21st Century economy. We need to do better."
