Dayton Urges President Bush to Include MN Community Leaders in his Visit Friday to Minnesota
U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today sent a letter to the White House, recommending that President Bush include local leaders in the fields of health care and senior citizens' issues in his upcoming "Conversation on Medicare" in Minnesota. On Friday, June 17, 2005, in Maple Grove, Minnesota, the President will hold a roundtable discussion with a dozen participants on the topics of senior health care, Medicare, and Social Security. Following the discussion, President Bush will speak about those issues to a crowd of approximately 500 Minnesotans.
