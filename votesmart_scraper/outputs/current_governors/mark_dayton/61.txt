The President's declaration will deliver federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in Blue Earth, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Houston, Le Sueur, Rice, Steele, and Waseca Counties. The counties suffered significant damage as a result of heavy rainstorms and flooding on September 21 and 22, 2016.

In his letter to President Obama, Governor Dayton wrote, "Disaster assistance Â… is clearly warranted. Without it, and given the already heavy burden of previous state and federal disasters, Minnesotans will struggle to return their communities to normalcy."

Federal, state, and local officials conducted preliminary damage assessments from October 11 to October 14, 2016, and found $8.3 million in eligible public infrastructure damage and $10.1 million in estimated individual and household needs. The President's declaration includes financial assistance for eligible storm-related damage to public infrastructure in affected communities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will now fund 75 percent of approved costs. Under legislation signed by Governor Dayton in 2014, the State of Minnesota will pay the 25 percent non-federal share.

Federal aid also may available for individuals and households seriously impacted by the flooding. The Governor's request for individual assistance remains under review by FEMA.
