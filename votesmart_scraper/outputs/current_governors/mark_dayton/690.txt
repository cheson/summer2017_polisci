Defense Committee Approves DOD Secretary Nominee
Today in a Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing, U.S. Senator Mark Dayton questioned the Bush Administration's Secretary of Defense Nominee, Dr. Robert Gates. Senator Dayton pressed Dr. Gates on what he would do as Secretary of Defense to correct strategic and tactical mistakes that have led to a quagmire in Iraq, but expressed his appreciation of Dr. Gates's candor in responding to questions.
"You've asserted your own independence of judgment, which I think you've demonstrated so far today," Dayton said. "I want to know that as Secretary of Defense you will grant that same independence to your military commanders who are asked to testify before this committee or other committees of Congress to express views that reflect their own honest judgments even if they differ with your own."
At a hearing last month, Dayton raised concerns with General John Abizaid regarding the veracity of military commanders' testimony before the Armed Services Committee on the Iraq war. Dayton has consistently relied on the assessments and recommendations of military commanders for his legislative decision-making and was appalled to read that General Abizaid and other commanders were reportedly not as candid as they promised to be with Congress on conditions in Iraq and their recommendations.
If approved by the U.S. Senate, Gates would replace outgoing Secretary Donald Rumsfeld who resigned last month after six years as head of the Defense Department. Dr. Gates has spent over two decades in the intelligence community and served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency under President George H. W. Bush. Most recently Gates served as President of Texas A&M University. The Senate is expected to vote on Dr. Gates pending nomination this week.
