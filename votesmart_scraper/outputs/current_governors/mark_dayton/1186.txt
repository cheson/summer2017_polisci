Quality, Affordable Health Care for ALL Minnesotans
All Minnesotans should receive good, affordable health care. I will make the MN Department of Health their advocate to get them the care they need.
I will also expand our state government's existing "public option" to cover more and more Minnesotans. I will pass Education Minnesota's excellent proposal to allow school districts to join together and negotiate improved health care benefits for all public school employees at lower costs to them and to taxpayers.
I will use these two expanded "public options" as springboards to broaden Minnesota's health care into a "single payer" model for the nation -- one that eliminates health insurance company profiteering that deprives thousands of Minnesotans of good, affordable health care.
