Letter to Comptroller General David M. Walker
The Honorable David M. Walker
Comptroller General
U.S. General Accountability Office
441 G Street, NW
Washington, DC 20548
Dear Mr. Walker:
On June 15, 2004, we requested the General Accountability Office (GAO) commence an audit into the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) rejection of an application to make Plan B emergency contraception available without a prescription. We understand the investigation is underway and thank you for GAO's commitment to a thorough review. We write to ask when you anticipate completing your report and to encourage you to release your findings as soon as possible.
As you may know, after more than two years of deliberation on the application, on Friday the FDA announced that the "the available scientific data are sufficient to support the safe use of Plan B as an over the counter product," but it still failed to approve Plan B, opting instead to invite public comment on whether the FDA has the authority to approve the application to make Plan B available over the counter.
This turn of events leaves the strong impression that concerns about politics have overridden concerns about public health in this process. As we stated in our letter last June, the FDA's own scientific advisory committee voted overwhelmingly in favor of the product being available over the counter. Over 70 major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American College of Obstretrics and Gynecologist have weighed in in support of Barr Laboratories application. Yet, the FDA has delayed action on the application time and again.
