In accordance with the proclamation issued today by President Barack Obama, Governor Mark Dayton has ordered all United States flags and Minnesota flags to be flown at half-staff at all state and federal buildings in the State of Minnesota. As directed by the President, flags will be flown at half-staff beginning immediately, until sunset on Friday, July 22, 2016, as a mark of respect for the victims of the attack on police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

On Sunday, July 17, 2016, a terrible attack on police officers occurred in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the victims and their families deserve our honor, respect, and remembrance.

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton:

"The terrible murder of three law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge shocks the conscience of every decent-minded American. I renew my plea for all Minnesotans to engage only in peaceful and lawful ways to exercise their First Amendment rights. This is our opportunity to help lead the nation away from this wanton, mass violence and toward a reconciliation and healing."

The following is a statement from Lt. Governor Tina Smith:

"I join all Minnesotans in mourning the tragic shooting deaths of two Baton Rouge police officers and an East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office deputy. Our prayers are with their families, friends, and communities. Law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge and across our country bravely serve to keep us safe with little consideration for their own well-being. This makes their murders particularly horrifying. We must stop this terrible violence."
