More than 300 construction projects scheduled for 2014 will do much to improve highways, bridges and other state transportation infrastructure to ensure the safety and mobility of the traveling public, the Minnesota Department of Transportation announced today.

"Hundreds of road and bridge improvements getting underway this spring and summer will support Minnesota's growing economy, improve our quality of life and create thousands of good-paying jobs all over our state," said Governor Mark Dayton. "I thank the dedicated construction workers and engineers who are doing this important work, and urge Minnesotans to drive safely in construction zones this season."

The $1.1 billion 2014 construction program of 308 projects includes work on 74 projects in the Twin Cities and 194 projects in Greater Minnesota. An additional 40 projects statewide will improve safety at railroad crossings, and make improvements on runways and terminals at regional airports. The work includes projects funded by the Corridors of Commerce program, a bonding effort aimed at improving roadways for freight travel.

"This program will provide vital upgrades to our transportation system," said MnDOT Commissioner Charlie Zelle. "The Corridors of Commerce projects will ensure that roadways vital to business use will get needed improvements."
