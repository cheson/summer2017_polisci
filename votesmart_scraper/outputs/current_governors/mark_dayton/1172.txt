Senate Governmental Affairs Committee Holds Hearing on Secretary of Homeland Security Nomination
DAYTON:
Thank you, Madam Chairman. Welcome to yourÂ—congratulations to you on your chairing this committee. I look forward to serving under your leadership.
I will have to leave shortly because I am going to a briefing with CIA Director Tenet regarding a CODEL with Senator Warner and Armed Services Committee members leaving tomorrow morning. But I have already expressed to the governor my very, very strong support for his nomination.
I commend you, sir, for your dedicated service to our country and your leadership. You have a herculean task ahead of you. I've expressed some of the areas, such as INS, where I think your leadership is going to be particularly important.
But I just wish you well and ask that you share with this committee and with the Congress whatever needs you have that can bring this together as rapidly as possible. If it's a new computer system that integrates all of these agencies and divisions, whatever it is, please let us know. You have my full support.
I'm sure that's all I have to say.
Thank you.
