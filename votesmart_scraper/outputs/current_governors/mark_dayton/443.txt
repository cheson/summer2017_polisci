Location: St. Paul, MN

This morning, Governor Mark Dayton provided remarks at a groundbreaking ceremony for the Downtown East redevelopment project in Minneapolis. Following this morning's groundbreaking event, Governor Dayton released the following statement:

"Some people said that investing in this part of downtown Minneapolis wouldn't work. Others still believe there is no role for government in private sector economic development. This project and the jobs it will create, prove them wrong. I thank Ryan Companies for their critically important initiative. It will trigger more job-creating projects in this area in the years ahead."

About the Downtown East Project
The Downtown East redevelopment project will consist of a new urban park, two new office towers for more than 5,000 Wells Fargo employees, new skyways, and new residential housing units. This public-private partnership is expected to create thousands of new Minnesota jobs, and be a catalyst for continued business creation and economic development in downtown Minneapolis.
