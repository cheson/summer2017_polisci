Dayton, Senators Disappointed in the Defeat of Agriculture Disaster Assistance
U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today joined a bipartisan group of 29 Senators in a third attempt this year to help farmers struck by natural disasters in the 2005 and 2006 crop years. Dayton cosponsored the amendment, introduced by Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND), which would have provided $5 billion to farmers and ranchers nationwide who have suffered losses due to drought, flooding, disease, and other natural disasters. The amendment was offered to the 2007 Agriculture Appropriations spending bill but was defeated by a 57-37 vote on a procedural measure where 60 votes were needed for the amendment to pass. Similar legislation was approved by the Senate in April but, lacking the support of the President and many Republicans in Congress, the measure was defeated in conference negotiations with the House of Representatives.
"Almost half of the counties in Minnesota have been declared federal disaster areas this year. The crisis is real; the suffering is acute," said Dayton. "The Senate has historically answered the call to Americans afflicted by natural disasters, and it is disgraceful that the call of farmers has fallen upon deaf ears due to this procedural maneuvering."
Earlier this fall, USDA declared 36 counties in Minnesota as primary natural disaster areas due to persistent drought conditions. Today's agriculture disaster assistance aimed to compensate farmers who suffered losses due to natural disasters in the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons, including the drought that devastated much of Minnesota this year.
