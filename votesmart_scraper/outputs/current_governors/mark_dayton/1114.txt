DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004
AMENDMENT NO. 1277
    Mr. DAYTON. I fully concur with my colleague that we need to conclude our work on this bill. This is the third day we have been on this matter. There are several hundred billion dollars involved; it is one of the most costly measures we consider every year. The majority leader said we will complete work on the bill tonight. I expect we will do so with that instruction. I am prepared to stay late, as others of my colleagues are, to talk about these issues. I cannot think of anything that is more profoundly important to this country today and to the future of this Nation and to the world today and to the future of the world than what we are addressing, which is the circumstances that caused the President of the United States to make, as my colleague from Illinois said, an onerous and fateful decision to start a war, doing something that was unprecedented in our Nation's historyÂ—to initiate a war against another country, invade another country.
    Now, there may be other reasons cited for doing so, but under international law, under the U.N. Charter, of all the reasons cited by the administration for this action, the one that has no credence is the threat of an immediate and urgent attack against the United States by weapons of mass destruction with the missile capability to deliver them. That is what was stated and implied on a frequent basis by members of the administration last fall.
    This is not about one 16-word inclusion in the President's State of the Union speech, as important as that is. This is about questions, as the Senator from Illinois said, that dictated the actions or influenced the actions of Congress last October in voting to give the President the authority to initiate military action, which the President followed through on 6 months later, for which we have 145,000 sweltering Americans in Iraq today. I was there 2 weeks ago in 115-degree temperatures. If anything, they are even hotter than that at this point in time. Some of those incredibly brave young men and women won't come home to their families and friends alive. They will give the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of their country.
