On President Bush's State of the Union Speech
January 28, 2003
I'm disappointed that the President defended a tax cut that is indefensible. He's giving all the money to the very wealthiest Americans for the second time in three years, and he is giving very little to working families and middle income families who deserve a tax break.
In regards to the other domestic issues he addressed, such as prescription drugs, many of them I'm in favor of. I've been waiting two years to get to these issues. But actions speak louder than words. He's left farmers who face disasters in Minnesota behind; he's left school kids behind. He's left the unemployed who have exhausted their unemployed insurance behind. So I think the rhetoric matters a lot less than the policies that are going to be put in place.
Unfortunately, the record contradicts the president's rhetoric. Leave no child behind is leaving millions of children behind. We could have fully funded special education and did not do so. We don't have disaster relief for farmers in Minnesota who are on the verge of bankruptcy. It is coldhearted to turn our backs on them and then say we have enough money to give 90 thousand dollar tax cuts to the very wealthiest Americans who got tax cuts just two years ago. So I think his deeds speak louder than his words.
