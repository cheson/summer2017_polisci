Increased options for alternative and renewable fuels and expanded conservation efforts are the answer.
Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Mark Dayton today reaffirmed his opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Dayton, along with several dozen other Senators, sent a letter to key members of the House and Senate urging them not to add a provision that would allow for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Dayton insists that adding the controversial provision would be counterproductive to completing work on the energy bill, which he says is urgently needed in light of the recent blackouts and rising gas prices.
"I am not a supporter of drilling in ANWR, and I am committed to fighting any future attempts to open this pristine area to exploration or drilling. Last March, I voted to preserve this area and today I signed a letter of support to continue protection of this valuable resource.
"Some of my colleagues want to add a provision to the Energy Bill that would allow for drilling in ANWR. I think this would be counterproductive to completing work on a much needed energy bill. We will be better served by focusing our attention on the use of renewable fuels such as wind and ethanol, which will lead us down the road to future energy independence."
