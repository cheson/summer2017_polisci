To assist states in easing veterans' transition from military service to civilian life and meaningful employment, the National Governors Association (NGA) today announced the selection of six states--Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, Virginia and Wisconsin--to participate in the Veterans' Licensing and Certification Demonstration Policy Academy.

Each state will develop a plan to help service members leaving the military gain the necessary civilian credentials in three of the five following occupations (which all require state-level credentials): truck drivers, police officers, EMTs/paramedics, licensed practical nurses, plus one health care occupation of the state's choosing based on its particular needs.

"As thousands of heroic men and women return home from overseas, it is our job to make their transition back to civilian life as smooth and successful as possible," said Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton. "This policy academy will help states learn from one another. I am grateful Minnesota will have this opportunity."

Selected states also will work to reduce the number of unemployment insurance claims and the length of time for which veterans draw benefits. Finally, they will study ways to reduce costs associated with veterans receiving credentials.

An NGA policy academy is a highly interactive, team-based, multi-state process in which a number of states develop and implement an action plan to address a complex public policy issue. Participating states receive guidance and technical assistance from NGA staff and faculty experts, as well as consultants from the private sector, research organizations and academia.
