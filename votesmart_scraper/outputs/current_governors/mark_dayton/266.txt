Governor Orders MnDOT to Reinstate Use of Umlauts on Road Signs
Press Release

Location: St. Paul, MN

Upon learning that the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) had discontinued the use of umlauts on city limit signs in Lindström, Governor Mark Dayton will sign an Executive Order later today requiring MnDOT reinstate the use of umlauts on roadway signage, when appropriate.
Umlauts had been used on city limit signs in Lindström for more than two decades, until the signs were replaced following the most recent U.S. Census. When the signs were replaced, MnDOT omitted the use of umlauts because of new federal guidance known as, "Standard Alphabets for Traffic Control Devices."
"Nonsensical rules like this are exactly why people get frustrated with government," said Governor Dayton. "Even if I have to drive to Lindström, and paint the umlauts on the city limit signs myself, I'll do it."
Governor Dayton has instructed MnDOT to work with the City of Lindstrom to replace the city limit signs as soon as possible.
