CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2006--Continued --
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my cosponsors, Senators Durbin, Mikulski, Lieberman, Stabenow, and Akaka. My amendment would increase the Federal share of funding for special education to the level of 40 percent of the cost that was promised when IDEA was established almost 30 years ago. Despite the increases that President Bush has proposed and that this Congress has enacted in the last 4 years, that Federal share is still less than half of what was promised back then. My colleagues have before them as a part of the letter that I submitted what the difference is for their respective States. For Minnesota, it is about $250 million. That money would be badly needed and best used by our local school districts.
As a result of the shortfall in Minnesota, and I suspect other States, funds that are supposed to go to regular education get shifted over to cover the shortfall for special education, meaning the quality of education for all of our students goes down.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.
Mr. DAYTON. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.
