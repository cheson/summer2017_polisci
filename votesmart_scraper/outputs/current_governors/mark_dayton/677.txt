COLEMAN PRAISES LATEST U.S. JOBS REPORT
Senator Norm Coleman today praised the Labor Department's November jobs report which shows that the labor market continues to remain healthy with solid job and wage gains. According to the report, 132,000 jobs were created, with over 400,000 jobs created in the last three months alone. In addition to the solid job gains, the unemployment rate for November was 4.5 percent, the lowest rate since June 2001, while wage gains remain solid with average weekly earnings increasing 4.4 percent during the past year.
"Today's report is proof positive that pro-growth tax policies continue to be the catalyst for our economy - 39 straight months of job growth, 20 straight quarters of growth and record federal revenues," Coleman said. "At the same time, even with the strong performance of our economy, I am fully aware of and am concerned about the everyday challenges confronting working families and the middle class. That is why I have been and will continue to work hard with my Republican and Democratic colleagues on such important efforts as breaking our dependence on foreign sources of energy, making health care and college education more affordable and accessible, raising the minimum wage, and providing adequate funding for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program for our communities throughout the state. Looking ahead, I am optimistic that we can achieve significant bipartisan progress on the major challenges facing America."
Also announced in the report were revisions to previously reported October and September job figures. October's job gain was reduced from 92,000 to 79,000 while September's gain was revised upward from 148,000 to 203,000.
