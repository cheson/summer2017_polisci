Today, Minnesota Management and Budget released a report on the 2011 state government shutdown. Governor Mark Dayton released the following statement in response to the report:

"I am grateful that the Report concludes there was no net cost to Minnesota taxpayers. Unfortunately, it also shows that the worst financial hardship fell upon state employees, who were involuntarily laid off.

"Minnesotans know that it was the Republican legislators' refusal to consider a reasonable and balanced solution, which caused the shutdown."
