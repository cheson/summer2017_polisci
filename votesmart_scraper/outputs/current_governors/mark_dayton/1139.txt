WASHINGTON, DC - Senator Mark Dayton today announced that the Senate has passed a seven month extension of the federal unemployment insurance program, providing an additional 13 weeks of benefits to some laid off workers.
Dayton released the following statement:
"Today the Senate gave Porsches to the richest people in America, but not even peanuts to many who are unemployed. While we did pass a limited extension of unemployment insurance for some unemployed workers, it left another million out-of-work Americans with nothing. Tragically, that was all the generosity the Republican majority had for the unemployed. When it came to tax cuts for millionaires and multimillionaires, their enthusiasm was unlimited."
