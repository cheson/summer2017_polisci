U.S. SENATOR MARK DAYTON'S STATEMENT ON RED LAKE SCHOOL SHOOTING
"My prayers and heartfelt sympathies go out to the victims of yesterday's shootings, to their families and to the community of Red Lake. I join with all Minnesotans in mourning their losses. I will be traveling to Red Lake as soon as possible, where I will do everything I can to help the Red Lake tribal leaders during this difficult time. This senseless tragedy will forever change the lives of all who endured it. I encourage all Minnesotans to reach out to the families and friends of the victims, and to extend their support to this grieving community, in any way they can."
