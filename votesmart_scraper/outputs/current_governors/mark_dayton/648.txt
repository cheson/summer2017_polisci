Today, the Office of Governor Mark Dayton released the following statement from Press Secretary Katharine Tinucci:

"Earlier today the governor reiterated his belief that budgets are a reflection of values and priorities and the decisions we make about the budget affect people's lives. Based on the spreadsheets the GOP put out today it appears those values and priorities are cutting education, cutting health care, cutting jobs, cutting veterans, and raising property taxes. These cuts will hurt school children, tax payers, businesses and seniors."
