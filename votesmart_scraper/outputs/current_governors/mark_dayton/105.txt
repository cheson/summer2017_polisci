Governor Mark Dayton will travel this week to Zagreb, Croatia to recognize and celebrate 20 years of partnership between the State of Minnesota and Croatia. Governor Dayton will depart from Minnesota on Tuesday, June 28, 2016, and will return to the state on Sunday, July 3, 2016.

"Our partnership with Croatia has produced tremendous benefits over the past twenty years, strengthening national security, enhancing economic ties, and growing civic relationships between Minnesota and Croatia," said Governor Dayton. "I was pleased to host President Grabar-Kitarović in St. Paul in January, and I am honored to have been invited to visit Croatia, to celebrate the anniversary of this important partnership."

The State Partnership Program between the Minnesota National Guard and Croatia has strengthened national security, as well as economic and cultural ties between Minnesota and Croatia since its inception in 1996. In January 2016, Governor Dayton hosted Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović in St. Paul to celebrate the 20th anniversary of this partnership.

During the Governor's visit, the Minnesota National Guard will be working to remodel and restore the Primary Dubovac Elementary School in Zagreb. Governor Dayton will visit the school, and will meet with key military and government officials throughout the week.
