As part of an ongoing effort to provide Minnesotans with information about Ebola and related precautions against the disease, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) today established an Ebola Information Line. The number for the Ebola Information Line is 651-201-3920 or 1-800-657-3903.
"Minnesota's best defense against Ebola is access to reliable information and resources," said Governor Mark Dayton. "This hotline will provide Minnesotans a reliable point of contact for any questions or concerns they have about this disease."
The line will be staffed during regular business hours, from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. MDH has made arrangements for a translation service to help facilitate calls from those who do not speak English.
The purpose of the information line is to provide an easy, reliable source of Ebola information to Minnesota residents. Information about Ebola is available also on the Minnesota Department of Health website at http://www.health.state.mn.us/index.html.
