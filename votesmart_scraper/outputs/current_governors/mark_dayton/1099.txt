"My Democratic colleagues and I stated repeatedly that we would agree to an up or down confirmation vote on Mr. Estrada, as soon as we were permitted to view his legal writings as a Justice Department official."
"It was only reasonable that we be able to inform ourselves about his judicial views before confirming him to a lifetime appointment on our nation's second highest federal court."
"However, the White House preferred to play politics with Mr. Estrada's nomination and deny us that review, rather than get him confirmed."
