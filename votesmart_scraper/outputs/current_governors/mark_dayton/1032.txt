ETHANOL PENALTY IN HIGHWAY TRUST FUND FORMULA
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to express, on my behalf and that of my colleague and certainly the people of Minnesota, my gratitude to the Senator from Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, our distinguished neighbor to the south, for his phenomenal efforts in changing the ethanol penalty in the highway trust fund formula that will provide enormous benefit in the Senate bill to Minnesota and to his own State of Iowa. I have also been working with my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, to try to do our best in our small way to support that effort and to be vigilant on the floor with regard to our caucuses. I certainly want to give credit where credit is due to the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee for using his leadership position, and it is an enormous benefit to the State of Minnesota.
I express my gratitude and the gratitude of all Minnesotans to the Senator from Iowa for his initiative and leadership.
