Senate Passes Dayton Amendment Limiting Congress Members'
Prescription Benefits to Those Passed into Law
"Taste of Their Own Medicine" Amendment Wins in Landslide 93-3 Vote
WASHINGTON, DC - The Senate voted overwhelmingly to pass an amendment offered today by Senator Mark Dayton requiring that Members of Congress receive prescription reimbursements at the same benefit level as the prescription drug plan that becomes law. The amendment passed by a vote of 93-3.
Dayton released the following statement:
"This amendment is a matter of simple fairness. Under my amendment, whatever prescription drug plan Congress enacts for seniors and others on Medicare would be the same coverage we Members of Congress would get for ourselves.
"Unfortunately, the benefits provided in this bill are only half of what Members of Congress currently receive. Furthermore, the proposed Medicare program would not begin until January, 2006, and most seniors would receive only a drug discount card until then. That is an unacceptably long delay, and I have offered another amendment to make the effective date January 1, 2004.
"Those are some of the reasons why whatever Members of Congress enact for Medicare recipients is what Members of Congress should get for themselves."
