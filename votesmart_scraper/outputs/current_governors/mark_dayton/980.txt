CONDEMNING HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN LAOS
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues Senator Feingold and Senator Coleman for permitting me to have this time and also to commend them for their outstanding leadership regarding the violation of human rights in Laos. I join with them in opposing the granting of permanent trade relations for that country due to the oppression of Hmong and other violations of human rights in Laos. I strongly support, proudly, and am a cosponsor of their resolution to express the strong opposition of the Senate to those continuing violations.
