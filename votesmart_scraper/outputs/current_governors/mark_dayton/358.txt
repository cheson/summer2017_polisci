Press Release
By: Mark Dayton
Date: Oct. 9, 2014
Location: St. Paul, MN

Tomorrow, Governor Mark Dayton will travel to Worthington to host the Fourth Annual Governor's Pheasant Hunting Opener. Celebrating the pheasant opener is a long-standing Minnesota tradition -- and one that Governor Dayton has highlighted by hosting Governor's Pheasant Opener events in each of his four years as Governor.
"For almost 60 years, I have enjoyed pheasant hunting in Minnesota," said Governor Dayton, who began the Governor's Pheasant Opener tradition in 2011. "Over the past four years, we have enjoyed terrific Openers, thanks to the tremendous work of our hosts in Montevideo, Marshall, Madelia, and now Worthington."
Governor Dayton will be joined at this weekend's events by Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Landwehr, Director of Explore Minnesota Tourism John Edman, local elected officials, members of the Worthington community, Pheasants Forever, and Minnesota veterans.
In addition to hunting, a variety of activities will take place throughout the weekend. Events will include a community banquet, a wildlife management area dedication, a shooting tournament, and more.
