With thousands of students across the state returning to school today many will benefit from the $895 million that Governor Mark Dayton and the Minnesota Legislature have invested in schools since 2011. This year, more than 55,000 of Minnesota's youngest learners will benefit from free all-day Kindergarten, while others will benefit from high-impact initiatives designed to increase literacy and close the achievement gap.
"As Minnesota's students and teachers return to the classroom, I wish them all a successful school year," said Governor Dayton. "During the past four years, the Legislature and I have worked to make high-impact investments that will increase academic achievement and prepare our students for future success."
