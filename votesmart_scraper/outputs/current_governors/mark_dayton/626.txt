Today Governor Dayton released the following statement on Delta Airlines:
"I am very disappointed in Delta Airline's decision to move some of the company's operations from Minneapolis to Atlanta, but Delta remains a premier Minnesota company, employing over 12,000 Minnesotans, and we will continue to value Delta's hub at MSP."
