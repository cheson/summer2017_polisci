Governor Mark Dayton released the following statement today on the news that Standard and Poor's has downgraded Minnesota's bond rating from AAA to AA+.

"The downgrading of Minnesota's credit rating is very disappointing but not surprising, given the fiscal irresponsibility of the legislature's republican majority. Standard and Poor's specifically cited the use of one time measures, which would not have been necessary had my proposed budget been adopted."
