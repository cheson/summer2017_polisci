DOMINICAN REPUBLIC-CENTRAL AMERICA-UNITED STATES FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (Senate - June 30, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the leader of our representation on the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator from Montana, who has been outstanding in his guidance to all of us in our caucus and in standing up for the interests not only of his own State but for the farmers and the workers and the people of Minnesota and America, as well as Montana. I thank him and I thank my colleagues from North Dakota who also have been in the forefront of this issue because they, like myself, represent people who are seriously at risk with this agreement.
TRIBUTE TO THE U.S. CAPITOL POLICE
Mr. President, before I address DR-CAFTA, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to the courageous men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police, who risked their lives yesterday, once again, to help evacuate the rest of us safely from the Capitol Complex.
This is, unfortunately, my fifth evacuation from the Capitol Complex, beginning with September 11, 2001. This has been the best of them, if such a word can be applied to that race against time and the possible horror that is involved.
But as my staff and I walked out of the Russell Senate Office Building's nearest door yesterday afternoon, which is directly across the street from the Capitol, and hurried down the street away from the Capitol and the buildings, I saw several Capitol Police officers who stood directly exposed while they were calmly directing everyone else to safety. Other officers, I am told, remained once again at their posts inside or right outside the Capitol Building itself, helping everyone else to exit as quickly and safely as possible.
