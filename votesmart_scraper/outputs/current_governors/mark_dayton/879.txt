Dayton Pushes Through More Than $100 Million for Duluth Military Base, Minnesota-Based Defense Projects, and Child Care Assistance for Guardsman and Reservists Living Far From Home
WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Mark Dayton, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, today secured an additional $30 million for Minnesota military contracts in the President's defense budget as part of the Defense Department's spending authorization bill. Additionally, Dayton secured a commitment for $40 million above the President's request to help defray child care costs for the families of Guardsman and reservists' as well as $6.5 million for the 148th Fighter Wing at the Duluth Air National Guard Base to complete the next phase of a fire station that will serve the airport and base. Since Dayton arrived at the Senate in 2000, he has delivered nearly $40 million to the Duluth Air National Guard Base.
"Minnesota companies are proud to be able to contribute to the hard work our troops are doing overseas and this year's defense authorization bill will continue Minnesota businesses' strong involvement," said Dayton. "These funds will generate more employment in Minnesota, and I am proud that I could use my position on the Armed Services Committee to help secure those jobs."
Dayton is a long-standing advocate of providing child care for reservists serving overseas. A child care provision is included in Dayton's National Guard and Reserve Bill of Rights legislation which he introduced in January. Dayton also helped to secure funds in the Defense authorization bill to allow the children of deceased National Guardsman and reservists to have full-time access to TRICARE, the military health care system, until their 23rd birthdays. Currently, children are cut off from TRICARE three years after the death of their parent.
"Offering our Guard and Reserve families living far from military bases help in paying for child care is the least we can do at a time when we are increasingly dependent on non-regular forces for our security at home and abroad.
"I will continue to fight to ensure that our troops are not only the best equipped and trained in the world, but that they and their families receive the benefits they deserve. It is, without question, our duty to our servicemen and women."
The defense authorization bill is expected to be voted on early next month.
