Governor Mark Dayton and Lt. Governor Tina Smith released the following statements today regarding the death of Philando Castile.

The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton:

"I extend my deepest condolences to the family, friends, and community of Philando Castile. Our state today grieves with them.

"This morning, I spoke by phone with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough to request that the U.S. Department of Justice begin an immediate independent federal investigation into this matter.

"Overnight, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension began an independent investigation at the state level. They are currently collecting all necessary evidence, and interviewing witnesses, to determine what happened, and to assure that justice in this case is served. I will do everything in my power to help protect the integrity of that investigation, to ensure a proper and just outcome for all involved."

The following is a statement from Lt. Governor Tina Smith:

"I grieve for Philando Castile, his family, friends, and community, and especially the child, who was in the car with him. I pray for everyone touched by this tragedy, including our law enforcement officers.

"The Governor has wisely requested the U.S. Department of Justice conduct an independent investigation, and I am grateful the Falcon Heights Police Department immediately asked the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to lead their independent investigation. As we seek justice, we must be ruled by facts and the law. We need a swift, impartial investigation, and peace."
