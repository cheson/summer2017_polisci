Location: St. Paul, MN

Today, MNsure announced that nearly 170,000 Minnesotans have enrolled in high-quality, affordable health coverage, and that as many as 36,000 Minnesotans are now eligible for an extension. Governor Mark Dayton released this statement following MNsure's announcement.
"During MNsure's first six months of operation, nearly 170,000 Minnesotans have successfully enrolled in its health insurance programs. Many people now have health insurance for the first time ever. Others have gained more complete coverage at lower prices.

"Because of the Affordable Care Act, no Minnesotans were denied health insurance for pre-existing conditions. All of them are covered for important preventive health care services, such as cancer screenings and immunizations.

"MNsure has made major improvements in its functionality and customer service during the past three months. More work lies ahead to continue those improvements. However, MNsure has now demonstrated its capacity to improve the lives of many thousands of Minnesotans by offering them access to better health care at more affordable costs."
