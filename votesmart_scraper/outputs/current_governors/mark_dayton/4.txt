Location: St. Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton today released the following statement regarding drivers licenses for members of Minnesota's immigrant communities.

"The un-Minnesotan provision that Republicans insisted be in the Public Safety Bill is divisive and destructive to all Minnesotans. I understand the anger, and share the very legitimate concerns, of Minnesota's immigrant communities, and will continue to fight with them to remove this hateful provision from state law.

"I will meet with members of our immigrant communities very soon to listen to their concerns and explore their suggestions to make Minnesota a more welcoming place for all people. As Governor, I will continue to do all I can to protect our state's hard-working immigrant communities from the destructive immigration policies of the Trump Administration."
