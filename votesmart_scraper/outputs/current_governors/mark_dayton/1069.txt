Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Mark Dayton responded to reports that the long-awaited Conference Report on prescription drug coverage for seniors and other Medicare recipients may be voted on later this week. However, the Conference Report, which Dayton has not seen and has been told will not be available to all Senators until tomorrow, will exclude his Taste of Our Own Medicine amendment, prescription drug reimportation, and adequate incentives to employers to continue providing health coverage to 2.2 million retirees.
"The Senate voted 93-3 in favor of my ' Taste of Our Own Medicine' amendment, which says that prescription drug coverage Senators and House Members receive can be no better than what we provide senior citizens and others in this bill. If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for us. I would prefer to improve seniors' benefits than decrease our own; but we deserve no better than we give them.
"Prescription drug costs in this country are disgracefully high and getting worse. There is no reason to prevent Minnesotans from buying the same medicines for lower prices elsewhere, except for the unsatiable greed of the drug companies. They evidently have friends on the Conference Committee, because they won, and everyone else lost. Shame on the Conference Committee Members who betrayed their public trust."
