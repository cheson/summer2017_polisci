Senate Armed Services Committee Holds Hearing on Worldwide Threats to U.S. Security
DAYTON:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First, I want to say to both of you, thank you for your extraordinarily dedicated service to our country at this critical time.
Director Tenet, I would agree with your testimony that the burden of proof is entirely on Saddam Hussein. And I believe, as you said, that we would find if we were able to make a complete inspection that those caches of chemical, biological materials the president outlined in his State of the Union address are largely still there. And that those constitute, as the secretary of state evidenced last week, even with what's been detected to date, violations of the U.N. sanctions.
The United States has confronted dangerous dictators with weapons of mass destruction for the last 55 years since World War II. And the essence of the critique you made today against Saddam Hussein could be applied to Nikita Khrushchev and other leaders of the former Soviet Union in years past. They're building weapons of mass destruction arsenals, they're making linkages with anti-U.S. and anti-West operatives around the world. Chinese leaders in decades past, and even North Korea today, which you, Admiral, have cited as the most serious threat to the U.S. regional interests in a generation.
But the United States did not launch preemptive strikes to eliminate those threats. Those threats, as a result, remain serious and ongoing, even increasing. Those countries have leaders which at times we distrusted and even rightfully detested, yet no Republican or Democratic president acted to remove them or disarm them.
And the primary reason, I believe, was the doctrine of mutual assured destruction, that an attack by the United States would result in assured destruction of our cities, our countryside, our social networks and civilian casualties that would be unforeseeable in their numbers.
So when I read reports over the last week that our threat level has been increased and read what Director Mueller testified yesterday or predicted, that a U.S. attack would result in retaliatory attacks against the United States within our borders, I ask myself, "Why would we expect otherwise? Why wouldn't we expect that Saddam Hussein would retaliate as we would have if we were attacked in those years past by the Soviet Union or some other enemy with as much destruction to this country, within our borders, as possible?"
And I would ask, you know, to what extent you assess that as an ongoing threat? And is that factored into the decision to proceed military against Iraq? If we do proceed with military action against Iraq, why is Iraq different from North Korea today and from all the other threats in years past?
TENET:
Sir, you're asking some intelligence questions. You're asking a lot of policy questions. And Admiral Jacoby and I shouldbut I'll give you my view in any event.
The interesting thing about Iraq, of course, is Iraq, even though it's army is a third of the size that it was 10 or 12 years ago, it's still larger than all the GCC countries and Arab nations combined. The difference with Iraq isthe difference of the issue is, you've got to remember is, is in the last 15 years he's crossed two borders twice.
Of concern to us, just is from an intelligence perspective...
DAYTON:
Just for the record, sir, when did those occur?
TENET:
You had Kuwait, and you had the Iran-Iraq war. The years elude me at the moment.
DAYTON:
But in the last 12 years.
TENET:
Fifteen years, sir.
DAYTON:
Mr. Director, in the last 12 years, how many borders?
TENET:
Well, sir, I'll provide it for the record. I had 15 years in my mind.
But in any event, the other thingand it's a choice you have to think abouthe is going to get a nuclear weapon sooner or later. Our estimate is that with fissile material he could have it in a year or two. He will enhance his ballistic missile capability with that kind of capability. His biological weapons capability is far bigger than it was at the time of the Gulf War. And he has a chemical weapons capability that he hasn't declared.
And so you put that in the context of a regionand it's actually a little bit different than what you look at in North Korea, because you've got a South Korea with a large American presence and a Japanese, a Russian, a Chinese and a South Korean ally that are bit different in terms of their strength and overall stature than the countries he faces in this region.
At the end of the day you have to make a determination about how to best deal with this problem. At the end of the day you have to ask yourself whether, after 10 or 12 years of dealing with a U.N. process that he is fundamentally failed to comply with, whether you want to wake up in three or fours and face the prospect of the issues that I've, kind of, walked through.
Now, those are valid and important issues for people to debate. All we can do is lay down the facts of what the concerns are.
DAYTON:
My time is limited, so let me just go on.
Today's Washington Post reported your remarks yesterday, your testimony, as, quote, "Signaling that the Bush has concluded that without enforcement the era in which countries were encouraged by treaties and self-regulation to avoid developing nuclear weapons may be coming to an end.
"Such a conclusion would buttress the administration's new national security doctrine, which envisions preemptive strikes against potential nuclear powers, as well as bolster the administration's case for developing nuclear defenses."
DAYTON:
Is this, the interview, the policy that we're entering intoto developlaunching preemptive strikes against potential nuclear power?
TENET:
Actually sir, when I wrote the statement, I had no policy in mind other than to attempt to objectively say to you...
DAYTON:
That policy has been ascribed to your remarks.
TENET:
Well, sir, I didn't talk about policies yesterday. I basically said that my concern was the Nonproliferation Treaty regime was being battered in a way that continues to undermine a foundation that we've used for many, many years.
And the question is, given my concern that nuclear proliferation will loom larger, do we have the right regime in placeis the battering of this regimewhat should it be replaced with? How active should we become?
Those are policy question others have to answer. But I was just reflecting on my look at the world and the concerns I had.
DAYTON:
Let me ask one last question please.
Regarding Iraq, Al Qaida connection, I again would tend to agree with I understood your assertion today being that that linkage isthe evidence you've presented here has increased. But it seems to have increased since the administration announced that it intends to go to war.
Prior to last Octoberwell, the reports I've receivedand I sat in put a number of briefingsof those connections were far more tenuous than the ones you presented today. It's the old Arab saying, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." And it doesn't surprise me that Saddam Hussein has been reaching out in the last month to as many prospective allies as he could possibly find in the face of a possible U.S. invasion. And it's not surprising that bin Laden would seize on this crisis to exploit it to advance his anti-U.S. and anti-Israel agenda.
But that's the reality that we have today, based on your report, whether we like it or not. And that, it seems to me, increases the specter thator likelihood that an attack against Saddam Hussein by the United States is going to be portrayedwrongly, but portrayed, by bin Laden and others, as an attack against an Arab nation, and as you said, a repetition of the Crusades, and that we're going to see the kind of retaliations that we saw in 9/11 as part of their effort to foment this rebellion against what they view as the infidel.
TENET:
Well, let me just comment on one of your points. This is an iterative business, and very dynamic in the way it changes.

As you go back and look at my testimony to this committee, and I think in October when we talked about WMD, when you look at the classified terrorism section, it mentions Zarqawi, it mentioned the EIJ operatives we already signaled.
What has happened since that time period, sir, is an explosion in our knowledge and understanding and depth, additional sources, people we have at our disposal, work with our European allies. This thing moves every day. It's very, very dynamic.
But you said something that I have to push back on, because we don't cook the case for anybody to make a policy; we never do that. We would never do that. We would never allow it.
DAYTON:
I wasn't implying that, sir. What I understood it to be was that the amount of contacts, the degree of connection between those two entities have increased in the last few months compared to what they were prior to, say, October of this year.
TENET:
Can I just finish, sir, and add one more point to it?
It's important; there's a history here. We've provided some interesting papers to the committee about contacts that go back to the Sudanese time period in the mid-'90s, and an extensive paper on all this.
You know, it's a tough issue that you're constantly trying to connect the dots on, and in the terrorism environment, remember everybody (inaudible) connect the dots? There are lots of dots here that people have to be careful to connect in the right way, and be quite dispassionate about how you portray it.
But this is a serious issue. And we've got to be very mindful of it.
DAYTON:
I just wanted to, for the record make it clear, I credit you in both these appearances and then...
TENET:
I apologize.
DAYTON:
No, I just want to be clear. And in those classified briefings for being as forthright, candor, and giving us the information you had, and acknowledging, as you say, this is a constantly shifting set of information.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
