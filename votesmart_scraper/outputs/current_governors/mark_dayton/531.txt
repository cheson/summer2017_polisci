Governor Dayton released the following statement on the news that a federal judge has overturned two lawsuits challenging childcare union laws passed during the 2013 Legislative Session.

"I am very pleased that both lawsuits seeking to prevent child care providers from deciding for themselves whether or not to form a union have been dismissed by the Chief Judge of the United States District Court. I believe that working men and women should have the right to vote on forming a union, and that the Court's decisions will permit such an election to be held."
