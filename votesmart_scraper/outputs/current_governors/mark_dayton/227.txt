Below is a statement from Lt. Governor Tina Smith on the federal Clean Power Plan, which sets the goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 32 percent by 2030.
"The Clean Power Plan is a good step forward for our country. Here in Minnesota, these rules will build on our bipartisan efforts to build a renewable energy economy and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. With fossil fuels costs likely to remain volatile in the future -- continuing to collaborate on a cleaner, more sustainable energy future will be good for both the environment and the economy."
