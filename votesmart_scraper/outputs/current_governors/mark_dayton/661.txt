Governor Dayton issued the following statement in response to President Obama's State of the Union Address:

"It was a terrific speech. Under President Obama's leadership, our country is on its way to a new era in which we will lead the world into the 21st century through public-private partnerships in innovation, research, education and infrastructure. My goal is for all of us in Minnesota to work together so that our state will once again lead our country into this new era."
