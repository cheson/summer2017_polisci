Joined by Governor Mark Dayton today, Taiwanese trade officials and business leaders signed letters of intent to purchase billions of dollars of agricultural products from farmers in Minnesota and other Midwestern states over the next two years. The Taiwanese delegation plans to purchase up to $2.49 billion of American corn and soybeans in 2016 and 2017. Taiwan is Minnesota's sixth-largest export market, and a key trading partner for the state's corn and soybean growers.
"Minnesota farmers produce the highest quality agricultural products in the world," said Governor Dayton. "Our trade relations around the world, including Taiwan, are crucial to ensuring that our farmers can sell their products in the global marketplace. I want to thank everyone involved, especially the corn and soybean growers of Minnesota, for their efforts to promote our state and support strong business relationships."
