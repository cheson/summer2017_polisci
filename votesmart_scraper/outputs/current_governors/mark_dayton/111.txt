Statement from Governor Dayton Regarding US Forest Service's 30-Day Public Comment Period on Twin Metals Leases
Statement
By: Mark Dayton
Date: June 13, 2016
Location: St. Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton today issued the following statement after the US Forest Service announced it will begin a 30-day public comment period on two Twin Metals lease renewal applications being considered by the federal government.

"I commend the US Forest Service for undertaking a 30-day public comment period in order to more thoroughly review the two lease renewal applications by Twin Metals to further develop its copper-nickel mining project immediately adjacent to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. My position regarding this project and its inherent danger to the Boundary Waters remains unchanged. However, I recognize that the federal government has its own separate jurisdiction in this matter.

"I share the view expressed today by the Forest Service: 'However, the Forest Service is deeply concerned by the location of the leases within the same watershed as the BWCAW, and by the inherent risks associated with potential copper, nickel and other sulfide mining operations within that watershed.'"
