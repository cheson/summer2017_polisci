This evening, the Minnesota Legislature will conclude the 2014 Legislative Session. Throughout the weekend, Governor Mark Dayton will review pending legislation, and consult with his staff and commissioners. He will meet with members of the press early next week. The following is a statement from Governor Dayton:
"Two years ago, when I was asked what Minnesotans could expect from a DFL Governor and a DFL Legislature, I said: Progress. That is exactly what we delivered again this session.
"We cut taxes by $550 million for over 1 million Minnesota citizens and businesses. We increased the State Budget Reserve for the first time in 13 years. We committed to over $1 billion in infrastructure improvements, which will create thousands of jobs and continue our strong economic growth.
"We increased the State Minimum Wage for the first time in a decade, and indexed it to inflation. We improved working conditions for women all across our State. We passed a strong bill to protect our schoolchildren from bullying.
"And we revised, reduced, or eliminated more than 1,100 outdated laws and cumbersome regulations -- saving Minnesotans time and money.
"We did all of this to improve the lives of Minnesotans, and to build a Better Minnesota. We have more work ahead to finish restoring our State to greatness; but we have made important progress."
