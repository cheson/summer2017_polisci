Statement from Governor Dayton on Preliminary Health Insurance Rate Proposals
Press Release
By: Mark Dayton
Date: June 3, 2015
Location: St. Paul, MN

For the first time ever, Minnesotans today can see proposed 2016 rate information submitted by Minnesota health insurers for individual market health plans. Under new federal rules, all health plans with proposed rate increases of 10 percent or more are included. These proposed rates are now subject to review by the Minnesota Department of Commerce.
The following is a statement from Governor Mark Dayton:
"The proposed rate increases from Minnesota's health insurers are outrageous, given that our state's health care costs have been increasing by only 3%. They underscore the need for a rigorous review of those proposed rates by the Minnesota Department of Commerce, before they become final on October 1st."
Unfortunately, Minnesota is not the only state in which health insurers have proposed drastic preliminary rate increases for individual market products. The following are examples of large rate increases proposed by health plans in other states. A full list of proposed rate increases across the United States is available on HealthCare.gov.
