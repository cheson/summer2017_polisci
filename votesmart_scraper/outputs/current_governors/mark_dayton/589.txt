Today, Governor Dayton released the following analysis and conclusions on the Vikings stadium proposals:

Arden Hills/Ramsey County
It is easy to understand why the Vikings like the Arden Hills site. Ramsey County has made another excellent, detailed proposal. The Vikings are truly wanted there. It has the advantage that the property is available for the project to begin.
However, the Legislature's unwillingness to permit Ramsey County Commissioners to increase either the general sales tax or the food and beverage tax without a voter referendum leaves the County with no apparent means to raise its local share. I have been told that neither the Senate nor the House majorities will change their opposition in the upcoming session.
That leaves the Vikings and the State of Minnesota as the project's only two financiers. The estimated cost of a new stadium in Arden Hills is approximately $1.1 billion. Even if the State increased its share from the previously stated $300 million to $400 million, the team's share would have to be $700 million. If the Vikings so want to be in Arden Hills that they will increase their financial contribution to that amount, the project is potentially viable. If not, it is not.
The other missing component of Ramsey County's proposal is the unwillingness of the Vikings owners to disclose their intentions with the property's 170 acres, which will not be used for the stadium. If the Vikings truly want to be in Arden Hills, they have thus far missed their opportunity to inspire decision-makers and the public with their vision for the site's entire development.
