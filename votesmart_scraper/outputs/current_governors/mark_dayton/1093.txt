What is the truth about Iraq? Like the search for weapons of mass destruction, the truth has also been difficult to uncover.
Until President Bush's address to the nation on Sept. 7, his administration's public posture had been that "95 percent" of Iraq is basically secure and conditions there continue to improve.
However, during the preceding week, I attended a Senate Armed Services Committee briefing by top U.S. intelligence and military officials and another meeting with Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and General John Abizaid, commander of all U.S. forces in the region, including Iraq and Afghanistan. They presented grim evaluations of present conditions and predictions of few immediate improvements. The Washington Post reported that in August, American casualties in Iraq averaged 10 per day, one-third more than during the previous month.
Our troops have demonstrated extraordinary patriotism, courage and effectiveness. They won the war in three weeks. Now, terribly, they are the ones suffering for their successes. They remain deployed to preserve their military victory and thus are the targets of Iraqi opposition and other insurgents.
