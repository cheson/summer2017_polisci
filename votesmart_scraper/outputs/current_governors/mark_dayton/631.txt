Governor Dayton released the following statement today after President Obama's speech on the importance of fixing the broken immigration system:

"Today President Obama spoke the truth about immigration reform. I strongly support the President's position that fixing our broken immigration system is an economic imperative as well as a moral obligation.

Reforming immigration rewards businesses that follow the rules, pay their workers good wages, and provide safe places to work. This benefits all American workers.

Minnesota has long been enriched by immigrants, and I look forward to working with the President to strengthen our heritage and provide opportunities for all American workers to contribute to our future prosperity."
