Statement from Governor Mark Dayton on ITC Steel Dumping Decision
Statement
By: Mark Dayton
Date: Aug. 22, 2014
Location: St. Paul, MN

Today, following the strong urging of Governor Mark Dayton, the International Trade Commission (ITC) voted to impose penalties on South Korea and five other countries for illegally dumping steel products in the United States. The move will allow tariffs to be imposed on Korean steel products coming into the United States at anti-competitive prices.
Today's decision follows a July ruling from the U.S. Department of Commerce against these steel dumping practices. Governor Dayton sent a letter to President Barack Obama last month urging the Administration to enforce the law, and end this illegal market activity.
The following is a statement from Governor Dayton.
"Today's ITC decision is a tremendous victory for Minnesota steelworkers, their families, and their communities. Minnesota products can compete successfully on a level playing field. This decision should help to restore that fairness."
