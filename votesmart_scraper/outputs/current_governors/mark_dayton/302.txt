Location: St. Paul, MN

Governor Mark Dayton will lead representatives from business, education and cultural institutions on a trade mission to Mexico this summer that will focus on strengthening Minnesota exports and ties to the world's 15th-largest economy.
The Aug. 9-14 trade mission will include visits to Mexico City and Guadalajara. Besides helping Minnesota companies find business opportunities in Mexico, the governor hopes to attract Mexican investments to Minnesota and promote the state as a great place to do business.
The mission is being coordinated by the Minnesota Trade Office within the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED).
"As Minnesota's second-largest export market, Mexico is a very important trading partner for businesses and farmers throughout our state," Governor Dayton said. "The goal of this trade mission will be to establish and build relationships that will help Minnesota companies and producers increase their exports to Mexico, and in doing so, create more jobs here at home."
"With a growing middle class and increased demand for high-quality Minnesota-made products, Mexico is one of our state's fastest-growing trade partners," added DEED Commissioner Katie Clark Sieben. "The governor's trade mission will open doors for Minnesota companies to increase sales to Mexico and identify opportunities for new foreign investment into Minnesota."
Mexico became the state's second-largest export market (behind Canada) last year, with sales climbing 52 percent from a year earlier to $2.2 billion. Since 2004, Minnesota exports sales to Mexico have jumped 255 percent, adjusted for inflation.
