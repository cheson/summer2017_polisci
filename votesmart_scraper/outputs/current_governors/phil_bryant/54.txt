By: Phil Bryant
Date: Aug. 6, 2015
Location: Senatobia, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant and officials from Calbee North America gathered today for the grand opening of the company's snack food manufacturing facility in Senatobia, Miss. The company announced in October 2014 it would locate in the former BMW distribution facility there. The project represents a corporate investment of $51.1 million and will create 254 jobs.
"Today is a great day for Senatobia and Tate County as Calbee North America prepares to ramp up its operations and provide so many job opportunities for the area's workforce," Gov. Bryant said. "This grand opening is another positive indicator that our economy continues to gain momentum, and it also serves as a testament to the fact that Mississippi is open for business. I once again thank the Calbee team for choosing to locate in our state, and I wish the company many successful years in Tate County."
