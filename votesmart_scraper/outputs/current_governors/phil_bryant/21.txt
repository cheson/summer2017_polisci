Gov. Phil Bryant comments on the passing of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
"Justice Scalia was the greatest legal mind of our time and will be missed by all who love this nation and what it stands for. On a personal note, I will miss our duck hunts in the Mississippi Delta. He enjoyed our great state and its people. Mississippi has lost a friend."
