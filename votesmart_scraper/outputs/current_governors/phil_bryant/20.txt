Statement from Gov. Bryant:
"We have seen too many examples of terror groups' determination to strike here in the United States. Citizens who feel comfortable alerting law enforcement to activity they have a legitimate reason to believe is related to terrorism are an important tool in preventing these terrible attacks. This legislation enables that due diligence, and I commend the House for passing it."
