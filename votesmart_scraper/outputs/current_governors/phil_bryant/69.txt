Officials from upholstered furniture manufacturer United Furniture Industries announce the company is locating distribution operations in the former Lane Furniture distribution facility in Wren, Miss. The project will create 50 new jobs at the Wren location, as well as 50 new manufacturing jobs throughout United Furniture's Amory, Nettleton, and Okolona, Miss., facilities.
United Furniture currently maintains operations in several Mississippi locations, including Amory, Hatley, Nettleton, Okolona, Vardaman and Verona. The company employs more than 2,000 workers throughout these locations.
"United Furniture is a valued business partner to the state of Mississippi and continues to demonstrate its commitment to the state and the communities in which it is located through new investment and job creation," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "The company is truly a shining example of the growth and success companies enjoy in Mississippi, and I thank the United Furniture team for locating these operations in Wren and providing new job opportunities for the region's workforce."
"United is proud of its presence in Northeast Mississippi and looks forward to this expansion and growing its footprint in Monroe County," said United Furniture COO Doug Hanby. "The purchase of the 500,000-square-foot Wren Distribution Center will allow United to expand manufacturing operations across Monroe, Chickasaw and Lee counties."
Mississippi Development Authority provided assistance in support of the project for infrastructure improvements. Tennessee Valley Authority provided assistance, as well.
"This expansion by United Furniture marks the company's second this year, and it will be the company's seventh facility in Northeast Mississippi. That speaks volumes about the people found in Mississippi, and it demonstrates to the world that we have the business environment and productive workforce needed for success in today's global economy," said MDA Executive Director Glenn McCullough. "MDA is grateful for the teamwork of Tennessee Valley Authority, the Monroe County Board of Supervisors, and the Monroe County Chamber of Commerce, which assisted United Furniture in choosing to locate these distribution operations in Wren."
United Furniture was formed in 2000 through the merger and acquisitions of Parkhill Furniture Company, Comfort Furniture and United Chair. Since that time, the company has undergone numerous expansions and now operates in more than 5 million square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space in Mississippi, North Carolina and California.
United Furniture is the exclusive U.S. manufacturer of Simmons Upholstery. The company offers a large range of styles and designs, including stationary sofas, BeautyrestÂ™ upholstery, reclining sofas, recliners, sectionals and Hide-A-Bed sleepers.
