Health care affects all of us. Whether it's private insurance, Medicaid or Medicare, we all know that our health care system is complex and can be costly.
We don't know what the future holds for Obamacare, but as Governor, I will oppose Obamacare with all lawful means.
I'm hopeful that Congress will dismantle Obamacare plan quickly--and with Congressmen Gregg Harper, Alan Nunnelee, Steven Palazzo, Senator Cochran and Senator Wicker looking out for us in Washington, I know our congressional delegation will be fighting the fight with us against Obamacare.
We must control the growth of healthcare costs on our state budget. One way to help accomplish that goal is to make Mississippi a healthier state.
We have high rates of diabetes and heart disease. Taking care of ourselves with the right diet and frequent exercise can make a huge difference in tackling many of our health care problems.
We have good health care providers and facilities in our state, and working together, we can encourage healthier lifestyles that will mean a better quality of life for all of our citizens.
