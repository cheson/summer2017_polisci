Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant today issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Court ruling on the Arizona Immigration Enforcement Law:
"States are moving to enact their own regulations to address the serious issue of illegal immigration because the federal government is choosing to disregard its own laws.
"Although I am not in agreement with all of the Supreme Court's ruling, today's decision upholds the importance of the rule of law in this country and confirms that a state can authorize law enforcement officers to verify a person's immigration status when a reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the state illegally.
"I have long maintained that Mississippi has this right and that enacting a law to this effect is in this state's best interest. If our federal government asks us to ignore its immigration laws, what other laws will we be asked to ignore?"
