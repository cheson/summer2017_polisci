Statement
By: Phil Bryant

Location: Jackson, MS

Governor Phil Bryant issues the following comment on House Bill 1629:
"It is a shame that the liberal Democrat leadership in the House has voted today to keep unnecessary taxes on small businesses and corporations in Mississippi and to prevent hardworking taxpayers from keeping a portion of their own money. I appreciate the conservative leadership of Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and Speaker Philip Gunn on this important issue."
