Governor Comments on Passage of Rural Physician Legislation
Statement
By: Phil Bryant

Location: Jackson, MS

Legislation aiming to encourage physicians to practice in medically underserved areas of the state today passed the Mississippi House 120-1. House Bill 1547 caps the state income tax of every new physician who chooses to practice in these communities.
"I am pleased that the Mississippi House passed legislation today to encourage doctors to practice in medically underserved areas of our state. I outlined this initiative in my state of the state address, and this legislation will not only allow doctors to serve the rural areas of our state while maintaining the necessary income to support their families but can also foster the development of jobs that support a physician's practice. Further, by increasing the availability of quality health care, we can improve the health of Mississippians and work toward reducing our state's health care expenditures."
