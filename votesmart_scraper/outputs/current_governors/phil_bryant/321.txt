Gov. Bryant Approves Voter ID Legislation
Press Release
By: Phil Bryant
Date: May 17, 2012
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant today signed legislation requiring voters to show photo identification at all elections.
House Bill 921 enacts a state constitutional amendment that was approved by 62 percent of Mississippians in the 2011 general election. The bill also includes a provision allowing people without proper photo identification to apply for a free voter ID at the office of the county circuit clerk.
"This legislation is about protecting the integrity of Mississippi's elections," Bryant said. "This legislation is a direct result of the majority of Mississippians expressing their desire for a constitutional voter ID requirement in the state. We want everyone to participate in the election process, and we want that process to be fair and secure."
Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann joined Bryant for the signing.
"This law implements a voter identification requirement Mississippians overwhelmingly demanded through the constitutional initiative process," Hosemann said. "Mississippians want a vote to count just once, and they want the confidence the person is alive and a resident of this state when they cast it. This legislation helps us ensure that goal."
The legislation also includes:
A listing of acceptable forms of photo identification;
A procedure to receive the vote of individuals without proper identification. These voters may cast an affidavit ballot. That vote will be counted if the voter within five days of the election presents an acceptable photo ID to the county circuit clerk.
