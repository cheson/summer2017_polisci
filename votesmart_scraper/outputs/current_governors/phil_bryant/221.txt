Gov. Phil Bryant issues the following statement about the agreement between Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi and Hospital Management Associates to reinstate 10 HMA hospitals to the Blue Cross network:
"I am gratified that the patients and employees who were impacted by this dispute now have peace of mind in knowing that an agreement has been reached.
"Earlier this year, I used my executive authority because negotiations had stalled and patient access to care was threatened. I am thankful that both Blue Cross and HMA then returned to the table and worked together to ensure that access to care and patient-doctor relationships are preserved."
