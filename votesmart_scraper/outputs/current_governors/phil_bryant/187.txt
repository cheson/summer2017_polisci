Press Release
By: Phil Bryant
Date: April 28, 2014
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant has declared a State of Emergency in preparation for severe weather that is forecast to affect Mississippi today. The National Weather Service predicts portions of the state could experience high winds, heavy rains, flash flooding and the potential for hail and tornadoes.
A State of Emergency declaration is an administrative tool that allows state officials to position and deploy resources to assist areas that are affected by an emergency.
The State Emergency Operations Center is partially activated with key response personnel and is prepared to fully activate if necessary.
"This storm system has the potential to create dangerous conditions, and we are monitoring it closely," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "Residents should not overreact but should make plans now to ensure they are prepared for a variety of conditions, including strong winds and rains and the possibility of hail and tornadoes. Know how to receive emergency information and know where you will go if you need to seek shelter."
Residents can find preparedness information at MEMA's website, www.msema.org.
The following are some of the most effective ways to receive weather alerts:
* NOAA Weather Radio: Warnings issued by NWS.
* Television Stations: Local or national news stations monitor and broadcast weather alerts.
* AM/FM Radio: Radio stations are required to broadcast Emergency Alert System messages.
* Smartphone Applications: Numerous to choose from, and user can specify their areas for alerts.
* Alert FM Receiver: Similar to a NOAA Weather Radio, but relays the message from FM Stations.
* Social Media: MEMA partners with the NWS to post severe weather alerts on Facebook and Twitter using the hashtag #mswx.
* MEMA Mobile App: Free app available for iOS and Android users. Allows the user to find emergency information from MEMA, preparedness tools, weather radar and several other options like statewide highway information. For more information about the MEMA App, visit www.msema.org/mobileapp.
