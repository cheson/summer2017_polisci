The main components that make Mississippi such a great state are our faith, our belief in traditional values and the generosity of our people.
It's been written about how Mississippi per capita is one of the most generous states in America when it comes to charitable giving. That says so much about the people of our state, their good hearts, and their concern for their fellow man.
It's also been said that Mississippi is the most pro-life state in our country. I think that's something to be proud of. As Governor, you have my word that I will do everything within my power to make Mississippi the safest place for all children--born or unborn--because the right to life is a sacred, God-given right that deserves to be protected.
I also cherish our 2nd Amendment Constitutional right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.
We all know that criminals don't obtain guns the legal way--and we should always make sure that our right to bear arms is protected for people who want to own guns for hunting, shooting sports and personal safety and protection.
