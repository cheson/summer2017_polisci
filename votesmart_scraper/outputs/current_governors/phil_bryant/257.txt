Gov. Bryant Comments on Mandated Furloughs
Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: May 30, 2013
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant issued the following statement regarding the upcoming furloughs, directed by the Department of Defense, affecting more than 1,400 Mississippi National Guard full-time federal employees throughout the state.
"These furloughs are disappointing to the men and women who are working to protect the very freedoms we hold dear. The worst part is that while the Obama administration is making cuts to our nation's military and defense industry, there are those who believe we should continue to trust this administration's promises when it comes to expanding the largest entitlement program in our nation's history. This announcement comes as the Mississippi Department of Employment Security announced the closing of seven full-time and six part-time WIN Job Centers. As we can see, this administration can't event pay the bills it has now--why should we expect them to honor their Medicaid promises and expand the program?"
