Gov. Phil Bryant issues the following comment on the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade:
"As we reflect on this dark day in American history, I think of the more than 57 million children who have been killed by abortion since this terrible court decision. These children's lives were cut tragically short, and it saddens me to know that still more fall victim every day. Rest assured that I am as committed as ever to ending abortion in Mississippi."
