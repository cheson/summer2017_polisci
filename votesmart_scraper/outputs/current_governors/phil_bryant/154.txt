For the second year in a row, Mississippi has been named the number one state in the nation to practice medicine by Physician's Practice in their "Best States to Practice" rankings. In the creation of their rankings, Physician's Practice took a look at the factors that can affect a medical practice's financial health.
"This report by Physician's Practice confirms what many doctors around the state of Mississippi already know regarding their medical practice. Just this year we passed telehealth reimbursement legislation that has increased medical provider compensation, which has recently been applauded by outside organizations," Gov. Bryant said. "We are still seeing the beneficial effects of medical tort reform that was passed nearly a decade ago in Mississippi, and because of this, malpractice insurance rates have been stable for physicians in Mississippi while the number of medical malpractice lawsuits has decreased. These factors and more will continue to help us retain our new physicians from the two great medical schools in the state, and boost medical access to the residents of Mississippi."
According to the publication, the factors taken into consider for the rankings included: cost of living, disciplinary actions taken against physicians, tax burden per capita, Medicare's Geographic Practice Cost Index, physician density, and malpractice award payouts per capita.
Alabama, Texas, and Nevada rounded out the top four states listed in the rankings.
