Gov. Bryant said, "Deborah and I are pleased to hear of Thad's intention to seek reelection. Sen. Cochran is a pioneer of the Mississippi Republican Party and has been instrumental in helping with my efforts to grow the economy and provide jobs for thousands of Mississippians. After Hurricane Katrina, Thad dedicated his time and influence to our state's recovery efforts as we rebuilt from the nation's largest natural disaster. Our state has benefited from Sen. Cochran's leadership for over three decades. In today's political environment, we need this experience for Mississippi's future."
