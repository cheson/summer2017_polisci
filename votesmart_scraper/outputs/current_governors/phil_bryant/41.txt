Statement

Date: Nov. 5, 2015
Location: Jackson, MS

The State of Mississippi has submitted its Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) plan for review to the U.S. Department of Labor and is the first state in the nation to do so. Unique to each state, the WIOA plans are designed to strengthen the national workforce by bringing all stakeholders together at the state-level to create an integrated workforce system.
"The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act plan we have submitted will improve Mississippi's existing workforce system by making the entire process more streamlined for everyone involved," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "By bringing all the relevant state agencies and workforce stakeholders together during this process we have submitted a plan that will close the middle-skill job gap and increase workforce participation rates. This will help Mississippi employers fill openings and also show prospective companies looking to locate in Mississippi that we are committed to a strong workforce and are open for business."
