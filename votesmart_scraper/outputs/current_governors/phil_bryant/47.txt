WEST POINT-- Gov. Phil Bryant, Hikomitsu Noji, president of Yokohama Rubber Company, Ltd., and officials from Yokohama Corporation of North America gathered today in West Point, Miss., to celebrate the grand opening of the first phase of the company's new commercial truck tire manufacturing plant, Yokohama Tire Manufacturing Mississippi, LLC. Yokohama announced in April 2013 it would locate the plant in West Point, the company's first in the U.S. to be built from the ground up.
The first phase of the project represents a $300 million corporate investment and the creation of 500 jobs. Potential future expansions are expected to increase the company's investment and employment levels to up to four times in scale in accordance with future growth.
"The opening of Yokohama's manufacturing facility in West Point brings full circle a project that broke ground just two short years ago. I appreciate the Yokohama team, the Mississippi Legislature and state and local officials who have worked hard from day one to expedite this project and create so many jobs for the residents of West Point and the Golden Triangle region," Gov. Bryant said. "I congratulate Yokohama on this milestone event, and the state of Mississippi looks forward to many more years of partnership with this great company."
