Perhaps the most notable achievement of Governor Bryant's first term in office is the transformational education reform package he signed into law in 2013. Better schools mean a healthier Mississippi, safer neighborhoods, and a brighter future. That's why Governor Bryant signed bills in his first term to:
* Expand charter schools in Mississippi, giving more options to children stuck in failing schools.
* Prioritize reading skills by ending social promotion of third grade students who cannot read at grade level and providing funding for literacy coaches.
* Provide for mandatory dyslexia screening of students in elementary schools.
* Provide a grant for early learning programs.
* Create a clear A through F rating system for Mississippi's schools so parents can know how well their children's schools are performing.
* Stop administrators from changing student grades.
* Increase teacher pay.
* Spend more on education than at any time in state history.
* Require districts with graduation rates lower than 80% to submit a plan for improvement to the Mississippi Department of Education.
* Create a scholarship for talented students who wish to become teachers in Mississippi.
* Establish a merit pay pilot program for teachers.
* Raise the standards for becoming a teacher.
* Establish a program for at-risk students who want to learn a trade while completing their high school work.

In the next four years, Governor Bryant will focus on doing even more to help make sure education is a top priority by working to:
* Expand the scholarship for at-risk students learning a trade.
* Reform our education standards.
* Provide scholarships to special needs students to attend the school of their choice.
* Continue to prepare children for lifelong learning by improving literacy skills and ending status-quo social promotion.
* Reward teacher and school leader effectiveness and quality.
* Expand early childhood education.
* Empower students and families by increasing school choice.
* Reduce the dropout rate and increase college and career readiness among high school students.
