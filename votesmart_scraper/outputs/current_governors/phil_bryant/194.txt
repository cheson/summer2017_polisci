Governor Phil Bryant on Thursday signed Senate Bill 2681, the Mississippi Religious Freedom Restoration Act. This law mirrors the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act that passed Congress almost unanimously and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993.
"I am proud to sign the Mississippi Religious Freedom Restoration Act today, which will protect the individual religious freedom of Mississippians of all faiths from government interference," said Gov. Bryant. "Mississippi has now joined 18 other states to defend religious freedoms on a state level."
