Press Release

Location: Jackson, MS

On Tuesday, the Mississippi House of Representatives shielded Mississippians' Second Amendment rights from federal overreach.
House Bill 782 passed the House Monday, but was held on a motion to reconsider. Representatives tabled the motion Tuesday. The legislation now heads to the Mississippi Senate.
It would prohibit state enforcement of any future federal act relating to personal firearms, firearm accessories or ammunition. Similar measures have already passed in eight states.
"States must do their part to protect the Second Amendment," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "As long as I am governor, Mississippi will answer that call. I'm grateful for the House's commitment to Mississippians' right to keep and bear arms. I hope the Senate will follow the House's lead and send this bill to my desk so I can sign it."
