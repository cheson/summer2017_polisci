Press Release
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Aug. 6, 2015
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant and First Lady Deborah Bryant, along with Katrina Remembrance Commission chairpersons Haley and Marsha Barbour, today announced a 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina remembrance event for first responders. It will be held on Friday, August 28 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Gulfport, Miss., at Barksdale Pavilion in Jones Park.
"This will be a time when we can honor and thank all first responders from across the state who gave so much during the weeks and months following Hurricane Katrina. Many of them were already executing plans and procedures before it ever came on shore, and even more displayed bravery during and after the storm made landfall," Gov. Bryant said. "It is my hope that we can remember the 238 Mississippians who were lost, while also reflecting on the achievements of the Gulf Coast since Hurricane Katrina swept through Mississippi ten years ago."
The event will feature music from the Bluz Boys Band from Jackson, Miss., and special entertainment from native Mississippian and five-time Grammy winning artist Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives.
First responders who are planning to attend are asked to RSVP to katrina10@gulfport-ms.gov by August 14. Attendees will be asked to present a badge or first responder credential for entrance.
