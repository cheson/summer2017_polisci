Gov. Phil Bryant commends the Senate for passing legislation to allow for public charter schools. Bryant has long been a proponent of public charter schools, observing such schools in West Helena, Ark. and New Orleans, La. during the past four years. In his inaugural State of the State address, Bryant asked the Legislature to put a workable charter school bill on his desk.
"Creating public charter schools is one way we can improve the quality of education for Mississippi children," Bryant said. "I commend the Senate for their bold steps to give our children the education opportunities they deserve. I look forward to seeing this legislation come to fruition, and I hope our state's leaders will consider additional tools, such as dual enrollment programs, to improve education in our state."
