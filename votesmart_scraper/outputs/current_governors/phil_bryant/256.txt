Gov. Bryant Issues Call for Special Legislative Session
Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: June 24, 2013
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant today issued a proclamation calling lawmakers into a Special Legislative Session at 10 a.m. on Thursday, June 27, 2013, to authorize and fund the Mississippi Division of Medicaid. Lawmakers adjourned the 2013 Regular Legislative Session without passing certain laws that regulate the state agency responsible for running Medicaid and without providing that agency funding to pay for medical services received by Mississippi's Medicaid beneficiaries.
"It is unfortunate that Mississippi taxpayers must bear the expense of a Special Session because some lawmakers chose to make a political point during the Regular Session instead of acting responsibly to conduct state business at the appropriate time," Gov. Bryant said. "I urge the Legislature to act immediately upon convening to authorize and fund the Division of Medicaid. Taxpayers should not have to pay for days of political showmanship, and Medicaid beneficiaries deserve to be freed from the uncertainty that has been thrust upon them."
