"Democrats are playing a political game with the lives of the 641,194 children, pregnant women, and aged, blind, and disabled adults currently receiving medical services through Medicaid. These individuals will no longer have health coverage because Democrats are choosing political posturing to expand ObamaCare over funding services for Medicaid recipients. Let the record reflect that Democrats in the Mississippi House have voted twice to withdraw funding and services for Mississippi's Nursing Homes, Hospitals and other vital programs."
