Governor Bryant Comments on Halbig v. Burwell Obamacare Ruling
Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: July 22, 2014
Location: Jackson, MS

"As I have long said, I believe the IRS violated the law when it authorized massive taxpayer funded subsidies in the 36 states that declined to establish Obamacare exchanges, thereby triggering unwarranted taxes and mandates on both individuals and employers. Today's ruling is another step in dismantling Obamacare and returning the control of individual health care to the people."
