Gov. Phil Bryant addressed the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (RESTORE Council) at its meeting today in Biloxi and announced several projects for the State of Mississippi designed to help restore and protect the environment and economy of the state following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
The RESTORE Council, consisting of representatives from the five Gulf states and six federal agencies, met to vote on approval of the Initial Funded Priorities List and the Spill Impact Component Rule pursuant to the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act). Included in that vote were four projects recommended by Mississippi.
"We continue to propose and implement projects to support the economic and natural resource recovery of the Mississippi Gulf Coast and the entire Gulf region resulting from the oil spill," Gov. Bryant said. "We have formed effective partnerships with the other states and the federal agencies to ensure funds are spent in the most effective and strategic ways to restore and enhance our natural resources and our economy."
