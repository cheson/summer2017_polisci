"Today was a good day for improving education in Mississippi. I applaud House and Senate leaders for coming to an agreement and sending me a workable public charter school bill. I have long supported public charter schools and believe in the opportunities they give our children. New public charter schools, along with some of the other strategies outlined in my Education Works plan, will ensure better schools and a stronger workforce."
