State Sells Land for Future Mixed-Use Development in Jackson
Press Release
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Feb. 24, 2012
Location: Jackson, MS

The former campus of the Mississippi School for the Blind in Jackson has a new owner as of today and plans are underway for a mixed-use development on 21 acres.
The land was purchased by District Land Development Company, LLC for $3.3 million, and the site's redevelopment into "The District at Eastover" is estimated to generate 600 jobs. The project, once fully built-out, has the potential to bring in about $1.9 million annually to the city and about $4.9 million annually to the state.
"This development will bring jobs and services to our capital city," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "This purchase puts a vacant site to use and has promise for the Jackson metro area."
In 2010, lawmakers passed a bill that allows the Department of Finance and Administration to seek proposals from developers to build mixed-use developments as well as lease or sell land to developers. This Senate bill was approved when Bryant served as lieutenant governor.
DFA issued a request for proposals (RFP) in September 2010, and The District Land Development Company, LLC, through its manager Duckworth Realty, won the bid. Duckworth Realty is managed by Ted Duckworth and Breck Hines.
The District at Eastover will feature 500,000 square feet of retail, office, hotel, restaurants and residential space. The development will be family oriented, and it maintains the property's natural assets, such as trees and public green spaces. Retail areas will have cafes and outdoor dining.
