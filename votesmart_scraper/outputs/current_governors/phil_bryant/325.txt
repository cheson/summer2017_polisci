Worker Education and Training Bill Passes Legislature
Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: May 2, 2012
Location: Jackson, MS

A key component of Gov. Phil Bryant's Mississippi Works agenda has passed both chambers of the Legislature. Senate Bill 2792, which creates the opportunity for potential high-school dropouts to enroll in community and junior college workforce training programs, now heads to the governor for review.
Bryant said that the measure is an important investment in Mississippi's economic future.
"When I travel this state and meet with companies to learn what makes a business want to locate here, I hear again and again about the quality of our workforce," Bryant said. "I want to make sure every child has the opportunity to be a part of that workforce. This legislation will ensure that our most vulnerable students have another chance to succeed, and I am pleased that the Legislature understood the importance of this effort."
Other major parts of Bryant's Mississippi Works agenda include: the Health Care Industry Zone Act (House Bill 1537), inventory tax relief legislation (Senate Bill 2934) and legislation aimed at bringing balance to workers compensation (Senate Bill 2576). The measures have passed the Legislature and are headed to the Bryant for review. Bryant has signed into law the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Act (Senate Bill 2398), another component of his Mississippi Works agenda.
