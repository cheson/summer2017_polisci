Statement

Location: Jackson, MS

The Mississippi Supreme Court today ruled 9-0 that House Bill 2, which clarifies the definition of "concealed" for purposes of Mississippi laws regarding the concealed carrying of firearms, is valid and constitutional. The court also vacated the injunction that a Hinds County judge had issued against the bill. As a result, it is now clear that House Bill 2 can take effect statewide.
"House Bill 2 is an important clarification of citizens' right to keep and bear arms under the state and federal Constitutions. I am very pleased that the court has agreed that House Bill 2 is consistent with the Constitution so that law will now take effect statewide."
