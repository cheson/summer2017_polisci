Former Hinds County Sheriff Malcolm McMillin was chosen by Gov. Phil Bryant today to lead Mississippi's five-member parole board as its chairperson.
McMillin, who served as sheriff from 1991-2011, will direct meetings of the Mississippi Parole Board and serve as the board's administrator. Positions are full-time, and members meet weekly to review the cases of state offenders to determine their parole eligibility.
"Malcolm is veteran law enforcement officer with many years of experience serving our state," Gov. Bryant said. "His understanding of the criminal justice system makes him well-qualified to serve in this position."
McMillin is a decorated law enforcement official and even once served the parole board as an administrative assistant. He is a former military policeman and served three tours of duty in Vietnam. While Hinds County Sheriff, he served in dual capacity as the Chief of Police for the Jackson Police Department from November 2007 through April 2009. He served one term as Hinds County Constable.
"I appreciate the confidence that Governor Bryant has shown in me by appointing me to this position," McMillin said. "I will carry out these duties and responsibilities to the very best of my ability."
McMillin serves on the boards of directors for Stewpot and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Jackson. He holds a bachelor's degree in history and administration of justice from Mississippi College and was recognized as Alumnus of the Year in 1994.
McMillin and his wife Delores live in Clinton, where they are members of St. Columb's Episcopal Church. They have three children and six grandchildren.
McMillin assumes his duties immediately. His appointment must be confirmed by the Senate.
