Gov. Phil Bryant has issued a State of Emergency this morning following severe storms and tornadoes that moved through the state last night.
The State of Emergency is an administrative tool that allows local governments to request state assistance to assist with response and recovery associated with these storm systems.
Damage is being reported in at least seven counties, Benton, Coahoma, Marshall, Panola, Quitman, Prentiss and Tippah with more than 40 injuries and at least six deaths.
"Deborah and I send our thoughts and prayers to the families who have lost a loved one, those who are injured, and those who will now have to rebuild," Gov. Bryant said. "The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and the Mississippi Department of Public Safety are continuing their disaster operations to get resources to the most heavily affected areas. Mississippians are resilient in difficult times, and we will meet this challenge head on for those that are in need."
