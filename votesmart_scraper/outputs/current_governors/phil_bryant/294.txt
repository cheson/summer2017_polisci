Gov. Phil Bryant said, "I commend Lt. Gov. Reeves and Speaker Gunn for their commitment to improving education in Mississippi. Senate Bill 2395 provides a collaborative approach to voluntarily providing PreK to young children in Mississippi. The Mississippi Building Blocks model, in combination with the PreK collaborative model, will provide more opportunities to support school readiness in young children and further my push for literacy improvements."
