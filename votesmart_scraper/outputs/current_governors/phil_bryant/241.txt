Press Release
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Sept. 25, 2013
Location: Jackson, MS

More than 200 riders are expected to participate in Gov. Phil Bryant's "Ride for the Cure" motorcycle journey from Jackson to Gulfport on Saturday, Sept. 28. All proceeds will benefit the Central Mississippi Steel Magnolias Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure.
"This is our first ride benefiting breast cancer awareness, and judging by the number of registered participants, it certainly will not be the last," Gov. Bryant said. "Deborah and I are not only doing this to raise money to help fight the disease but to raise awareness. I appreciate everyone who is participating and look forward to the trip from Jackson to Gulfport's Jones Park."
According to the Mississippi Department of Health, cancer is the second leading cause of death in Mississippi, accounting for about one in every four deaths. Statistics from the Mississippi Cancer Registry reported a total of 14,857 diagnosed cancer cases in 2010. Of those, 1,937 were breast cancer diagnoses.
"We are very excited to be part of such a unique event," said Catherine Young, executive director of CMSM. "With Ride for the Cure, the governor is personally creating awareness about Susan G. Komen from Jackson, south on Highway 49, to Gulfport. Gov. Phil Bryant and First Lady Deborah Bryant have played such a major role in our organization, and we greatly appreciate their continued support."
