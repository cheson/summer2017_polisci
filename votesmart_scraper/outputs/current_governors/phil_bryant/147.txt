Governor Phil Bryant presented his Fiscal Year 2016 budget to the Legislature today, calling for a tax credit for working Mississippi families and increasing funding for public education by over $52 million.
"Mississippi should start fiscal year 2016 in the best financial health it's ever had. This budget addresses the needs of the state while giving back money to the hard working families of Mississippi," Gov. Bryant said. "The increase in revenues is an opportunity to return money to the taxpayers, not to spend more on government programs."
This tax credit will allow low to moderate income working families the opportunity to take advantage of a nonrefundable tax credit. This will allow for full or partial relief of an individual's income tax liability depending on his or her income and filing status.
"I believe the additional money Mississippians will save on taxes will be reinvested in the state's economy," Gov. Bryant said. "I look forward to working with the Legislature in providing tax relief to working families, as well as finding ways to reduce the tax burden on small businesses and corporations."
To make sure the state is protected during uncertain economic times, the tax credit will only be available in years when the "Rainy Day Fund" is full and revenue estimates meet or exceed 3 percent growth.
Gov. Bryant's $6.2 billion conservative, balanced budget does not spend any one-time revenue on recurring expenses for the second year in a row. It uses the General Fund Revenue estimate jointly adopted on November 10 of $5.6 billion and has additional state support funds totaling $567 million. The FY 2016 General Fund revenue estimate reflects 3 percent growth over FY 2015.
