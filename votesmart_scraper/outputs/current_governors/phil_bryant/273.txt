Gov. Phil Bryant commends the Mississippi Legislature for implementing major public education reforms.
"Last November, I outlined an aggressive education agenda and dedicated this session to improving our schools. Today marks a turning point for public education in Mississippi. The House and Senate have both adopted the bold reforms I outlined in my "Education Works' agenda, and I thank them for their dedication to building a better Mississippi. Our children and our economy will reap the benefits of these improvement measures, and I look forward to signing these acts into law."
House Bill 369 and Senate Bills 2188, 2347 and 2658 are all headed to the governor's desk for signature.
