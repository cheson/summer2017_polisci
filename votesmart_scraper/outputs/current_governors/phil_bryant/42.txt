Location: Jackson, MS

Officials from tissue paper manufacturer Sofidel America announce the company is locating operations in Hattiesburg, Miss., in Forrest County. The project represents a corporate investment of $120 million and will create 230 jobs.
For the project, Sofidel acquired the newly constructed 400,000-square-foot Green Bay Converting (GBC) facility in the Hattiesburg-Forrest County Industrial Park. GBC opted to sell the facility to Sofidel and continue operations in its current Hattiesburg location. Sofidel expects to begin local recruiting immediately in order to ramp up production by December of this year.
"It's a pleasure to welcome Sofidel as the newest member of Mississippi's business community, and I thank the company for choosing to locate their operations in Hattiesburg and generate new jobs for the residents of Forrest County," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "When companies choose to expand or locate in the state, such as Sofidel, they put Mississippi on the global stage and show companies around the world that we are open for business. I wish Sofidel many successful years in Hattiesburg."
