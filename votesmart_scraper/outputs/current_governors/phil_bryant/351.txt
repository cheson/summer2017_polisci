Gov. Phil Bryant commends the Mississippi House and Senate for strong, proactive responses to some key items in his "Mississippi Works" agenda.
The House today overwhelmingly passed House Bill 1330--the Energy Sustainability and Development Act of 2012--by a vote of 121-0, while the Senate passed the dual enrollment component unanimously.
"Mississippi needs jobs and the qualified workforce to perform those jobs," Gov. Bryant said.
The Energy Sustainability Act of 2012 establishes a statewide energy plan and provides incentive opportunities for companies to make capital and workforce investments with money saved by making energy efficiency upgrades.
Bryant has said that Mississippi is on the cutting edge of energy technology and must continue developing energy jobs and technology.
Dual enrollment is also a key element of the "Mississippi Works" agenda. Senate Bill 2792 answers Bryant's call for dual enrollment opportunities for potential high school dropouts into community and junior college workforce development programs.
The House passed a similar dual enrollment measure last week.
"I want our children to have every opportunity to secure good, stable jobs," Bryant said. "This dual enrollment program will afford our most vulnerable students the opportunity to both earn a high school diploma and learn a modern work skill."
"I am pleased that the Legislature understands the importance of these proposals, and I look forward to both of these bills coming to me for signature," Bryant said.
Bryant spoke about Mississippi's energy future and his plans to grow the state's energy economy at a summit in Biloxi on Monday. In recent weeks, he has traveled the state meeting with companies to discuss Mississippi's workforce needs.
