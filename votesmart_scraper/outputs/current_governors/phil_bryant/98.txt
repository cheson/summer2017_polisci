Gov. Bryant has signed into law a measure to lower the cost of college tuition for military veterans and their eligible spouses and dependents. Senate Bill 2127, authored by Sen. Perry Lee, passed the Mississippi House and Senate unanimously and waives out-of-state tuition for veterans, active duty military, the National Guard or Reserve forces who are eligible for federal Veterans Education Benefits and who either live in another state and attend school in Mississippi or who live in the state but are not residents.
The tuition waiver will apply at all of Mississippi's public universities, community colleges and junior colleges and covers both traditional and distance learning courses.
"This is just one more way that we can honor veterans and their families for their service and sacrifice," Gov. Bryant said. "We already know that veterans make outstanding employees, and this measure will help these men and women pursue extra training and education to further their careers. We owe it to them to provide opportunity we can for them to succeed, and I am proud to sign this bill into law."
This bill was also supported by the Mississippi Veterans Affairs Board.
"We sincerely appreciate Governor Bryant's support and leadership in making sure all our veterans can get the greatest education possible in Mississippi," said Randy Reeves, executive director of the Mississippi Veterans Affairs Board. "Our leaders in the Legislature made sure this happened with the support of Mississippi's Institutes of Higher Learning and Community Colleges."
With Gov. Bryant's signature, this law is in effect immediately.
