Governor Phil Bryant Commends Senate on Passage of Appointed Superintendents Bill

Gov. Phil Bryant commended the Mississippi Senate today for passing Senate Bill 2438, which requires superintendents be appointed by school boards.
"There is a reason that most of the nation has decided to appoint superintendents rather than elect them -- because it works," Gov. Bryant said. "Expanding the pool of candidates beyond a school district's boundaries and removing politics from the office will better serve students, parents and teachers. I am pleased the Senate has passed this legislation, and I encourage the House to do the same. This should be the year this simple act of transformative innovation arrives in Mississippi."
