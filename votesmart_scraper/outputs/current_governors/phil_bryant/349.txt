Location: Jackson, MS

The Joint Legislative Budget Committee met Tuesday to hear the latest state, national and international economic trends.
Gov. Phil Bryant issued the following statement about the economic news:
"My fiscal year 2013 Executive Budget Recommendation was based on a conservative scenario using the most current information and making tough but necessary cuts to spending while best utilizing the resources at hand. We remain very cautious about revenue numbers and urge the legislature to be prudent in its spending, realizing next year will be as challenging. If this trend continues I would support additional funding for priority areas such as public safety, education and job creation."
