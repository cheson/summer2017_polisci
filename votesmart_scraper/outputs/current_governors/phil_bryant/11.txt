Governor Phil Bryant Requests Federal Disaster Declaration
Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: March 23, 2016
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant has requested President Obama issue a major disaster declaration for severe weather and flooding that first struck March 9 and has plagued the state since.
Based on joint preliminary damage assessments by local officials, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Gov. Bryant has asked the declaration cover Bolivar, Coahoma and Washington counties.
If the president grants the request, more counties could be added after additional damage assessments.
"This March flooding event has been historic throughout the state, and most people will need federal assistance to help them rebuild and recover," Gov. Bryant said. "These first three counties I've requested were among the hardest hit, and much of the water has receded. I am prepared to request other counties as the joint MEMA and FEMA damage assessment teams are able to access flooded areas."
Initial damage estimates showed more than 650 homes sustained major damage; in total, more than 1,800 were affected. Several state agencies, along with numerous nonprofits and faith-based groups, have been assisting with recovery and rebuilding since the storms began.
