Mississippi Unveils New State Seal
Press Release

Date: July 1, 2014
Location: Jackson, MS

During his 2014 State of the State Address, Gov. Phil Bryant called on lawmakers to add the national motto "In God We Trust" to the Great Seal of the State of Mississippi. The language making the changes is included in Senate Bill 2681, which takes effect today.
"In my State of the State Address, I called on the Legislature to add the simple yet profound words "In God We Trust' to Mississippi's state seal. These words should strengthen our resolve and give us the courage to stand for our principles in our state. I am very proud to see them added to our seal."
Gov. Bryant called on Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann to coordinate execution of the design of the new seal. The Cirlot Agency developed the new seal graphics free of charge.
"As instructed by the Mississippi Legislature, our Agency has developed a new State seal for the State of Mississippi, including the words "In God We Trust," says Secretary Hosemann. "This is a historic symbol of our State."
Senate Bill 2681 also establishes Mississippi's Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Mississippi's law mirrors the federal RFRA signed into law by President Bill Clinton and protects individuals from undue burden on closely held religious beliefs. The United States Supreme Court's June 30 decision in the Hobby Lobby case made clear that RFRA does not provide a shield for illegal discrimination.
