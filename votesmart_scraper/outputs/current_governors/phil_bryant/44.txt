JACKSON--Mississippi fourth graders demonstrated significant improvement in reading and math achievements on "The Nation's Report Card" (NAEP) assessment given to fourth and eighth grade students around the United States. Results for 2015 were released Wednesday. Mississippi was the only state in the nation to show an increase in achievement in both subject areas.
Mississippi fourth graders earned a six-point increase in reading scores and a three-point increase in math scores from 2013 to 2015. Mississippi's fourth grade reading increase is the most substantial increase the state has ever demonstrated on the NAEP test.
"This is an outstanding achievement for Mississippi. The credit truly goes to the students and to the hardworking teachers and caring families who support them," Gov. Phil Bryant said.
Nationally, 2015 fourth grade reading scores were flat, and fourth grade math scores decreased over the same time period. Math and reading scores for Mississippi eighth graders remained steady from 2013 to 2015. Nationally, scores for that age group trended downward in both subjects.
"Teachers, administrators and students all understand that learning to read by third grade is critically important," Gov. Bryant said. "The state has placed a special emphasis on literacy to ensure that children across the state have the opportunity to succeed. The NAEP results show the positive effect of that work and make a strong case for state-led reform efforts like those included in the "Education Works' agenda."
