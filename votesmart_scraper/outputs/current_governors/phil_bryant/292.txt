"My office has not been officially informed by the Department of Health and Human Services of a decision. However, I have said repeatedly that the health insurance exchanges mandated by ObamaCare are not free-market exchanges. Instead, they are a portal to a massive and unaffordable new federal entitlement program. They trigger new taxes on businesses and will ultimately drive more people onto Medicaid rolls. I firmly maintain my position that Mississippi will not willfully implement a mechanism that will compromise our state's financial stability.
Furthermore, the Department of Health and Human Services' refusal to approve Utah's plan for an exchange proves that the federal government has no intention of allowing states to tailor exchanges to their own unique needs. Make no mistake, the federal government will control all exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act."
