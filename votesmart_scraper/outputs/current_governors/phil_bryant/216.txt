Gov. Phil Bryant issues the following comment on House Bill 49, which passed the Mississippi House today by a vote of 74-46:
"The TANF program is a safety net for families in need, and adding this screening process will aid adults who are trapped in a dependency lifestyle so they can better provide for their children. I appreciate the House for passing this measure, and I look forward to working with the Senate to move the bill forward."
