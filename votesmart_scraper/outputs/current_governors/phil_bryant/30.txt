Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant today requested President Barack Obama declare a major disaster declaration for areas affected by severe weather that passed through Mississippi Dec. 23 through Dec. 28.
Based on joint preliminary damage assessments by local officials, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Gov. Bryant has requested the declaration for Benton, Coahoma, Marshall, Quitman and Tippah counties.
If President Obama grants the aid, additional counties may be added to the declaration, pending further damage assessments.
"This funding is critical to helping Mississippians and their communities recover from these devastating storms," Gov. Bryant said. "We continue to pray for all that were affected and lost so much during the Christmas holidays."
