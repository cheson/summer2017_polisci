A healthy Mississippi has always been in our state's best interest, but health care is even more important now that it offers a way to expand our economy and save lives at the same time. Governor Bryant signed bills in his first term to:
* Expand the University of Mississippi School of Medicine.
* Establish the Office of Physician Workforce to create new medical residency programs in Mississippi.
* Expand the Rural Physicians Scholarship.
* Establish the Rural Dentists Scholarship.
* Require health insurance plans in Mississippi to cover telemedicine.
* Create tax exemptions inside "healthcare industry zones" so businesses like laboratory testing facilities and medical supply distributors can create jobs near major hospitals or in small communities.
* Create a public-private partnership to serve as a chamber of commerce for healthcare.

In the next four years, Governor Bryant will continue making health care a priority. He will:
* Continue on the road to reaching the goal of creating 1,000 new doctors in Mississippi by 2025.
* Expand scholarships for doctors moving to underserved areas.
* Provide for faster licensing of doctors.
* Cut taxes for doctors serving in rural areas.
* Continue to oppose Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, which is estimated to cost the state billions over the next fifteen years.
