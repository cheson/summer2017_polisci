Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: June 5, 2012
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant issued the following statement regarding the scheduled execution of Henry Curtis Jackson Jr.:
"The sentence of death imposed by a jury upon Henry Curtis Jackson Jr. will be carried out as scheduled according to law. Mr. Jackson was convicted of armed robbery, murdering four of his young nieces and nephews, critically injuring an infant niece who remained paralyzed until her death in 2009, and stabbing yet another niece and one of his sisters, both of whom survived.
I have reviewed the facts of this case and the applicable law. There is no question that Mr. Jackson committed these heinous crimes, and there is no clear and convincing evidence that compels me to grant clemency.
I am deeply touched by the requests for clemency by two of his sisters and his brother-in-law. One of these sisters was a stabbing victim, and both of the sisters are mothers of the murdered children. However, as governor, I have the duty to see that justice is carried out and that the law is faithfully executed. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their loved ones."
