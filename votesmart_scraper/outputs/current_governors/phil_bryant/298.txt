Governor Bryant Issues Statement on Insurance Exchange
Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Nov. 15, 2012
Location: Jackson, MS

Governor Phil Bryant said, "I continue to believe that establishing a non-free market health insurance exchange is a gateway to full implementation of ObamaCare in Mississippi. The federal government has never funded a program it did not eventually control and expand, and I regret the submission of a letter of intent by the Insurance Department stating that Mississippi will establish a health insurance exchange as demanded under ObamaCare. This is one more step toward the largest entitlement program expansion in American history."
