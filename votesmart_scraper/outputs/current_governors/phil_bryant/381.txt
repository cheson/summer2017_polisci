On Thursday, June 16, Phil Bryant's campaign for Governor received another key endorsement at a news conference at the State Capitol in Jackson.
Citing his longtime, consistent and strong support for pro-life policies, Barbara Whitehead of Mississippi Right to Life announced their group's endorsement of Phil Bryant for Governor.
"I'm honored to receive the endorsement from Mississippi Right to Life," said Phil Bryant. "I am committed to doing everything I can legally do as Governor to support the rights of the unborn, and I appreciate the confidence you have in me."
"As Lt. Governor, I'm pleased we were able to successfully make sure of Mississippi's right to opt out of federally funded abortions under the Obama healthcare bill," Bryant stated. "That was a big victory for pro-life policies in our state."
"I also want to encourage everyone to support the Personhood Amendment that will be on the ballot in November," said Bryant. "If successful on the ballot, the Personhood Amendment will be a turning point for protecting the unborn in Mississippi."
Today's endorsement from Mississippi Right to Life adds another major endorsement to the list of groups who have formally endorsed Phil Bryant's campaign for Governor including the Home Builders Association of Mississippi, the Mississippi Association of Realtors and the Mississippi Federation for Immigration Reform and Enforcement (MFIRE).
