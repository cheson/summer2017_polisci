Governor Phil Bryant statement below:
"On this ninth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina we continue to remember the over 200 Mississippians and 1,800 Americans that lost their lives in August 2005. It forever changed the landscape of the Mississippi Gulf Coast and lives for countless families that were permanently displaced. Since that time, Mississippians have shown incredible strength, resilience, and a caring spirit for their neighbor while building back the Gulf Coast stronger than before Hurricane Katrina. Those unthinkable times in the aftermath have prepared us today to deal with such a catastrophe were it to ever happen again. Today we remember all those affected by Hurricane Katrina and continue to ask God's blessings upon the people of Mississippi."
