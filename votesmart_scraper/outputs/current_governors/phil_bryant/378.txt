I hope you have heard of my vision of a medical city. We must dream of this world class facility that will be a tremendous economic development opportunity for the fastest growing segment of our society, and work to make it a reality.
The concept of a medical city in Jackson, including the land surrounding the current University Medical Center and Veterans Memorial Stadium, would first and foremost be a benefit to the health of the people of Mississippi.
In addition, it would be a big boost to non-profit, public, and private health care facilities, and the overall economy of the state. By having a medical city location in Mississippi, we can put in place a public-private partnership. The result will grow the entire medical community including the expansion of privately-owned medical facilities as well as attracting more biotech companies that bring innovation and high-tech jobs to our state. Working together with non-profit, public and private health care facilities, we can provide a higher quality of health care for Mississippians which will lead to a better quality of life.
Additionally, there will be economic opportunities and benefits for people working in the medical profession including physicians, nurses, researchers and other key medical staff. The overall benefit from this medical city concept will bring about a new, higher standard of medical research, and better access to services for Mississippians than ever before.
