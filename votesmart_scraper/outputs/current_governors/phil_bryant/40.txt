Officials from ROCKFON® LLC,, a subsidiary of Denmark-based ROCKWOOL® International A/S and affiliate to ROXUL® Inc., announce the company is locating acoustic ceiling panel manufacturing operations in Marshall County, Miss. The operations will be the company's first in North America. The project represents a corporate investment of $42 million over the next five years and will create at least 90 jobs.
For the project, ROCKFON will construct a 130,000-square-foot addition adjacent to the existing ROXUL facility, which is located on more than 100 acres in the Chickasaw Trails Industrial Park.
"I am glad to welcome ROCKFON as the newest business partner to the State of Mississippi, and I am particularly grateful to the company for creating new jobs and economic opportunities for the residents of Marshall County," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "The company's decision to locate its very first North American facility here is a strong testament to the supportive business environment and quality workforce found throughout the state. I wish the ROCKFON team many years of success in North Mississippi."
