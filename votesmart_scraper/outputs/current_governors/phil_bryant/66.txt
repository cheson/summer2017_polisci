Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: June 26, 2015
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant issues the following statement on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell et al v. Hodges et al:
"Throughout history, states have had the authority to regulate marriage within their borders. Today, a federal court has usurped that right to self-governance and has mandated that states must comply with federal marriage standards--standards that are out of step with the wishes of many in the United States and that are certainly out of step with the majority of Mississippians."
