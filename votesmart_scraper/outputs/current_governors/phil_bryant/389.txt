We all care about our schools. That's why education should not be a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. It should be a "children" issue. If we keep our focus on what is best for students and their future, we can try new approaches to improve our educational system across the state.
Charter schools are a great idea to improve failing school districts, and we need to embrace that concept. We also need more research into early childhood education about the value it could provide in making our overall educational system second to none so that Mississippi's children have a better chance to compete in this global economy.
We can implement skills training curriculums in high schools to give even more job training opportunities. And by rewarding good teachers for the job they do will encourage others to become excellent teachers.
I believe in having strong public schools. Both of my children are the products of public schools. We also have to recognize that more money is not always the answer to solving every issue facing our educational system. By being innovative with a common sense approach to change, we can come together to provide the best education for the children of our state.
