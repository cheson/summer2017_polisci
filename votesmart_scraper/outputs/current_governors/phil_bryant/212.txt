With the new photo identification requirement beginning June 3rd, Governor Phil Bryant and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann want Mississippians to remember the key to our democracy lies with voting. Therefore, the Governor has proclaimed February Voter Registration Month in Mississippi.
"The right to vote is the cornerstone of our nation, and countless service men and women have given their lives in defense of this freedom," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "I encourage Mississippians to register to vote and participate in the electoral process at the local, state and federal levels."
"We believe there are approximately 360,000 Mississippians over the age of 18 who are not registered to vote," says Secretary Hosemann. "Voting is our most important right. We thank Governor Bryant for his commitment to the electoral process and hope this designation will encourage Mississippians to register to vote."
