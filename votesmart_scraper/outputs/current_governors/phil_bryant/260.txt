Governor Phil Bryant said, "I appreciate the ruling by the United States Supreme Court confirming that the 2011 legislative elections were constitutional and, therefore, that costly special elections are unnecessary. In addition, the new apportionment plans that the Legislature enacted during the 2012 session have already been approved by the Department of Justice and will be effective for the 2015 election cycle."
