By: Phil Bryant
Date: Jan. 4, 2016
Location: Unknown

Statement from the Gov. Bryant:
"Mr. Stokes' remarks are reprehensible, particularly with the attacks we have seen against our men and women in law enforcement. I condemn any such remarks in the strongest possible manner. This is nothing short of an outright assault upon all who wear the badge. I will be asking Attorney General Jim Hood to investigate whether Mr. Stokes' remarks represent criminal threats against law enforcement officers."
