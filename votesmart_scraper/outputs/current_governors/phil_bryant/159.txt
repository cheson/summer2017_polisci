Gov. Phil Bryant today issued a Writ of Election, setting Nov. 4 as the special election date to fill the Senate seat left vacant in District 17 with the passing of Senator Terry Brown in early September.
"In issuing this order I am ever mindful of the service to the people of Mississippi provided by my friend Terry Brown," Gov. Bryant said. "He will be missed long past the next election."
The qualifying deadline for candidates is Oct. 6.
If no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast in the special election, a runoff election will be held Nov. 25.
