Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant has declared a State of Emergency in preparation for coming winter weather across portions of Mississippi. Northern and central portions of the state could see winter weather conditions including ice and winter precipitation, with accumulation expected in some areas.
More than 40 counties are included in the National Weather Service forecast area.
A State of Emergency declaration is an administrative tool that allows state officials to position and deploy resources to assist areas that are impacted by an emergency.
"I have declared a State of Emergency to aid emergency officials in preparing for the onset of this potentially dangerous weather," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "Mississippi has seen its share of winter weather lately, but now is not the time to become weather weary. Residents should not overreact but should make plans now to ensure they are prepared for a variety of conditions, including prolonged freezing temperatures, icy roadways and accumulations of ice and winter precipitation."
"Residents in areas affected by winter weather should not drive unless necessary, as road conditions may become hazardous.
Residents should prepare for the possibility of power outages, problems with pipes that are not fully insulated or at risk of bursting and very dangerous driving conditions.
The Mississippi Department of Transportation is monitoring road conditions and will issue traffic alerts for roadways and bridges that experience icing conditions. Residents may also dial 5-1-1 for information on road conditions.
