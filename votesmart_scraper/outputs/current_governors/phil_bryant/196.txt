Gov. Phil Bryant today signed into law Senate Bill 2425, giving Mississippi sportsmen an annual tax free holiday in September. The Mississippi Second Amendment Weekend holiday will include sales tax exemption on individual sales of firearms, ammunition, archery equipment and certain hunting supplies. The annual holiday will occur on the first Friday of each September until midnight on the following Sunday.
During State Fiscal Year 2013, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks sold more than 425,000 resident hunting and fishing licenses.
"Many Mississippians share my strong belief in the Second Amendment and love the outdoors," Gov. Bryant said. "This tax holiday will help ensure Mississippians continue to enjoy our state's great outdoor heritage for years to come. I thank the Mississippi Legislature for their hard work on this bill and for supporting Mississippi sportsmen and sportswomen."
Senate Bill 2425 passed both the House and Senate with strong bipartisan support.
The National Rifle Association also supports the measure.
"On behalf of the NRA's five million members, we want to thank Governor Bryant for supporting this tax holiday for Mississippi's sportsmen," noted Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action. "This new law pays tribute to Mississippi's hunting heritage and our Second Amendment Rights. We look forward to the celebration of these freedoms when Mississippi gun owners and sportsmen visit their local firearms and sporting goods retailers in September, "added Cox.
