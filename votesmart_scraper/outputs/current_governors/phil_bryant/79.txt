Officials from CertainTeed Corporation and state and local officials gathered today for the grand reopening of the company's ceiling tile manufacturing operations in Meridian, Miss. The project is a $24 million corporate investment and is creating 110 new jobs. The facility produces a range of ceiling tiles and acoustical wall panels used in commercial construction applications.
CertainTeed ceased production at its Meridian location in 2009 in the midst of the construction market downturn. The facility had been idle since that time. Ceiling tiles have been manufactured at the facility since 1941 throughout various stages of operation.
"Today is a great day for Meridian and Lauderdale County as CertainTeed resumes operations and puts more than one hundred of the area's residents to work," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "CertainTeed's reopening is a positive indicator that our economy continues to gain momentum. Two years ago, we announced that CertainTeed would return to Meridian, and today we celebrate their reopening. I thank the CertainTeed team for their investment in Mississippi."
"Building upon more than one hundred years of building industry experience and innovation, CertainTeed Ceilings has become a driving force within the industry," said Carmen Bodden, vice president and general manager for CertainTeed Ceilings. "Every day we're working toward the next breakthrough in building science and acoustical product technology. Bringing the Meridian plant back online will help us forge ahead in these efforts, meet growing demand for our products and further strengthen our position."
In 2013, the Mississippi Development Authority provided assistance for building modifications and infrastructure improvements in preparation of the facility's reopening. The city of Meridian and Lauderdale County assisted with the project, as well.
"We thank CertainTeed for once again placing its trust in the East Mississippi workforce and its confidence in our business climate. The company's commitment to the Meridian community is evident with this reopening, and we are glad to have provided assistance with this project," said MDA Interim Executive Director Manning McPhillips. "We congratulate CertainTeed on this exciting day, as well as the teams at the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation, the city of Meridian and Lauderdale County, who all played an important role in bringing this project to fruition."
