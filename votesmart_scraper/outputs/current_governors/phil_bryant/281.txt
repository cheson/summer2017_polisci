"I appreciate Senators Cochran and Wicker for taking a stand with fellow Republican Senators today and voting against passing additional debt on to our children and grandchildren. Tuesday, Congressional Republicans took the same stand against out of control spending and mounting debt. Our nation is already saddled with a long-term deficit of more than $16.6 trillion, and the Government Accountability Office has agreed that ObamaCare will add an additional $6.2 trillion to that figure. Simply put, the federal government cannot afford the promises of ObamaCare.
Mississippi should not expand Medicaid because doing so would result in tax increases for hardworking Mississippians or cuts to critical spending in areas like education, public safety and economic development."
