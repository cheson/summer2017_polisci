Governor Phil Bryant Comments on ObamaCare Ruling
Statement
By: Phil Bryant

Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant issued the following statement regarding the decision by the Supreme Court of the United States on ObamaCare:
"Today's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold ObamaCare and its individual mandate is alarming. It is a stunning expansion of federal power and an assault on the liberty of American citizens. That is exactly why I personally filed a legal challenge to ObamaCare in 2011 and why we joined the multi-state lawsuit on which the Supreme Court ruled today.
Although I am continuing to review the ruling by the Supreme Court, I would resist any expansion of Medicaid that could result in significant tax increases or dramatic cuts to education, public safety and job creation.
Many of us hoped ObamaCare would fall today by a vote of the Supreme Court; instead, it will fall in November by a vote of the American people. I plan to work hard between now and November to elect Mitt Romney and a Republican Congress so we can repeal the damaging policies of this president."
