With faith in our founding principles, Governor Bryant has never wavered in his stand for policies consistent with conservative Mississippi values. Governor Bryant signed bills in his first term to:
* Require abortion facilities to meet the same medical standards as other medical facilities.
* Ban abortion after 20 weeks.
* Protect our Second Amendment rights through a clearer open carry law, protections for the privacy of law-abiding gun owners, and a tax holiday on firearms.
* Protect religious liberty and place "IN GOD WE TRUST" on the state seal.
* Safeguard our elections by requiring voters to present identification at polling places.
* Create the "Healthy Teens for a Better Mississippi" initiative to reduce teen pregnancy.
* Require public colleges and universities to develop plans to reduce teen pregnancy.

Mississippi should be a place where every child has the chance to be born into a mature, safe, two-parent family. To make this vision a reality, Governor Bryant will:
* Continue to fight to reduce teen pregnancy.
* Strengthen efforts to identify and prosecute child predators.
* Use every means possible to collect and distribute child support payments.
* Defend the right to life of the unborn.
