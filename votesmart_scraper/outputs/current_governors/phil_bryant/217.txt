Gov. Phil Bryant Comments on Proposed Anti-Gun Legislation
Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Jan. 14, 2014
Location: Jackson, MS

"Any bills that attempt to track ammunition, seize weapons or otherwise infringe upon the right of Mississippians to keep and bear arms are a frontal assault on the Second Amendment. I will not stand by and allow gun owner rights to be trampled in this state, and I will immediately veto such bills if they reach my desk."
