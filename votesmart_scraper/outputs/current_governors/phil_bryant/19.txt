Press Release
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Feb. 23, 2016

Gov. Phil Bryant issued a state of emergency today for all areas of the state that may be affected by severe weather. A potent storm system that has the potential for strong tornadoes, damaging winds, hail and heavy rain is expected to impact the state through Tuesday night.
The state of emergency is an administrative tool that allows local governments to request state assistance to assist with response and recovery associated with the storm recovery.
"All our citizens need to be prepared for this severe weather event," Gov. Bryant said. "Everyone should know how to receive weather alerts and have an action plan to take shelter if severe weather strikes."
The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide updates as information becomes available. The best way to get up-to-date information is to "Like" MEMA on Facebook, or "Follow" the agency on Twitter.
