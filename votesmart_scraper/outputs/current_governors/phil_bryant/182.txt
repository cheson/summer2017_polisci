A host of conservative legislative and fiscal measures supported and signed by Gov. Phil Bryant are set to take effect July 1. Major legislation includes a measure to protect religions liberty and add "In God We Trust" to the state seal, "Right on Crime" criminal justice reforms, a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks, a pay raise for public school teachers, and several anti-union bills. The state fiscal year also begins July 1; the state budget will include filling the "Rainy Day Fund" savings account.
"We worked hard to ensure the laws Mississippi passed embodied strong, conservative priorities," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "I am also proud that we passed a budget that protects the state's financial stability by fully funding our savings account and ending the practice of paying for recurring expenses with one-time revenue sources."
Major legislation and funding priorities that will take effect tomorrow include:
* Protecting religious freedom (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) and adding the national motto "In God We Trust" to the Mississippi state seal (Senate Bill 2681).
* Protecting gun owner rights (House Bill 314) and providing a sales tax holiday for sportsmen and sportswomen (Senate Bill 2425).
* Banning most abortions at 20 weeks (House Bill 1400).
Public Safety
* Comprehensive "Right on Crime" criminal justice reforms (House Bill 585) that will help Mississippi avoid about $266 million in projected increases to corrections costs over the next decade.
