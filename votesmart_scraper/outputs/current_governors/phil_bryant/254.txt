Cooperation Results in Medicaid Continuation, Gov. Bryant Says
Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: June 28, 2013
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Bryant issues the following statement regarding the conclusion of the two-day special legislative session.
"Today's success is a victory for the vulnerable and is a result of working together with the leadership in the House and Senate. We reauthorized the Division of Medicaid, ensured it can continue without another upheaval in the near future and appropriated funding for its operation--and we stopped expansion of ObamaCare while doing so. Both Speaker of the House Philip Gunn and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves showed exemplary leadership, and I am proud of them both."
