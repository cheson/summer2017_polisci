Press Release
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Jan. 26, 2015
Location: Verona, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant and officials from upholstered furniture manufacturer United Furniture Industries announced today the company is expanding in Mississippi by locating manufacturing operations in the former Lane Furniture facility in Verona. The project represents a $2.75 million corporate investment and will create 300 new jobs, bringing the company's total employment in the state to approximately 2,000.
United Furniture currently maintains operations in several Mississippi locations, including Amory, Hatley, Nettleton, Okolona and Vardaman. The company's decision to purchase the Verona facility is due to an increase in demand and production.
"For 15 years, United Furniture has been a valued member of Mississippi's business community and furniture industry. Throughout that time, the company has grown tremendously, and with the addition of these 300 new jobs, United Furniture will employ approximately 2,000 individuals in northeast Mississippi," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "That is a strong testament to the productive workforce and supportive business climate we strive to provide throughout the state. I wish the company many more years of success in northeast Mississippi."
"We would like to thank the Governor, MDA, TVA, the CDF and all others involved in helping put this project together. We are excited to expand our manufacturing presence in northeast Mississippi," said United Furniture Industries CFO Doug Hanby. "We plan to begin some production in mid-February and are looking to start hiring in the next few days. Applications can be submitted online at UFIjobs.com or in person at our Amory, Miss., human resources location."
The Mississippi Development Authority provided assistance in support of the project for building modifications and workforce training.
"In 2014, our economic development efforts -- working together with our partners throughout Mississippi -- produced strong results and created more than 6,000 new jobs for the citizens of Mississippi. Today's announcement that United Furniture is expanding into Verona and creating 300 new job opportunities is putting the state on the right track toward another successful year for economic development," said MDA Executive Director Brent Christensen. "We are glad to have assisted with this latest expansion, and we thank our partners at the Community Development Foundation, the Lee County Board of Supervisors and the Tennessee Valley Authority for working together to bring this project to fruition."
United Furniture was formed in 2000 through the merger and acquisitions of Parkhill Furniture Company, Comfort Furniture and United Chair. Since that time, the company has undergone numerous expansions and now operates in more than 4 million square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space in Mississippi, North Carolina and California.
United Furniture is the exclusive U.S. manufacturer of Simmons Upholstery. The company offers a large range of styles and designs, including stationary sofas, BeautyrestÂ™ upholstery, reclining sofas, recliners, sectionals and Hide-A-Bed sleepers.
