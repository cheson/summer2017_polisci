Gov. Bryant Comments on U.S. House of Representatives' Move to Not Provide Funding for ObamaCare
Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: March 12, 2013
Location: Jackson, MS

"I appreciate Congressional Republicans, including our delegation, for taking a stand against out of control spending that would pass additional debt to our children and grandchildren. Our nation is already saddled with more than $16.6 trillion in debt, and the Government Accountability Office has agreed with calculations that ObamaCare will heap an additional $6.2 trillion on to that figure. Congressional Republicans understand that the federal government cannot afford the promises of ObamaCare. I continue to believe that Mississippi should not expand Medicaid because doing so would result in tax increases for hardworking Mississippians or cuts to critical spending in areas like education, public safety and economic development."
