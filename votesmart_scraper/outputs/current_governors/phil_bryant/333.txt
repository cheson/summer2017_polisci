Governor Bryant Urges Lawmakers to Pass a Strong Child Protection Act
Press Release

Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant stressed the importance of The Child Protection Act, House Bill 16, in a letter to Senate Chairman Briggs Hopson and House Chairman Andy Gibson. The bill has moved to conference, where House and Senate members will work to draft final language for the measure.
Bryant is urging lawmakers to retain original House language that requires the retention of DNA evidence for use in possible criminal prosecutions.
"Returning this legislation back to the original House version will provide the necessary tools for law enforcement to fight crimes against children," Bryant said. "The Child Protection Act will send a clear message that Mississippi will not tolerate such abuse and will pursue the criminal who preys on children."
While Bryant was lieutenant governor, the Mississippi Senate passed The Child Protection Act unanimously. Bill drafts required retention of DNA evidence for possible prosecution in cases where abortions are performed on children under the age of fourteen.
