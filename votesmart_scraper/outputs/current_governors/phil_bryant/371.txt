Public Statements
Deputy to Lt. Gov, Bryant says service is career
Press Release

Location: Jackson, MS

Phil Bryant was part of a Jaycees group invited to the White House in 1986 to meet President Ronald Reagan. He remembers sitting in the Roosevelt Room, near the Oval Office, and being in awe as the broad-shouldered Republican icon strode into the room, a mere 12 feet away, and urged the young civic-group presidents to become leaders in their own communities.
"What an unbelievable moment for a young boy from Moorhead, Mississippi, whose dad was a diesel mechanic, mother was a housewife, the youngest of three boys, first ever to graduate from college in his family," Bryant recalled.
He said Reagan's speech inspired him to later seek public office.
Now 56 and a one-term Republican lieutenant governor of Mississippi, Bryant is the top fundraiser in the open race for governor. Republican Haley Barbour -- who was political director for the Reagan White House in the mid-1980s -- is limited to two terms as governor and couldn't seek re-election this year.
In next Tuesday's Republican gubernatorial primary, Bryant, of Brandon, faces businessman Dave Dennis of Pass Christian, Pearl River County supervisor Hudson Holliday of Poplarville and businessman Ron Williams of Moss Point.
Five Democrats are competing in a gubernatorial primary. Runoffs for each party, if needed, are Aug. 23.
In the Nov. 8 general election, one independent is also running for governor. Competing factions of the Reform Party want to put a candidate in the race, and their inner-party dispute over who's running could be decided by the state Board of Election Commissioners sometime after the major-party primaries.
