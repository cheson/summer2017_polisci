--Gov. Phil Bryant commends the Mississippi Senate for passage of House Bill 1152, a measure that would authorize public charter schools.
The measure passed the Senate by a vote of 31-19.
"In my inaugural State of the State address, I asked the Legislature to send me a workable charter school bill this session," Gov. Bryant said. "I commend the Senate for passing this measure, and I look forward to working with House leaders to enact this legislation that will give Mississippi children the opportunities they deserve."
The bill goes to the House for further consideration.
