Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Feb. 10, 2013
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant declared a State of Emergency today for four Mississippi counties due to the impacts of severe storms and tornadoes.
Those counties are: Forrest, Lamar, Lawrence and Marion.
Any additional counties with damages or impacts due to the ongoing severe weather will also be covered by this State of Emergency.
"As local and state officials work together to assess the damages, this State of Emergency will help expedite the support needed," Gov. Bryant said.
The State of Emergency is an administrative tool that allows the state to offer support to the areas impacted by this weather event.
Storm spotters confirmed at least one tornado, which moved through Lamar and Forrest Counties earlier this evening and is responsible for damages in Hattiesburg and on the campus of the University of Southern Mississippi.
Mississippi Emergency Management Agency has deployed state resources including search and rescue teams and a forward command center to support the local governments as they respond to this event.
