Gov. Phil Bryant recently signed House Bill 1450, the Shared Technology Efficiency Act. The legislation aims to minimize Mississippi's cost to operate IT services by eliminating redundant spending, consolidating technology purchasing and safeguarding state data through better utilization of Mississippi's State Data Center.
"A reliable way to save money is to streamline services when possible," Bryant said. "By optimizing our IT services, we can realize the cost savings of consolidated purchasing, and we can avoid the waste that often results from redundant spending."
Dr. Craig Orgeron, Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services executive director, stated, "With the fiscal challenges the state faces, the best way to bring about efficiencies in IT for an enterprise the size of state government is to standardize on IT hardware and software to the extent practical, to leverage volume discounts on goods and services, and to share common IT resources across agency boundaries."
ITS will coordinate the state's IT efforts and will work to improve Mississippi's technology assets and offerings. ITS has already launched Phase I of its overhaul to ms.gov, the state's portal for online services and information.
