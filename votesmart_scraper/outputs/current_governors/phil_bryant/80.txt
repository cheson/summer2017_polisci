Governor Phil Bryant issues the following statement on the passing of BB King:
"Mississippi is known the world over as the birthplace of America's music, and BB King is one of its founding legends and one of our state's most treasured gifts to the music world. For decades, our souls have been stirred by his talents. From juke joints to concert halls, there is no place his influence hasn't reached. Deborah and I are saddened by BB's passing. Mississippi has lost a legend. He is the king. The thrill is gone."
