Gov. Phil Bryant was today awarded the Defender of Freedom Award by the National Rifle Association in recognition of his steadfast defense of the Second Amendment. The governor received the award during the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action Leadership Forum during the 2014 NRA annual meeting in Indianapolis.
"The Second Amendment is part of the fabric of our nation and is especially important to many Mississippians," Gov. Bryant said. "I am honored to receive this award from the NRA, and I will continue working to protect Mississippian's gun ownership rights and the strong outdoor traditions in our state."
Gov. Bryant is an avid hunter and outdoorsman, is a lifetime member of the NRA and was endorsed by the NRA during his gubernatorial campaign. He is a past recipient of the Kirk Fordice Freedom Award presented by the Central Mississippi chapter of the NRA.
"I'm pleased to present Governor with NRA's "Defender of Freedom' award in recognition of his outstanding support of the Second Amendment and Mississippi's proud hunting heritage," said Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. "On behalf of our nearly 40,000 members in the State of Mississippi, I want to thank him for his leadership on issues affecting gun owners and sportsmen."
In 2012, Gov. Bryant supported a House Concurrent Resolution (No. 30) to amend the Mississippi Constitution to establish the right to hunt, fish and harvest wildlife as a constitutional right. Voters will have the opportunity to vote on this amendment in the November 2014 election.
Since becoming governor, Bryant has also signed many pro-gun measures into law:
