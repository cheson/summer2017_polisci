Alabama and Mississippi are forming a partnership to further study the oil sands resources in the two states, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley and Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant announced on Saturday while speaking to the Southern States Energy Board.
Governor Bentley and Governor Bryant signed a memorandum of understanding commissioning an assessment of oil sands, which is a sandy mixture found below the surface containing bitumen. After extracting the sand, the bitumen is transformed into refinery-ready crude oil.
"As I have said before, for our nation to become more energy independent, we must recognize the importance of a forward-thinking approach to energy and continue to develop a comprehensive energy policy that works," Governor Bryant said.
The assessment is to be conducted as a joint effort between the Geological Survey of Alabama/State Oil and Gas Board, the Mississippi State Oil and Gas Board, the Mississippi Development Authority, the Mississippi Office of Geology and the Southern States Energy Board.
"By taking this action, we're exploring the potential for safe and reliable development of energy right here at home," Governor Bentley said.
Governor Bentley currently serves as chairman of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. During his time as chairman, he has addressed the states' roles in the responsible development of various energy resources. In his 2013 Chairman's Address, Governor Bentley said state oil and gas boards are the agencies that have the best expertise and local knowledge to oversee development of our oil and gas resources.
