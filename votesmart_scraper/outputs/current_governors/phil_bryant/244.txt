Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Sept. 19, 2013
Location: Jackson, MS

"Today's report from State Economist Darren Webb that Mississippi's economy continues to improve brings to the forefront our aggressive growth strategy to retain our existing industry base and recruit new global business investment. So far in 2013, we have announced the creation of 4,827 new jobs. This is a testament to Mississippi's workforce and to our efforts in fostering a strong business climate. Economic development is a dynamic team sport, and I appreciate the work of Mississippi Development Authority Executive Director Brent Christensen and the entire MDA team for their hard work and dedication."
