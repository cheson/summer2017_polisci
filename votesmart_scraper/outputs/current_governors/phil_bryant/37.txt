Officials from Biewer Lumber announce the company is locating a state-of-the-art sawmill in Newton, Miss. The project represents a corporate investment of $85 million and will create 125 jobs.
Construction of the new sawmill is slated to begin in the first quarter of 2016, with mill production expected to begin in early 2017. Once operational, the new facility will expand the company's mill production into the South; Biewer currently operates four Midwest-based sawmills, as well as three treatment/distribution centers.
"I am glad to welcome Biewer Lumber as the newest member of the East Mississippi business community and newest business partner to the state. I know the area's productive workforce and abundant supply of timber will position the company for many years of success in Newton," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "I thank the company for placing its confidence in our supportive business climate and for creating so many new jobs for the area's workers."
