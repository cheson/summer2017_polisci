Governor Bryant Considers Calling Special Session
Press Release

Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant today announced that he is considering a special legislative session within the session to provide lawmakers increased opportunity to consider public charter school legislation.
Senate Bill 2401, the public charter schools bill, failed to pass in the House Education Committee meeting today by a very narrow vote of 16 to 15.
Gov. Bryant has long advocated for public charter schools, saying that Mississippi's students deserve every opportunity to succeed.
"I am disappointed that the charter school bill failed to pass in the House Committee today but appreciate Speaker Gunn and Chairman Moore's efforts in attempting to pass this very important legislation," Gov. Bryant said. Creating public charter schools is one way to give our children another opportunity to succeed. I am considering calling a special session within the session to give lawmakers additional time to develop a workable public charter school bill. We must stop accepting failing schools that do not give kids the opportunities they deserve."
