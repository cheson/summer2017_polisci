Gov. Phil Bryant and officials from Ice Industries Grenada announced today the company is continuing to expand and improve operations at its facility in Grenada, Miss. The project marks the company's fifth expansion since 2010. It represents a company investment of $1.8 million and will create 50 new jobs, bringing the total number employed at the facility to approximately 290.
Ice Industries Grenada, formerly known as Grenada Stamping and Assembly, supplies parts to the appliance, automotive, heavy truck, and alternative energy markets. Improvements will include infrastructure upgrades, overhead crane improvements, and shipping and safety enhancements that will allow the company to continue to expand service to its customers. New metal stamping and assembly equipment is also being installed to accommodate additional work from existing customers, as well as new work the company has acquired in the furniture industry.
"Ice Industries is a shining example of a Mississippi business that continues to place its confidence in the state's supportive business climate and trust in its workforce," Gov. Bryant said. "I am grateful to Ice Industries team for once again creating new job opportunities for the area's residents and for helping show the world that Mississippi is a great place to do business."
"We continue to find ways to grow our capabilities and add value to our global customer base by not only providing metal stamping, but also through assembly operations, welding, and painting. This latest investment clearly demonstrates the commitment Ice Industries has made to world class manufacturing in Grenada, Mississippi," said Ice Industries Chairman and CEO Howard Ice. "We appreciate the considerable efforts that MDA and Grenada County have undertaken to support Ice Industries, our customers, and our employees."
The Mississippi Development Authority provided assistance in support of the project for building improvements. Grenada County provided assistance for the project, as well.
"MDA is proud to once again support Ice Industries as it pursues growth opportunities in Grenada County. Ice Industries is a valued member of the Grenada business community and business partner to the state, and we look forward to working with the company again in the future," said MDA Executive Director Brent Christensen. "We thank our partners in Grenada County for working with us to help this great company with its latest expansion."
