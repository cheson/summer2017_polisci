Governor Phil Bryant and officials from Milwaukee Tool announced today the company is expanding its operations in Greenwood, Miss. The project represents a corporate investment of $16.8 million, and the creation of 126 new jobs, of which 105 have been filled. This brings the total number employed by the company in Greenwood to 508. Milwaukee Tool employs a total of 891 workers throughout its three Mississippi locations.
For this project, the company will locate its expanded operations into a facility adjacent to its existing location. Milwaukee Tool is leasing that facility from the city of Greenwood.
"This announcement is great news for the Mississippi Delta as Milwaukee Tool increases its presence in Greenwood and creates new jobs for the region's workforce. We are committed to partnering with our existing companies like Milwaukee Tool to advance industrial growth throughout the state, and we look forward to working with the company again in the future," Gov. Bryant said. "I thank Milwaukee Tool for its dedication to Greenwood and Mississippi and wish the company many years of continued success."
"Milwaukee Tool is dedicated to driving growth and creating new jobs in the United States," said Milwaukee Tool Group President Steve Richman. "In the last several years we have created nearly 900 new jobs across the country, more than 250 of which are in Mississippi. We firmly believe that, through investing in our people, we will deliver disruptive innovation and the highest quality products for our users and distribution partners."
Mississippi Development Authority provided assistance in support of the project for infrastructure improvements to Milwaukee Tool's new facility, as well as for renovations to the company's current facility. The city of Greenwood provided assistance for building renovations, as well.
