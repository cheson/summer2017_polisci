Location: Jackson, MS

Legislation to bolster Mississippi's workforce is on the way to Gov. Phil Bryant's desk.
The House passed Senate Bill 2808 on Tuesday. The bill creates the Mississippi Works Fund to provide highly focused workforce training for new and existing businesses.
This fund is an addition to the Workforce Enhancement Training Fund, which provides funding for existing businesses to train current personnel. The legislation allots $10 million for workforce training at community colleges for 2016, and $5 million each following year. Annual performance reports to the Governor and the Legislature are required.
"We recently celebrated the largest, single-day job-creation and capital investment success in Mississippi's history," Gov. Bryant said. "To break the record set by Continental Tire and TopShip, we must maintain the best workforce in the nation. I am grateful to the House and the Senate for their commitment to doing that. I will quickly sign this legislation."
