Public Assistance Approved for Marion County Following Severe Storms and Tornadoes
Press Release
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Jan. 8, 2015
Location: Jackson, MS

Marion County has been granted Public Assistance Categories A-G through the Federal Emergency Management Agency following severe storms and tornadoes on Dec. 23, 2014. Five tornadoes affected central Mississippi, including Marion and Jones counties. The storms caused five deaths.
Mississippi also received approval to administer FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Program statewide.
Governor Bryant's request for Individual Assistance for Jones and Marion counties is still under review by FEMA. Individual Assistance is aid that helps individuals and families recover.
Gov. Bryant requested a presidential disaster declaration based on damage sustained in each county. In Marion County, 82 homes and 43 businesses were heavily damaged or destroyed. In Jones County, eight homes and one business were heavily damaged or destroyed. On Monday, Mississippi's entire congressional delegation sent a letter to the president in support of Gov. Bryant's request.
"This assistance will help rebuild the community following these tragic tornadoes," said Gov. Bryant. "We mourn the five lives lost during the Christmas holidays, and I am hopeful the federal government will quickly approve the additional aid I requested."
Through the Public Assistance declaration, state and local governments and certain non-profit groups in Marion County are eligible for certain types of aid. Disaster costs incurred since Dec. 23 could be reimbursed by FEMA through its 75 percent cost-sharing program.
The Public Assistance aid available includes assistance in Categories A-G and may assist with things like repairing public roads and bridges, rebuilding public buildings like the National Guard Armory, and removing debris from public properties and rights of way, emergency work and actions to prevent threats to life and property.
