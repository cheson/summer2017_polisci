Statement

Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Bryant provides comment upon learning that the President's budget recommends a one-year delay in reductions to Disproportionate Share Hospital payments under the Affordable Care Act.
"After speaking with Secretary Sebelius on April 3 regarding funding for Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, I am pleased to see that President Obama's budget delays cutting these payments until 2015.
I have long advocated that cuts to this program should not be used to affect budgets in states that choose not to expand Medicaid. This move should give us additional time to make a reasonable decision about any changes to the Medicaid program.
Furthermore, this supports my position that the budget and authorization for the current Medicaid program in Mississippi should be adopted."
