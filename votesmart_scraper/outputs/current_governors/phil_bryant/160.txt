Press Release
By: Phil Bryant
Date: Sept. 11, 2014
Location: Jackson, MS

Gov. Phil Bryant has issued a state of emergency this evening for flooding in Desoto County, Miss., following severe storms and flooding that occurred earlier Thursday. A state of emergency is an administrative tool that authorizes the use of additional state resources to aid in storm response efforts.
The National Weather Service is reporting five to seven inches of rain fell in DeSoto County over a 12-hour period today.
"I have declared a state of emergency to assist local officials with any available state resources," Gov. Bryant said. "I have been in contact with MEMA Director Robert Latham, and he is on his way to Desoto County to assess the situation."
County Emergency Management reports numerous homes and roads have been flooded primarily in the cities of Southaven and Horn Lake. Exact figures are not known because many areas are still covered by water.
Desoto County and the American Red Cross are opening a shelter for displaced residents at 6 p.m. at the Brown Missionary Baptist Church, 980 Stateline Road East in Southaven.
MEMA staff are assisting local officials with any needs the state may need to provide and will conduct preliminary damage assessments once areas are accessible.
Residents are asked to report any damage to their county emergency management director. A directory of those directors can be found on the MEMA website, www.msema.org, and on our free mobile phone app by searching MEMA.
