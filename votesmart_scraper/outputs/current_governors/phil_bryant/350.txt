Gov. Phil Bryant commends the Legislature for passing bills that aim to create jobs and cultivate energy opportunities. The passage of bills that aid youth and children, reform illegal immigration laws and improve efficiency in government have also progressed in the 2012 Legislative session.
"We are moving Mississippi forward," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "I am grateful to our House and Senate for advancing these issues that will improve the quality of life in our state. We need to continue to work to grow our economy and provide opportunities for our youth, and these bills ensure we are laying the foundation for a better Mississippi."
Both the House and Senate have approved components of Bryant's "Mississippi Works" agenda, which outlines ways to enhance job growth in Mississippi. One portion of the package calls for dual enrollment programs that allow potential high school dropouts to complete diploma requirements while learning a particular trade through workforce training programs. The initiative was passed through House Bill 864 and Senate Bill 2792.
Another element of Bryant's "Mississippi Works" agenda, The Energy Sustainability and Development Act of 2012, is also moving forward. The House approved House Bill 1330, which aims to expand Mississippi's economy through the creation of energy jobs, diversified energy development and increased energy research. Mississippi has become well-known for its pro-energy climate, and Bryant said he wants to capitalize on this industry.
"The energy economy will drive Mississippi's future, so we must have an "all of the above' strategy that will increase energy development and create valuable, needed jobs for our citizens," Bryant said.
