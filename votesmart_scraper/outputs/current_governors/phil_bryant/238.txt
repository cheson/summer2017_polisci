Gov. Bryant Issues Order to Temporarily Reinstate 10 Mississippi Hospitals to the Blue Cross Network

After Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Mississippi terminated contracts with 10 Mississippi hospitals, Gov. Phil Bryant today issued an executive order requiring that the hospitals be reinstated to the network for about 60 days until an investigation can be done.
"I had hoped the two parties could come to some resolution, but as Governor, I cannot sit back and allow Mississippian's access to care to be threatened in violation of state law," Gov. Bryant said. "It is my hope that a full investigation will ensure that no law has been broken as it relates to a patient's access to care and a provider's responsibility under state law."
According to Executive Order 1327 it provides, first, that the 10 hospitals will be returned temporarily to the network on the same terms on which they operated prior to their exclusion. Second, the Governor's Order provides for the Department of Insurance to complete its ongoing investigation of the hospitals' exclusion and, if appropriate, hold hearings on any violations of the law that are identified. If the Department identifies no violations, the Order requires it to submit a report explaining why the hospitals' exclusion is consistent with applicable state law.
The Order provides that the investigation, as well as any required hearings or reports, should be completed within 60 days. It will then expire automatically seven days after this process concludes.
The Order issued by Gov. Bryant does not attempt to resolve the parties' dispute over prior payments under their contracts, and it expresses no opinion and has no effect on that issue or their ongoing lawsuit. Rather, the Order is intended to preserve access to care until a full investigation is complete.
