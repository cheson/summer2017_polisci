Veterans in Mississippi will be able to show proof of military service on their driver's licenses or state-issued IDs if lawmakers in the House of Representatives pass Senate Bill 2461. Gov. Phil Bryant said he plans to sign the bill if it is transmitted to him.
The provision providing for veteran identification is an amendment to Senate Bill 2461, which passed the Senate unanimously today. The amendment was offered by Sen. Hob Bryan.
"I appreciate Sen. Hob Bryan for offering this amendment and honoring those who have served our country," Bryant said. "Many businesses provide benefits to veterans, and adding this designation to veterans' driver's licenses and IDs will make sure they are recognized for their service to our state and nation."
More than 200,000 veterans live in Mississippi.
Fifteen other states now designate military services on driver's licenses, and showing proof of service on a license is often less cumbersome for a veteran than proving service with military documentation. Other states such as Alaska, Michigan, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin are considering similar legislation.
