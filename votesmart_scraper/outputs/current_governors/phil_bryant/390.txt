Despite a difficult economy and a tight state budget, we have some exciting things happening in Mississippi. Over the past 3 years, there have been great economic development and business recruitment success stories in Mississippi.
That's what we need more of--job creation--and that's why my top priority will be making Mississippi the most job friendly state in America.
Let's be clear: government can't create jobs, but it can create an environment where jobs can grow and our economy can flourish with the right economic policies.
We can do it by keeping taxes low, keeping spending under control, making sure tort reform stays in place and that we continue our focus on actively recruiting new businesses and industries to locate their companies right here in the greatest state in America.
