Gov. Phil Bryant applauds the Senate Education Committee for its near unanimous passage of Senate Bill 2695, the Equal Opportunity for Students with Special Needs Act. The bill is sponsored by Sens. Nancy Collins and now heads to the full Senate for consideration. During his State of the State Address, Gov. Bryant called on the Legislature to send the bill to his desk.
"I congratulate Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, Senate Education Committee Chairman Gray Tollison and the Senate Education Committee for taking a step in support of students with special needs. These children and their families don't need more education bureaucracy, they need real options now. Passage of this bill is a step in the right direction, and I urge the House to act in favor of these students, as well."
