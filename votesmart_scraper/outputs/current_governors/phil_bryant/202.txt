Mississippi House Passes Funding for Trooper School
Press Release
By: Phil Bryant
Date: March 17, 2014
Location: Jackson, MS

The Mississippi House today unanimously adopted an appropriations bill for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety that includes $6.9 million to conduct a trooper school as requested by Governor Phil Bryant in his Fiscal Year 2015 Executive Budget Recommendation. The bill now awaits action by the Mississippi Senate.
Mississippi is approximately 150 troopers short, with more than 120 currently retirement eligible. The $6.9 million funding recommended for a trooper school would cover training costs for the school, as well as vehicles, weapons, ammunition, armored vests, uniforms and other equipment for a graduating class of 60 troopers. It would also cover salaries for the graduating troopers for the remainder of the fiscal year in which they graduate.
"We know that we must train more troopers. If we don't, people will die. Protecting public safety is the foremost function of government, and we owe it to Mississippians, and to the troopers who are already stretching to cover the state, to get this done," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "I thank the House for their leadership on this issue, and I look forward to action from the Senate."
