Mississippi elected officials and Jones County Supervisors have joined Governor Haley Barbour in opposition to a planned slot parlor near Sandersville.
Governor Barbour, Lt. Gov. Phil Bryant, Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney, Auditor Stacey Pickering, Treasurer Tate Reeves and Agriculture Commissioner Lester Spell outlined their concerns today about the proposed gaming operation in a letter to Miko Beasley Denson, Chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.
"Allowing a gambling operation to be developed in the manner which the MBCI proposes to do will result in an economic drain on Jones County and the surrounding areas, which will necessarily have to shoulder the financial and personal burden of negative impacts resulting from this facility," the letter states. "This proposed gambling facility fails to meet the policy of the state to develop destination casino gambling, unlike the MBCI's developments in Neshoba County which provided the type of amenities -- such as a golf course, water park, and restaurants -- needed to ensure the developments are consistent with state policies."
Jones County Supervisors have adopted a resolution in opposition to the gaming plan.
