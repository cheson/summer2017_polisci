Press Release

Location: Jackson, MS

Governor Phil Bryant has signed two gun rights measures into law. Senate Bill 2394 allows Mississippians the option of carrying a pistol or revolver in a purse, briefcase or other fully enclosed case without a concealed carry permit. Senate Bill 2619, which is effective immediately, allows active duty military, veterans and honorably retired law enforcement officers to count firearms training toward the requirements for an enhanced concealed carry permit and protects Mississippians from federal overregulation of ammunition.
"The right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to America and to Mississippi," Gov. Phil Bryant said. "I have always been a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment, and I am proud to sign these bills into law. I thank the National Rifle Association for their support of these measures and thank Rep. Andy Gibson for his continued leadership on behalf of gun owners in Mississippi."
Senate Bill 2394, which is effective July 1, 2015, also:
* reduces the fee for concealed carry permits from $100 to $80;
* reduces permit renewal fees;
* exempts active duty military from paying the concealed carry fee, and
* beginning Jan. 1, 2016, allows the Department of Public Safety to include the designation "retired law enforcement officer" on driver licenses for honorably retired law enforcement and correctional officers.
"The NRA's five million dues-paying members appreciate the leadership of Governor Phil Bryant on Second Amendment issues. The legislation he signed into law will provide key reforms and strengthen the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Mississippians," said Chris W. Cox, Executive Director of the NRA-ILA.
