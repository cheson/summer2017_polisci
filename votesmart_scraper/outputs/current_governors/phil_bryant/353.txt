Gov. Phil Bryant commends the Mississippi House of Representatives for passage of HB 1186, the "Mississippi Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Act." The measure passed the full chamber today by an overwhelming majority and is a key component of Bryant's legislative agenda.
The measure creates a volunteer committee of current and former small business owners and officers who will work with agencies to review existing and proposed rules and regulations and determine if such regulations are harmful to small businesses.
"Small businesses make up the bulk of our employers in Mississippi," Gov. Bryant said. "Large businesses are often better able to comply with across-the-board regulations than small businesses because economies of scale are not taken into account. This legislation ensures that small businesses have a voice and that regulations are not unduly cumbersome.
"I will not stand for job-killing regulations, and I want to make sure that no business shies away from expanding or locating in Mississippi because of burdensome mandates."
