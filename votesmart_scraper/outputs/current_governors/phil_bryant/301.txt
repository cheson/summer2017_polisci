Gov. Phil Bryant today unveiled his comprehensive plan for capitalizing on Mississippi's energy strengths and bringing more energy jobs and research to the state. Bryant presented the plan at the conclusion of his "Governor's Energy Summit" in Jackson.
"As I said in my inaugural State of the State Address, our energy economy will drive Mississippi's economic growth in the 21st century," Gov. Bryant said. "The world's energy demands will continue to grow, and Mississippi is in the position to become a dominant force in the energy industry. My energy plan establishes a comprehensive framework that will position Mississippi for new jobs, new growth and a future built on reliable, affordable energy."
Energy Works: Mississippi's Energy Roadmap, details opportunities in six key focus areas that will play vital roles in growing Mississippi's energy economy:
Enhancing Mississippi's position as a top state for oil and gas-related exploration and extraction
Promoting Mississippi's competitive advantages, maximizing energy resources and expanding the energy value chain
Expanding energy capacity through conservation and efficiency
Developing transportation and energy infrastructure to meet growing demand
Increasing energy-focused research and development
Meeting the workforce needs of the energy industry
"Mississippi is on the cutting edge of energy technology. Now it is time to continue moving forward with more energy jobs and more investment in oil, gas and all other forms of competitive energy," Bryant said.
The Energy Works plan stems from months of meetings and discussions with more than fifty industry leaders both in and out of Mississippi, state agencies and workforce and economic development partners.
