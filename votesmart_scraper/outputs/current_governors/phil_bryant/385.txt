A staunch conservative who will make Mississippi "the most job-friendly state in America," Lt. Gov. Phil Bryant made his opening pitch to be the state's next Republican governor during a stop in Hattiesburg Monday.
Bryant accompanied by his wife, Deborah, spoke at Chain Electric Co., one of several small businesses across the state serving as a venue for his announcement Monday.
The choice, of course, was symbolic.
"We're focusing on economic development in this campaign. It is the sun in our universe and everything else rotates around it," he said.
Bryant was one of three candidates to officially enter the campaign to replace Gov. Haley Barbour, who is prevented by the state constitution from serving a third term.
Republican Dave Dennis of Gulfport and Democrat Bill Luckett of Clarksdale filed qualifying papers with their parties.
Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree is also expected to seek the Democratic Party nomination but has yet to qualify.
Bryant, 56, a University of Southern Mississippi graduate, promised to continue the job creation work of Gov. Haley Barbour, citing the recent groundbreaking of a clean coal gasification plant in Kemper County.
"Whether it's in DeSoto County or Kemper County or it's in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, it's all about creating businesses," he said.
