Gov. Bryant Comments on Special Legislative Session
Statement
By: Phil Bryant
Date: June 27, 2013
Location: Jackson, MS

"While it is regrettable that Democrats have forced the expense of a special session onto taxpayers and even today continued to waste time and resources with political grandstanding, I am pleased with today's progress. I commend Speaker Gunn for his leadership and thank the House of Representatives for voting to reauthorize and fund the Division of Medicaid. I look forward to working with Lt. Gov. Reeves and the Senate and anticipate their swift action on these matters."
