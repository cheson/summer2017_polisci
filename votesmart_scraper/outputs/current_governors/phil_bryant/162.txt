Mississippi was one of only seven states on Monday to receive an A-grade from the American Telemedecine Association in its State Telemedicine Gaps Analysis: Coverage and Reimbursement report. This report identifies and compares state policies on a report card, assigning each state grades ranging from A-to-F based on telemedicine reimbursement and physician practice standards.
"I want to thank the Mississippi Telehealth Association and the Mississippi Legislature for their hard work and dedication in setting the bar for telemedicine around the country," Gov. Bryant said. "This year in March I signed a telemedicine bill into law that had the unanimous support of the legislature and required all health insurance plans in the state to cover telemedicine practices and reimbursements. We are committed to providing quality healthcare to all Mississippians, and telemedicine is closing the gap for many rural patients around the state."
The states with the highest grades include: Maryland, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Virginia. The states receiving the lowest possible composite grades include: Connecticut, Iowa and Rhode Island.
