JACKSON-- Gov. Phil Bryant and officials from Ashley Furniture gathered today for a groundbreaking ceremony at the site of the company's stationary upholstery manufacturing and regional distribution center in Ecru, Miss. The project represents a $6 million corporate investment in an expansion of its manufacturing facility and transportation terminal.
Once construction is complete, the new 175,192-square-foot addition will increase the company's footprint in Ecru to nearly 2 million square feet under roof. It will also increase the facility's manufacturing capacity, allowing Ashley Furniture to meet an increased product demand for its customers in the South and Midwestern regions of the U.S.
"Northeast Mississippi's furniture industry continues to experience significant growth, and Ashley Furniture's new addition will enable the company to capitalize upon that momentum well into the future," Gov. Bryant said. "Ashley Furniture has been a valued partner to the state of Mississippi for more than two decades, providing thousands of job opportunities for the residents of North Mississippi throughout its four locations. I thank the company for its continued investment in our state and in its operations."
