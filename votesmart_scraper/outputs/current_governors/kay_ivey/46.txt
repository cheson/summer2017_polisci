Energy: Alternative Sources
Kay's Answer: I am totally for any source of new energy that is cheap, easy to use, and doesn't pollute. Unfortunately, wind power, solar power, biomass, hydrogen, and other alternative sources of energy are still too expensive and inefficient to replace coal, oil, or natural gas.
Until the time comes where these energy sources become practical, Alabama should continue to rely on the abundant energy we already have around us: coal, oil, and natural gas. In fact, Alabama is the seventh largest producer of electricity in the nation. We should also continue to pursue nuclear power, which is very cheap once the power plants are built.
Another way Alabama can lead in the rush for alternative energy sources is by tasking the large number of scientists in the Huntsville research corridor to rise to the challenge. Just like Texas was the pioneer state in the early 1980s when it came to petroleum technology, Alabama could be the nation's leader in 21st century energy science.
The Benefit to You: Alabama can be a leader in alternative energy by tasking our scientists to make new energy sources practical. Until then, we must rely on the abundant energy we already have in our state.
