End Child Hunger in Alabama (ECHA) is a statewide, multisector initiative, public movement addressing the critical issues of hunger and food insecurity facing Alabama's children and youth. Three years ago, End Child Hunger in Alabama (ECHA) was launched by Auburn University's Hunger Institute, which Lt. Governor Kay Ivey is pleased to serve as the campaign spokesperson.
ECHA focuses to increase Alabama families' economic stability, cultivate a strong regional food system, build public will to end childhood hunger, improve the food assistance safety net for Alabama's children, support community action, and enhance children's health and prevent obesity. Since 2013, ECHA has made great strides on behalf of childhood hunger due to the collaborative effort of outstanding key leaders serving on the task force and the USDA summer feeding programs.
Child hunger in America has increased significantly since the great recession of 2008. Of the one million plus children who live in Alabama, more than one in four live in families that experience food hardships. Child hunger is not just a food problem but health problem, education problem and work force problem.
Hunger is preventable in our State, but we must work together. The children of our State deserve our attention. Together we can start a public movement to combat childhood hunger in Alabama. Join me in getting involved with a local feeding organization.
