Kay's Answer: There are three views that I personally hold as I reflect on the magnificence, glory and protection of life.
The first is my belief that life is an exclusive, miraculous gift from our Heavenly Father. We are all--- each one of us--- created equally in his image.
The second perspective is that we human beings, as the highest form of creation on the planet, have a unique and serious responsibility to regard and protect innocent human life as sacred and untouchable.
And lastly, I subscribe to the eloquent doctrine rooted in our nation's Declaration of Independence which states that we all are entitled to the universal, natural rights of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
Fundamentally, abortion is an affront and indignity to these principles. Abortion destroys an innocent life. It can also injure a woman who chooses to end her pregnancy.
In 2007, there was approximately one abortion for every 7 live births in Alabama. Of the more than 9,000 abortions performed in 2007, almost 20 percent were to teenagers.
Almost half a million abortions have been performed in Alabama since Roe. v. Wade was decided in 1973. That's greater than the populations of Mobile (404,000), Huntsville (387,000), or Montgomery (366,000).
For every 1,000 live births in America, there are more than 200 abortions. Since 1973, more than 40 million babies have been aborted in the United States.
