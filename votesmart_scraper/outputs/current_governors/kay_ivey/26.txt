Alabama is proud to be home to several of the nation's most critical military assets. The state is host to four major military installations--Redstone Arsenal, Maxwell Air Force Base, Fort Rucker, and Anniston Army Depot. These bases, along with the state's own National Guard and a significant defense contractor presence, generate an estimated $17 billion annual economic impact and jobs for more than 177,000 Alabamians. The military is one of the state's top industry clusters.
Lt. Governor Ivey serves as chair of the Alabama Job Creation and Military Stability Commission, created by the Legislature in 2011 to proactively insure the stability of Alabama's military resources. The Commission works to make Alabama a place where industry and the US Department of Defense seek to locate by promoting a favorable environment for military mission growth. The Commission is composed of state officials, retired military commanders, and local community leaders.
