Kay's Answer: I firmly believe marriage is between one man and one woman. It is a sacred, legal union that has been the cornerstone of civilization for centuries. It is wrong to legalize other "forms" of marriage, such as same-sex unions, and equally wrong to grant them the same legal rights.
My opposition to same-sex marriage is based on more than my personal Christian beliefs. Incidentally, none of the world's other four largest religions--Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, or Islam--- recognizes same-sex marriage as legitimate either.
There is no advantage to bringing up children in homes where parents are both of the same gender. Years of research show children need both a mom and a dad to reach their maximum potential. And other studies show children brought up in same-sex households have lower self-esteem.
I will always oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage in Alabama and elsewhere in the nation, and I support legislation that defines marriage as being between one man and one woman.
The Benefit to You: Maintaining marriage as a sacred union between one man and one woman is the best way to preserve a strong society. It should be protected.
