Kay's Answer:
I believe that when the Second Amendment says, "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed" then it is a fundamental right of the people to own and keep their guns.
I, myself, own guns, have been properly trained how to use them, and I hold a "Life Membership" with the National Rifle Association of America (NRA).
Justice Joseph Story, who served on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1811 until 1845, is recognized as one of this country's most brilliant jurists in history. Harvard educated, he finished second in his class when he was only 18 years old. He wrote many legal works, including, "A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution of the United States." He was a close observer and contributor to the early years of constitutional interpretation.
I agree with what he said in his commentary of the Second Amendment: "The importance of this article will scarcely be doubted by any persons, who have duly reflected upon the subjectÂ…The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms had justly been considered, as the palladium (safeguard) of the liberties of a republic."
How you would benefit:
Kay Ivey is a staunch defender of the Second Amendment who will stand up against designs and erosions of your constitutional right to keep and bear arms. You have a right to protect your life, your family, your property and to enjoy guns for hunting and sport.
