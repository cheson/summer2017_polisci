Upon receiving the endorsement, Ms Ivey said, "I am honored to have the support from the Alabama Citizens for Life. Nothing is as important as protecting the lives of the unborn, and as Lieutenant Governor, I will work for issues that recognize the sanctity of life and preserve traditional family values."

This is Ms. Ivey's second endorsement from a pro-life group. The first was from the Susan B. Anthony List, a national advocacy group whose motto is "Electing Leaders Who Protect the Unborn."
