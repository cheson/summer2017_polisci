Labor Day is Upon Us!
Like me, I'll bet you can't wait for football season (and hopefully, cooler weather). September in Alabama is a great month. With September we get the celebration of Labor Day (September 6th) where we commemorate and honor the men and women who make up our work force--the real backbone of our economy. Labor Day signifies the end of summer vacations and unofficially kicks off campaign season. It brings barbeques, outdoor fun and lots of political speeches. I can't tell you how many Labor Day functions I have been to over the years where I ate great barbeque or catfish and listened to some stem-winding speeches where politicians promised the voters everything under the sun.
Fundraising
When you run for office, one of the most challenging things you have to do is ask people for money. My staff reminds me of the daily commitment to make calls to contributors. It is true that well-funded campaigns can make the difference between winning and losing. Our campaign has been focusing on raising money these last few weeks, and I am glad to report that we are experiencing success beyond our expectations, but by no means are we where we need to be. I remind people all the time that I am running against an entrenched incumbent whose last name is synonymous with the good ol' boy Democrat network in Alabama. And he's scurrying around Montgomery trying to convince every special interest group--liberal and conservative--why he needs their financial support. My folks tell me he's nervous because I lead in three separate polls, including one conducted by his own campaign.
