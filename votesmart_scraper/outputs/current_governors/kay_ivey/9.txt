Governor Ivey Urges President Trump to Extend Red Snapper Season
Statement
By: Kay Ivey
Date: June 2, 2017
Location: Montgomery, AL

Today, Governor Kay Ivey expedited a letter to President Donald J. Trump formally requesting him to extend the 2017 Federal Red Snapper Season. After sending the letter, Governor Ivey made the following statement:
"Red Snapper fishing is vital to Alabamians as it is a major source of recreational enjoyment and provides great economic impact. Overreaching federal bureaucrats have unjustly made the 2017 Red Snapper Season shorter than any season in history -- that decision is simply unacceptable for Alabama.
"I have asked President Trump to extend the season to include every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in June, July and August as well as July 3 and 4 for the 2017 season. The federal government's estimates of the number of Red Snapper being caught and living in the wild are simply not accurate.
"I hope the President will do the right thing and take swift action on my request and right this wrong."
