"I talk with business leaders on a daily basis who tell me that the most important reason for their success is Ohio's talented, educated workforce. Our children are both incredibly important to our lives and families and are Ohio's greatest long-term economic asset." - Rep. Carney
Ohio must invest in its educational system as a part of economic development I supported strictly limiting state college tuition increases to 3.5% in the 2009-10 state budget, as opposed to annual increases of about 10% per year in the past. At OSU, tuition remained flat during this time period. I have continued to advocate for such policies.
