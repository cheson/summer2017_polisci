Governor Christie: I believe the people of New Jersey would pay the money we're paying right now, if what we saw were results in return. We are generous people and we want every child in this state to have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential and we'd pay to do it. What angers me even more than the money, are the wasted lives. What about those 34% of those kids every year who don't get a degree from Asbury Park High School? Where do they go? What happens to them? Think about the heartbreak for those parents who don't see a better future for their children, but one that is the same as theirs or even worse. What do you say to those kids? Well, it's not our fault because we sent a lot of money. Are we content to just sit back and let those children fail? And fail those families? And by the way, most of those families in these districts don't have a choice on top of it. They can't send their kids to a parochial school if they think their neighborhood school is a failure. They can't send their kids to a private school. They have no choice but to send their child to a neighborhood school which is spending a fortune and is failing.
