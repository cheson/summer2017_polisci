Governor Chris Christie today released the following statement in recognition of the 71st Anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces landed at Normandy during World War II:
"Today we join the rest of the country in recognizing the 71st anniversary of D-Day. American soldiers from across our great nation charged into enemy territory in the name of democracy and freedom. We pay tribute to and honor the men who fought on the beaches of Normandy to defend against tyranny and in turn changed the course of World War II. Our nation remains forever grateful to these members of America's Greatest Generation, especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice on that day. I encourage all New Jerseyans to also remember and thank the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who continue the tradition of those we lost on D-Day by always defending our nation in time of war and in peace. The dedication of our American soldiers ensures the safety and security of our country and others around the globe while promoting the sacred principles of liberty and freedom."
Governor Christie also issued a proclamation marking June 6, 2015 "D-Day Remembrance Day" throughout New Jersey.
