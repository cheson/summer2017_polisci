Governor Christie: We're going to continue to talk about these issues. I thought it was important to raise it today, given the events of last week with the unemployment numbers, and give everybody time to digest those and come back and have a conversation about them. We're going to continue to do that. We're going to continue to monitor as things go along. I want to thank the Labor Commissioner, as well. Aaron has done a great job in replacing Hal Wirths and his working together with our community colleges and others to continue to create an atmosphere of job creation in the State. And when he works in partnership with Melissa at the EDA, with Michele Brown at Choose New Jersey, and with our businesses leaders that you see, some of who you see represented here in the front row, it's that type of comradery where we're all looking to create opportunities for the residents of this state that create the kind of positive atmosphere that we have. Acknowledging that still we're a very expensive state to operate and do business in, so we don't want to make it worse, we want to try to make it better and these policies, as shown by the charts on either side of me, have made it better.
