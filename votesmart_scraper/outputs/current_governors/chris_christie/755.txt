Governor Christie To Dreamers: Our Job Is To Give You Opportunity

The fact is that the taxpayers of this state have made an enormous investment in these young people, and the question is: do we want to maximize our investment through giving them nothing more than an opportunity? There is no guarantee of success here, and because the DREAM Act has been signed it does not mean that every student who now has the opportunity to go to college will succeed. Some will, some won't. Some will exceed beyond anyone's expectations and some not. But our job, I believe as a government, is to give every one of these children, who we have already invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in, an opportunity to maximize that investment for their own benefit, for the benefit of their families, and for the benefit of our state and our country.
