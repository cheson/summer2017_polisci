Statement from Governor Chris Christie On Amtrak Service Failures
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: July 24, 2015
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today released the following statement on Amtrak's service failures this week that impacted hundreds of thousands of New Jersey commuters and actions he is taking to demand accountability:
"NJ Transit commuters were victimized by nearly an entire week of extreme delays and cancellations for one reason only: Amtrak's indifference to New Jersey commuters and its abject neglect of the infrastructure that New Jersey and our entire region relies upon. We have tried again and again to work cooperatively with Amtrak to resolve these issues, but in the face of this repeated and unacceptable failure, I am calling on the Obama Administration and Congress to step up to their responsibility to the people of New Jersey and to the largest and most important regional infrastructure system in the nation.
"I have also asked the New Jersey Attorney General to review the matter to see what recourse New Jersey has to ensure the $100 million we pay Amtrak every year for use of this critical infrastructure is being used properly. I urge Senators Booker and Menendez to join me in holding Amtrak accountable for doing their job and demanding a plan of action to immediately and fully fix these issues."
