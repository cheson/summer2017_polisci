Location: Trenton, NJ

Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement updating on his administration's response to Winter Storm Jonas:
"We are pleased that today has been such a productive day for businesses and citizens in New Jersey only 48 hours after one of our largest snowstorms in the last six years. I commend the Department of Transportation for clearing our roads so quickly and effectively. I also commend NJ Transit for helping so many commuters to get to work today without incident.
"I have dispatched teams to Cape May, Atlantic, Ocean and Cumberland counties today, led by the Lieutenant Governor and DEP Commissioner, to assess any damage. They report the flood waters have, in the main, receded and that only 500 power outages remain from a high during the storm of approximately 100,000. I have also sent the leaders of the Economic Development Authority to work with any businesses which sustained any damage.
"I also dispatched at 8:00 a.m. today the Office of Emergency Management to do Preliminary Damage Assessments to see if we meet the required minimum to apply for Federal Disaster Relief. No declaration of disaster can be made until we determine whether we have reached that damage threshold. That process will take days to complete.
"Our Administration and the people of New Jersey deserve great credit for the way we have effectively dealt with this storm. We will continue that effort until the job is done."
