Governor Christie: This is going to eat our state alive. It is eating Illinois alive as we speak. They're ahead of us, not by much, but they're ahead of us in terms of the disaster their public pension and health benefit system has driven the state to. And so I've been talking about this since I became Governor. I've been arguing about this since I became Governor. We got reforms, some reforms done in 2011. But now since January I've been saying to folks this is going to get worse and it's going to come home to roost soon. I'd thought it was going to take another year. It didn't. It took six months, and the problem is here. And now there are people in Trenton who will tell you we're going to grow out of the problem. Let me guarantee you something: anybody who tells you you're going to grow out of the problem, that's like Trenton language. You know there's Trenton and then there's regular English. And when you come to Trenton you need, you need a dictionary, a Trenton-to-English dictionary. See, when politicians in Trenton tell you we're going to grow out of the problem what that means is I don't have the guts to tell you the truth that we're going to have to do something to fix this problem, therefore I'm just going to tell you we'll grow out of it and hope you'll believe that, and then move on your merry way and not bother me because I like this job. That's not who I've been since I got here and it's not who I'm going to be for the rest of the time that I am Governor.
