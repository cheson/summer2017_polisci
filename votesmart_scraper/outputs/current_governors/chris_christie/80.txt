We also have another very bright bit of economic news that didn't get much notice this week but should have: the Bureau of Labor Statistics point out lots of different ways they cut up the unemployment numbers around the country and one of the ways they do it is looking at the over the year percentage increase in employment among the nation's 38 metropolitan areas. They divide the country up into 38 metropolitan areas. The largest year-over-year percentage last year of increase in employment among these 38 metropolitan divisions occurred in the Camden, New Jersey metro area. Employment in the Camden metro area grew by 3.7 percent from February of 2016 to February of 2017, which was matched by only one other metro area in the nation in Texas. If I told you seven years ago that Camden, New Jersey would experience the largest growth in the country of employment in a particular year you would have told me that was absolutely impossible. But we've invested like we invested here with Amazon in Carteret, we've invested through our Grow New Jersey program, and our other economic development programs in the city of Camden and the surroundings and the results are now being seen. As most already know the Economic Development Authority, our Business Action Center, our Department of Labor and Workforce Development have all been working with local officials and county officials in Camden to try to create a better private sector workforce environment in that city and the surrounding areas and we've actually been able to do it. And to have Camden, New Jersey have the highest increase in private sector employment of any metropolitan area in the country is something that we're enormously proud of and something that should be trumpeted throughout the state.
