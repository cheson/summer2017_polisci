Ensuring Economic Security For Future Generations of Seniors

Social Security exists so America's seniors, after a lifetime of hard work, don't fall into poverty. Governor Christie is proposing that Americans pay into this system throughout the course of their life knowing it will be there if they need it to support them, but if they are fortunate enough not to need it, they will have paid into a system that will continue to help Americans who need it most. This proposal will not impact current retirees, and will be phased-in gradually.
