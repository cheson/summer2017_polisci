Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement in commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day:
"Today as we honor the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I am proud New Jersey has long been at the forefront of efforts to honor and continue his work. I encourage New Jerseyans to pause and reflect on his contributions to our society and to do their part to make his dream a reality for all Americans. Dr. King's message is one that is deeply rooted in the same ideals that have made our state and our nation great -- equality, freedom, faith, and opportunity for all."
New Jersey, under Governor Tom Kean, was the first state to establish a Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative Commission in 1983 to ensure Dr. King's life and work were continually recognized across New Jersey.
