Governor Christie Advances New, Broad-Based Middle- and Working-Class Tax Relief Plan

Adhering to his principled stand to deliver wide-ranging tax relief to middle- and working-class families in New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie today recommended a fair, responsible tax reduction plan, building off his bipartisan compromise plan delivered last year by incorporating a revenue circuit-breaker to end any basis for obstructing the opportunity to provide broad relief from the State's onerous property and income tax burdens.
To address the legislative majority's excuse for rejecting last year's bipartisan tax reduction plan, the Governor proposes an answer that should end any pretext for withholding tax relief: His proposal, contained in a conditional veto of Senate Bill 2535, would authorize the legislature each year to activate a "revenue circuit-breaker" and prevent implementation of the tax cuts if State revenues are insufficient.
"This is the right plan at the right time directed to those who need property tax relief the most -- our middle- and working-class families. By setting an income eligibility ceiling of $400,000 and restoring the full Earned Income Tax Credit, we are spreading relief across a wide and deserving swath of New Jerseyans. This improves upon the bipartisan agreement we reached last year but was ultimately rejected by some legislators, who now have no reason to stand in the way of a responsible tax relief plan," said Governor Christie.
In his conditional veto message, the Governor added: "With the final barrier to enactment addressed, the legislature must now choose between two paths: swift and decisive action on tax relief, based on principled compromise and sound public policy that will set the State on the course for economic prosperity; or new excuses conclusively proving that, under no circumstances will the Senate and General Assembly ever agree to return to the people even a single dollar of their income."
Governor Christie's plan vastly expands tax relief to a significantly larger segment of New Jerseyans beyond the narrow scope of relief proposed in S-2535, which would have only increased the state's Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) by an additional 5 percent of the federal EITC. The Governor's plan would indeed extend that relief to about 528,000 EITC-eligible taxpayers, but would also provide broad-based relief to millions more of New Jersey's middle- and working-class taxpayers and their families.
