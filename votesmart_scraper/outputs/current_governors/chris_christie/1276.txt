Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement today regarding the U.S. Department of Education's approval of $268 million in federal education funds:

"I am pleased that Secretary Duncan has approved New Jersey's application for funding under the Education Jobs Fund Program. As I have said before, difficult economic times necessitated difficult choices in our budget. The additional resources will be helpful, but this funding must be viewed for what it is -- a one-time infusion of cash that will not be available to us the following year. This funding, while welcome, must not change our commitment to careful, prudent budgeting that properly aligns state spending with revenues."
