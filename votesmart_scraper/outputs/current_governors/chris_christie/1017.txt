Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statement concerning the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority's approval of its Tourism District Master Plan, a blueprint to guide Atlantic City's revitalization:
"A successful, vibrant Atlantic City is vital to the economic growth of both the regional and state economies. Exactly one year to the day of signing landmark legislation that established the Atlantic City Tourism District, we now have an ambitious, visionary road map that will transform Atlantic City and lead its comeback.
"The steep challenges faced by the tourism and gaming industries in Atlantic City have been a long time in the making and will not be fixed overnight. But with this plan and the reforms already enacted, we are finally making meaningful progress to turn around the city, grow the economy and create sustainable jobs. I thank the CRDA Board Chairman James Kehoe, Executive Director John Palmieri, Deputy Executive Director Susan Ney Thompson, and the CRDA Board for their hard work in crafting this plan to revitalize Atlantic City."
