Governor Christie: I am not under the illusion that anybody voted for me in 2009 or voted for me again in 2013 because of my charm and good looks. You knew we had big problems here and you said we want somebody who's going to be willing to tell us the truth and to try to fix them. It doesn't mean we're perfect. It doesn't mean we always get every answer right to every question. But, we're going to ask the questions and we're going to have our ideas on how to fix them. And we can no longer stand around and say: it's not a problem, don't worry about it. That's what led New Jersey to have some of the highest taxes in the country, already. And we can't any longer do that because in the end what I want is for you to have more of your own money so you can spend it as you see fit. You earn it, you spend it on your children the way you see fit, not my idea. You spend it to buy the home you want, not the home that only you can afford because I've taken most of your money. I want you to make those decisions. I trust you to make them.
