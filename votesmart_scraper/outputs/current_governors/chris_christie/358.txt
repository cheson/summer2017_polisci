Furthering his administration's commitment to New Jersey's veterans and military personnel, Governor Chris Christie took action today on legislation from the 216th Legislative Session, including 11 legislative measures designed to assist both active military members and veterans, along with their families.
"From the very start of this administration, we have focused on serving the needs of our veterans and the men and women still in active duty, assisting them with everything from securing jobs to finding the proper health care and social services," said Governor Christie. "The bills I signed today continue to make good on our promise to help those who have given so much of themselves to defend and serve this nation find a seamless transition back to civilian life and receive a helping-hand, when needed, no matter how long after their discharge from the military."
