Chris Christie Backs Webber as Choice for State GOP Chair
Today, Chris Christie announced his support for Assemblyman Jay Webber as the next Chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee. Christie and Webber were joined at today's press conference by Senator Tom Kean and Assemblyman Alex DeCroce.

Assemblyman Webber said, "I am honored to help lead Chris Christie and the rest of the ticket to victory this November. I am confident we'll have success up and down the ticket this November by focusing on common-sense solutions to lower taxes, cut spending and bring jobs back to New Jersey. I am excited to stand with Chris and join him in the fight to bring our state back from the fiscal mess created by Governors McGreevey and Corzine."

"With unemployment rising, taxes increasing and spending through the roof, taxpayers know Jon Corzine's abysmal record and failed policies. With Jay's help, I will continue to be straight with New Jerseyans about the tough decisions it's going to take to fix our broken economy and provide real relief to hard-working families," said Chris Christie.
