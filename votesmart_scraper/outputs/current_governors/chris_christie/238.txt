Our students need you, they need your knowledge, they need your inspiration, they need your support, they need your friendship. It's a challenging and difficult world as all of you know. And your work will help to make that a world that is much more manageable for them. Where I hope that they'll be able to find what you believe you found, which is a calling in life, a calling to do something that, whether it's for your whole life or just a part of it, that's special and that helps to contribute to the betterment of other human beings, not just to the enrichment of yourself. That's why I think any type of public service for part of every person's life is something that they should consider doing because it helps to reemphasize to us that there are things greater than our own self-interest. And you are going to be living, breathing examples of that for every young man and women who are in your classrooms. And that's a really, really special thing. And I will tell you, they will remember you. The most special teachers I've had, I remember. I remember them. And everything you do in your life and you decide as an adult; comes from your family, from your friends, and from those people who educated you. So you join a special class of people. And I suspect you're here because you're already pretty special in your own right. That's a good combination. So on behalf of the students you have yet to meet and their families who I represent, I thank you for what you're doing. It's an extraordinary service, to those families, to those young men and women; but also to our state and to our country. I hope you're proud of what you're doing because I am certainly proud of you for doing what you're doing.
