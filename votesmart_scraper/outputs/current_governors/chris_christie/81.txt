Most importantly, we're proud of all of you. Government can do certain things to be helpful and we try to do that and keeping taxes under control, keeping our spending under control, allowing you to keep more of your money so you can spend it on your families as you see fit and creating an environment where businesses like Amazon want to come in and grow and expand as they are doing to 10 fulfillment centers her in the state. Those are the things government can do, but once we do that, the rest of it is up to you. If Amazon doesn't have great citizens, a great workforce working in here every day, if you're not doing your job the way the company needs it to be done, if we can't meet the goals and the aspirations of the leadership of this company as a community here in New Jersey, then no matter what the government does, they'll leave. In the end the power of this state is the people who live here. And that's why I'm so happy that we have more people working today than any time in our state's history because that translates into happier families. Families that don't have to worry every minute about how they are going to pay the bills are happier families. Families that are in a positive work environment everyday go home in a bit of a better mood. And that helps to make their home life better. Better for their spouse, better for their children, better for the other loved ones in their life, who count on them to be part of not only a great economy in our state, but part of a great family inside of their own home.
