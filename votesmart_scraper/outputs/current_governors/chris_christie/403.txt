Executive Order No. 187 - Ordering all State buildings to fly flags at half-staff on Tuesday, October 6, 2015, in recognition of the lives and in mourning of the passing of the victims of the shootings at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. This act tragically took the lives of nine innocent people: Lucero Alcaraz, Treven Taylor Anspach, Rebecka Ann Carnes, Quinn Glen Cooper, Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, Lucas Eibel, Jason Dale Johnson, Lawrence Levine, and Sarena Dawn Moore, and caused several others to suffer serious injuries.
"Senseless and devastating acts of violence were committed at Umpqua Community College, these horrific and deliberate acts victimized numerous persons, their families, friends, and loved ones," said Governor Christie. "It is appropriate to recognize the victims, to honor their memories, and to mark their passing. It is with profound sadness that we mourn the devastating loss of the victims of this needless violence, and pause to offer our deepest sympathies to all those touched by this tragedy."
