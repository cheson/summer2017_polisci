Governor Christie Urges New Jerseyans to Bring Unused Prescriptions to Collection Locations
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: April 28, 2017
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today issued a proclamation declaring Saturday, April 29, 2017 as Take Back Day in New Jersey, citing Take Back programs as the best and safest way to dispose of old prescription medication.
Governor Christie this week announced the launching of a new interactive component to ReachNJ, the state's drug addiction one-stop website, that easily locates the nearest collection sites for Project Medicine Drop, the Department of Law and Public Safety, Division of Consumer Affairs' 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week prescription drug collection program. Residents can drop off unwanted prescriptions for free and anonymously at more than 212 stationary drop boxes and 148 mobile drop boxes around the state in police stations, sheriff's offices, and military installations.
"Unused or expired prescription medications are a public safety issue, leading to accidental poisoning, overdose or abuse. The majority of teenagers who abuse prescription drugs get them from family and friends -- and the home medicine cabinet," according to the Proclamation signed by Governor Christie.
New Jersey's Take Back Day and Project Medicine Drop support National Prescription Take Back Day, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration initiative.
