I love this place. And I said in my budget speech yesterday, in trying to implore the legislature to do what we talked about earlier, I said we can't leave it to someone else. There is no one else. There's only us. We're the only people who are going to fix these problems, together. And I feel so fortunate to have the opportunity to lead the state where I was born and raised and I'm now raising my children. You have given me an enormous honor. Every day when I want into that State House, I walk in the front door and I walk through that rotunda and I go to the door of my office with my name on it, and it says "Chris Christie, Governor' and I will tell you, every time I walk through it, it touches me, it makes me shake my head. Like, how the hell did this happen? And if you listen really closely and carefully when the legislature is in session, you hear them saying the same thing. How the hell did this happen? You hear them saying the same thing. So I want to thank you not only for being here today, but for the job you've given me. And just because I'm going to need a job after this cause I can't do this anymore, I'm constitutionally prohibited, 8 years and I'm done. So I'm going to need a job after this. Just because I may have to consider what that next job is going to be doesn't mean I'm not on the job, doing the job I need to do every day here. I can walk and chew gum at the same time, so can you. So thank you all for having me today, I appreciate it very much.
