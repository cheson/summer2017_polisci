Christie Administration Announces Tax Relief for Businesses Impacted by Seaside Boardwalk Fire
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: Sept. 17, 2013
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Christie today announced the approval of tax relief for businesses impacted by the fire that struck Seaside Heights and Seaside Park last week. As a result, businesses that suffered damage from the fire will be able to postpone filing sales and use tax returns, making regularly scheduled payments that would have been due in September on the quarterly return date of October 21 without any penalty.
"We are providing immediate help to businesses in the fire-damaged area by giving them extra time before they have to make scheduled tax payments or file returns," said Governor Christie. "This will help them get back on their feet and back in operation as quickly as possible."
Representatives from the Treasury Department yesterday participated in a Mobile Cabinet meeting in the Seaside area to help affected residents and businesses with questions on tax, business registration and New Jersey Lottery issues. They will continue to offer assistance to affected residents and businesses as needed.
"We provided similar relief to taxpayers on filing deadlines immediately after Superstorm Sandy and it helped free them up to deal with the pressing issues of recovery they were facing at that time. Businesses in Seaside are confronting the same challenges today and we are pleased to be able to help them in this way," said State Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff.
