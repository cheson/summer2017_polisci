In anticipation of the severe winter weather expected to arrive in New Jersey tonight, Governor Chris Christie declared a State of Emergency, authorizing the State Director of Emergency Management to continue coordinating the preparation, response and recovery efforts for the storm with all county and municipal emergency operations and governmental agencies. Governor Christie also authorized the closing of state offices on Wednesday, February 5th for all non-essential employees.
"Tonight's winter weather is expected to produce snow and ice, creating hazardous travel conditions and affecting areas throughout the state that are already recovering from yesterday's storm," said Governor Christie. "I've authorized state officials to continue all necessary actions to assist, and my Administration will continue monitoring conditions throughout the remainder of the storm. I encourage all New Jerseyans to drive carefully and remain off the roads if possible so that our first responders and public safety officials can safely respond to any emergency situations."
Tonight's storm is expected to continue into tomorrow afternoon, bringing additional snow and ice to areas that experienced significant snowfall during yesterday's storm. A potential mixture of hazardous travel conditions, fallen trees, power outages and flooding are anticipated.
