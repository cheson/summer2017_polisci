Governor Christie: Who knows? I mean I don't know. And I think the only New Jerseyans who are really all that concerned about that are you guys. I walked along the boardwalk in Point Pleasant and Ocean Grove and got a lot of people encouraging me to consider my options for the future but that's easy for everybody else to say. These are going to be my decisions and Mary Pat's decisions ultimately whether we want to run for president or we don't. But believe me Michael, whatever decision I make in that regard, I can tell you this, it won't be a decision based upon viability because anybody who tries to predict where politics is going to be a year or a year and a half from now when a Republican nomination for president will be decided, you know is just looking into a crystal ball, it's not, it doesn't make any sense. So I'll make that decision based upon what I want to do and what Mary Pat wants to do and what I think is best for our family and what I think is best for New Jersey and for our country and that's the way I'll make the decision. I'm not going to make it based upon whether I think I'm going to win or lose because who knows.
