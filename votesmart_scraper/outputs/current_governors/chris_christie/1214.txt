*MARGARET BRENNAN:*Well President Obama will focus on creating jobs and cutting the deficit during his second State of the Union Address tonight. And New Jersey's Governor has been dealing with his own debt issues, closing what is possibly more than a $10 billion budget gap without hiking taxes. Governor Chris Christie joins us now here in studio with more on what he wants to hear from the President Obama tonight. Governor, welcome back to In Business. Good to talk to you again.
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*Glad to be back
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*So, why is Congressman Ryan giving the Republican response to the State of the Union tonight and not you?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*Well I assume that is who the Republican leadership wanted and I'm excited to hear Congressman Ryan speak tonight. It will be good.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*Did you want to do it yourself? Were you asked?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*Listen, what was more important is who is actually doing it and it's Congressman Ryan and I'm really interested to hear. He is a leader in making sure that we get our deficit under control and has been for a while. And I think he will lay out a very, very interesting plan tonight. He is a very articulate spokesman for us and I have great respect for him.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*Let's talk about what your response is right now, sort of a pre-reaction here. The President is expected to be giving the argument forward -- that we need to invest in education and we need to invest in infrastructure. Why is that not the right course?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*Well, I don't know that it isn't the right course but I think everything has to be dealt with in context of the deficit that we've run up. We have $14 trillion in federal debt. And if you look at New Jersey, what we are deciding to do is first get fiscal house in order. And I think that is what's going to help economic growth and create private-sector jobs is to have a stable government working not by increasing debt and increasing taxes but by making sure that we create the necessary business climate that will allow the private sector to take some of that money they have on the sidelines right now and put it into employing Americans and New Jerseyans.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*One things that you have done in your state is to attack some of the entitlements, right, not necessarily the investments? So the President is making the argument to invest more in education, to invest more in infrastructure. Are you supportive of that kind of short-term financing?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*Listen, I think we have to continue to work on our infrastructure. In New Jersey, we just laid out our Transportation Capital Plan. But the way that we did it was a little bit different. Governor Corzine when he did it -- 90 percent of the payment for that was debt. In our plan we do 37 percent pay as you go. It is just a more responsible way of doing it. To make sure we don't run up tremendous amounts of debt. Yeah, we have to invest in infrastructure, but there should be a good portion of that that's pay as you go and then a portion of it that is debt because it is a long term investment.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*Bloomberg is reporting this morning that the President, in his budget in February, is going to be looking at opening up to private financing for roads, for bridges, for that kind of infrastructure. You have a lot of attention for one specific infrastructure program here between New York and New Jersey, that nearly $9 billion tunnel that you killed. If private financing was in place, like the President is trying to encourage now, would you reconsider that?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*The problem with it is that private financing is not some panacea where you don't have to pay those people back. They are expecting a return on their investment as well in the private sector. It's all about what's the project going to cost ultimately. The problem with the Arc Tunnel was that it was running 2-5 billion dollars over budget today that New Jersey was going to have to absorb every penny of those cost overruns and the State of New York was paying nothing, zero towards the Arc Tunnel. So, it was an equity issue and it was also a sense that we could not get control over what this thing was going to cost. And the federal government was telling us that we had to pick up every nickel of that cost overrun. We could not afford it.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*So if there were more tax incentives, if there was more of a federal subsidy in some form, would you reconsider it?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*Well listen, it would have to be a significant difference. I don't see us revisiting it. The Arc Tunnel has moved on. We are having conversationsÂ…
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*Do you have a number in mind for significant?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*No, but here's what we are doing now. We are having conversations with Mayor Bloomberg and others regarding the potential extension of the No. 7 Train to Secaucus, New Jersey which would do what we really wanted the Arc Tunnel to do originally . Remember, the Arc Tunnel was really only going to the basement of Macy's. That's all it was doing. The No. 7 Train would connect us finally with the east side of New York which is what ultimately we wanted from the Arc project.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*The hope though would be putting people to work. So how many jobs do you think you will create with this other project?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*Well we don't know. It is still in the preliminary stages. But it's not just about putting people to work. While that is important, it's also about setting up a project that will address the long-term infrastructure and commuting needs of the people in New Jersey. We have lots of people from New Jersey who commute everyday here into New York to go to work. We would like to get them in a more efficient way over to the east side of Manhattan. That was the original Arc plan. It got morphed into this plan that had some multibillion dollar terminal in the basement of Macy's, blocks away from any other connecting trains.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*So it was the specifics of the design that you had a problem with. But if financing were in place, you would be interested in other infrastructure programs?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*We are looking at the No. 7 train as one of those things and then there we'd would be sharing also the costs with the city and the State of New York which was not the case with the Arc Tunnel.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*Okay, let's talk about education because in New Jersey you did reduce state subsidies to local school districts about 5 percent or so. Talk to me about how you can justify that in an environment where investing last in education is hoping to get you more. There's a lot of concern that the U.S. is getting less competitive in a global economy.
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*We are getting less competitive because our education system is not working, not because we don't spend enough. In New Jersey we spend an average of $17, 600 per pupil per year. That's the highest of any state in America. It's not that we're not investing enough. We have to have more choice. We have to reform the teacher tenure system to get rid of bad performing teachers. And we need merit pay to reward excellent teachers and keep them there. So those are some things we need to do improve the education system and become more competitive. I urge every one of your views to go out and watch Waiting for Superman. When you see what can happen and what isn't happening in our educational system, you realize it is less about money than it is about changing a system that caters to the feelings of adults rather than the needs students.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*You have been very vocal about the unions. Putting that aside and that battle you're having over tenure, talk about what you need from the federal government. If this is not about money, what kind of incentives would you ask of President Obama if he's talking about investing in education?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*Loosen the mandates, loosen the strings, let governors manage. And lead by example on reform. And I think the President has done a good job on this, in terms of talking about things like tenure reform, things like school choice. Those are things the President -- charter schools - has spoken vocally about. Race to the Top was a big part of that as well in terms of driving reforms that are necessary to make the educational system better . So the President of the United States and I agree a great deal on the education issue. And I think he will say, too, it is not only about money. And in New Jersey we are spending more than any other State, so it's not money.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*But you want control over where that financing gets directed.
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*Exactly right.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*So talk to me though about the budget issues that we talk about. State by state, we have been tracking this very carefully at Bloomberg and the deficits that so many states face. In New Jersey, it is $10 billion budget shortfall?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*We have an $11 billion shortfall for fiscal "11.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*So do you think that states should be allowed to declare bankruptcy in order to renegotiate some of those debts?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*I don't think we are at that stage yet, Margaret. I really don't.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*Newt Gingrich is purposing this. That is why I'm asking.
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:* I think it's an idea that is out on the table, but I think we need as an elected governors, to take responsibility for what is going on in our states and try to manage our way out of this before we turn to a potential bankruptcy option. First, we have the tools to be able to change this if we have the political will to make it happen. And we have to take on those cost drivers in state government, and that means in large measure, taking on public- sector unions.
*MARGARET BRENNAN:*That's a big fight. And I know you've been having one. But talk to me about those debt levels, more broadly. Treasury Secretary Geithner is talking about us running up the clock, in March if we don't raise this debt ceiling - the credit markets are going to be frozen. Is it worth shutting down the Government for the principle of not raising the debt ceiling?
*GOVERNOR CHRISTIE:*Well listen. I don't know. I'm not in Congress and I don't make those calls. But what I will tell you is, what we did in New Jersey. What we did in New Jersey is we sat down and had reasonable conversations with Democrats and we reduced spending last year, in last year's budget, 9 percent year over year and didn't close down the government. I don't think this is a partisan issue nor should it be. We need to balance our budgets at every level of Government. We need to move toward that at the federal level, and we need to sit down and talk with each other and make the kind of reasonable, principled decisions that can make that happen. We did it in New Jersey and I hope we can do that in the federal government without having to resort to those type of maneuvers.

*MARGARET BRENNAN:*Alright so thank you very much, Governor, for giving us your sense on the state of your state and of the country right now. Always good to talk to you.
