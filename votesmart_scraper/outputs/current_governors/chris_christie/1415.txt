Kim and I are very excited as we take the oath of office today and officially assume our new roles. We know there is a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we have already started putting together a team that will take the necessary first steps to shrink our growing budget deficit and help put our economy back on track. Join us as we get down to the serious work of changing New Jersey's course. As always, I am eager to hear from you, so please feel free to reach out and let me know how we can change New Jersey by emailing me.
It is a privilege to work with you!
