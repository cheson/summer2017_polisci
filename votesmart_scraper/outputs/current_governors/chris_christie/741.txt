Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statement in commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day:
"Today, we honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. for dedicating his life to justice, freedom and equality for all. His leadership through peace and his use of education continue to inspire the world, and serve as the foundation in the ongoing fight against prejudice and discrimination. Even though it's been half a century since his "I Have A Dream" speech, Dr. King's belief in equality, freedom and faith still rings true today. I encourage New Jerseyans to observe this day through acts and deeds of service in their communities and to continue to help make Dr. King's dream a reality for all Americans."
New Jersey, under Governor Tom Kean, was the first state to establish a Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative Commission in 1983 to ensure Dr. King's life and work were continually recognized across New Jersey.
Governor Christie also issued a proclamation marking Monday, January 20, 2014 "Martin Luther King, Jr. Day" throughout New Jersey.
