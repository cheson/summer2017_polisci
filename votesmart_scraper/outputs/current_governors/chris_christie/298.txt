As we get to the end of national re-entry week, which is tomorrow, it is important for us to take some time to focus on how important these programs are in changing lives and to reinforce the fact that even the most troubled among us can be redeemed. I met with the folks standing behind me, it was really a wonderful opportunity to sit and listen, listen to the different experiences each one of these gentlemen have had in their lives. Some of whom have been incarcerated nearly thirty years and talk to me about the challenges that come with just getting back to understanding what everyday life is on the outside. I heard a great story inside about figuring out how to operate a New Jersey Transit bus as a passenger and how different it is now than when the person was first incarcerated and how it cost him a two mile walk backwards after he missed his stop and had to walk back to go two miles to find out where he was but now he knows how to work it. How the technology that is so a part of our lives now, was not a part at all. How the technology that is so part of our lives now was not a part at all for these gentlemen and how they need to learn all these things before they can become productive, active, valuable members of our day to day society again. Where are they supposed to learn these skills? Where are they supposed to learn these lessons, if not for programs like this and not just those skills but many others we would not have an opportunity to reintegrate into life in a way that's seamless.
