Today, Governor Chris Christie signed the following Executive Order:
Executive Order No. 208 - Ordering all State buildings to fly flags at half-staff on Friday, June 17, 2016, in recognition of the life and in mourning of the 49 innocent lives taken during the June 12th terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida.
"On June 12, 2016, barbaric acts of terrorism were committed at a nightclub in Orlando, FL and the atrocities carried out took the lives of 49 innocent people and seriously injured dozens of others," said Governor Chris Christie. "This shocking and horrific attack constitutes the deadliest act of terrorism carried out in the United States since September 11, 2001. It was purposely directed against members of the LGBT community, and represents a deliberate and callous assault on the freedoms we cherish as Americans. It is with profound sadness that we mourn the loss of the victims of this terrorist attack and pause to offer our deepest sympathies to their families, friends, and loved ones. It is appropriate to recognize the victims, to honor their memories, and to mark their passing."
