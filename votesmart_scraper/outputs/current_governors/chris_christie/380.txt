"We know, and we talk about this all the time, that addiction is a disease. It is not a moral failing; it is a disease, and those affected need to know that it's not only OK to ask for help, but you need to ask for help and then to go and get it. The men that we talked to in the Life Change program are a prime example that no life is disposable. Every life is a precious gift from God and everyone deserves a second chance or more to make things right in their life."
