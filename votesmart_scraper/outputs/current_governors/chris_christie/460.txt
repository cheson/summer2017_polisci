Governor Christie: Today we remember five in particular: Detective Santiago, Officer Goodell, Officer Arocha, Special Officer Petruzzello, and Detective Stevens, and to their families, on behalf of a grateful state of New Jersey, we offer not only our prayers and our condolences but our thanks, our thanks for the continuing sacrifice that you make. That is what I think this service is about more than anything else as I reflect on the last 13 years. Yes, we are here to honor the memories of those who have served and given their lives, but we are here just as much to honor their families for the continuing sacrifice that they make each and every day from the end of their loved one's life. Whether you're a prosecutor or whether you're the governor, as John put it there are simply not words that are sufficient to express the gratitude of the people of this state to all of you, but we keep coming back to try and to make you all understand that we do care about you, care about your families, and care that each and every year this service continues in order to reinforce that point, and so thank you very much for those of you who come here each and every year. Thank you for participating in something that is extraordinarily important in the fabric of our state, not only our desire but our responsibility, our responsibility to remember and to support those whose sacrifice never truly ends. Thank you for being here this morning and on behalf of the people of the state of New Jersey thank you for your sacrifice.
