Christopher J. Christie took off his suit jacket, crossed a highway exit ramp, and walked into a stand of trees, the nearby cars and trains putting up a wall of background noise.
After crossing a makeshift boardwalk made of wooden pallets, he was in Camden's hidden homeless encampment, called "Transitional Park" by its 60 or so residents.
He said he didn't know "this city within the state's poorest city" existed, even though he spent a lot of time in Camden when he was U.S. attorney. He said he doubted many others knew of its existence, and he used it as a backdrop last week to say the state must turn its economy around.
"They call it a transitional center. They named it themselves because they believe in their hearts this is a temporary stop for them from despair to hope," he said.
Christie, the Republican candidate for governor, is spending a lot of time talking to people in cities about their fragile economic status. Many are Democrats he will need if he wants to beat incumbent Democratic Gov. Corzine in the Nov. 3 election.
