Governor Chris Christie: Don't believe -- please don't believe -- the fiction that you hear from some corners of the state that will say to you, if we focus on sick leave reform, if we focus on civil service reform, if we focus on shared services reform, then somehow we aren't going to continue to create jobs. In fact, quite to the contrary. As we continue to do those things we drive down the costs of county and local government and state government. As we continue to drive down those costs, we continue to be able to incentivize businesses to come here, that will create more private-sector jobs in New Jersey that will raise revenue for everybody. Business men and women are not stupid. They will not be fooled by one-time, gimmicky, quick-shot proposals. Because they don't come here if they'll get business for one year, or two years, or three years. They come here if they believe over the next 10 years that New Jersey is on track to be able to create a business climate where businesses can grow and thrive and where their employees can prosper. Those are the decisions that have to be made right now. And because of the efforts of the Lt. Governor, you are seeing more and more companies -- Honeywell, Bayer, now Allergan -- and numbers of others establishing and expanding their headquarters here in New Jersey.
