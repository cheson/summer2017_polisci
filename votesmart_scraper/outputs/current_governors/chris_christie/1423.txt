Energizing a town hall chamber filled with supporters, Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Christie launched his final week, 21-county tour this afternoon in the heart of Republican Ocean County.
"I believe hope is real," said Christie. "You have to go out now and convince not just fellow Republicans, but Democrats and independents: in your church parking lots, soccer and football fields, school yards. We can say hope is real with a sense of conviction. We must have the courage to believe New Jersey can be a better place."
This was where Christie began his campaign last February, and with six days remaining in his bid to unseat Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine, he again expressed his desire that "Toms River and Ocean County will provide (running mate) Kim Guadagno and me the margin of victory we need to win this election."
A Quinnipiac University poll released this morning shows the Republican trending in the wrong direction and five points behind Corzine, but two other polls this week, including one released by Rasmussen, showed Christie four points in front of the governor.
Standing at a podium in front of a Christie-Guadagno banner, the Republican candidate projected confidence to a crowd excited by the prospect that the Rasmussen poll more clearly reflects the will of a majority of voters who want to dump Corzine.
"We're calling this the 'Countdown to Change' tour," said Christie, in contrast to what he described as Corzine's "Save me from Myself" tour, featuring the presence, by turns, of President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, and Vice President Joe Biden, among other Democratic Party luminaries.
