Governor Christie Reaffirms Bi-State Law Enforcement and Homeland Security Cooperation With New York
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: Dec. 8, 2015
Location: Trenton, NJ

In light of recent terrorist attacks, both overseas and that which took the lives of fourteen people in San Bernardino last week, and heightened states of alert around the globe, Governor Christie is taking steps to reaffirm and renew critical joint law enforcement efforts to increase security for the New York and New Jersey region. Today, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an Executive Order renewing reciprocity for New Jersey law enforcement to operate in New York in bi-state transportation contexts under limited circumstances. Existing Executive Order authority in New Jersey currently provides New York law enforcement the authority to operate in those limited circumstances.
Governor Christie noted that in addition to this specific renewal and reaffirmation of security cooperation, the New Jersey State Police and their law enforcement partners have stepped up the presence of law enforcement officers to maximize public safety and provide a visible deterrent to criminal activity. While currently there is no immediate or credible threat to the region, today's action is an important precautionary measure in the continued effort to ensure the safety of the people of the region.
"The terror attacks and threats of the past weeks are jarring and bring a sharp focus to every American of the threat the West faces from radical Islam," said Governor Christie. "As Governor, my first and most solemn responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people in our state, and we are taking every step to ensure that the people and critical infrastructure of New Jersey and the region are protected against the threat of terrorism."
