Governor Christie: I would often argue to people that I want us to get to a point in our society where we so have recognized and embedded in our culture that folks of Hispanic descent are extraordinary not only contributors to our culture but are our culture.
That we don't have to recognize them any differently than we recognize anyone else who achieves things of extraordinary merit in our society, and so I've always hesitated about it but I realize I continue to do it because I realize we're not there yet. Until we are, that's just an aspiration, but I want you to know that my aspiration as Governor has always been to make those New Jersey citizens of Hispanic heritage understand that you are every bit a part of what makes New Jersey great as any other citizen in our state and that we'll continue to work together to get to the aspirational goal, but I never want to be at one of these events without saying that's where I want to be.
I want to be at a point where all of you feel as if there is no need any longer for special acknowledgement, that inherent in that special acknowledgement is also a recognition that we haven't done well enough in terms of integrating our society in a way that everyone feels as if they are a special part through their efforts and their accomplishments, and their children's accomplishments of what makes New Jersey great.
I can tell you that's the way I feel and I'll talk to you a little bit about how we've tried to display that as well, but I wanted to say that to all of you, in the beginning, that I'm happy to be here, but I hope and believe there will come a day in our state when our Hispanic brothers and sisters are so immersed, and acknowledged as such in our society that this will not be something that we need to do and still want to do it, but right now we not only want to do it, we need to do it to make sure that we acknowledge these accomplishments and these goals in the way that we need to.
