Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: Sept. 1, 2010
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statement concerning the decision not to renew Superintendent Clifford Janey's contract and to find new leadership for Newark's public school system:

"As governor, it is my responsibility to set a high standard for student achievement and it is my belief that Newark can and will be a national model for education reform and excellence. Newark's children, and those around the state, simply cannot wait any longer. It is my expectation that new leadership will move quickly, aggressively and with accountability to implement the kind of fundamental reform that is urgently needed to improve Newark's school system. We will continue to work with Mayor Booker, the Newark Public Schools Advisory Board and community leaders to make these reforms a reality.

"I thank Dr. Janey for his years of effort and service to Newark's children and families."

Clifford Janey was confirmed as Newark State District Superintendent in June 2008.
