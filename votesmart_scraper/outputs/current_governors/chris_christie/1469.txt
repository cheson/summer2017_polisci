Statement by Chris Christie on Reinstating the Property Tax Reduction
Chris Christie delivered the following statement at the opening of his press conference call today:
"It is time to stop the pain Governor Corzine is inflicting on New Jersey's middle class.
Governor Corzine's budget proposals will cost the average New Jersey family making $75,000 per year an additional $1,700 to $2,000. It is unacceptable to punish honest, hardworking taxpayers and loyal businesses with higher income taxes, higher business taxes, and even higher property taxes. In this economic environment, income taxes should not be raised. Business taxes should not be increased. And property tax rebates cannot be slashed.
I am calling today for the State Legislature to promise the people of New Jersey that they will reinstate the property tax deduction that Governor Corzine proposed eliminating last week. If they do not, I will immediately reverse it when elected.
Governor Corzine cannot lead us out of tough economic times by raising taxes on New Jersey's middle-class families. The way to fix the budget is by bringing jobs to New Jersey, lowering taxes and broadening our dwindling tax base."
