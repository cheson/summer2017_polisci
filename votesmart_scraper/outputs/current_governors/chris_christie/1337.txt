Yesterday, the New Jersey Department of Education submitted the State's Race to the Top application in an attempt to secure $400 million in federal education funding over the next four years. The application includes several bold initiatives to strengthen teacher quality and ultimately improve student performance:
* Incentivizing Quality Instruction with Merit-Pay
* Evaluating Teacher Training Programs
* Putting Educational Effectiveness Over Seniority
* Successful Schools are Led by Successful Principals (financial incentive to effective principals)
All of these reforms are in step with the Obama Administration's education reform efforts and the national education reform movement happening around the country. To give you a few examples, we put together a document outlining similar efforts around the nation that have been called for by the Obama Administration.
Yesterday, during a press conference, Governor Christie discussed the application and noted that both he and the President agree that "merit pay should go to individual teachers; that agree that student achievement has to be a key part, if not the key part of judging teacher effectiveness."
Receiving the Race to the Top funding would mean a huge boost of support for education in the state however, funding or no funding -- Governor Christie has affirmed his commitment to work to improve teacher quality and enhance school districts' capabilities to measure student learning in the classroom.
