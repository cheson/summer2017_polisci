With severe winter weather expected to arrive in New Jersey tonight, Governor Chris Christie declared a State of Emergency, authorizing the State Director of Emergency Management to continue coordinating all preparation, response and recovery efforts for the storm with all county and municipal emergency operations and governmental agencies. Governor Christie also announced the closing of state offices on Thursday, February 13th for all non-essential employees.
"This winter storm is expected to arrive tonight and last through early Friday morning, and the heavy snow will create hazardous travel conditions across the state," said Governor Christie. "I've authorized state officials to continue all necessary actions, and my Administration will monitor conditions throughout the remainder of the storm. I encourage all New Jerseyans to drive carefully and remain off the roads if possible so that our first responders and public safety officials can safely respond to any emergency situations."
Tonight's storm is expected to continue into Friday morning, bringing heavy snow, freezing temperatures and mixed precipitation, as well as dangerous and icy conditions that will affect travel throughout the state for several days. A potential mixture of fallen trees, power outages and flooding is anticipated.
