Governor Christie: Now whenever I come to an event like this that's Sandy related we have to recognize that not everyone is yet back at home and not everyone has their lives back to the new normal. We just remain completely committed to getting those people back in their homes where they belong. The process is continuing to move forward. We're working hard with our partners at the local level like the Mayor to make sure that it happens as quickly as possible for folks, whether they're looking to sell their home or rebuild and moving back in. This Blue Acres program has been one of those successful recovery programs, giving homeowners and their families a chance to move away from all the uncertainty and fear and the expense that the Mayor talked about in his remarks, of living in repeatedly flooded areas. More importantly, it's giving residents the opportunity to start their lives over again, and as I toured the state in the immediate aftermath of Sandy, I heard from more people than I can count that they just wanted a chance to start their lives over again, and we're going to continue to make that progress and do the things that we need to do to return our state back to the new post-Sandy normal.
