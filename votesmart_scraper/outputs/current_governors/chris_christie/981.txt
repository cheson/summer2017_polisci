Governor Chris Christie today released the following statement in recognition of the 68th Anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces landed at Normandy during World War II:
"On June 6, 1944, American soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy to defend the principles of freedom and Democracy against tyranny, in a conflict against one of the greatest threats in history to free peoples around the globe. As America commemorates the 68th Anniversary of D-Day, we honor and remember our nation's Greatest Generation for their bravery and sacrifice during this defining moment in American and world history. Our nation will forever be grateful to those who served, and especially to those service men and women and their families who made the ultimate sacrifice while defending those principles that define us a nation.
"In commemorating the anniversary of D-Day, we also thank and honor all of our brave men and women -- past and present -- who have served in defense of our nation in time of war and in peace. It is their service and dedication that allows the United States of America to remain a beacon of freedom and hope throughout the world."
