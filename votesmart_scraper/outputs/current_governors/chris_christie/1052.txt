Governor Christie: Supreme Court a Mystery to Me

Governor Chris Christie: I can't say I'm completely shocked, you know, and I hope they understand the importance of what they're doing. I'm a little concerned about the speed which they want to do this, the fact that we've been denied the opportunity to file a reply brief, under the current briefing schedule which is very unusual. Seems as if they're attempting to shoehorn this in a very truncated time period. And I also have to say I'm mystified by Justice Long being the presiding judge on this and why the Chief Justice is not participating. That's a complete mystery to me. I have no idea why the Chief Justice is not participating, and that's disappointing because he's the leader of the Judiciary, and a Judiciary that is in extraordinary conflict and to be without their leader on such an important decision is mystifying to me. I found out about it this morning. So, you know, I'm going to be interested to see what they do. They're going to make their arguments. I don't think there's any argument to be made here, but I'm a little concerned about the swiftness with which they're trying to get this resolved. I don't know what kind of deadline they're working on.
