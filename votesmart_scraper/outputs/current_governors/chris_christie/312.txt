Governor Christie Announces Bipartisan Legislative Compromise To Ensure Support For People Looking For Work
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: April 18, 2016
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today conditionally vetoed S-993/A-2777 (Vitale, Pou, Gordon, Wimberly, Vainieri Huttle, Sumter), pursuant to a bipartisan agreement that preserves the availability of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for people in struggling communities while upholding the requirement that those participants capable of working be involved in work activities.
"This bill, instead of promoting work participation, which is in the best interests of the recipients and the entire State, would require the Commissioner of the Department of Human Services to apply for a waiver of the work requirement for the State or any area of the State whenever SNAP participants might be eligible under federal law," Governor Christie wrote in his conditional veto. "While I am committed to supporting the SNAP program and ensuring that those individuals in need of benefits receive them, our goal as a State should be to find ways to fulfill the ultimate objective of the work requirement -- to assist individuals in achieving self-sufficiency."
To advance that commitment and the ongoing efforts of his administration to help people achieve self-sufficiency through employment, Governor Christie has worked with Senate Democrat Joseph Vitale, the bill's prime sponsor, to develop an alternative approach that provides the Commissioner of Human Services discretion on SNAP benefit waiver requests for ABAWDs (able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 50 without dependents). Their compromise solution, backed by Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean Jr., also creates more efficient and effective reporting requirements.
"I acknowledge the sponsors' concern that individuals may lose SNAP benefits for failing to fulfill the work requirement if there are insufficient work opportunities for able-bodied SNAP beneficiaries," Governor Christie wrote. "I am recommending that the bill be amended to require the Commissioner of Human Services annually to review data on labor and employment in the State and then make a decision on whether to apply for a waiver of the work requirement. In addition, I am recommending that the Department of Human Services monitor the success of the current work requirement initiatives by reviewing data on ABAWD SNAP recipients."
