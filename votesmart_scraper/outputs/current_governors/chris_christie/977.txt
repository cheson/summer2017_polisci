Statement from Governor Chris Christie on Halfway House Oversight and Accountability
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: June 18, 2012
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statement concerning oversight and accountability in New Jersey's halfway houses:
"While many of the disturbing accounts reported in today's New York Times documenting lax oversight and accountability in some of New Jersey's halfway houses took place prior to this administration, we have an obligation to ensure the community placements program is effectively and safely operating today. This administration takes its responsibility to properly administer this program very seriously which is why we have increased monitoring of halfway houses with enhanced site visits, fines for noncompliance and a new inspection monitoring system that has led to a dramatic decrease in the number of walkaways under this administration.
"New Jersey has been on the cutting edge of pursuing policies that both ensure our most violent offenders stay off the streets, such as closing the early release loophole, and support a more rehabilitative approach focused on nonviolent offenders. We need to constantly ensure these policies are being responsibly and safely implemented which is why I am calling on the Department of Corrections Commissioner Gary Lanigan to immediately step up inspections of all halfway houses and report any violations and recommendations for changes to the deputy chief of staff for policy."
