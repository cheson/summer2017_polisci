Governor Chris Christie: New Jersey is the most diverse state in America. We have more different ethnicities and races and religions in this state than any other state in the country, and if we're not welcoming here, then how can we propose to set an example for the rest of the country to become more welcoming to those who want to raise their families here, work hard to earn a living, pay taxes, and be solid citizens? We have to be able to do that better and this is just one way, and some people will say: well, is this that big a deal? Well, let them try to do it. I mean, I don't want to take the written driver's test right now, I can guarantee you that. I don't know how I'd do if I took the written driver's test right now, and nobody who's already proven themselves to be a licensed driver anyplace in the United States should have to come to New Jersey and retake that written test.
