Governor Christie: Thank you, Johnny. Thank you. I love the Eagles fans are here, baby. I'm thrilled -- Brian, where's Brian? Get up here, Brian. I love Brian Westbrook. What are you talking about?
Brian Westbrook: Hey, the Eagles fans are here. Let's give the Governor a chant. Say it with me: E-A-G-L-E-S.
Governor Christie:: Thank you everybody. Thank you New Jersey. Thank you Eagles fans. And I want to thank Johnny Morris so much for what he's done for this country, but also the faith and confidence that he's shown in New Jersey and in Atlantic City by building and opening this extraordinary place behind me. I've been in there already, I know you can't wait to get in there and I'm one of the only things standing between you and this store. So I'm going to be really brief. I want to thank the mayor for his hard work. I want to thank all the folks here in Atlantic City for their faith and confidence in this place. I'm going to tell Johnny right now: this is going to be one of the greatest investments that Bass Pro Shops has ever made and we are looking forward to working with them and all of you to keep Atlantic City the great place it has always been. Thank you for being here, enjoy the place and thanks for the shoes, I appreciate it.
