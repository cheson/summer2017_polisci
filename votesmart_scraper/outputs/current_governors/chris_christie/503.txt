I will never stop working to fix the problems we have previously ignored. I will never stop coming into this chamber and telling the hard truths. I will never ever give up on New Jersey. That is why the people have sent me to this chair twice and I will not stop fighting for them until my very last day as Governor. Through our ability to bring people together we know, even though we have not always agreed in the past, we can bring people together and set a national trend. By putting forward new solutions to age old problems like this, we are creating a national model. By signing this Roadmap with the teachers union, we are showing government can work for all our hardworking taxpayers. That is my pledge to you today and if you are willing to stand up and work with me toward a better tomorrow, I will work with you. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the great State of New Jersey.
