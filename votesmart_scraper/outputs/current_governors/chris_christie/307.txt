Statement from Governor Christie on Newark Public Schools
Statement
By: Chris Christie

Location: Trenton, NJ

Today, Governor Christie released the following statement in response to Mayor Ras Baraka's comments on Newark public schools.
"The failings of the Newark Public Schools system are clearly the result of an antiquated system which protects poorly performing teachers and hurts students. This administration has begged the legislature and the teachers union to fully reform state laws and put students first, as public charter schools are doing right now for Newark families. Charter schools are public schools, Mayor Baraka, and thousands of your constituents are choosing them every year over traditional public schools in Newark because they give their children a better chance at a brighter future. As the Mayor knows, the demand for public charter schools grows every year in his city. Unfortunately, the Mayor pursues policies which look to close the doors of new or expanded public charter schools to Newark families in order to pursue his pro-union political agenda. The state will stop him from doing so.
"As for aid to the Newark Public Schools, the taxpayers of New Jersey will send $829 million in the upcoming fiscal year on top of the $803 million provided this year. Still, Mayor Baraka somehow complains about this extraordinary level of aid. He should consult his fellow Mayors in the suburbs and rural areas whose property taxes are artificially high due to this court-ordered disproportionate aid to the Newark school district. Maybe the Mayor would then have a greater perspective on the challenges that Mayors and school boards all over New Jersey are facing rather than complaining about the hundreds of millions of dollars New Jerseyans already send to the Newark School District."
