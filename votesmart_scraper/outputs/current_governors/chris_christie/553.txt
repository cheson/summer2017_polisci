Governor Christie: For the people in that room, which--who represented the majority of the stakeholders in this city and the region there is a sense of urgency among the people around that table. There is no one--I shouldn't say no one, but there's very few that want to look at playing the blame game and rationalize what's happened here. Everybody understands that the situation is grave and with rare exception everybody is committed to not looking backwards but looking forwards and what we need to do.
