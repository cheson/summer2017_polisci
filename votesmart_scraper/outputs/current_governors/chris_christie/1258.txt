JAMIE GANGEL: You're very outspoken at home?

GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: There's not a lot of difference between the way I am outside and the way I am here. Although, my kids will remind will remind me, my ten year old in particular reminds me all the time, you are not the governor of the house.

JAMIE GANGEL: You're not surprised?

GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: No.

JAMIE GANGEL: Because?

GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: Because I think people want to be treated like adults. I think they're tired of being pandered to. I think they're tired of being told, hey listen, vote for me and I can make it all better and it won't cost you anything and it won't hurt you at all. They know that's baloney. They know it.

JAMIE GANGEL: That no-nonsense approach and YouTube moments like this one --

GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: Yes.

JAMIE GANGEL: How would you describe your politics?

GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: Well honestly I'm a republican for sure and I say, you know, I'm on the conservative side of things. But I think that I'm also really practical and I want to get things done.

JAMIE GANGEL: And it's not just talk. One of his closest political allies is a democrat, Newark Mayor Cory Booker.

MAYOR BOOKER: Like it or not, I always know where I stand. He doesn't say yes or no, he says hell yes, or hell no. [Laughter] And you really know where you can go. And so I have a partner sitting at the table in a way that I haven't had ever before that is saying we are going to get this done Mayor, whatever it takes.

JAMIE GANGEL: At the same time, Christie has become the hottest ticket for republicans. The new star of a GOP ad campaign.

GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: We can change America overnight.

JAMIE GANGEL: Do you think he'd make a good president.

MARY PAT CHRISTIE: Oh absolutely.

JAMIE GANGEL: But Christie says he's not readyEveryone in the republican party but you is talking about that you should be on the ticket in 2012 to run for the White House. You say?

GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: No way.
JAMIE GANGEL: Would you consider running for Vice President?

GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: Jamie, can you see me as somebody's Vice President. [Laughter] I mean, who would be that poor guy? You know, I just don't think that my personality is necessarily suited to being number two.

[Start of clip]

JAMIE GANGEL: That said, when pressed, the governor admits he's discussed with his family. But try to find out what he really think, even 7-year-old Bridget is a political proCome here I want to ask you a question.

GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: Would you like your daddy to be president of the United States?

BRIDGET CHRISTIE: I don't have an answer for that.

[Laughter]

JAMIE GANGEL: Someone prepared her --

GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: On message!

[End of clip]

JAMIE GANGEL: We may not know what Bridget thinks, Ann, but we do now know what salty language is and I'm here to tell you the speculation about Christie is not going to go away any time soon. Ann.

ANN CURRY: Jamie Gangel, great job as always. Thanks this morning.
