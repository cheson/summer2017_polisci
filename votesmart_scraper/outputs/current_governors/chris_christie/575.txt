Reinforcing his support for legal sports wagering in New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie today signed legislation that reflects recent court rulings and removes prohibitions against sports wagering in New Jersey.
"As I've said all along, I am a strong proponent of legalized sports wagering in New Jersey. But given earlier decisions by federal courts, it was critical that we follow a correct and appropriate path to curtail new court challenges and expensive litigation," Governor Christie said. "I believe we have found that path in this bipartisan legislative effort."
In a signing statement with the bill (S-2460), the Governor explains that this bill corrects the critical flaws in the Legislature's earlier bill on sports wagering that was vetoed. For example, the new bill specifies that certain collegiate sports contests and athletic events shall not be the subject of wagering, as the New Jersey Constitution mandates, and it limits the repeal to wagers placed by persons at least 21 years of age. The bill also repeals the prior Sports Wagering Act in its entirety, thereby providing certainty and clarity to the law.
