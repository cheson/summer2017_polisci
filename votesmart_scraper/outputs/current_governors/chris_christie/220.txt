Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: July 1, 2016
Location: Trenton, NJ

Yesterday, Governor Chris Christie issued Executive Order No. 211, directing Acting Attorney General Christopher S. Porrino to study the costs, savings and administrative challenges associated with pretrial release reforms approved by New Jersey voters in November 2014. The evaluation will assist in the successful implementation of the changes, which take effect on January 1, 2017.
The study will be conducted by the Division of Criminal Justice and the Office of Law Enforcement Professional Standards in the Department of Law and Public Safety, in consultation with the State Police and the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey, and with the input of appropriate stakeholders. In addition, the State's Judiciary is currently revising the Rules of Court to implement these reforms and establish new practices and procedures that will impact the operations and workload of police agencies and prosecutors' offices.
"Upon full implementation of the constitutional amendment and the implementing legislation, fewer defendants will be incarcerated in county jails at taxpayer expense while awaiting trial," said Governor Christie.
