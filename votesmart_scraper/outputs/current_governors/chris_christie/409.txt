Recognizing quality educational programming and high student achievement, Governor Chris Christie today commended the fifteen New Jersey public and private schools that earned the U.S. Department of Education's designation of a 2015 National Blue Ribbon School. Nine New Jersey public schools and six private schools from throughout the Garden State were named Blue Ribbon schools.
"New Jersey is known for having one of the strongest public education systems in the nation as well as some of the finest private schools, and all those recognized today exemplify the high standards we have in the Garden State," said Governor Christie. "The National Blue Ribbon Schools award affirms the kind of success that teachers, administrators and students can achieve when working together with a shared vision of ensuring that each child is on the path to success throughout their education and in the future."
