Each life is an individual gift from God and if that is true, then no life is beyond redemption and no life is a life that deserves to be disposed of. If we believe that, whether you're pro-life or pro-choice on the issue of abortion, or no matter what our other political differences are, if we could all come together and agree that every life is an individual gift from God, that no life is beyond redemption, and that no life is disposable, that was the path that I was put on that inextricably led me to today and to do what we're doing now in the areas of drug treatment, drug and alcohol treatment and rehabilitation, reentry, expungement and all the issues that surround it. Because there is not a person in this room, I am confidant and I will start by admitting that I have made plenty of mistakes in my life. I'm fortunate that none of those mistakes have involved drugs or alcohol but there but for the grace of God go I and it is through that grace that God has given me the opportunity to make a difference in this area. But we're not nearly done. This room has gotten bigger every year that I've come to it. More and more people here every year, that's good. And we're now engaged in a statewide advertising campaign to let people know that there is hope. That you can reach out for help and that help is available to you and now the President has given me the opportunity to bring the cause that we started to talk about here in New Jersey to the entire country and that's a great gift too.
