Piers Morgan: Could the next president of the United States come from New Jersey? Tonight I'll talk to hometown boy made good, governor Chris Christie, and find out.
Governor Christie: I'm making this decision based on whether I believe in my heart that I'm ready to be president of the united states and that I want to be president of the united states right now.
Piers Morgan: Tea Party loves him, and democrats fear him. Sounds like the formula for a perfect Republican Presidential candidate. Chris Christie says he's not running for president. Well, not yet.
Governor Christie: I'm 100% certain I'm not going to run.
Piers Morgan: He's a budget-slashing reformer, a tough-talking former federal prosecutor, and a Jersey Boy born and bred.
