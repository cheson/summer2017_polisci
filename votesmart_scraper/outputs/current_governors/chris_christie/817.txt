Governor Christie: Providing a high quality education for every student in every corner of this state is a deeply personal issue for me. I fully believe the most important thing we can do to put our kids on a path to a successful life is to give them the greatest education we possibly can. And that's not just in the classroom but also at home where it's the obligation of parents and caregivers to participate in that education as well. That's why I'm proud to say under our Administration that this year we provide an all-time record level of state funding to our K to 12 school system, and we've done that without raising taxes on the people of the state of New Jersey at the state level. So, I want to celebrate the reopening at this school, it is great to be here. I have always said that September is the best month at the Jersey Shore, all you people who live here full time know that. You already know it.
