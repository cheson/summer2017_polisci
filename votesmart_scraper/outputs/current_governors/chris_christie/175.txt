Governor Christie: We can't take the easy way out, and let me tell you something, this lady brought up and I didn't respond to, the pitting of the suburbs against the cities. Let me tell you with all due respect, that's already happened. The supreme court did it 30 years ago. They did it 30 years ago.
They didn't have to do it that way and they did. They made the choice and every year property taxes went up astronomically in the suburbs, and every year they said that it was going to make education better in the cities, and every year it didn't. So I understand your concern and I share your concern about whether this will work. Here's what I know: what's going on now doesn't work.
It doesn't work, and I can't sit around any longer and let's give it another couple years, because in another couple of years some of you will move because you can't afford it anymore, another couple of years wastes another kid in Camden and his or her life.
They don't have time to wait. You're only in eighth grade for a year. And if you don't get eighth grade and they push you to ninth grade, it doesn't make ninth grade any easier. Every year that goes by that we say to them, be patient, wait, their lives get wasted. It's unacceptable we can't wait anymore.
