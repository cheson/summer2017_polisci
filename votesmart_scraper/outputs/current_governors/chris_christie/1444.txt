Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: Aug. 25, 2009
Location: Parsippany, NJ

Today, Chris Christie released the following statement following the appeals court decision on affordable housing:
"Yesterday's ruling is the latest blow to our struggling towns and residents already overwhelmed by skyrocketing property taxes, diminished services and heightened urban sprawl. Enough is enough - placing more onerous requirements on our towns is a lazy and sloppy approach to solving our affordable housing problem and only creates further problems at the local level.
"I ask Governor Corzine to join me in denouncing this ruling and supporting a special session of the Legislature so we can overturn this damaging decision and fix this problem before even more towns and New Jerseyans pay the price."
