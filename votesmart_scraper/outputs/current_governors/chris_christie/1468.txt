Statement by Chris Christie on New Jersey's Unemployment Rate
With the release of February's state unemployment rate of 8.2% - now above the national rate of 8.1% - Chris Christie released the following statement:
"In his budget speech, Jon Corzine said that Â‘New Jersey is faring better than other states by most standards.' There's no clearer measure than our state's unemployment rate. Corzine and McGreevey's 103 tax increases and anti-business policies have driven business from our state and caused our state's business climate to be ranked dead last in the country. I will cut the business and income taxes raised by Corzine and McGreevey to keep good paying jobs here and encourage new private sector growth. I will get New Jersey working again."
