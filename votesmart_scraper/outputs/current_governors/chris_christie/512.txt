Governor Christie: All of the different partisan folks who were pronouncing cataclysm over this have now seen over the course of the last two years that what it's done is made Rutgers a better institution and has helped in cities like Newark and in Camden, to bring world-class educators, the chancellors that we've brought in, the people leading medical education at Rutgers now, are world-class educators, and if we had listened to some of the voices who are always voices of negativity inside the Legislature we would have never done it. But thankfully we can ignore them and should continue to as we make sure that we expand and grow our medical education in the state. Let us remember that up until just a year and a half ago it had been 25 years since the state government had invested any capital money in our institutions of higher education. Governors, both Republican and Democrat, had been unwilling to approach the voters and ask them to invest capital money in our state's higher education institutions. We are in the midst of a building boom in higher education in our state right now fueled by over $1.2 billion that we have committed to our higher education institutions in this state both public and private, and another 25% of private funding that is matching that public funding to build new classrooms, new laboratories all across our state, with a particular focus on science and technology, engineering and math, to enhance our state's position today as the number two state in the country in biotechnology. We know that by continuing to grow our academic core we're going to grow our economic core as well especially in the areas where we continue to be very strong.
