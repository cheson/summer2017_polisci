Governor Christie: People will throw out all different kinds of numbers about how much of capital investment they're making, certain grants and other things that the state and localities are participating in to help to encourage this growth, but one of the things that you can't quantify, but that as Governor I know has extraordinary value, is the contribution that's made by Goya and its employees every day to the fabric of our society here in New Jersey. You saw Peter review some of the contributions that they're making, financial and otherwise, to philanthropic causes here in the state and we appreciate that and Goya has always been a generous and thoughtful corporate citizen in terms of helping philanthropically throughout the state, but even more so, the great cultural strength that Goya brings to our state, the distinction that it brings to New Jersey and its people is something that's I think impossible to place a dollar value on, that as people consume Goya foods around the world, they know that it comes from New Jersey, that it comes from a place that respects the heritage and the culture of every citizen that lives here within the borders of our state and to have such a wonderful, not only contributor, but representative for that heritage and that belief as Goya is something that is incredibly important to our state's continued growth, not only economically, but our continued growth in terms of the culture of our state and the strength that it provides of diversity to all of the folks who live here, work here, and grow up here, so I'm happy to be back here to watch the ribbon be cut in this place. I can't wait to continue to see the growth of Goya as it continues to provide an extraordinary service to people, not only in our country but around the world, so to Bob and to Peter and to the rest of the family and to La Gran Familia Goya, thank you all very much for believing in New Jersey. It is very gratifying for this Governor. Thank you all very much.
