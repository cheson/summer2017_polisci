Statement From Governor Chris Christie Regarding Supreme Court Decision On The Council On Affordable Housing
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: July 10, 2013
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie released the following statement on the COAH ruling:
"Both elected branches of government approved the plan to eliminate COAH. Not surprisingly, this liberal Supreme Court once again ignores that and continues to blindly perpetuate its failed social experiment in housing. The Chief Justice's activist opinion arrogantly bolsters another of the failures he and his colleagues have foisted on New Jersey taxpayers. This only steels my determination to continue to fight to bring common sense back to New Jersey's judiciary."
