Governor Christie: There Is No Disputing NJ Republican Job Creation

Governor Christie: Its results that matter, and there's really no disputing this any longer. Not only have we long ago recovered all the jobs that were lost in the recession, but we are now well above where we were before the recession even occurred, and as the chart that you see over to my right shows, the record of job creation of this administration exceeds almost every other one over the last 25 years, and I say it's no coincidence that the two best job creation times were when we've had Republican governors. Myself and Governor Whitman have the two best job-creation records over the last 30 years. That's no coincidence and when you look at the job-creation records of the Democratic governors over that time, it's pretty lame, and it's because of their policies. The fact of the matter is that jobs and people move with the way you treat them. If they feel like they're being treated fairly and they have certainty, they stay where they want to be, but if you make that place too expensive for them, they will go.
