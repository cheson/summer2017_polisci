Press Release

Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie this morning released 19 reports prepared by his Transition New Jersey subcommittees, which conducted thorough reviews of all departments, agencies and authorities of the state and made assessments and recommendations to improve, shrink and, in some cases, eliminate wasteful or inefficient government operations.
"These reports are full of bold ideas and recommendations for change from a bipartisan group of individuals from the private and public sectors," said Christie. "They came to the task with a wide range of knowledge and expertise and gave us unvarnished assessments of our state government, its strengths, weaknesses and failures. I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication. In the coming weeks, my Cabinet and I will be consulting with subcommittee members, reviewing each of the reports, and carefully considering these recommendations for improvement and change."
