Governor Christie: As part of that bail reform action that we took, we also put into law banning the box. And that's been Senator Cunningham's cause for a long time. We spent many times together in my office talking about how we were going to get Republicans and Democrats to come together to do this and to give people the permission to do the right thing and when packaged together with all the bail reform measures, it gave Republicans and Democrats a sense of comfort that we were doing something that was protective of our society but also opening of opportunities. We need to do more. I hope between now and June that we work more specifically on the issue of expungement and I am open to doing this and doing it in a right and smart way because we know that, even though we've banned the box, that these questions and issues continue to come up. Now, we have to find the right standard by which to institute expungement but I absolutely believe that if we want to move to the next step in all of this, that expungement has to be an option that is available to those who have earned it and deserve it and allow them even greater opportunity to become employed in our society and become productive members again when they've paid their debt to society.
