Gov. Christie On Atlantic City: Exempting Public Sector Unions From The Solution Is Bald Politics

I will not sign them and I will not sign any one of them individually, I have to sign them together. And let me explain to the people of the region who are listening why. Because you have seen failed attempts to fix this problem before. I do not want this to become one of those failed attempts and if I do not have all the authority I need to as governor to be able to bring Atlantic County's finances into balance, then it will fail. And we will be back in the same position we are now, six months from now, nine months from now, a year from now. And the problem will get no better, in fact it will get worse for the people of Atlantic City and for the people of the region. Because remember, for all you folks who are listening who live in Atlantic County, the longer Atlantic City doesn't get its act together the more it costs Atlantic County and all the citizens who live in all the municipalities of Atlantic County. And it hurts the region even more broadly. And so, I'm not doing this because I want my way, I know that this is what's needed to be able to get their finances into order. To exempt an entire class of people, public sector union workers from having to be part of the solution is just bald politics. That's all it is and I'm not going to engage in it.
