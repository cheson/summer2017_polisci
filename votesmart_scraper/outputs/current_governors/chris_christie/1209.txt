With legislation pending that would transfer the functions of the Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Authority (ACCVA) to the Casino Reinvestment and Development Authority (CRDA), Governor Chris Christie today vetoed numerous resolutions of the ACCVA, including its 2011 operations and marketing budgets.
"In light of this legislation currently before me for consideration, and my desire not to foreclose any options for the future of Atlantic City, I am compelled to veto the above resolutions which affect the operating, budgeting and finances of the ACCVA," Governor Christie wrote in his veto letter, signed today, to Jeffrey S. Vasser, the ACCVA executive director.
The Governor vetoed the following resolutions reflected in the minutes of the ACCVA's December 15, meeting:
* 2011 Destination Marketing Organization Budget
* 2011 Operations Budget
* 2011 Consolidated Capital Plan
* Solar Purchase Agreement, West Hall, and
* Renewal of Intergovernmental Agreement with the Atlantic City Special Improvement District to Install, Remove and Store Banners.
The Governor noted in his veto letter that two bills (S-11 and A-3581) have passed in the legislature and direct the establishment of the Atlantic City Tourism District, broaden the powers and duties of the CRDA and transfers ACCVA and its functions to the CRDA. Both pieces of legislation await action by Governor Christie.
