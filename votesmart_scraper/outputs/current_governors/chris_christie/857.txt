Governor Christie: As I said in the State of the State Address the New Jersey Comeback has begun. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York just issued a report this past week saying that in the fourth quarter of 2011 the economic growth in New Jersey is more robust than any state in the North East. And the noise you can here around us is the greatest noise I can hear as Governor of New Jersey, the noise of construction. Realogy joins a growing list of leading Fortune 500 Companies to small and medium size businesses that are fueling the New Jersey Economic turnaround. Ashurian, BFSF, Honeywell as I mentioned before, Bayer, Church & Dwight, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Panasonic, have all committed to generate and maintain over 43,000 jobs here in New Jersey. Bringing nearly $6 billion in total public-private investment into New Jersey since January 2010 when we took office. That's why this month I said that we got to cut income taxes by 10% for individuals and small businesses and medium size businesses across the state. We need to make sure we are more competitive than New York. And when we institute our cut, we will have rates at every level, below the state of New York again. Now, when did you think you were going to here that when we were back in 2009 running for office in the context of 117,000 lost private sector jobs just in one year. But in the last year, in 2011, more private sector jobs were created in New Jersey in one year than any year since the year 2000. We have ended our decade of joblessness and business rejection in New Jersey and we're backing to letting business know that they are welcome to grow here.
