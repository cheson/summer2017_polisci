Statement on the Selection of "Race to the Top' Phase 2 Finalists
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: July 27, 2010
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statement in response to New Jersey's selection as a finalist in Phase 2 of Race to the Top:
"President Obama and Secretary Duncan today recognized our administration's plan for bold reform of our state's education system. This announcement affirms our decision to stick with real reform and not capitulate to the watered-down, failed status quo approach advocated by the NJEA. Now is the time for New Jersey's leaders to join me to begin enactment of the pillars of real education reform contained within our Race to the Top application - more charter school opportunities for students, more choice for parents and fidelity to placing student success ahead of union self interest."
