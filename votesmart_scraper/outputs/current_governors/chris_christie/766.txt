Governor Christie: We Are Not Going To Be Timid
Statement
By: Chris Christie

Location: Washington, DC

Governor Christie: I will tell you that I absolutely believe that this is an investment that the people of New Jersey had to make, but our leaders had to be willing to put it in front of them to get them to answer the question. And all too often people get timid about this in public life and we're not going to be timid. We haven't been for the last four years. We won't be for the next four years. You see that I'm still getting used to that part of it because up until like last Tuesday I kept saying if I have another four years. That matter has now been settled, so if I seem to stumble over those words a little bit it's just because I'm still getting used to the idea that I have this job for another four years. But, I have lots of plans and lots of ideas about what to do with those next four years to continue to build on what we've done over the last four and to make New Jersey an even better place to live and work and raise your families. So to Dr. Yaw, who has been a leader of this institution for a very long time and led it in I think an exemplary manner, I am looking forward to seeing what happens here with the investment that we're making and the freeholders are making.
