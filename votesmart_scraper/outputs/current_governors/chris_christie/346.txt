Governor Christie: It's A Monumental Day For New Jersey's Economic Recovery

As we start today, it's a monumental day for New Jersey's economic recovery. The New Jersey unemployment rate is now down to 4.8%. To remind you, when I came into office in January of 2010, the February 2010 unemployment rate, the first one given during my time as Governor, was 9.8%, a full five points higher. We've now cut the unemployment rate more than in half. The unemployment rate in New Jersey is now lower than New York. It's now lower than Connecticut. It's now lower than Delaware. It's now lower than Maryland, and it's now lower than Massachusetts. Just in last year, in 2015, the national rate went down 6/10ths of one percent. New Jersey's rate went down two percent. Why is this? I think it's the strong steps that we've taken over the course of the last six years. No new taxes in six years at the state level. Over $2 billion in business tax cuts. Property tax increases that have been cut by over 70% from where they were before I became Governor, so we need to continue the momentum that's going on in our state with job creation. We need to pass a lean and a smart budget this June that doesn't raise taxes on the people of New Jersey. We need to oppose any type of special interest constitutional amendments which would foist a over $3 billion tax increase on the people of New Jersey. We need to continue to fund infrastructure, but we need to do it not on the backs of the New Jersey taxpayers, and we need to take the games out of the Senate's judicial confirmation process for the Supreme Court and hold hearings to confirm qualified people for the Supreme Court.
