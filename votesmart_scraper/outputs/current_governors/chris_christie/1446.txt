Christie Backs Reopening Pascack Valley Hospital
Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Christie this afternoon insisted that Pascack Valley Hospital be reopened. "It seems clear to me that from a health and safety perspective, for the people of Pascack Valley, we need to allow them to have access to this type of health care facility," Christie told a crowd gathered at the entrance to the hospital in Westwood.
The nearly 300-bed hospital, which opened a half-century ago, closed two years ago after being forced into bankruptcy. The state Health Planning Board must recommend whether it should remain closed or allow Hackensack University Medical Center to open a 128-bed acute care facility managed and mostly owned by a for-profit partner -- a first for North Jersey.
Residents and officials have fought in favor of reopening Pascack, saying that the health of local citizens is at stake.
