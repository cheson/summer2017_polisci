Governor Christie: To each and every one of you, congratulations on what you're accomplishing today, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to stand up here and look into your eyes and the eyes of your family. You'd be amazed when you stand up here and you look out at you, how much you can really see. About 95 percent of you are totally bought into the program. There's still a few of you, though, who are like shaking your head a little bit. Get with it; no giving up; no being cynical. There should be no cynicism in this room today, even for people from New Jersey, there should be no cynicism in this room today. This should be a room of joy. This should be a room of celebration. This should be a room filled with love of life. That's the spirit with which I came here today, and the spirit with which I congratulate all of you on what will be just your latest achievement in your second chance at life, on a road that's going to help you, your family and your friends and most importantly yourself to make everything of the life that God has given to each and every one of you. Thank you all for having me today, I appreciate it.
