Lt. Governor, Mr. Speaker congratulations, Mr. President, members of the State Legislature, friends and fellow New Jerseyans: Now, the last week has certainly tested this Administration. Mistakes were clearly made. And as a result, we let down the people we're entrusted to serve. I know our citizens deserve better. Much better. Now, I'm the governor and I'm ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch - both good and bad. Now without a doubt, we will cooperate with all appropriate inquiries to ensure that this breach of trust does not happen again. But I also want to assure the people of New Jersey today that what has occurred does not define us or our state. This Administration and this Legislature will not allow the work that needs to be done to improve the people's lives in New Jersey to be delayed for any reason. I am the leader of this state and its people and I stand here today proud to be both. But also, those of you who know me know I'm always, always determined to do better.
