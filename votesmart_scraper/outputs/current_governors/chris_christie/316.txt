George Sherman: During this journey we will go from 3,500 J.P. Morgan Chase workers to 8,000. And of those 8,000, 3,000 will be new jobs in New Jersey. So quite a significant commitment. And when we are done, we will have one of the largest most state of the art technology centers in our global portfolio right here in Jersey City.
Governor Christie: I am happy to be back here to hear all that great news. You know with the approval by the Economic Development Authority here in New Jersey of Grow New Jersey tax credits in the amount of $412 million the company is creating and retaining the jobs that George just talked about. The capital investment that is being made here is significant and appreciated by the state. So, today, I am pleased to also announce that due to the administration's efforts to return the UI Trust Fund to full solvency -- where it now stands with a positive balance of nearly $1 billion -- we have triggered another $200 million in tax reductions for New Jersey employers by reaching that threshold. The move will benefit New Jersey companies tremendously in the long run because its successful companies like yours here at J.P. Morgan and others -- not the government -- that will grow our economy and create jobs and the creation of these new jobs here by J.P. Morgan in New Jersey, in your expansion, is proof of that. Our job is to make it easier and more affordable to live and to work here, not more expensive and burdensome. And so, we want you to able to support your families, that's been our priority for the last six and a half years. And it will be my priority in last year and a half or so that I have as governor.
