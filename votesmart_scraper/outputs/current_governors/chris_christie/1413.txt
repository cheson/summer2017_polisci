Statement from Governor Chris Christie Praising Senate President Sweeney
Governor Chris Christie released the following statement praising Senate President Steve Sweeney for making pension and benefit reform an early priority of the new Senate session:
"Senate President Sweeney is sending a clear signal that results matter and that bipartisan action is critical to reforming a broken pension and benefits system. I applaud the Senate leadership's decision to complete the sweeping overhaul of the public employee pension and benefits system that was first proposed over three years ago. The only way to ease New Jersey's fiscal pain and close our budget gap is by working together to fundamentally change the way government operates and today's move is a very positive first step."
