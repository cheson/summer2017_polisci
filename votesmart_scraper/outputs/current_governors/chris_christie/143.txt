Governor Chris Christie today signed legislation, S-2156/A-3424, requiring medical professionals to educate children and teenagers about addiction risks before issuing prescription drugs.
"This critical prevention legislation will stem the growing tide of drug addiction in New Jersey that has been largely caused by the misuse of prescription drugs or prescription drugs getting into the wrong hands," Governor Christie said. "Coupled with dozens of other new reforms underway, including a comprehensive in-school curriculum for kindergarteners through 12th graders, we can stop this fatal disease from decimating another generation. Piece by piece, I am proud that my administration, with bipartisan cooperation from the legislature, is creating a holistic model for America to curb this epidemic impacting all residents, families, communities and businesses."
