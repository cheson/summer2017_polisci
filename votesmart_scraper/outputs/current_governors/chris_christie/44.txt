Governor Christie: I'm not happy about any of this, but the fact of the matter is we're going to either make these repairs now or we're going to make them later, but the repairs need to be made. I also am heartened by Amtrak's announcement last night that they are bringing in a private firm to supplement their work on this as well, and so they are going to be bringing in a firm called HNTB to be able to provide them with additional repair workers to be able to try to expedite this even more quickly. I still agree with Governor Cuomo that the long-term solution for this, as we jointly recommended last week, is to get a private operator in to make sure that a private operator runs Penn Station and that infrastructure. Given Amtrak's duplicity, their dishonesty, and their inability to be able to keep this infrastructure in a state of good repair, we can't any longer for a long-term solution rely upon Amtrak, but in the short term we need these repairs made and made as quickly as possible by Amtrak. Again, going back to the safety, we don't want any further derailments as we've had over the course of the last couple of months, and reliability as well, because we know that even when there's not a derailment when there are problems with these tracks there are significant delays that hurt our customers, and so I'm happy that we have an agreement with significant concessions from Amtrak to us on how this is going to operate during this eight week period of delay and it's my view that we cannot be charging people the rates that we were charging them before for a Midtown Direct ticket when they have to stop in Hoboken and take another mode of transportation into Midtown, and so 56 to 63 percent reductions for July and August for those who use the Morris and Essex lines and the Midtown Direct I think is something that is significant as we saw in the Gladstone line, a significant decrease in the cost to the commuters and something that I hope will at least provide them with some financial relief for the problems that Amtrak has caused.
