With Winter Storm Cato expected to impede transportation and travel throughout New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie today declared a State of Emergency, authorizing the State Director of Emergency Management to activate and coordinate the preparation, response and recovery efforts for the storm with all county and municipal emergency operations and governmental agencies. Commuters are asked to use extreme caution while traveling across the state.
"Today's storm is expected to produce travel hazards and potentially cause power outages throughout the state," said Governor Christie. "I've authorized state officials to take all necessary action to prepare, and my Administration will continue monitoring conditions throughout the remainder of the storm. With higher than normal traffic volume due to the Thanksgiving holiday, I strongly encourage all New Jerseyans to drive carefully so that they and their families arrive safely at their destinations.

Already affecting parts of the state, Winter Storm Cato is expected to continue into the evening, bringing rain, snow, mixed precipitation, and strong winds.
