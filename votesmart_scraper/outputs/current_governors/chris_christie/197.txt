Governor Chris Christie Acts To Make New Jersey A "Shall Issue" State For Handgun Carry Permits
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: Aug. 24, 2016
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today conditionally vetoed two bills that seek to further impede a citizen's Second Amendment right to own a firearm in the State of New Jersey, where restrictions are already among the most unreasonable and onerous in the country.

"The right to own a gun is a fundamental one enumerated in the Constitution," said Governor Christie. "I continue to oppose the relentless campaign by the Democratic legislature to make New Jersey as inhospitable as possible to lawful gun ownership and sales. Instead of remaining an outlier with overly burdensome restrictions of questionable constitutionality, New Jersey should follow the lead of the vast majority of states across the country and simplify, not complicate, the ability of responsible citizens, dealers and retailers, to buy, sell and possess firearms as protected by the Second Amendment."
The Governor's actions today would repeal a state law mandating the sale of firearms with so-called "smart gun" technology that has not been perfected in the 10 years the law has been on the books. More significantly, the Governor's conditional veto of A-3689 would enable New Jersey to join 42 other states with a "shall issue" standard for the issuance of a handgun carry permit. The Governor has proposed eliminating the nearly-insurmountable "justifiable need" standard and requiring the issuance of a carry permit to anyone who is not legally disqualified from possessing a firearm and who can demonstrate an understanding of the safe handling of a handgun. This revised standard would allow law-abiding New Jersey residents to exercise their Second Amendment rights more reasonably, while still preventing dangerous persons from legally obtaining firearms.
BILLS VETOED:
S-816/ACS for A-1426 (Weinberg, Codey/Johnson, Vainieri Huttle, Eustace, Wimberly) -- CONDITIONAL - Establishes commission to approve personalized handguns; requires firearm retailers to sell handgun
A-3689/S-2165 (Greenwald, Houghtaling, Downey, Mosquera, Lampitt/Weinberg) -- CONDITIONAL - Codifies regulations defining justifiable need to carry handgun
