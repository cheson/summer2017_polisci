Governor Christie Exercises Veto In Continued Commitment To End Wasteful Spending Throughout State Government
Press Release

Location: Trenton, NJ

Late Wednesday, Governor Chris Christie exercised his veto authority to curb spending increases, his fourth such action since taking office. Demonstrating his long-term commitment to ending the practice of excessive, profligate spending in every part of state government, Governor Christie vetoed the budgets of the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association of New Jersey and the Standardbred Breeders' and Owners' Association of New Jersey at the New Jersey Racing Commission's January 20, 2010 meeting.
Governor Christie said, "As when I have previously exercised veto authority, my Administration will continue to scrutinize the actions of the many Board and Authorities in our state and root out waste. As we face serious fiscal challenges, savings are being identified and realized in every part of state government, including spending reductions. Board and Authorities are no exception to this, and my Administration will continue to rein in spending increases in these entities."
The proposed 2010 budget for the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association of New Jersey represents a 19.8% increase over 2009 expenditures, and includes excessive line items such as $10,000 for an annual awards banquet, $42,500 for the New Jersey Thoroughbred Festival - a $22,500 increase over 2009 to pay for additional promotional giveaway items - and $40,000 for lobbyists costs.
The proposed 2010 budget for the Standardbred Breeders' and Owners' Association of New Jersey represents a 5.6% increase over 2009 expenditures.
This represents the fourth time Governor Christie has exercised his veto authority to combat wasteful spending. Previously, Governor Christie vetoed blanket spending increases in the budget of the Delaware River and Bay Authority, excessive expenditures by the UEZ for street cleaning, and a change order at the Schools Development Authority.
No veto power was exercised as to any other action taken by the Commission at its meeting on January 20, 2010.
