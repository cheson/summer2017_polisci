Governor Christie Pardons Philadelphia Man Who Has Reclaimed His Life From Addiction
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: Nov. 25, 2015
Location: Trenton, NJ

Acting on his commitment to helping people reclaim their lives from the destructive cycle of substance abuse and crime, Governor Chris Christie today granted a pardon to Philadelphia resident John F. Berry, who was convicted more than 40 years ago in New Jersey for robbery and possession of stolen property as a result of his extensive drug use. For the last 36 years, Berry has transformed his life, focusing his commitment to addiction programs that serve adults and children separating from correctional facilities.
"John's story is the reason why I believe that no life is disposable," said Governor Christie. "Through the years, he has overcome many hurdles and set a positive example of what can be achieved when given a second chance to make things right in your life. I want to thank John for his courage and commitment, for giving back to others through his advocacy and by serving as a symbol of hope and influence to those overcoming the disease of addiction."
