Governor Christie: I brought reinforcements today. How many town hall meetings have you been to?
Mary Pat Christie: I think this is about my fifth.
Governor Christie: Your fifth. It's my 132nd. It's my 132nd so Mary Pat and I are glad to be here because this is home, so I was able to induce her today to come out and to come to the town hall meeting and see what I'm doing when we come out and do this stuff. But one thing I want to tell you about what we've been doing together as a couple over the last 5 ½ years and then I'll get into the rest of it and allow her to sit down and watch what I do. This--one of the real focuses for us over the last 5 ½ years has been the developmentally disabled community in the state and with a particular focus on those families who have family members with autism, and she's helped to start things across the country that have been great in terms of bringing greater awareness to it. All of us know that New Jersey has the highest rate of autism of any state in the country, and so those issues are extraordinarily important to both of us, and so we've been working incredibly hard together, not only to try to have more funding for the developmentally disabled community but also greater level of attention to the needs and issues, and I know that there'll be lots of conversation if today's town hall is anything like the four I've had in the last month or so, that there'll be questions and conversation about that and I'm looking forward to taking those questions, but we do this as a team. We've done it as a team ever since I decided to run 6 ½ years ago and we continue to do this as a team and it's good to have my partner and my teammate with me today so I'll try not to be too nervous, all right, while you're here? Thanks.
