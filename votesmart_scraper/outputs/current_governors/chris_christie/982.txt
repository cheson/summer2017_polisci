School's Not Out Yet
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: May 31, 2012
Location: East Brunswick, NJ

"Dealing with the legislature is like dealing with your children who have a book report due. Many of you parents understand exactly what I mean. The book report's given to them in January. The teacher tells them "You've got to have that book report and it's due June 30th.  For us, the teacher assignment is the State of the State address in January. I laid out an ambitious agenda in January for the things that we needed to get done this year.  All of a sudden there's 30 days left. They just picked out the book. They haven't started reading it yet. And they've got to jam it all in to the last 30 days.  And for some reason they never change. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the New Jersey State Legislature."
