Governor Christie: Camden is a model in a whole bunch of ways and it's a model because you can never take the politics out of this unfortunately David. The question is whether or not you're going to put aside the politics and work together for what can be a common shared good, and unfortunately in other places we have people still playing the politics of yesterday and blaming and finger pointing and--you know, protests are fine. We're a democratic society, and I don't ever bemoan someone for going out and protesting if that's what they want to do. That's fine, but what we've had in some other places, in Newark in particular, are people who are trying to undercut the success of the very schools they're sending their children to, with boycotts and other things and politicians who are just trying to make a name for themselves off of that. That's fine for them I guess, for the individual politician who's inducing that type of conduct, but it's really emblematic of the problem that we have in a lot of our urban areas with public education, which is the interests of adults are being put ahead of the interests of children, and we need to grow up and understand that as adults those children are counting on us to put aside our differences and to act like adults and to get the job done. They're doing that here in Camden. It doesn't mean every day is perfect. It doesn't mean they're not without problems as Paymon referenced, and everybody's got their moments. But the spirit here is how can we get to yes with each other, not how's a new way we can find a way to no.
