For 6Â½ years, I have been able to effectively ignore the liberal, fact-twisting rantings of The Star-Ledger editorial board. But the stakes of this debate on property taxes and urban education are too great to ignore the newspaper's latest emotional screed against my Fairness Formula.
On property taxes, our residents pay the highest in the nation. Why? First, our school funding formula has allocated grossly disproportionate amounts to 31 School Development Authority districts for 30-plus years. Second, urban municipal governments spend disproportionately compared with most other local governments in the state. Third, union dominance of work rules costs taxpayers a fortune.
Ninety-seven billion dollars in taxpayer money has been given to 31 SDA districts over 30 years. Eighty-eight billion dollars has been divided among all the other 546 districts over the same time period. All that money -- just from state income tax payers -- for a 66 percent graduation rate in Asbury Park, a 63 percent rate in Camden and a 69 percent rate in Newark.
The Star-Ledger justifies that failure by saying we are better than other states.
But while The Star-Ledger may define this as "success," I don't. And here is the real truth: The overwhelming number of those "graduates" need remedial training for at least a year to even sit in a college classroom. Those diplomas are an illusion, and that failed system, they say, we must pour more money into it every year.
