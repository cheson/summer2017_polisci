Joint Statement of Governors Christie and Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo Chris Christie
Date: Dec. 7, 2012
Location: Trenton, NJ

"During the past days and weeks, we have been working very closely with the President, administration officials and our respective congressional delegations to craft a supplemental appropriations request that meets the critical needs facing our states in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Today's agreement on the Administration's request to Congress would authorize more than $60 billion in funding that will enable our states to recover, repair, and rebuild better and stronger than before. This package also includes funding to invest in essential mitigation and prevention efforts that will better protect our region against the devastating impacts of future superstorms.
"The request is crafted to afford maximum flexibility to state governments and we will continue to work with the Administration and Congress as our needs arise.
"We thank President Obama for his steadfast commitment of support and look forward to continuing our partnership in the recovery effort."
