Location: Trenton, NJ

Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement in commemoration of Independence Day:
"Today, we celebrate our nation's independence and the liberties we are fortunate to have as Americans. We remember the principles upon which our nation was built and the many around the globe to whom freedom and self-determination are still denied. As New Jerseyans gather across our state with family and friends for barbeques, parades and fireworks displays, let us also remember and honor our military servicemen and women, whose sacrifice and commitment have made possible every liberty, every freedom and the way of life we enjoy. I wish all New Jerseyans a happy and safe 4th of July holiday and may God continue to bless America."
