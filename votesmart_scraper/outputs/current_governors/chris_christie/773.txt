Essex County Executive Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr.: One of the things we have in this county, we have Democrats, we have Republicans and we have Independents and as the leader, as the CEO of the county that has to work with 22 municipalities, this Governor has been very, very effective in helping us here in Essex County but not only Essex County, in New Jersey. You know our slogan is "Putting Essex County First.' His of course is put New Jersey first but he was born in Newark and he grew up in Livingston. So he hears it every day from me about Essex County and for the last four years when you talk about what we have done and what we have accomplished. It's only because of the relationship that I have had with the Governor.
Governor Chris Christie: Finally to Joe D. He's right. He and I have been friends for 11 years. We've worked together as Governor and County Executive over the last four years to make sure that the people of Essex County are represented well, that they get their fair share and that the county is run efficiently and effectively and so is the state. And I count him as a friend but also as somebody who knows how to run his government. Those are the kinds of friends I want to have when I'm Governor.
