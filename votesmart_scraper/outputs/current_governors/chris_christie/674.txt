Governor Christie: Every Life We Save Is A Life Worthwhile
Press Conference
By: Chris Christie
Date: April 3, 2014
Location: Sayreville, NJ

Governor Christie: I really believe that the only way to deal with this problem -- yeah for the dealers and the violent folks is they have to go to jail --
JoAnn Drickler: Absolutely.
Governor Christie: -- and we have strict laws for them. But the problem is that what we're doing with folks like your daughter is either giving probation like you talked about or if they come back repeatedly, we're putting them in jail.
JoAnn Drickler: Right.
Governor Christie: Where they don't get treatment.
JoAnn Drickler: Right.
Governor Christie: Where drugs get snuck into prison.
JoAnn Drickler: Right.
Governor Christie: And they come out just as addicted as they were when they went in. And then we all sit around going: jeez, wonder why they committed another crime?
