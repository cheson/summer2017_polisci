Since taking office, Governor Christie acted on his commitment to ensure that every child in New Jersey has access to a high-quality education regardless of their zip code. The sweeping changes he enacted can and should be a model for reform for the nation.

* Reform Tenure To Remove Teachers Who Are Failing Students While Rewarding Good Teachers For Performance: Tenure for teachers should be awarded and retained based on performance. In New Jersey, Governor Christie signed into law a sweeping, bipartisan overhaul of the oldest tenure law in the nation. Also, for the first time in New Jersey history, a new contract for teachers in Newark allows them to earn raises and be eligible for additional bonuses based in part on student performance.
* Promote College Readiness: Focusing specifically on students from low income families, college readiness programs can enroll these students in transitional courses before they graduate high school to better prepare them for college. In New Jersey's initial pilot of the College Readiness Now Program, 19 community colleges in partnership with over 60 high schools across the state successfully participated.
* Provide School Choice For Those In Failing Districts: Students in struggling districts should have the option of attending a public school outside their district of residence without cost to their parents. Enrollment in New Jersey's Inter-District School Choice Program increased more than 5-fold since the program was signed into law in 2010.
* Expand Access To Charter Schools: Another way to expand the education options available for children trapped in school districts with the largest achievement gaps is to encourage the best charter school operators. The Christie Administration has increased the overall number of charter schools in New Jersey to 87, serving 37,500 students.
