I want to fix Atlantic City and so you know I do not negotiate out in public and I have negotiated plenty on this issue already. The legislature cannot come to a consensus. My door is always open to talk to the leaders of the legislature about whatever is on their mind. But one thing we know for sure, Matt, nothing will happen unless it gets my signature. That is the great thing about it. You know, there are three key numbers in Trenton, they will tell you all the time, for those who are newly initiated to Trenton. There are three key numbers: Forty-one, twenty-one and one. Forty-one gets you a majority in the assembly, twenty-one gets you a majority in the senate, but it is great to be one. Because then you do not have to worry about anyone else but me. So my door continues to be open, but I am not going to negotiate with folks in public. I would not going to take on or off the table. I have told them I want the Sweeney bill as it was originally passed. If they have something else they want to show me, I am always willing to listen but I am certainly not changing my position and I have not.
