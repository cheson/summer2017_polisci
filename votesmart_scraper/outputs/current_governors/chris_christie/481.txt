Governor Christie: The greatest thing that you'll find about any facility that's run by Daytop. It's a place where miracles happen on earth. All of us find certain challenges in life and certain discouragements. Miracles should be something that lifts our spirit and that gives us faith and hope and trust in the fact that the future, that tomorrow can be better than today, and this is a place where miracles will happen for young people in Ocean County dealing with this difficult disease. Miracles are not without effort, but they're miracles nonetheless, and that's what's kept me associated with this organization for 20 years as a public official, as a board member, and as a private contributor to their mission, because what they're doing is God's work here on Earth.
