Date: Sept. 18, 2015
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statement in honor and remembrance of Americans taken as Prisoners of War or Missing in Action and their families:
"On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, I encourage all New Jerseyans to pause and honor the men and women of our Armed Forces who courageously defended our freedom in the face of imprisonment and those who never returned home to their loved ones. As we look to the National League of POW/MIA Families Flag, we are reminded of our Nation's concern and commitment to those still missing and the determination to end the uncertainty for their families. Today represents the utmost respect and gratitude of a grateful Nation but also stands as a symbolic statement of our continued resolve, decades later, to account for United States personnel still missing from our Nation's past wars and conflicts."
