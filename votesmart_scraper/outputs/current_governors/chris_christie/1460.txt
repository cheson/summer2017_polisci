Statement by Chris Christie on New Jersey's Unemployment Figures
Chris Christie released the following statement regarding New Jersey's latest unemployment figures released today:
"For the 15th consecutive month, New Jersey's unemployment rate has risen while Jon Corzine has done nothing but raise taxes on hardworking families buckling under the financial strain. Since Governor Corzine has been in office, it has been one bad decision after another, and New Jerseyans are paying the consequences. It's time for a governor who will put a stop to high taxes, turn around our anti-competitive climate to keep jobs here and enact responsible budgeting so funding for priority programs like property tax relief and education doesn't disappear."
