Governor Christie: Leadership is not always easy. Leaders are the ones that put themselves out there, and when they do, they are subject to criticism from anybody who has a voice or a Twitter account or both. I want to tell you though that every individual trooper who puts on the uniform every day and wears that badge is a leader. Today, I'm proud of you, a new generation of leaders who sits right before me. I'm even more confident that you will serve the state of New Jersey and the greater community in our state with pride, with dignity and with honor. On behalf of all of the people of the state of New Jersey, let me thank you in advance for your sacrifice, for your service, for your fidelity to the people of the state and as the final graduating class of my time as governor, I want to let you all know what extraordinary pride I have in having had the opportunity to work as closely with all of you as I have over the last eight years. Your service to the people New Jersey will never be fully understood by them, but when a crisis comes, believe me, they are enormously proud to have you on the front lines and enormously indebted to you and your families, for the sacrifice and the service that you provide. To the graduating class, the men and women who will now become part of this most elite organization, God bless you, may you stay safe from all harm and please know that during my time as governor and for the rest of my life, I will be proud to have been associated with the men and women of the New Jersey State Police. Congratulations.
