Governor Christie: We Want To Ensure Sea Bright Never Looks Like It Did After Sandy

What we're doing here is something that's planning for incidents like Sandy, although I suspect we'll never see anything quite like that again. But, all the resiliency plans that we're working on here, including the sea wall, is to take into consideration the depth of what happened there and what FEMA is both recommending and requiring, as we move forward, of municipalities that are situated like Sea Bright is here. And so we get local input, we get a lot of input from FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers and from the engineers at the DEP. You can never predict what something would have been able to handle. You know, man-made structures are still man-made structures and nature is often a very, very difficult opponent in that regard but, based upon the best information we have we hope it would have been able to. And that's what we're planning for, for the future to try to make sure what this downtown looked like, when I came here for the first time, that it never looks like that again.
