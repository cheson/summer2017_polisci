This is a direct result, what you see behind us, the creation of AC Devco was one of the things that he advocated for, and his group advocated for in that report, to build the essential partnerships that are needed to bring about mixed-use redevelopment initiatives in this city, as well as the development of a new Stockton University campus here in Atlantic City. In fact, the 675,000-square-foot project is the first major non-casino development since the completion of the walk, which, unbelievably, was 15 years ago, now. More importantly, it's anticipated to generate about 925 direct construction jobs and once completed the project will bring an additional 300 permanent jobs into Atlantic City. Today not only represents another major step in putting Atlantic City on the right path by developing its non-gaming sector thorough private investment and job creation, it's bringing both Stockton University and South Jersey Gas back to Atlantic City.
