Governor Christie: Listen, I said at the time in January of 2013 that the reason that federal aid should have been approved much more quickly than it was here and we waited longer than any area ever waited after a natural disaster for federal aid was that not only because was it the right thing to do but also because, you know, those Representatives and Senators down there should be thinking, there but for the grace of God go I. You know that this could happen in your state, in your neighborhood and you would want the American people to come and help you, as well. And so I continue to feel that way. I believe that the folks in Texas deserve to get federal aid to help them and this is not the kind of thing where we should playing tit for tat. Whatever mistakes were made by those folks at the time, I was pretty vocal at pointing out what I thought about them, especially those from my own party, who did not step up in the way that they should. And the only voice I'm going to add to this is to say, I feel for the people of Texas and for what they're going through and I know the people of Belmar and people of New Jersey would say to the Congress, don't play with them the way you played with us. Help the people in Texas so that they can recover too. And we're not going to get into arguments about this stuff.
