Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement marking the 101st anniversary of Flag Day:
"On the 101st anniversary of Flag Day, we recognize our American flag that defines the unity and prosperity of our great nation. Our flag not only represents the resiliency, courage, and pride that this country was built upon, but it also pays tribute to the brave men and women who protect our freedoms both at home and abroad. The American flag is a symbol that reminds us how we must stand together under the 50 stars and 13 stripes to protect this nation from any threats to our democracy and way of life. Today, I encourage all New Jerseyans to proudly display our American flag as a powerful demonstration of our citizens' basic rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
