Governor Chris Christie released the following statement today in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins today and continues through October 15:
"For more than 40 years, our nation has celebrated the contributions of the Hispanic community during Hispanic Heritage Month. As our state's largest and fastest growing ethnic community, our Hispanic residents are a critical part of New Jersey's uniqueness and identity. Through this month's various events and activities, New Jerseyans will recognize the many contributions our Hispanic residents have made in enriching our state's overall quality of life.
"My Administration continues to work aggressively to improve our state's economic climate, secure access to quality social services, and make the promise of a quality education available to every single child in this state, regardless of their zip code. By pursuing an agenda to make New Jersey a better, more affordable place to live and raise a family, we are working every day to keep opportunity alive for our Hispanic residents and all of our state's diverse communities. I am proud to be the first Governor to appoint a Hispanic New Jerseyan -- Martin Perez, Esq. of New Brunswick -- to the Rutgers University Board of Governors, the university's top governing board.
"As we recognize Hispanic Heritage Month, I hope that New Jerseyans will join me and celebrate the Hispanic community's contribution to our history and rich heritage."
Governor Christie also proclaimed September 15 - October 15, 2011 as "Hispanic Heritage Month" throughout New Jersey.
