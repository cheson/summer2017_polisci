Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan got a helping hand Wednesday from one of his party's best-known figures as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie came to Maryland to raise money for the GOP.
Christie, chair of the Republican Governors Association, arrived at a lunchtime fundraiser at a Bethesda restaurant to benefit Hogan and said the race's changing dynamics brought him to Maryland.
"This race is closing, and that's why I'm here," Christie said. "In the beginning, it didn't look like a race that was going to be tight, but it is tight now. That's why I'm here, and that's why the RGA is going to be here to help him because we think he's got a good chance here."
Proceeds from the event, which was closed to the news media, will go to the Maryland Republican Party's Hogan Victory Fund.
The visit by Christie signals national party interest in Hogan's underdog race in the Nov. 4 election in heavily Democratic Maryland. The New Jersey governor said he counted himself as a candidate who prevailed against the odds.
"You're talking to a guy from New Jersey, who won twice, with 750,000 more [registered] Democrats in the same kind of atmosphere," Christie told reporters as he walked from his car to the Redwood restaurant. "I feel pretty good about it. These races can be won. I'm proof of it, and that's why I'm here."
