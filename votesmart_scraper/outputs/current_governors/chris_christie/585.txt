To the children of this school, it's always exciting for me as Governor to come to a school. It reminds me all the time why we do what we do. Because we have an obligation to all of you to make the place that you grow up in and learn in, as great as it can possibly be because that will lead to you reaching the fullest potential that God has given to each and every one of you. And that's the most exciting part of being Governor, is to watch that happen and have played at least some small part in it so thank you again for inviting me today. Thank you for the extraordinary welcome. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. And thank you for what you're doing each and every day inside this building. When I saw each one of the teachers, what I tried to say to every one of them was thank you for your hard work. It's not easy doing what we do every day but I appreciate on behalf of all of the people in the state, the very hard work that you do every day and the great results that we trust will be produced with the students who walk these halls.
