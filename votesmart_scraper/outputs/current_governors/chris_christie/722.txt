With today's severe winter weather expected to result in dangerous travel conditions for several days, Governor Chris Christie today declared a State of Emergency, authorizing the State Director of Emergency Management to activate and coordinate the preparation, response and recovery efforts for the storm with all county and municipal emergency operations and governmental agencies. Governor Christie also authorized a staggering dismissal for all non-essential state employees beginning at noon. The staggering closing schedule will help to alleviate traffic congestion and reduce travel hazards.
"Today's winter storm is expected to produce heavy snow and travel hazards throughout the state, affecting tonight's evening commute," said Governor Christie. "I've authorized state officials to take all necessary action to prepare, and my Administration will continue monitoring conditions throughout the remainder of the storm. I encourage all New Jerseyans to drive carefully and remain off the roads if possible so that our first responders and public safety officials can safely respond to any emergency situations."
Already affecting parts of the state, the storm is expected to continue into the afternoon, bringing heavy snow and mixed precipitation throughout the state. A potential mixture of hazardous travel conditions, fallen trees and power outages and coastal, stream and river flooding are anticipated.
