Governor Christie Urges NJ Congressional Delegation To Hold Immediate Amtrak Hearings
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: April 6, 2017
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today urged U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker, House transportation committee members Frank LoBiondo and Albio Sires, and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen to hold Amtrak accountable for recent failures and how they prioritize state of good repair money they are receiving from New Jersey taxpayers and commuters. The Governor sent the attached letters this afternoon, in the wake Amtrak's CEO admitting responsibility for consecutive derailments, including Monday's incident at Pennsylvania Station in New York that is still causing disruptions throughout NJ TRANSIT's system.
"Amtrak's admission of fault and failure today proves a valuable lesson. The rush to judgment by candidates, politicians and the media to mislead the public with prejudicial conclusions to drive their partisan or personal agendas is irresponsible," Governor Christie said. "We must hold Amtrak fully accountable for these failures to keep commuters safe and maintain an efficient mass transportation system for the North East corridor. Our Congressional delegation should immediately execute their powers and oversight to ensure taxpayer and commuter dollars are prioritized for public safety and functional infrastructure."
Governor Christie also today extended his order for NJ TRANSIT senior officials to increase outreach and assist commuters during rush-hour commutes today and Friday at Newark, Hoboken and New York stations.
