Location: Trenton, NJ

Taking action to further strengthen support for New Jersey's military members, veterans and their families, Governor Chris Christie today signed several measures designed to encourage entrepreneurship, provide educational opportunity assistance and protect the honor of the service of New Jersey's military men and women.
"The service and sacrifice of our current military members and veterans to New Jersey and the nation is unequaled," said Governor Christie. "This administration's commitment to these brave men and women has never been stronger. By signing these three measures, we are not only reaffirming a pledge to those who serve, we are providing important opportunities for educational access and business development, and upholding the integrity and dignity of their service by punishing those who misrepresent themselves as serving in the military."
