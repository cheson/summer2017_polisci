Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement marking Veterans Day:
"We pause today to honor the men and women of our Armed Forces and the sacrifices they have made while wearing our nation's uniform. Our veterans have kept us safe at home and abroad and have served as the very best symbols of the values and freedoms of our nation. While we know that we can never fully repay the debt we owe our veterans or their families, we can use today to show our appreciation for their service to our country. May God bless New Jersey's 425,000 veterans and the many millions throughout the country."
