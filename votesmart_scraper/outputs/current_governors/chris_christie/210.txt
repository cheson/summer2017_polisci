Governor Christie: Under the current funding formula you only get about $2,900 per pupil from the state, $2,900 per pupil. You're paying $20,000 per kid to educate them and the state is only picking up less than $3,000 of that cost. That means all of the rest of that money must come from you, from property taxes. There is a little federal funding but a very small amount for a place like Fair Lawn, almost all the rest of it, almost the rest of the $17,000 per pupil per year has to come from you. Now in contrast, let's look at Asbury Park, let's forget Newark and Paterson and the ones that are near us, let's go a little further south down to Asbury Park.
Like I said you have almost a 95 percent graduation rate in Fair Lawn, the graduation rate this past year that we have states for, 2014, for Asbury Park was 66 percent. Only two-thirds of the kids that go to Asbury Park High School graduate. How much are they spending per pupil, per year? You're spending $20,031, they're spending $33,600 per pupil, per year, compared to your 20,000, and they're getting a graduation rate that is nearly 30 percent less than the graduation rate you're getting. You're paying 62 percent of your property taxes are going to school taxes. What percentage of their taxes go to schools? 25 percent, 25 percent, so why is it they're only paying 25 percent of their property tax bill, and by the way your property taxes here in Fair Lawn are 10, theirs are 5, the average bill in Asbury Park, they're half, and they pay half as less as you do and they only pay 25 percent of that towards their schools, you're paying 62 percent of it towards your schools.
Why? Because you get $2,900 per pupil, per year in aide from the state, you know how much they get? $29,000; $29,000 per pupil, per year from the state. Now I've got to tell you something, we've seen all this great liberal, editorial, and media response to me saying that's unfair. They say, if he takes away aide from the urban districts it's going to ruin them. Here's my question, how will they know? How will they know?
