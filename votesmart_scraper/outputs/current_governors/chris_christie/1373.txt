Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: March 31, 2010
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statement on President Obama's proposal to open the Atlantic Coast to oil and natural gas exploration and offshore drilling:
"I oppose the idea of drilling off the coast of New Jersey," Governor Christie said, noting that the President's proposal thus far includes areas off Virginia and the northern tip of Delaware near Cape May in the Delaware Bay. "New Jersey's coastline is one of our economic engines and I would have to be really convinced of both the economic viability and environmental safety of oil and gas exploration off our coast. At this point, I'm not convinced of either.''
