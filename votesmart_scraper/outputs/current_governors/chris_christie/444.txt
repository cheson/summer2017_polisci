Governor Andrew Cuomo and Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statements on Port Authority Reform Legislation:
Statement from Governor Andrew Cuomo:
"The legislation introduced today adopts the comprehensive changes underway as a result of the recommendations made in December by the Bi-State Special Panel on the Future of the Port Authority," said Governor Andrew M. Cuomo. "By enshrining these improvements into law, we will ensure the Port Authority will ably and effectively serve the people of the New York metropolitan region and returns to its original core mission of developing and overseeing regional transportation infrastructure. Enacting these critically important reforms will also ensure a more transparent and effective Port Authority. I want to thank Governor Christie and my partners in the legislature and in New Jersey for working together to guarantee that the Port Authority functions at the highest standards."
Statement from Governor Chris Christie:
"Achieving much-needed reform of the Port Authority's structure, management, operations and governance to secure its future as a transportation and economic cornerstone of our region is a goal that Governor Cuomo and I share. Based on bipartisan, collaborative work with representatives from both states, a bill is being introduced in New York that will achieve exactly the sort of reform that we are seeking, including the key elements of the recommendations of the Bi-State Special Panel and legislation introduced under Senator Tom Kean, Jr.'s leadership earlier this year. I urge New Jersey's legislature to introduce and pass this bill as well so that we can finally meet the standard for reform laid out by Governor Cuomo and me last year: a real, fundamental and long-lasting reimagining of the Port Authority that efficiently and transparently serves the needs of our region and the public."
