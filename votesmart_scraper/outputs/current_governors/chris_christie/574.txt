Governor Christie: The public in New Jersey needs to know we're prepared and we're ready to deal with whatever comes and that we're constantly reviewing our protocols and our approaches to make sure that we're doing it in the best possible way that we can and we're taking this extraordinarily seriously but we are not going to be in the business of stoking hysteria about this in the public. That's not what folks expect from people in leadership positions during a crisis, and the good thing for New Jerseyans--I'll end with this and turn it over to Commissioner O'Dowd--is the group of people sitting around this table have dealt with significant crises before in our state during Hurricane Sandy and the fact is all of us have, while we never would have welcomed that experience, it has really I've seen prepared us for the way we need to interact with each other, with authorities in other governments, and the way you approach these problems and analyze them, and so that experience from two years ago with this cabinet and with this Governor has made us I think very, very well prepared to deal with whatever crisis comes up, so the people in New Jersey should feel a sense of calm about this. Let's not be hysterical about it. Let's make sure we deal with it in a forthright way with each other and we will share as much information as we possibly can on a real-time basis because I think that also helps to lower the level of anxiety across our state.
