Location: Unknown

Governor Christie is committed to our nation's veterans and providing them with the healthcare they've been promised.
1.) Anytime, Anywhere Care:
Governor Christie believes veterans should be able to receive their health care benefit from any medical institution. Private sector and nonprofit hospitals want to be engaged in veteran health care and they should be brought in to supplement treatment delivered from veterans' hospitals.
2.) Qualified Leadership At The VA:
As President, Christie would hire a qualified professional who has run a major healthcare system in this country to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The majority of the role of the VA has become that of a healthcare provider and therefore needs someone who knows how to meet the mission of providing adequate and timely care.
3.) 24/7 Hotline:
In New Jersey, Governor Christie's administration established a 24 hours a day 7 days a week hotline manned by mental health professionals as well as veteran volunteers. Governor Christie supports creating a similar nationwide hotline to act as a resource for veterans experiencing mental health issues when they get home.
