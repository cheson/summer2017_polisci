Governor Christie: When our system works at its best, that's what it does. It not only helps people through the mission of the company, but through the investment that people make like TPG and others in these companies. They help to provide a better way of life for the people who work here every day. That's a great thing. And so as governor, I'm really proud to be here today. It is a continuing focus of our administration not just to create jobs, which nearly 275,000 have now been created since we entered office in February of 2010, in the private sector. And government employment down nearly 80,000 jobs, that's what helps us cut taxes, we got less people to pay for. The fact is that our focus is going to continue to be on creating the really good paying jobs that are careers for people. So that they can lay down roots here in New Jersey, feel comfortable in investing in real estate here, investing in education, and being able to raise their families here. Those are the roots of a great state and a great neighborhood. And you are in a great neighborhood, and I believe, without any objectivity at all, you're in a great state as well. So I want to thank all of the folks at Adare for believing in our state. We believe in you, that's why I'm here. And we have a ribbon to cut, so let's cut that ribbon. Thank you John.
