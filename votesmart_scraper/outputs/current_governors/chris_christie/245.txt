Governor Chris Christie today released the following statement in recognition of the 72nd Anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces landed at Normandy during World War II:
"Today, we join the rest of the country in recognizing the 72nd anniversary of D-Day. All Americans owe a tremendous debt of gratitude and appreciation to our World War II veterans who represent our nation's greatest values -- bravery, loyalty, and an unbreakable resolve in the face of adversity. On this day, we remember all of our military service members who unselfishly laid themselves on the line for our country in the face of Nazism and tyranny abroad. It is important for New Jersey residents to join in expressing their gratitude for the patriotic service of our veterans, who have risked their lives to ensure the safety and security of others around the globe while promoting the sacred principles of liberty and freedom."
