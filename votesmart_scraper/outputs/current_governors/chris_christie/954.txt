Continuing his strong record of bipartisan cooperation and compromise to put results before politics, Governor Chris Christie today signed the bipartisan "New Jersey Medical and Health Sciences Education Restructuring Act" into law, achieving a long-awaited, dramatic overhaul and strengthening of the state's higher education system that had eluded leaders in the state for more than a decade. This significant accomplishment represents the latest action of Governor Christie's commitment to improving New Jersey's system of higher education, including his signing of a $750 million bond referendum for capital improvements -- the first in 24 years -- the enactment of multiple pieces of legislation to support public-private partnerships for infrastructure improvements and investments at colleges and universities, an overall state aid increase of $65 million to colleges and universities this year, and $28 million in additional student financial assistance this year.
"This is a transformative and historic day for higher education in New Jersey. After decades of politics getting in the way of a desperately needed rethinking and restructuring of our higher education system, we have again come together in a bipartisan way to put our state's students, our long-term economic viability and our future generations first," said Governor Christie. "Along with our commitment to support a bond referendum to invest three-quarters of a billion dollars in capital improvements, we are undertaking the broadest, boldest, and most important restructuring of New Jersey's higher education landscape in decades."
This significant and sweeping restructuring legislation, A-3102, will promote long-term, sustainable economic growth and high academic achievement by fostering three hubs of higher education excellence in the northern, central, and southern parts of the state. The reform, effective July 1, 2013, transfers all schools, institutes and centers of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ), other than the School of Osteopathic Medicine and University Hospital, to Rutgers, while establishing Rowan University as a public research university. Rutgers University will become a Top-25 research institute based on the combined outside funding sources of the merged universities, a reality that will attract more top faculty and students, creating a cycle of excellence that will propel Rutgers to sustained excellence.
