NJ Biz: Relief From Trenton Requires Patience, Christie Says
By Martin C. Daks
Entrepreneurs and other taxpayers hoping for new economic incentives or other relief from Trenton will have to wait a bit longer, Gov. Chris Christie told a gathering of business owners Thursday.
"First, we have to work through the budget," Christie said at an afternoon meeting of the New Jersey Association of Women Business Owners. "Incentive programs won't happen just yet."
In fact, Christie sees 2010 as a time to plan a state strategy, and significant change isn't likely "until the end" of that first year, he told NJBIZ.
Christie and Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno spoke to about 60 business owners in the Hamilton office of The Mercadien Group, a CPA firm.
"Something's got to change," said Aldonna R. Ambler, owner of Hammonton-based Ambler Growth Strategy Consultants Inc. "Small-business owners need some relief."
Calling the state's past policy of spiraling taxes and spending "a failed experiment," Christie said Guadagno is now working on a plan "to trim the wet blanket of existing regulations."
It was a welcome message for entrepreneurs like Jackie Berman, president of Manalapan office supply business Cartridge Renewal Systems.
"I thought they [Christie and Guadagno] were great," said Berman, who also serves as NJAWBO's membership vice president. "It was an inspiration and a relief to hear elected officals finally address business owners' issues."
