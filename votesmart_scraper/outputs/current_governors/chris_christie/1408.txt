Statement from Governor Chris Christie on Fiscal Mismanagement in Atlantic City
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: Jan. 27, 2010
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie released the following statement today in response to the Office of Comptroller's report on fiscal mismanagement and abuse in Atlantic City:
"Today's report only reinforces the fact that there is irresponsible waste and abuse at every level of government. It is completely unacceptable that when our state is facing a gaping budget deficit and New Jerseyans are the highest taxed in the nation, Atlantic City is being reckless with taxpayer dollars. This audit is a good first step toward putting Atlantic City's finances in order and exactly the approach we plan to take across the board."
