Governor Christie: They don't ask you when you become drug addicted and you're buying drugs from dealers all across the state, when you purchase, if you're a Republican or Democrat. They don't ask you, amongst the many questions they ask you when you're incarcerated, they don't ask you whether you're Republican or a Democrat. And when you re-enter society after incarceration, and you're trying to get a job, you're trying to get housing, you're trying to get back into the swing of being a contributing member of our society, they don't ask you whether you're a Republican or Democrat. That shouldn't matter on this issue. That'll matter on some of the solutions perhaps, and we can have some good debate and discussion about it, but what we know is that this issue is an issue that cuts across every community in this state. Some it's just more obvious than others, some talk about it more, some try to hide it. It cuts across every demographic of this state, and we need to understand that this is an issue that will continue to define our success or failure as a civil society.
