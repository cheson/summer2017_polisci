Location: Trenton, NJ

Michael Drewniak, Press Secretary for the Office of the Governor, today issued the following statement on today's report on unemployment in New Jersey from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development:
"Today's report from the Department of Labor and Workforce offered some mildly reassuring news that New Jersey added 3,700 private sector jobs last month and that the jobless rate dropped by one-tenth of a percent. What that tells us is that there is a lot more work to do and reforms to pass to pave the way for real job growth. The Governor and his entire administration are committed to restoring fiscal stability, growing our economy and reforming our business climate to secure New Jersey's place as a place for strong, ongoing business growth and job creation."
