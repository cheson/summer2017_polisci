Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: June 20, 2011
Location: Trenton, NJ

Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement after the State Senate passed S-2937:
"I am encouraged by the bipartisan Senate vote today and the continued display of support for common-sense pension and health benefits reform. This is a watershed moment for New Jersey, proving that the stakes are too high and the consequences all too real to stand by and do nothing. As a result of Democrats and Republicans coming together to confront the tough issues, we are providing a sustainable future for our pension and health benefit system, saving New Jersey taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars and securing a fiscally responsible future for our state."
