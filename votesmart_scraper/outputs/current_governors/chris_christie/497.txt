Continuing to support Shore businesses preparing for the 2015 summer season, Governor Chris Christie signed Executive Order No. 174 allowing seasonal alcoholic beverage licensees to begin serving alcohol on March 1, two months ahead of the normal date of May 1. The advancement to March 1 will allow shore businesses to open early and spur economic activity along the Jersey Shore.
"The extensions over the last two years have allowed businesses to expeditiously recover from Sandy, recoup Sandy-related losses, and further the Jersey Shore's rebuilding efforts." said Governor Christie. "Helping Sandy-damaged Shore businesses get back to full strength has been a top priority of my Administration, and we've been working closely with the business community along the Shore to hear their needs and concerns. Because of the additional support and relief these businesses saw from extending the seasonal alcohol license in the last two years, we will once again advance the start date and allow these businesses to open early and welcome customers ahead of the summer tourism season."
Under the provision of the Executive Order for calendar year 2015, the date on which seasonal alcoholic beverage consumption licensees shall be permitted to commence serving alcoholic beverages shall be advanced from May 1, 2015 to March 1, 2015 and shall end on November 14, 2015.
This is the third year Governor Christie has extended the term of seasonal alcoholic beverage licenses.
