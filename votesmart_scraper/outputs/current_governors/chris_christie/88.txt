Unfortunately, the work of DCF is usually only heard about broadly in the public when something goes wrong. We don't have, like every 60 days, a story on TV or in the newspapers that say, another 60 days of extraordinary work, where children were protected and families were put back together. Let's take a moment to highlight five or 10 or those success stories. No, no, no. The only time we ever read or hear about it is when something goes wrong. Either something that went wrong that was unavoidable, but the people in the peanut gallery will snipe and say why it was avoidable, or when there is an actual mistake made by somebody who works with us every day. In either instance, two bad things arise out of that. Not only the result from the incident, but also, it tends to color people's view of the work that you do here into one very narrow circumstance, and that's why I'm here today. Yes, the federal monitor's report from 10 days ago and all the different achievements that you've gotten under the belt, are not the only motivation for me being here today. It is the last seven years of work. Work that this administration inherited, but that we have absolute responsibility for. You can't always only take responsibility for the good things. You've got to take responsibility for the difficult things and try to be part of fixing it.
