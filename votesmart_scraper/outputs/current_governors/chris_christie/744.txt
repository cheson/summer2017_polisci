Governor Christie: I was saying to my staff yesterday in the Sandy meeting, you know, come next Tuesday we've only got about 1,400 days to go as Governor, so we got plenty of time to get this job done, and we're going to get it done, and a lot sooner than 1,400 days, but let me tell you: that is my focus. My focus is you all gave me a resounding vote of support on November 5th. You asked me, and I accepted, the task of leading this state for eight years, not four years, and no one I can assure you ever told me or anybody on my team that it was going to be easy. It hadn't been up to this point, and there's all kinds of challenges as you know that come every day out of nowhere to test you. But, I want to ensure the people of New Jersey of one thing: I was born here, I was raised here, I'm raising my family here, and this is where I intend to spend the rest of my life. And whatever test they put in front of me, I will meet those tests because I'm doing it on your behalf. So, thank you all very much for being here.
