Governor Christie: On every level this is an obscenity. We're paying a king's ransom for a lousy education. We're lying to families that in the main are underprivileged, and we're denying these children a chance at a better life, to a better education, and at the same time we are absolutely fleecing you.
Because you're sending more of your income tax dollars to failing school districts, and because you're getting less to your school district, you're having to pay even more in property taxes than you otherwise should. And, by the way, the bloated governments in these Abbott districts aren't saving money for their districts because we're sending them so much. No, remember, they're only paying 25% of their property taxes towards education, where's the other 75% going? 75% is going to local and county government, you aren't even saving them money in the process. For 30 years, the Supreme Court has foisted upon us a failed theory, which is more money equals better results. Well everybody, we don't have to theorize about this anymore.
We've had 30 years of evidence, and the education in the main with the exception of 4 of the 31 districts is just as bad or worse today than it was 30 years ago. Only 4 of the 31 districts have graduation rates at or above the state average, the other 27 are below, and often, as in Asbury Park, well below the state average. This experiment has failed, yet we have been conditioned by the educational establishment in this state to believe that if we ever talk about less money rather than more, new rules, new ways of teaching, new ways of approaching this rather than the old ways, that we are anti-teacher, that we're anti-student. What could be more anti-student than this system?
