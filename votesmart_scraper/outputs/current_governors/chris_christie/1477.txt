At the time Chris became US Attorney, our nation had just endured the horror of September 11th, 2001, and nearly everyone thought we were vulnerable to additional attacks. Working with partners in federal and local law enforcement, Chris and his team foiled additional terrorist plots aimed at killing innocent New Jerseyans.
One of the more notable cases involved the Fort Dix Six, where Chris and his team stopped a group of would-be terrorists from storming Fort Dix and killing our servicemen and women. They will now be sentenced to life in prison.
Another noteworthy case occurred when Chris and his team tracked a would-be arms dealer and terrorist trying to buy and sell arms for attacks against the United States. The terrorist was intending to acquire shoulder-fired rocket launchers to take down commercial airliners leaving Newark Airport. Thankfully, the plot was disrupted, and the would-be terrorist was thrown in jail for nearly 50 years.
