"How much do you want to bet that the day after the elections this November, no matter how they turn out, we will see an enormous Democratic push for an increase in the gas tax. I have a warning for all of them. I will consider any option that's presented to me as long as those options include tax fairness for the people of New Jersey. Tax fairness for the people of New Jersey. Republicans should not be giving away any votes for an increase in the gas tax. None, zero. Unless, whatever is presented represents tax fairness for the people of New Jersey and your point on estate and inheritance taxes is incredibly important. We lose thousands, thousands, and tens of thousands of citizens every year as they age because they say to me, what friends of my parents said to me few years ago. It's not that I can't afford to live here, I can't afford to die here. And this affects business, as you know, in a material way but our sales taxes is too high in this state, in terms of being competitive across the country. Why isn't it true that in New Jersey you can deduct charitable contributions from the income tax? There's a lot of things that we should be talking about to represent tax fairness in this state, but we don't get any of those conversations from Democrats because they only know one thing to do with taxes and that's to raise them. So get ready for the post November period because there will be some unwise interest groups this state, who and who already have, jumped the gun on this issue. I know who I represent, I represent the taxpayers of New Jersey, the people who pay the bills and who played by the rules and they forget that in Trenton. These Democratic legislators in particular forget who it is they represent. I haven't."
