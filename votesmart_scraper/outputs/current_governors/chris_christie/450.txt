Gov. Christie On Common Core: We Don't Have Buy In From Educators Or Parents

Governor Christie: No, it's a recognition of what I've heard across the state for the better part of the last two years. For the better part of the last two years, you've been to many of my town halls meetings during the time, Christine, and you know at most of those town hall meetings we have someone stand up and complain about Common Core - parents, educators, who are concerned about it. I felt like we had to give it a fair chance, I think we did. We've given it a four year chance. We don't have buy in from parents, we don't have buy in from educators. They feel as if it's been imposed upon them from Washington, that their voice hasn't been heard and if you're going to have the best local education you can have, you have to have your local educators and those families buying into what you're trying to do. And so I think what I've done is more fair than what anybody else has done, some people just reflexively oppose things. I wanted to give things a chance to work when it has shown that it can't, if you don't then change, then you're just being stubborn. I don't get paid, at least not all the time, to be stubborn. So I am not being stubborn on this and as I walked in here today I had two or three different parents come up to me and say thank you for getting rid of common core. And so, no decision you make in this regard, especially regarding our education of our children, because it's an emotional issue, no decision you make will ever be universally popular. So the answer is, that's the reason I did it, not for other reasons.
