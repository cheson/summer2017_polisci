Governor Christie: I want you to know that I have a group of people standing behind me, many of whom have since left government, but that is almost the entire Sandy executive team that we put together on the day of the storm. All of them here today, many of them travelled from different parts of the country to be here today, because of how important this is. All the things that we accomplished in Sandy couldn't be done without the local officials, and the county officials in this area and the others that were affected, and they deserve great credit. But I can tell you that everything that the state did to interact with the federal government, to fight to get the money here to rebuild our state, and then to make sure that that money was spent in a way that did rebuild our state, was accomplished because of the leadership of the men and women standing behind me. They worked 18 to 20 hour days for weeks and weeks after Sandy, didn't go home to see their families most of the time, and just asked what's next, what's next, what's next? Because what we saw in front of us was an enormous task, but more importantly what we saw was a group of New Jerseyans who were down but not out, and we needed to get our hands around them and help to lift them up and bring it back. And this roller coaster, in the same way that the Jet Star was the iconic symbol of what happened here during Superstorm Sandy, the Hydrus is now going to be forever the iconic symbol of the comeback of the Jersey Shore from Hurricane Sandy.
