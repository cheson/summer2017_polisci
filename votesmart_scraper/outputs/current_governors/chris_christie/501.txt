The numbers do not lie and let me tell you this, we don't need any court to tell us we have a serious problem. I have stood behind this podium for five years talking about this problem, candidly and openly. And as a result we acted in 2011 to acknowledge and begin to repair of this serious problem. Now we have a bipartisan reform plan which can, once and for all, fix this problem. No one branch of government can wish or order the problem away. We must do it together. And together, I know we can get this done. We have proven time and again that even when we look like we're not going to make it work and that politics and partisan interests have won out, we flip the script. We do it differently. We get it done. I am committed to working with each and every one of you in good faith to make a promise to the people of this state that we will not push this off...we will not leave it for another day... for another year... for another generation. We will tackle this problem now and we will solve it. That is what real leadership produces for the people who sent us here. Real leadership produced the 2011 reforms on both sides of the aisle, which took our system off life support. That was a success. Those reforms were in the best interest of all New Jerseyans when we passed them. The steps we've taken since then have been reasonable, necessary and in the interests of our citizens as well. Adopting the reform plan roadmap agreed to by the Commission and the NJEA by June will return the system to health.
