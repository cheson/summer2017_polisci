"This month we celebrate the enormous contributions made by one of our State's fastest-growing communities, our Asian American and Pacific Islander residents. New Jersey's Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders - through their diversity of language, culture, and background -- have consistently given their talents to strengthen our communities, businesses, and civic society.
