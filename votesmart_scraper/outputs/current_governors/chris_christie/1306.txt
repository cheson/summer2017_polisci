Statement from Governor Chris Christie on Cap 2.0
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: July 12, 2010
Location: Trenton, NJ

Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement:
"Thanks to the quick action taken last week by the Senate and today by the Assembly, New Jersey families can finally look forward to the kind of real, long-term property tax relief that Trenton has failed to deliver for decades. A hard cap of 2 percent with limited exceptions that puts final authority to exceed the cap in the hands of the people is the substantial and sustainable reform New Jersey needs. I thank Senate President Steve Sweeney, Minority Leader Tom Kean, Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver and Minority Leader Alex DeCroce for taking action and passing this bill; and I look forward to continuing to work with each of them and members of both parties in the legislature to enact the necessary tool kit reforms to control costs and empower local governments to effectively manage under this new cap."
