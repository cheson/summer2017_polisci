Governor Christie Signs Bipartisan Measure To Strengthen New Jersey's Tough Gun Laws
Press Release

Location: Trenton, NJ

Strengthening New Jersey's already-tough guns laws, Governor Christie today signed a bipartisan measure that codifies existing state guidelines into law for reporting of firearms seized from criminals, recovered in criminal investigations or found abandoned or discarded.
The bill, A-3797, includes the full recommended changes the Governor submitted to the Legislature in his conditional veto last month. His changes called for the codification of these regulations to bring the bill in line with federal law. Without these improvements, the bill would have violated federal law under the Tiahrt Amendments.
"I'm glad the Legislature acted swiftly to incorporate my commonsense changes so that I can sign this bill and responsibly strengthen New Jersey's already-tough gun laws," said Governor Christie. "This new law will help state and federal law enforcement officials stop guns from getting into the hands of criminals, and help maintain public safety."
According to The Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence, New Jersey's existing gun laws are currently ranked as the second-toughest in the nation and include an assault weapons ban, a seven-day waiting period and the second-strictest magazine limit in the country. Additionally, thorough background checks already exist for individuals wishing to purchase a firearm.
Separately, Governor Christie also signed Bill A-4149, which adopted the Governor's recommendations to authorize the New Jersey Racing Commission to grant a special permit for horse racing on the beach.
