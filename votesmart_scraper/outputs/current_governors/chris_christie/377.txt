Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement today in honor of Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day:
"Seventy-four years ago, the attack on Pearl Harbor shattered our Nation's domestic tranquility but strengthened our unity and resolve against forces of oppression and hate. In the aftermath of the attack, thousands of brave Americans responded to the call of duty and enlisted in the Armed Forces to fight in defense of our country. Today we honor those courageous Americans who fought and died on that December day as well as all of the other service members who lost their lives during World War II to defend our freedoms. Let us remember and honor their sacrifice as well as the sacrifice of all those who continue to fight for and protect our freedoms at home and abroad today. "
Governor Christie also proclaimed today "Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day" throughout New Jersey.
