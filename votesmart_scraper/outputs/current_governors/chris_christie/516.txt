The critical measure of success for any growth plan is people going to work at jobs worth doing. Today, though, there are too many federal policies which discourage work. America must reduce the marginal cost to the employee of taking a job, and reduce the federally-imposed cost to an employer of hiring someone.

Governor Christie proposes eliminating the payroll tax for those above age 62, as well as for those newly entering the workforce, below age 25. This will encourage those nearing retirement to keep working should they want to, and make it easier for the young to enter the workforce. Both will be good for America. He will also repeal Obamacare's 30-Hour Workweek mandate which has been a clear contributor to the massive shift from full time to part time employment under this president.
