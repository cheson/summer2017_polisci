Governor Chris Christie Reacts to COAH Court Decision
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: Oct. 8, 2010
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement today regarding COAH:

"Today's court decision on COAH reinforces how imperative it is for the Legislature to immediately follow my recommendations and bring to an end this hopelessly complex and outdated system. In February, I signed an Executive Order convening a task force to study this issue, and its report was delivered in March. Since then, the Legislature has continued to drag its heels and the Assembly has refused to act. The decision today makes clear that delay is not an option and it is time for the Legislature to move quickly to pass reform and eliminate COAH once and for all.

"I am committed to ensuring compliance with constitutional requirements in a manner that is as efficient and effective as possible and is not a burden on New Jersey communities and taxpayers. Unfortunately, today's court decision will only lead to additional expenditures of limited resources by the State and our municipalities. As today's decision notes, COAH spent $2 million on a methodology to revise its own rules only to have those rules overturned by the courts. Not one additional dollar should be spent to continue this failed process. The State Assembly needs to take up and act now on legislation to eliminate COAH."
