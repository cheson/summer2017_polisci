Statement

Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Christie: Today I'm really happy to announce the distribution of another 132 HMGP grants that will assist homeowners with the costs incurred in elevating their homes to protect against future flooding and storms. In this latest round of grants, FEMA approved applications from the DEP for properties in 29 municipalities in Atlantic County, Monmouth County and Ocean County. The first round of awards was approved in April for 26 homeowners in Brigantine in Atlantic County and subsequent grant awards have been awarded to property owners in seven other counties, bringing the total to 460 property owners and about 12 million dollars in grant awards. Bob Martin, the DEP Commissioner, and his staff have submitted more than 1,200 post Sandy elevation applications to FEMA and we expect more approvals from FEMA in the very near future. In fact, the Commissioner and I will continue to press FEMA to get more grants out as quickly as possible so that families still recovering from Sandy can put their lives back together. By helping people to elevate their homes, they can literally raise their homes out of harm's way.
