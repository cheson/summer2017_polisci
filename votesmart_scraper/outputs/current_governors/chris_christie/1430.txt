The two men trying to unseat Gov. Jon Corzine faced off without him today in a forum that featured sharp exchanges over taxes and sincerity.
Republican Chris Christie and independent Chris Daggett fielded questions from editors of Gannett New Jersey newspapers in a live forum shown online. Corzine, citing scheduling conflicts, declined to appear.
With an empty chair meant to represent Corzine between them, Christie and Daggett both criticized the Democratic governor's record on the economy, higher education and other areas. But the most heat came when they tore into one another's financial prescriptions for the state -- illustrating the headache Daggett has become for Christie, whose comfortable lead over Corzine has evaporated as Daggett claimed more support.
Christie repeatedly criticized Daggett for saying he would consider raising taxes -- including the gas tax -- while Daggett slammed Christie as "intellectually dishonest" and lacking plans of his own.
Christie was quick to characterize Daggett's biggest proposal -- to cut property taxes 25 percent by extending the sales tax to a broader array of legal and household services -- as a tax increase. Christie also said he doubts that "the numbers work" and that Daggett will be able to raise his projected $4 billion through the sales tax.
