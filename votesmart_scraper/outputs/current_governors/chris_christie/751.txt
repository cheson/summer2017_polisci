It's no accident how we got to this place today, no accident at all. We chose -- we chose the way. And in this new year and in the next four years, we need to build on this momentum by creating a new attitude: we need to create an attitude of choice. An attitude of choice is not about choosing everything; it's not about saying yes to everyone; it is about us setting our priorities and choosing to invest in New Jersey where it matters and to put in place the reforms and reductions that will make that possible. And the best part of our turnaround in these past four years is because we have chosen to work together. Let's take a moment -- these are our achievements. Four balanced budgets. Passed with bipartisan support. Pension reform. Passed with bipartisan support. Teacher tenure reform. Passed with bipartisan support. A cap on property taxes. Passed with bipartisan support. We acted and we acted together.
