In honor of Memorial Day, Governor Chris Christie released the following statement:
"Today, we pause to remember the brave men and women who paid the ultimate price protecting our nation's freedom. While we can never come close to fully repaying these heroes for their sacrifice, it is our solemn obligation to take care of our veterans and their families when they return home from war. On this Memorial Day, I encourage all New Jerseyans to join me in honoring the courageous members of the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and National Guard. It is because of their service that America remains free and a beacon of strength, courage and freedom across the globe."
