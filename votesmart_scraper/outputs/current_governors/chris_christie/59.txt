I'm happy today to be able to stand here after having worked with all of these people who are standing with me that to say that we've met one of New Jersey's great economic challenges for our future and I know the people who are employed today are grateful and even more importantly for all of you, you know there are going to be people coming behind you, additional people working in our ports, additional people working not only with you but that this industry will continue to remain a vital part of New Jersey's economy and this region's economy now for the foreseeable future with our ability now to repair this bridge and to make sure that commerce continues to move from all over the world right here into New Jersey. So there couldn't be a higher priority for me than to get this done. I'm glad that we've done so.
