Today we are also going further to reform our criminal justice system by signing legislation that continues with our promise and commitment to give people a second chance. You've seen it through the work we are doing in drug rehabilitation across the state. This is a state that believes that every life is precious and that no life is beyond salvation, that everyone deserves a second chance in New Jersey, if they've made a mistake. So, today, we are banning the box and ending employment discrimination. And this is going to make a huge difference for folks who have paid their debts to society, who want to start their lives over again and are going to have an opportunity to do just that in our state. That's what people want and it's what they except and it's what they deserved from those of us they entrust with public office.
