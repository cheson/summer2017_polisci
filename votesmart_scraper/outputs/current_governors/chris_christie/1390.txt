Location: Trenton, NJ

Today Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement on the latest New Jersey unemployment figures:
"Although slightly more positive, the drop in the unemployment rate is cold comfort to too many New Jersey residents who remain unemployed," said Governor Chris Christie. "Our goal is to foster a business climate where payrolls expand, where we finally round the corner in this recession, and turn this dip in unemployment into a positive, continuous trend. These are challenging times, as our budget next week will confirm. But it is my sincere belief that our policies and reforms will lay the groundwork for private sector growth and responsible government spending and taxation."
