Statement from Governor Chris Christie Regarding Supreme Court Decision on Affordable Care Act
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: June 28, 2012
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie released the following statement regarding today's decision:
"I've been clear from the very beginning that I do not believe a one-size-fits-all health care program works for the entire country and that each governor should have the ability to make decisions about what works best for their state. Today's Supreme Court decision is disappointing and I still believe this is the wrong approach for the people of New Jersey who should be able to make their own judgments about health care. Most importantly, the Supreme Court is confirming what we knew all along about this law -- it is a tax on middle class Americans."
