Advancing his commitment to streamline government and remove duplication, redundancies and bureaucracy, Governor Chris Christie signed an Executive Order eliminating 60 State boards and commissions that were found through a thorough review to be expired, inactive, non-operational or otherwise defunct.
"The councils, commissions and boards targeted for elimination have quite frankly outlived their usefulness," said Governor Christie. "Removing this bureaucratic clutter is central to the process of administration's goal of cutting overlapping, redundant or useless layers of government, streamlining operations, and reducing red tape. My administration will continue working diligently to rein in the growth of state government and ensure that it operates as efficiently as possible and in the best interests of our citizens."

Further, Governor Christie also welcomed the report of the Cabinet's recommendations submitted in accordance with Executive Order 15, which directed a Cabinet-level review of all authorities, boards and commissions to determine whether each entity should continue or cease to exist. The review resulted in recommendations to eliminate approximately 250 entities and over 60 additional recommendations for mergers. The Governor will review the Cabinet's recommendations and propose legislation to eliminate or merge boards and commissions that were created by statute.
The report outlining the findings of the EO 15 review and recommendations can be found in PDF format on the Governor's website here: http://www.nj.gov/governor/news/reports/pdf/20100909_EO15DeptRecommendations.pdf.
The actions taken in Executive Order 15 represent critical steps towards ensuring fiscal responsibility and streamlining government. In addition to directing a comprehensive review of all state authorities, boards and commissions, EO 15 took immediate action to reform abusive fiscal practices at those entities by strictly limiting the hiring of lobbyists, eliminating "golden parachutes" to departing executives and employees and capping travel expenses at $250.
