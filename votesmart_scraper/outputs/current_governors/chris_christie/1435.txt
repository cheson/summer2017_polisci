Today, Chris Christie released the following statement on New Jersey's ballooning unemployment rate:
"Today's unemployment numbers prove Governor Corzine has failed our state in exactly the area we were told to trust him the most. His unsustainably high taxes, increased debt and irresponsible spending have driven jobs out of New Jersey forcing record numbers of people out of work. His Wall Street borrow and spend budget gimmicks have failed. It is time for him to go."
