Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statement in honor and remembrance of Americans taken as Prisoners of War or Missing in Action and their families:
"Today, on National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we honor the servicemembers who have been imprisoned while serving our country and those who never returned home and remain missing. We also keep their families, who have waited and remain waiting for their loved ones in the most difficult and uncertain of times, in our thoughts. While we can never repay the sacrifices of the men and women of our Armed Forces for protecting us both at home and abroad, we thank them today for their service and renew our resolve to account for our United States servicemembers still missing from past wars and conflicts."
