Governor Chris Christie Releases Transitional Aid Funds
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: Aug. 29, 2016
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today ordered the immediate release of all transitional aid funds that were temporarily reserved under Executive Order No. 209 to maintain a fiscally responsible, balanced Fiscal Year 2017 State Budget.
"I am pleased the State Health Benefits Plan Design Committee voted to approve common sense health plan savings that begin to address the $250 million budget deficit resulting from growing state health care costs," Governor Christie said. "As a result of the savings gained today, I am immediately directing Local Government Services to release all Fiscal Year 2017 Transitional Aid funds."
The Committee's action will result in significant savings for taxpayers and participating state & local employees.
Until additional savings are enacted, previously reserved Legislative funds will remain held.
State employee health care benefits cost state taxpayers over $3.25 billion annually. EO-209 was issued in direct response to the Legislature's inability to responsibly budget for the State's existing health care costs and force the enactment of common sense, reasonable health benefit reforms. To address the Legislature's irresponsible spending plan, the EO placed tens of millions of dollars in budget appropriations in fiscal reserve, including FY17 Transitional Aid funds.
