You are an inspiration to us. You're an inspiration to us because in you we see all that the future of our country can be. In you, we see the infinite possibilities that exist in a human mind that's challenged and taught and maximized. In you, most importantly, we see the infinite possibilities of the human spirit, that all of you, with a good heart, caring about not only yourselves but your neighbors, your friends, and your family, can make our country a better place.
