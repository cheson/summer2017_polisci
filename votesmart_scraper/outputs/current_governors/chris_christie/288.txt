In recognition of Holocaust Remembrance Day (Yom HaShoah), Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement:
"As New Jerseyans solemnly mark Holocaust Remembrance Day, we pause to pay tribute to the memory of the innocent victims persecuted and killed by the Nazis before and during World War II. At this time of remembrance, we reflect on the more than six million Jewish lives taken in the Shoah, the survivors who experienced such unthinkable tragedy and persevered to rebuild their lives and share their stories throughout the world, and all who fought and died to liberate the world from the Nazi regime. Today gives us an opportunity to remember this dark time in history, honor the memories of those lost, and reaffirm our promise to never allow such atrocities to happen again."
Governor Christie also proclaimed May 2016 as "Jewish American Heritage Month" throughout New Jersey.
