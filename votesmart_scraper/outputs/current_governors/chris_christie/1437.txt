Earlier this week, Jon Corzine could not have made it clearer how completely out of touch he is with the struggles of real New Jerseyans when he released an ad claiming to have led New Jersey to economic recovery. However, the reality of the economic troubles faced by families throughout our state simply does not bear out these claims.
Today, the United States Census Bureau released a report which shows the devastating truth about the state of New Jersey's economy. According to the report, New Jersey's median household income declined by $7,214 from 2005-2006 to 2007-2008, the nation's largest dollar decrease.
Chris Christie stated: "As if the 9.3 percent unemployment rate and 43 percent spike in home foreclosures was not enough evidence, the devastating drop in New Jerseyans' income clearly refutes Jon Corzine's claims of economic recovery for our state. It is clear that Corzine has failed us. Jon Corzine's out of touch claims are insulting to those families whose livelihoods are being drained."
