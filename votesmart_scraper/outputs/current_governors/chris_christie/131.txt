Governor Christie: The rest of our nation in its pockets of other 49 states are not as diverse as we are and there are those who have hate in their hearts based upon many many different factors, but none of them are justified. And if we don't stand up and speak out, not only about the fact that any type of bias act is intolerable, but to also speak about the opposite side of how much this diversity brings to life's experiences, how much better it makes us as a people, how much better it makes us as parents to have experienced all this as children. We will stand up and fight the fights that need to be fought but we also need to raise our voices in the celebration of what a place like this means to becoming a fuller and better human being. You see, in New Jersey we have learned over our lifetimes, that this diversity is part of what makes this place so special and what makes our experience different than many other experiences around the rest of even this diverse nation. And so as Governor, we will continue to speak out. Our Attorney General is aggressively enforcing the law that Senator Menendez referenced and we now have a $10,000 rewards available for any leads that lead us to the violation of bias crimes and anyone in this state who commits that type of crime will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent to prison.
