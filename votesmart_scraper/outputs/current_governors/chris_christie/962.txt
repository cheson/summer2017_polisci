Governor Chris Christie released the following statement regarding today's bipartisan, decisive and overwhelming passage of a constitutional amendment to restore common sense to judicial pensions:
"Rarely has the public seen such unanimity between the legislative and executive branches that the judicial branch was dead wrong. I congratulate the legislature for their decisive, bipartisan action that lives up to the promise of our historical pension and benefit reform by making sure everyone is treated fairly. I pledge to do all I can this fall to ensure passage of this amendment to our constitution and truly believe that New Jersey voters will deliver the same message of fairness to the judiciary as well."
