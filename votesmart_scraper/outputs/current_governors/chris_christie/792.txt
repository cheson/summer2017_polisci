Bipartisanship was the theme for the night.
Republican Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic state senator and Union City Mayor Brian Stack sat side-by-side Thursday evening as they took calls from Hudson County and Union City residents in a tele-town hall meeting. 
But unlike Christie's usual town halls, Thursday's campaign event centered on one central theme: Bipartisanship. 
"Leadership is about getting things done and not going backwards to the day partisanship dominated our state," he said. "I want to thank Brian for his friendship and his partnership." 
What are your thoughts governor, [a] caller asked, about the government shutdown and dysfunction in Washington, D.C.?
Christie didn't skip a beat.
"It is a failure of government for government to shut down," said Christie, declaring "it's the failure of both parties" that led to the federal government being forced to shut down non-essential services. 
Stack agreed.
"It's not about Republican. It's not about Democrat," he said.
