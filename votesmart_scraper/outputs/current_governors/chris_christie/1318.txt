Governor Chris Christie today announced that he has ordered a Special Joint Session of the Legislature to immediately address his Cap 2.5 Reform Agenda to provide real, immediate and lasting relief to the highest property taxes in the nation faced by New Jersey families and businesses.
"New Jersey residents have waited far too long for property tax relief. New Jersey families pay an average $7,281 in property taxes, up 70 percent in just 10 years," said Governor Christie. "The time to act is now. We can no longer afford to wait for real, sustainable property tax relief. That is why I have determined that the public interest requires this special session."
Acting under his authority in Article V, Section 1, Paragraph 12 and Article IV, Section 1, Paragraph 4 of the New Jersey Constitution, Governor Christie notified the leadership of the Senate and Assembly tonight in a letter that a Special Joint Session of the Legislature should be convened this Thursday, July 1, 2010 at 10:00 a.m.
In addition to considering the proposed the Cap 2.5 and constitutional amendment for placement on the ballot for the November General Election, Governor Christie has also ordered the special session to address the thirty-three legislative proposals to reduce costs at the municipal, school and higher education levels.
