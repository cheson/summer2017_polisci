ICYMI: Governor Christie Reserves Certain Transitional Aid, Legislative Spending Under EO-209
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: July 1, 2016
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie has ordered certain spending items to be temporarily reserved under Executive Order No. 209 to maintain a fiscally responsible, balanced Fiscal Year 2017 State Budget.
EO-209 was issued yesterday in response to the Legislature's inability to responsibly budget for the State's existing health care costs or force the enactment of common sense, reasonable health benefit reforms. To address the Legislature's irresponsible spending plan, the attached Executive Order immediately places tens of millions of dollars in budget appropriations in fiscal reserve, starting with the following:
* One-half or approximately $53.68 million of the Fiscal Year 2017 Transitional Aid account, from which 13 municipalities received funds in Fiscal Year 2016; and
* Legislative Democrat extra spending, equaling $45.38 million.
"Failure to exercise any of these powers risks the State potentially lacking resources necessary to maintain a responsible fund balance while providing for essential State services and basic operations of State government for Fiscal Year 2017, potentially causing immediate adverse impacts on the residents of the State," Governor Christie said."The legislative majority wants to thoughtlessly spend down the State's surplus by $160 million. Worse, however, is their shameless inclusion of a $250 million phantom savings in public employee and retiree health care costs, which I called for in February but the Legislature did absolutely nothing to embrace, negotiate or achieve. Those "savings' were penciled in on paper but completely nonexistent."
