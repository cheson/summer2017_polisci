Statement by Chris Christie Regarding Governor Corzine's Commitment to High Taxes
Today, Chris Christie issued a statement regarding the recent vetoing of the Pemberton Borough School District's proposed budget because it reduced taxes below a state-required minimum. The change would have lowered the town's local school tax rate by 26 cents, saving average property owners about $293 on their tax bills.

Christie said, "It's not enough for Governor Corzine that New Jersey tax rates are among the highest in the country, he's also hard at work making sure that local governments who want to lower taxes in their community are penalized. The Pemberton Borough School Board has done what Governor Corzine has failed to do - they used fiscal responsibility and careful budgeting to lower taxes this year. Instead of rewarding Pemberton for their efforts, Governor Corzine would rather punish them. This is emblematic of the backwards fiscal policies of the seven years of the Corzine/McGreevey Administration, and one I will permanently end as Governor."
