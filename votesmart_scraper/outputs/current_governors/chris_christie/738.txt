Governor Christie: We Have To Be Willing To Play Outside The Red And Blue Boxes

Governor Christie: One of the lessons that I've learned most acutely over the last four years is that New Jersey can really be one state. Now, this election has taught us that the ways we divide each other - by race, by class, by ethnicity, by wealth, and yes, by political party is neither permanent nor necessary. You see our dreams are the same: a good job, a great education for our children, safe streets in our neighborhood and core values which give our lives real meaning. Those dreams are not unique to any one group in our state. And, while government has a role in ensuring the opportunity to accomplish these dreams, we have now learned that we have an even bigger role to play as individual citizens. We have to be willing to play outside the red and blue boxes that the media pundits put us in; we have to be willing to reach out to others who look or speak differently than us; we have to be willing to personally reach out a helping hand to a neighbor or a friend suffering from drug addiction, or depression or the dignity stripping loss of a job. New Jersey came together as one community when it mattered most and now we must stay together -- people of every background and belief - the government and our people - to help our fellow citizens reach their dreams.
