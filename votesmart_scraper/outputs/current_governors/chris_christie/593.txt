This month provides us with an opportunity to focus on the many Hispanic Americans whose lives have shaped our communities throughout our State and Nation's history.

During this Hispanic Heritage month, I encourage all New Jerseyans to join me in honoring the impact of the Hispanic Community in our State and the role they play in contributing to our rich diversity, now and in the future."
