Today, Chris Christie released the following statement on Jon Corzine's failure of leadership during New Jersey's unemployment crisis:
"Jon Corzine's campaign photo-op today means nothing for the near 200,000 New Jerseyans who have lost their jobs in the last year and have been struggling to make ends meet. Today's efforts are too little too late considering Jon Corzine stood by and did nothing as the unemployment rate rose drastically from 5.5 percent last year to 9.3 percent today and New Jersey continues to have the highest home foreclosure rate in the region. We need to put an end to Jon Corzine's failed economic policies and high taxes if we're going to turn around the hostile business climate in New Jersey . An election year band-aid is not going to fix New Jersey's economic problems or create long-term, good-paying jobs."
