Governor Christie: Do You Want To Do Something Or Be Something?

I've said this before and it's never been truer than it is right now when you look at the dysfunctional mess that Washington, DC has become. There are two types of people that get into public life: those who want to do something and those who want to be something. DC politicians spend weeks posturing and dithering while the important issues facing our county continue to fester, only to leave for summer recess and their campaign cycle having done nothing for their constituents. And this is the fault of both parties. Meanwhile, here in New Jersey, we're continuing to show that you can do things differently. Five years later, we're still putting up with each other and we're still able to come together and do our jobs when we need to. Under these reforms, our justice system will be both more effective in protecting our communities from dangerous, violent repeat-offenders and fairer to those non-violent offenders who do not deserve to sit in what has become the equivalent of debtors' prison because they can't afford to post the bail.
