Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie announced today that the State is seeking a Major Disaster Declaration under the federal Stafford Act for three Shore counties that sustained in excess of $32 million in damages caused by a severe Nor' Easter from October 1, 2015 through October 4, 2015. A letter outlining the State's request for a Major Disaster Declaration for Cape May, Monmouth and Ocean counties, was sent to President Barack Obama through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
"This storm has put a severe strain on State, county and local resources," said Governor Christie. "Based on the information collected and provided through preliminary and final joint damage assessments, I have determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response through federal assistance is necessary to supplement the efforts and available resources of the State, county and local governments, and disaster relief organizations. I am specifically requesting Public Assistance for the counties of Cape May, Monmouth and Ocean."
