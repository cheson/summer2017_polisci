Statement from Chris Christie on Corzine Administration Waste of School Construction Funds
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: Sept. 10, 2009
Location: Parsippany, NJ

Today, Chris Christie stated the following regarding the Corzine Administration's mismanagement of school construction funds:
"While Jon Corzine poses for the cameras today, yet another photo op cannot hide the fact that the Corzine Administration has done nothing to recover the millions in wasted and misappropriated school construction funds, including $67 million that was spent to purchase lands already owned by the public. Governor Corzine has raised taxes on New Jerseyans with impunity, but has done nothing to reassure us that the money sent to Trenton is protected and used to help the citizens of our state. Governor Corzine's blind eye to waste is further evidence that he is out of touch with the struggles of New Jerseyans who are being stretched to their limits under the rising taxes levied under his failed leadership."
