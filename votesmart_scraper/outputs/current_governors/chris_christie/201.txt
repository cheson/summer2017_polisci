You will continue to see liberal editorial pages, and special interest groups yell and scream that they need more money. I can tell you after 7 years as Governor I have never met an interest group that didn't want more money in the budget, ever. No interest group has ever come into my office in 7 years and said to me, "Governor, this year in the budget, would you please reduce our funding? Please reduce our funding because we don't need as much as we had before and we believe that in the interest of the taxpayers of New Jersey, we'd like you to reduce our funding." 7 years, 7 budgets, it's never happened, it's not going to happen. I'm the one who has to say no, that's what you hired me to do is to decide when to say yes and when to say no. And I can guarantee you one thing when you say no, you are never popular with the group you say no to. And if you've now been saying no for seven years, that group is getting bigger. That's ok. I'm not running for anything. I don't care. Yeah, anymore that's right. And the fact is that I was never running for anything here again, I can't. So the fact is I am liberated from the normal constraints that are on politicians who have to worry about, well I don't know if I really want to say this out loud because if I do there might be enough people who don't like that that maybe I won't win the next time. Listen everybody, I got 61 percent of the vote last time as a Republican. It was the second largest percentage for a Republican for governor in the history of this state. I got nothing else to prove, except I got to finish the job.
