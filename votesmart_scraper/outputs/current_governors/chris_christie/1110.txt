Location: Trenton, NJ

Underscoring the Administration's commitment to quality health services for New Jersey's most vulnerable, Governor Chris Christie today kicked off National Health Center Week with a visit to the Southern Jersey Family Medical Center's (SJFMC) Burlington City Health Center.
"The Burlington City Health Center and all of our New Jersey community health centers are an essential part of our health safety net for those who otherwise would not have a medical home," said Governor Christie. "These centers offer affordable, high-quality care to residents and families in need. I am proud of the strong support my Administration has provided for community health centers in the budget -- $113 million in Medicaid and $46.4 million for the uninsured. With this assistance, we are making sure the people and communities who rely on these services lead healthy lives now and in the future."
The Governor also signed a proclamation recognizing this week as National Health Center Week in honor of the comprehensive medical and dental care community health centers have been providing for more than 40 years. The theme of this year's National Health Center Week is "Celebrating America's Health Centers: Serving Locally, Leading Nationally."
Burlington City Health Center, which handled more than 13,400 patient visits last year, is part of Southern Jersey Family Medical Centers, a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that offers health services at eight sites in Burlington, Atlantic and Salem counties. The SJFMC, including the Burlington site, has received a total of $4.1 million in state funds and $4.8 million in federal assistance this year. They also have received grants from the Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) for Fiscal Year 2012 totaling $1.1 million including:
* $650,000 for Access to Prenatal Care
* $265,750 for Diabetes Management
* $4,600 for Newborn Hearing Programs
* $220,500 for Oral Health Programs
Since 2010, the Christie Administration has maintained and increased support of New Jersey community health centers by $6.4 million. Statewide, more than 400,000 patients are treated each year in 20 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) with 103 satellite sites that provide dental, pediatrics and health care for both men and women. Seventy percent of those who receive health care in FQHCs are women and children. The total number of patient visits each year exceeds 1.3 million. Nearly half of the patients are on Medicaid and 42 percent are uninsured.
Throughout National Community Health Center Week, 50 free public events will be held throughout New Jersey including health fairs, health screenings, immunizations, open house tours, family activities, cookouts, receptions and award presentations.
* Today, Acting Health and Senior Services Commissioner Dr. Tina Tan joined the New Jersey Primary Care Association (NJPCA) for an awards ceremony for the centers at the Neighborhood Health Services Corporation in Plainfield.
* On Thursday, August 11, Dr. Carolyn Daniels, Executive Director of the Department of Health and Senior Services Office of Minority and Multicultural Health, will participate in Newark Community Health Center's Community Health and Patient Appreciation Day, which will feature health screenings, a healthy cookout and fitness demonstrations. This event runs from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 741 Broadway in Newark.
