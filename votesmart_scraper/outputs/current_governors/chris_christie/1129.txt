Governor Chris Christie:
Good Afternoon. For the second year in a row, I proposed a constitutionally balanced budget that reduced spending, didn't raise taxes and protected critical priorities for the people of New Jersey. It continued a marked departure from years past when establishment Trenton perpetuated irresponsible, autopilot spending that created a massive structural deficit and was ignorant to the devastating fiscal impact it was having on New Jersey's economic health.
The reality was that Trenton's spend at any cost mentality had allowed huge increases in state spending over the last eight years while recurring revenues continued to decline -- leading to a gigantic structural budget deficit. I was sent here in January of 2010 by the voters, in part, to solve this huge spending and debt problem.
The budget gaps I had to close for Fiscal Year 2010 and Fiscal Year 2011 totaled $13 billion. This action, combined with the adoption of landmark bipartisan legislation to reform interest arbitration, impose a two percent cap on local property tax increases, and reform the public employee pension and health benefits system, has meant real progress towards lasting fiscal discipline.
This year, unfortunately, the Democratic Legislature decided it was time to go back to the future. To revert to more of the same unrealistic, fantasy budgeting that has plagued Trenton for years and is the reason New Jersey got into fiscal trouble in the first place. They have decided to deceive the citizens of this state with a budget that makes them look like Santa Claus in an election year. How shocking--politicians deceiving and pandering to voters to get re-elected. I was sent here to end this politics as usual.
