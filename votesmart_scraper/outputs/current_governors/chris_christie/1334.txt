Statement from Governor Chris Christie on S-1
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: June 10, 2010
Location: Trenton, NJ

Today the Governor issued the following statement:
"The legislation passed by the Senate today eliminates COAH and goes a long way toward fundamentally reforming the affordable housing system which New Jerseyans have long demanded and that I have promised to deliver. We will continue to work with members of both parties in the legislature to bring the COAH nightmare to an end and replace a broken system with a common sense, predictable and achievable process. I want to thank Senators Lesniak, Bateman and Van Drew for their work on this issue and the Senate as a whole for the bipartisan support the bill received. I look forward to working with Assemblymen Green, Prieto and Rible to ensure sound and sensible affordable housing policy becomes law."
