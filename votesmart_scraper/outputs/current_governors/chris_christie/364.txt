Statement From Governor Christie On Legislation To Expand Gaming To North Jersey
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: Jan. 8, 2016
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie released the following statement on the legislature's competing bills to expand gaming to North Jersey:
"I have already clearly stated my support for the expansion of gaming to Northern New Jersey given the economic growth and job creation it will bring to our State. We should advance this item before the end of the legislative session. It is disturbing that infighting within the Democratic party over competing gaming bills may deprive the voters of the ability to consider this question in November. Right now, it appears that ACR-2 does not have sufficient support to move forward in the Assembly. If that is the case, inaction should not be an option. The only remaining course of action to put the ball in the end zone on this important issue is to post SCR-185 for a vote in the Assembly on Monday after its passage in the Senate. Delay puts the expansion of gaming in peril. That is not in the interests of anyone in New Jersey, North or South."
