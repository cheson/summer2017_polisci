Governor Christie: To the families here, I want to end by saying this. You all are heroes. As a father of four children, thank God to this point in my life I have not had to deal with this with one of my children, but who knows every day that that could change. You all are heroes because you didn't give up, you didn't give up on your child, you encouraged them, you stood by them, you kicked them in the butt when you needed to. You did the things you needed to do to try to give them another chance. You're the heroes of today, the parents and the family members who didn't give up. What I promise you is every day I have left as Governor I will not give up on all of you. We will do the things we need to do to tackle this disease and we won't solve it in the next few months but we'll get well on the road to giving people a greater chance to save their lives. Today, you all are the hope and the example of what a society can do when they say every life is precious, every life is an individual gift from God, no soul is beyond redemption, and no life is disposable. I believe that in my heart and you all are examples of that today.
