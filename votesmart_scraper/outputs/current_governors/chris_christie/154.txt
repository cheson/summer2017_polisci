Governor Christie: I also know, in my last year as governor that I won't get to see, during my time here, the fruits of all the things that we've invested but I'm not going anywhere. So I'll come back and we'll look at what we've done in higher education here and the difference that it makes, to go and see the new Camden High School when it's finished, to go and look at the waterfront development and see what that does to even in a bigger way revitalize the city, to look at what's being done in terms of education both at the undergraduate level and at the post-graduate level. And I was pleased to be here this last year for the first graduating class of our medical school in Camden, something that I know was a longtime dream of a lot of people that we've now seen realized. All of these things are going to lead to more citizens living in Camden, more folks working in Camden, and a better quality of life here. And it is unacceptable to me, it was unacceptable when I became governor to have this city, right across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, to have this city continue the state that it was in. But what I said to the leaders here was, you have to partner with me, there's going to be no more giveaways, no more we'll write you a check today and hope you use it responsibly. But let's partner together, both parties and the private sector to make this something worthwhile to invest in, make people believe that Camden is a city that's back on the rise and is worth investing in, worth raising a family in. And that's where I think we will be. It's where we're headed and I think inside the next three or four years that's exactly where we will be.
