Stressing the importance of shore protection to the vitality of the state's $35.5 billion tourism industry, its coastal communities and overall quality of life, Governor Chris Christie made stops in Manasquan and Seaside Heights today as part of his beach tour of Jersey shore towns.
"New Jersey's beach resources and shore towns are what make the Jersey shore the unique destination it is, and are the reason thousands of visitors return year after year," said Governor Christie. "As stewards of the environment, it is incumbent that we take all necessary measures to protect these treasures and to sustain our coastal communities and the diverse economies they support."
The Jersey shore has its own distinctive culture that reflects the uniqueness of its communities. Manasquan, for instance, is a popular shore getaway because of its mile-long oceanfront and open space areas that include fishing, wildlife sanctuaries and recreation. In contrast, Seaside Heights, with one of the busiest boardwalks along the Jersey coast, is a hub of activity with its amusements, arcades and traditional Jersey shore fare.
Protecting these resources -- from beaches and clean waterways to the diverse shore economy-- is paramount to sustaining the shore's unique characteristics. That's why Governor Christie has expressed his strong opposition to off-shore drilling in New Jersey, as well as drilling off the coast of other nearby states that could negatively impact the state's 130 miles of coastline and multi-billion dollar tourism industry. He has also opposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities off of the New Jersey coast and has also restored beach replenishment funding to its full level.
