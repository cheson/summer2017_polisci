Governor Christie wants faster action on a plan to curb the amount of New York City garbage trucks passing through New Jersey.

Christie called on the Port Authority Monday to move quicker on plans to barge New York's trash to New Jersey, and then ship the solid waste out-of-state by rail.

The Port Authority plans to build a barge-to-rail station in Jersey City by 2013 that would help replace 1,000 trash trucks that pass through New Jersey each day and spread "harmful emissions," Christie said.
Environmentalists applauded Christie's statements, calling for an end to New York City garbage trucks "traipsing all over New Jersey."

"This would also reduce global warming pollution, relieve traffic congestion and alleviate the heavy pounding on New Jersey roads," said David Pringle of the New Jersey Environmental Federation.

Christie said New Jersey's roads have been clogged by trash trucks for too long, "making the quality of life worse for all of our residents."

"But the Port Authority can act immediately by completing its purchase of this land, investing the resources needed to build a first-class operation, and moving waste off our roads and onto rail in sealed, safe containers," he said.
