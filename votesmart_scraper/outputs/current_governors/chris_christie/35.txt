Statement

Lou Cirigliano: Today we stand beneath Hydrus, and our Ferris wheel, on a new pier. Today, we have honored guests with us to officially commemorate the opening of this area, and the attractions. And today we declare the closing of the books of Superstorm Sandy, of that era, and saying loud and proud, Casino Pier is back, and we are stronger than the storm.
Governor Christie: This marks a closing in a chapter for this boardwalk, unfortunately, two parts of the chapter, both Superstorm Sandy and then the later fire. And to see this rebuilt, I want to tell you how important this is to me and to Mary Pat personally. I was here in the days after the storm, walked out with the family and their whole team to see the destruction that happened to this pier. And they told me that day that they were committed rebuilding if they were committed to partnering with them. And we said we would, and here we are four years later and this boardwalk looks better than it ever has. And as you can see from the people who are already here on the early afternoon on Friday, Memorial Day weekend, the Jersey Shore is back and better than ever, and we are so proud of everyone who has made it that way.
