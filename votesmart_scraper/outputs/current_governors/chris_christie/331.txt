We need people from every neighborhood in this state, every color, every race, every religion, to say it happens in our families too. So then it becomes everyone's problem, not someone else's problem, everyone's problem. And we need to acknowledge that. That will continue to lower stigma as well. Because if you think it is just in someone else's family, you can look askance at that, right? And say not good parents, not good whatever. Let me tell you, we know that is baloney. We know that every family in this state has been touched in some way by addiction. Whether it is a member of their family, a co-worker, a colleague, a neighbor, a more distant relative, we have all felt it and seen it. I have. Everyone else has. And so no one is above this problem. It is non-discriminatory. It is one of the ugly non-discriminatory things in our society, addiction. I cannot thank you enough for what you are doing. We need people to help each other and understand that it is all our problem. Because when a family breaks up, we the taxpayers, the citizens of this state step into that breach and we are not very good at it. Moms and dads are much better at it than government officials so let's do that.
