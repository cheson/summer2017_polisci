Governor Chris Christie Builds On Comprehensive Plan To Address Gun Violence, Takes Action On Gun Legislation
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: Aug. 8, 2013
Location: Trenton, NJ

Responsibly addressing gun violence in a comprehensive manner, Governor Christie today signed into law 10 pieces of gun violence and firearm-related legislation recently passed by the Legislature. These bills build on the plan Governor Christie introduced in April, as well as New Jersey's already strict gun laws, currently the second toughest in the nation.
"These commonsense measures will both strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws and upgrade penalties for those who commit gun crimes and violate gun trafficking laws," said Governor Christie. "As elected leaders, our first duty is to maintain public safety, and these new laws will help reduce gun violence and keep our streets and communities safer."
Governor Christie included a signing statement with Assembly Bill No. 3687, which prevents individuals on the federal Terrorist Watchlist from obtaining a firearms identification card or permit to purchase handgun. The Governor noted that the bill represents his "commitment to keeping the citizens of New Jersey safe," but also noted the federal government's obligation to protect law-abiding citizens against "improper scrutiny." In carrying out that balance, Governor Christie said, "the government must be circumspect in its application of the law. There is little room for mistakes since they may harm the innocent and law abiding."
