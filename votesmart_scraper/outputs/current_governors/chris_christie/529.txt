Protecting Health Benefits For Today's And Tomorrow's Seniors

Medicare spending growth is placing an inescapable burden on future generations and failing to produce high-quality health care results for our seniors. In order to make these programs fiscally solvent for future generations and improve the kind of health care services and treatment those utilizing these programs receive, Governor Christie proposes keeping it simple - if you can afford to pay more for your health benefits you will and if you can't, you won't. Governor Christie proposes expanding the existing sliding scale for Medicare premiums for higher-income seniors.
