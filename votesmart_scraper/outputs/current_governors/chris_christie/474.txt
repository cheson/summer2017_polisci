Governor Christie: I hope that we never see another Sandy. None of us ever want to go through what we went through in the aftermath of that storm, but we got to prepare for the possibility that it will happen and that's what this is all about, all across the state. So I'll end by saying how much I appreciate the resiliency of the people of Union Beach. I've been in your community when you were helping each other demolish homes. I've been in the community when you were together helping to rebuild those homes, among lots of other charitable organizations who were coming here to help the neighbors and friends inside Union Beach rebuild those homes. And I've been there to watch people have that look on their face when they come back in to a restored home where they and their family can live again. We're not done yet, but all those particular moments we should remember. Those are all mileposts on this journey that we're taking. And you know, we're from New Jersey so every once in a while we tend to be a little bit cynical, just a little, but you know in the end you all have been an inspiration to the rest the country. They've watched what happens here and they've watched how neighbors have helped neighbors and friends have helped friends and volunteers from all over the country have come here and walked away with an extraordinary impression of the people that they met and their generosity and their toughness and their honesty. And Union Beach is absolutely emblematic of that spirit here in this state. And so whenever I'm anywhere across this country, I always am proud to say I'm from here because all of you make me proud to be able to say that I'm your governor.
