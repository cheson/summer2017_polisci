Location: Trenton, NJ

Acting on a commitment to provide teachers with opportunities for professional advancement, Governor Christie today signed into law a measure that will allow outstanding teachers the opportunity to earn a "teacher-leader" designation as part of their teaching certificate. The specialized endorsement is intended to extend career ladders for teachers seeking to advance as leaders while remaining in the classroom, and to further support these teachers as they build upon their capacity to design, lead, and support professional learning opportunities for local schools and districts.
"This bill makes good on an important reform I have called for since 2011 by creating a pathway for growth, professional development, and peer leadership for our best, most inspiring and innovative teachers," said Governor Chris Christie. "The reality is that we know great teachers are already leaders in their schools and communities, but this law honors and recognizes those contributions and designates that leadership in a real way, without making them go outside the classroom to pursue those opportunities. This goal -- to provide teachers with career ladders -- is an essential component of this Administration's education reform agenda."
