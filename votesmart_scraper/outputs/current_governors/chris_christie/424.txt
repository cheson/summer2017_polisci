Today, Governor Chris Christie signed the following Executive Order:
Executive Order No. 182 - Ordering all State buildings to fly flags at half-staff on Friday, July 31, 2015 in recognition of the life and in mourning of the passing of Emergency Medical Technician Hinal Patel, a resident of Piscataway and a graduate of both Piscataway High School and Rutgers University. EMT Patel completed her training in 2012 and served her community by providing emergency medical services on behalf of the Spotswood Emergency Medical Service and the North Stelton Volunteer Fire Company. On July 25, 2015, EMT Patel tragically passed away in the line of duty following a motor vehicle accident while responding to an emergency situation.
"EMT Hinal Patel's compassion for others and commitment to her community through providing care to those in need makes her a hero and a true role model for all New Jerseyans. It is with deep sadness that we mourn the loss of Hinal Patel, and extend our sincere sympathy to her family, friends, and fellow first responders," said Governor Christie. "It is appropriate and fitting for the State of New Jersey to remember EMT Hinal Patel, to mark her passing, and to honor her memory."
