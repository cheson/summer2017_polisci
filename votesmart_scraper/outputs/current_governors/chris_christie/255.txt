There are Republicans in this room, there are Democrats in this room, there are independents in this room, education should not be a partisan issue. It should be about, it should be about results, achievement, accomplishment. But do not be fooled, in this state it is a partisan issue. Notice that the people that who want to restrict charter schools, that want to restrict school choice that defend and stand up for a failed status quo are almost universally the people in the legislature who represent the districts that are failing. The districts that are failing, the very people who represent Newark and Jersey City and Paterson and Trenton and Camden, day after day after day, stand up for the failed status quo because they are owned by the status quo. I don't care whether it's a Republican, a Democrat, or an independent who is willing to stand with us but we most also open our eyes to the fact that charter school law was signed by a Republican governor, Christie Whitman. Charter schools have been expanded their greatest amount in the history of the state by me, a Republican governor. Why? Is it that we care more about educating your children than the democrats do? No. It's that they're owned and we're not.
