The Christie Reform Agenda: Creating Jersey Jobs
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: Feb. 1, 2011
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Christie has made economic growth and a friendlier business climate a top priority. Through the New Jersey Partnership for Action, the Christie Administration has implemented an aggressive economic development agenda, including overhauling state government's regulatory system and reducing the red tape that stifles economic growth and imposes costs on businesses and citizens. After 115 tax and fee increases over the last 8 years, Governor Christie is breaking the pattern of higher taxes, increased spending and shortsighted economic policy that has plagued Trenton for decades. He has closed back-to-back budget shortfalls, amounting to billions of dollars, without raising taxes and rejected an attempt by the legislature to increase taxes on small businesses and individuals by $637 million. He sunset the corporate business tax surcharge, put a hard, two-percent cap on property taxes and protected businesses from an average $400 per employee, or 52%, increase in the unemployment insurance payroll tax.

As a result, companies are once again taking notice and choosing New Jersey for their corporate locations and expansions. From Fortune 500 firms to small and medium-sized businesses, the companies listed below are generating 3024 new jobs while retaining 6832 existing jobs, bringing more than $288 million in total investment to the Garden State.
