New Jersey Governor Chris Christie: I need to be governed by the will of the people. And the best expression of the will of the people is not a poll, it is an election. So, let's put it on the ballot. And I think if you've got Republicans across New Jersey saying they're willing to put it on the ballot, people who advocate for the traditional interpretation of marriage saying they're willing to put it on the ballot, then everybody should be willing to put it on the ballot. And if in fact what the advocates for same-sex marriage are saying is true, which I've seen them say, which is "New Jersey wants this,' well than there's an easy way to figure that out. Let New Jersey vote.
