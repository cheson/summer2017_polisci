Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement on the New Jersey Supreme Court pension ruling:
"This decision is an important victory not only for our taxpayers who simply cannot afford these unsustainably high costs, but for limited, constitutional government that recognizes the proper role of the executive and legislative branches of government. The Court's position is clear, as is mine, it is time to move forward and work together to find a tangible, long-term solution to make our pension system and public employee health benefit costs affordable and sustainable for generations to come. In light of today's decision, I urge all interested parties to come back to the table and partner with me to finally solve this problem once and for all."
