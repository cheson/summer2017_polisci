Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today released the following statement in remembrance of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks:
"As we reach the eleventh anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we pause to remember and honor the memories of the innocent victims who lost their lives in New York City, Washington, DC and Pennsylvania - 746 of them New Jerseyans. Over a decade later, the events of that day - the unprecedented nature of the attacks on our homeland, the tragic loss of life, and the character, heroism and selflessness displayed by responders on that day - continue to have a permanent and deep-seated effect on every New Jerseyan and American today. As we gather at memorial ceremonies across the state, we remember the very best and the very worst of what we all experienced that day. We continue to give our comfort, thoughts and prayers to our communities and families who lost a loved one and honor the thousands of selfless Americans - firefighters, police officers, EMS responders, construction workers, and military personnel - who displayed unimaginable bravery and sacrifice.
"The events of that day continue to unite us as Americans - in our common respect and debt to the heroes of that day and against the forces of hatred that sought to cripple and undermine our values, our freedom, and our resolve as a nation and people to be a force of good in the world. As our state and nation did in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, we continue to demonstrate the resilience, strength and patriotism that define us as both New Jerseyans and Americans."
Governor Christie signed Executive Order No. 102, ordering all State buildings to fly flags at half-staff on Tuesday, September 11, 2012 to recognize and mourn all of those lost in the September 11th attacks, as well as issued a proclamation marking September 11, 2012 as "Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance" throughout New Jersey.
