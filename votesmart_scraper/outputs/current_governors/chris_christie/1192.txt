Remarks of Governor Chris Christie To the Joint Session of the New Jersey Senate and General Assembly Regarding the Fiscal Year 2012 Budget
By: Chris Christie
Date: Feb. 22, 2011
Location: Trenton, NJ

Madam Speaker, Mr. President, members of the Legislature, people of the State of New Jersey:
It is my pleasure, and my duty, to present to you my budget for the year ending June 30, 2012.
Early last year, I took my first major budget actions in two separate budget presentations to the legislature and the people of this state.
First, we had to stop the hemorrhaging and close the $2 billion budget gap that existed last February for FY 2010, with only five months to go in the fiscal year. We did it -- without raising taxes.
Second, in March, we proposed to attack the much larger projected deficit, some $11 billion, for FY 2011. By June, together we had closed that gap too -- again, without raising taxes on the people of New Jersey, their first real relief in eight years.
One key to changing direction has been changing our approach to the budget process.
Every year, the Office of Legislative Services puts out a projected deficit. The only problem is that this number assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday's New Jersey.
The old projection is a result of the old way of budgetingÂ… assuming you cannot control the budget and guide it to a more sustainable place, but instead must just let it take its own course. To run away from hard choices, just because they are hard. To put the government on autopilot, with no strong leadership setting priorities.
