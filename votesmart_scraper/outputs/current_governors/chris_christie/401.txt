Location: Morristown, NJ

This morning, Hillsborough County Commissioner Toni Pappas, who has represented Manchester, Bedford and New Boston for 14 years, announced her endorsement for Chris Christie's Presidential Campaign at his 26th New Hampshire town hall meeting.
"Governor Christie has delivered remarkable results for the people of New Jersey, and unlike politicians in Washington, DC, he did so while working with a legislature of the opposite party. He has reduced the size of government, vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history and provided strong leadership in the most trying of times," said Pappas. "No other candidate has his experience and resolve, which will restore American leadership."
"Toni has a long record of public service in Manchester and is widely respected across New Hampshire. She brings tremendous experience and passion to our campaign, and I am grateful for her support," said Governor Christie.
Toni Pappas is a former state representative and is currently an account executive with Business NH Magazine. In 1999, she led the effort to draft Elizabeth Dole into the presidential campaign and was one of Dole's key supporters in New Hampshire.
Toni has served as President of the Manchester Historic Association. She is a member of the Manchester Rotary Club. She serves on the Boards of the NH Citizens for the Arts and the Manchester Community Health Center. Toni is former President of the New Hampshire Association of Counties.
Toni and her husband Billy volunteer their time to support scholar athletes through the Joe Yukica NH Chapter of the National Football Foundation. They assist with Greek community events including Greekfest and GLENDI. They also enjoy various sports and have run the Boston and New York City marathons together.
