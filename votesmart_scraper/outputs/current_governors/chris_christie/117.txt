Governor Christie: I want to thank Dean and the folks at QuickChek, they're a great New Jersey company and I appreciate the investment they're making in our state. I want to thank them for being participants in what you see that on that chart to my right at no time in New Jersey history have more people been employed in the private sector than right now and by a significant amount. I'm proud of that record, it's a record that all New Jerseyans should be happy with. We'll never be satisfied because we're New Jersey and to be satisfied would be against our DNA but we should be happy about the fact that you look at where private sector employment was under Governor Corzine when he left office and look at where private sector employment is now after seven years. One of the things I promised in my campaigns for Governor was to increase employment opportunities for the people of New Jersey and that's a promise made and a promise kept as displayed by that chart, and QuickChek has been a part of that as have been many other folks. And in towns like Hanover where the Mayor and the Council are concerned about property taxes, are smart about the way they spend the public's money, are frugal about it, they help to make places like Hanover Township not only a great place to raise your children and go to school, but also an affordable place to live for their taxpayers. The Mayor has been doing that for a very long time, I appreciate the efforts that he puts in and he is representative of a lot of really good Mayors across this state who are trying to do the best they can, even though the folks in the Legislature at times make it harder for them. So thank you all for coming this morning I appreciate it, we will see you again soon.
