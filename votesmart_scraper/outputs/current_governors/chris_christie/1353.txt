GOVERNOR CHRSTIE:

In New Jersey we say this. With a teachers union collects $130 million in dues a year from its 200,000 members across our state. In a state that has been dominated politically by a state NJEA in every way an interest group can dominate a legislature and a series of Governors. If we can make this happen in New Jersey over the course of the next four years, there is no excuse for anyone anywhere not to get this done. We're going to lead the way.
