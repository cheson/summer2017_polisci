Advancing his commitment to provide New Jersey's institutions of higher education with the resources necessary to prepare the State's workforce for the 21st Century economy, Governor Chris Christie today announced a second round of grant funding from the 2012 Building Our Future Bond Act for a Fall 2015 grant cycle. In addition, new grant awards will be made from the Higher Education Capital Improvement Fund. These funds may be used for construction and reconstruction of facilities and technology infrastructure.
"To keep more of our best students in New Jersey and to make our colleges and universities more attractive research partners for industries looking to bring good-paying jobs and businesses here, we must have modern educational facilities in order to remain competitive," said Governor Christie. "Through this second round of funding, we're making $180 million available to help build, repair and update these critically needed academic facilities."
