Charter schools have been in existence for 20 years now. They've proven they work and so we've got to give them more freedom to be more aggressive, and that's why I changed all these rules. And I want you to remember one thing on the way out the door, when I announced those rules, it seems to be pretty commonsense right, you know if you've got an empty building you should be able to occupy it, if you got space in a building that you're not using, why not let a charter school collocate there, and if you want to sign a lease that's longer than your charter, you should be able to do that so you can get a lower price. Within one hour of when I went to the Charter School Association meeting in Atlantic City and announced these new rules, within one hour, the teacher's union came out and opposed it. And what they said in their press release was, this is just an expansion of Governor Christie's failed charter school experiment. Now let me tell you something everybody, I look around this table, they want to say you're part of a failed charter school experiment. All I've heard this morning are testimonies about this school and what a difference it's made in the lives of the children and the families that its affected. If that's failure, we should have more failure all over this state.
