Governor Chris Christie today released the following statement in remembrance of the September 11, 2001 attacks:
"On the twelfth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we pause to honor and remember the nearly 3,000 innocent victims - more than 700 of them New Jerseyans - whose lives were lost in New York City, Washington, DC and Pennsylvania. We continue to comfort the families of the victims and share in the memories of their loved ones, as well as honor the thousands of Americans - firefighters, police officers, EMS responders, military personnel and construction workers - whose selfless acts of bravery and heroism saved thousands of lives that day. We are also grateful to our law enforcement communities and our Armed Forces for their tremendous sacrifices to protect us at home and abroad since the terrorist attacks. The events of that day united us as Americans to show the world the power of our strength and resolve to overcome unspeakable evil. Just as we did on September 11, 2001, we continue to display today and every day the patriotism that defines us as New Jerseyans and as Americans."
Governor Christie signed Executive Order No. 139 ordering all State buildings to fly flags at half-staff on Wednesday, September 11, 2013 to recognize and mourn the thousands of lives lost in the September 11th attacks. The Governor also issued a proclamation marking September 11, 2013 as "Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance" throughout New Jersey.
