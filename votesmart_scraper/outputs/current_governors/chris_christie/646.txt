Governor Chris Christie and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan, today announced HUD's approval of New Jersey's plan to spend $1.46 billion of federal disaster recovery funds to assist families, businesses and communities that were impacted by Superstorm Sandy.
The approval of New Jersey's plan, which came through formal notification this past Friday, will allow the State to rebuild Sandy-damaged homes and rental housing, support hardest hit and financially strained communities, buyout homes in communities vulnerable to repetitive flooding, and finance infrastructure resiliency projects throughout New Jersey to protect the state from future storms.
With monies now available from the second round of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Disaster Recovery funds, the State will continue to move eligible Reconstruction, Rehabilitation, Elevation & Mitigation (RREM) applicants off the waitlist and streamline the rebuilding process. Combined with anticipated third round funds, the State expects to reach all eligible homeowners currently on the RREM waitlist.
"The State of New Jersey has enjoyed a strong working relationship with HUD throughout our recovery from Superstorm Sandy, and we continue to work collaboratively to get families back into their homes as quickly as possible and find opportunities to help communities build back even stronger," Governor Christie said. "Together, the State and HUD are incorporating lessons learned from Sandy to create a more resilient New Jersey that can better withstand extreme weather events and other natural disasters. With this approval and expected third round funding of $881 million in the future, we will continue to prioritize our housing needs for Sandy-affected families, including clearing the RREM wait list and providing significant additional resources for renters."
