Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie released the following statement regarding today:
"After months of promising to deliver critical tax relief to the people of New Jersey, Corzine Democrats today proved it's just more of the same when it comes to their addiction to raising taxes and holding tax relief hostage. Corzine Democrats are sending a loud, resounding no to tax relief for hardworking New Jerseyans because they'd rather repeat the cycle of the eight years before I became Governor, raising taxes and fees every 25 days on the citizens of New Jersey."
