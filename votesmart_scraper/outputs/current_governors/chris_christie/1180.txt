Statement from Governor Chris Christie on Camden Mayor Redd's Public Safety Announcements Today
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: March 17, 2011
Location: Trenton, NJ

"We are in full support of Mayor Redd in her short-term response to policing in the City of Camden and her leadership in seeking long-term answers to meet public safety demands for her city and Camden County. Fiscal realities are forcing change, and as we witnessed in Camden, not everyone is willing to accept that reality. So it's time for all of us to assert leadership and work together on a new approach to combine and maximize public safety resources, eliminate redundancies and inefficiencies, and provide a long-term solution to create a new and strong public safety network."
