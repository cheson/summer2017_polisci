Statement From Governor Chris Christie On Democrats' TTF Tax Hike
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: July 25, 2016
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement on the Democrat's proposed Transportation Trust Fund plan:
"I reviewed this weekend the Democrats' latest plan to fund the Transportation Trust Fund through a massive gas tax hike that does not represent tax fairness to the residents of New Jersey. Therefore, I cannot support it.
"I proposed a significant plan for tax fairness, one that included a reduced sales tax and retirement income tax cuts to offset any increase in the gas tax. The Assembly overwhelmingly approved that plan. The Democrat Senate responded by doing what Democrats always do on taxes: impose an immediate massive tax hike with a promise of future tax relief long after I am out of office. It is unfortunate that Speaker Prieto has now given in to this failed approach.
"As I have said for two years, any solution for a Transportation Trust Fund must have as its foundation tax fairness. This proposal does not. Hopefully when they return to New Jersey after the Democrat National Convention in Philadelphia, the Democrats will put forward a plan consistent with that principle.
Their current proposal, however, is dead on arrival."
