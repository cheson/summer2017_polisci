Governor Chris Christie today signed into law S-157/A-1120 (Madden, Vitale/Oliver, Handlin, Vainieri Huttle, Quijano, McKnight, Tucker, Wimberly) establishing a task force to better protect senior citizens and people with disabilities.
"This new law will protect our most-vulnerable residents by offering real solutions to prevent evolving forms of abuse, neglect, fraud and exploitation," Governor Christie said. "It guarantees and affirms a commitment to our core mission to promote the health, wellness and safety of the elderly and individuals with disabilities."
The 11-member, unpaid "Task Force on Abuses of Persons who are Elderly or Disabled" includes state government leaders and subject experts, along with a total of five public members appointed by the Governor, Senate President and Assembly Speaker. Within 15 months, this task force is to organize, evaluate current protection policies, identify inadequacies and submit a report of its findings and recommended solutions to the Governor and Legislature.
The Governor also acted today on other pending legislation.
