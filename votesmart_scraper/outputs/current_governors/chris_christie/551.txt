Governor Chris Christie Takes Action on Pending Legislation
Press Release

Calling it a "solution in search of a problem," Governor Chris Christie today vetoed legislation banning the use of pig gestation crates in New Jersey where, in fact, the practice is not even in use by farmers. The Governor urged legislators to turn their attention to actual problems facing New Jersey, instead of using lawmaking as "a political cudgel" on issues outside our borders.
Governor Christie noted that he rejected nearly identical legislation last year sponsored by the same partisan legislators. At the time, he noted that both the state Board of Agriculture and Department of Agriculture found that bill to be unnecessary and ill-advised.
"I will rely on our in-state experts rather than the partisan politicians who sponsor this bill. These facts are no less true today," Governor Christie said.
In fact, the Legislature in 1995 directed the state's agricultural experts to develop and adopt standards for the humane raising, keeping, care and treatment of all types of domestic livestock.
"These Humane Standards have put New Jersey at the vanguard of protecting domestic livestock from animal cruelty," Governor Christie said.
The New Jersey Supreme Court, in upholding the majority of these standards, observed that the Agriculture Department "took seriously its charge to consider all aspects of ... the welfare of domestic livestock."
