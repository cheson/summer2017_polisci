We know that four out of every five heroin addicts start on prescription drugs. Four out of every five heroin addicts start on medicine they get from a physician and we need to start talking about that much more aggressively. In 2012, 259 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers were written in the United States alone. That is enough for every adult in the United States to have their own bottle of 30 pills of OxyContin or Percocet or one of the others. That is obscene. We need to educate our physicians about how it's appropriate to use these drugs. Believe me, I've traveled the country they're not getting educated about it. It's not part of their medical school curriculum it's not part of any continuing medical education. You know who's educating them about it? The pharmaceutical companies whose sales people come into their offices, hand them prescription pads and tell them to write prescriptions. I don't believe that most doctors want to do harm, in fact, just the opposite, the Hippocratic oath is first do no harm, but to know whether you're doing harm or not you've got to know, you have to be educated, and we are not educating our doctors and we need to educate our doctors and our healthcare providers. And then once we educate them, we need to monitor them, and we need to punish the ones who are making money off of this disease.
