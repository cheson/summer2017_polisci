Governor Christie: Horizon's most productive line of business is Medicaid. In 2016 for example, Horizon's Medicaid profits from serving the poor exceeded $163 million. Now, we discover that their profit was based in part on improper denial of claims, late payment of claims, failure to pay interest on late claims, and growing and ignoring, rather, the concerns of the poor and those who provide treatment to them. We must demand answers. We must discover what else Horizon's well paid lobbyists and secret executives are hiding from us. We need the greater transparency and additional independent management that our proposed legislation provides to the public. Sixteen million dollars in fines in nine months could just be the tip of the iceberg. We should not permit a nonprofit insurer to profit from ignoring the poor and those who give them the life enhancing and life sustaining health care that they need, at taxpayer expense. Horizon needs to be held answerable to this. The only way to do that in my view is through the legislation that we have provided to the Legislature that would insure greater transparency and greater independent governance, so that their well-paid lobbyists and their high-paid executives will not go unchecked by a board that is under the thumb of the chairman and CEO.
