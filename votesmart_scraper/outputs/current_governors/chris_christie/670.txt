Statement

Location: Franklin, NJ

I hope that all of us will take a moment today in our own time a private moment to think that a year ago today that we had the bombing in Boston at the marathon. Lives were lost and lives were altered forever by that awful terrorist act. So I hope that today when you have a moment by yourselves, you'll take a moment if you choose to, to have some silent reflection or prayer for those families who lost their loved ones a year ago today standing on a finish line at a marathon thinking that they were there for a joyous occasion and for those who were so severely wounded and had their lives changed that day. Their struggle continues and will continue for the rest of their lives. So I think all of us, especially folks in New Jersey, who have had our lives touched by a terrorist act on September 11th and so many of us know people whose lives will always be affected by that day can empathize with the people of Boston who were affected by it. So I just hope that all of you will take the time to do that today and think about those families. They need our support and our strength and our prayers for them a year later because today will be a very, very difficult day for them as the 364 between them have been difficult for those folks.
