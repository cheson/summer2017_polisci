Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: June 27, 2016
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie released the following statement on the Assembly's passage of a bipartisan agreement to cut the sales tax and fund the TTF:
"I am pleased that the Assembly has heeded my suggestion for tax fairness, which I have been calling for for a long time. This is the first broad-based tax cut for all New Jerseyans since 1994. It is much-needed while at the same time we are going to have constitutionally-dedicated revenue to improve roads, bridges and the mass transit systems in the state. After the action the Assembly took, I look forward to working with the Senate between now and Thursday to hopefully bring this issue to a successful conclusion."
