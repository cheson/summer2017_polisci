Governor Chris Christie: In my five years as Governor, we will have made $4.2 billion in payments to the pension system. In the 15 years before I became Governor, under five different Governors, both republicans and democrats, they paid a total in 15 years of $3.4 billion. $3.4 billion in 15 years. $4.2 billion in 5 years. So when you get these complainants from public employees about Governor Christie should pay the pension. Let me tell you something, these public employees should be sending me a thank you note. I'm the first guy whose put significant money into this pension system. But by the way, I'm not holding my breath waiting for the thank you note. Keep it in perspective in this year's budget with that $1.3 billion payment, if you take $1 that's spent in the budget 15 cents of every dollar will go to pension and health benefits. 15 cents of every dollar will go to pension and health benefits. How does that compare with everything else? 7 cents of every dollar goes to higher education, 3 cents of every dollar goes to property tax relief, 4 cents goes to municipal aid to your towns, 3 cents goes to help support our hospitals. So do the math, all the higher ed spending, all the property tax relief programs, all the municipal aid, all the hospital funding is 17 cents. 15 cents just for pension and health benefits. I think we have our priorities in the wrong order.
