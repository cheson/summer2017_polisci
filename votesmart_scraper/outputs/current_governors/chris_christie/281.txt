Statement From Governor Christie On Speaker Prieto's Atlantic City Inaction
Statement
By: Chris Christie

Location: Trenton, NJ

Today, Governor Christie released the following statement in response to Speaker Prieto's inaction on Atlantic City:

"The speaker needs to stop making it up as he goes along.
"Remarkably, with Atlantic City on the financial brink, Speaker Prieto today cavalierly tossed out yet another hastily thought-out idea, saying: "bankruptcy is always the other option that is out there."
"His refusal to adopt a proposal that would avoid bankruptcy is incredibly irresponsible to the businesses, employees and citizens of Atlantic City as well as to all other taxpayers in New Jersey. He promised us a vote on his flawed plan last week. He failed. We all now await what's next from the Speaker.
"Additionally, for months and again today, the Speaker claims that Governor Christie has the power under existing law to step in and avoid financial disaster for Atlantic City and protect the taxpayers of New Jersey. He is wrong.
"If the Speaker believes such powers exists, then he should provide detailed legal support for his position.
"He cannot provide that support because there is none. Moreover, there is no legislation on the Governor's desk to address Atlantic City's pending financial ruin because of the Speaker's failures. Time is running out to fix the city's fiscal problems. Instead of addressing the crisis in Atlantic City, Speaker Prieto continues to obstruct bipartisan efforts to rescue Atlantic City. Stop with the games Mr. Speaker; do the job you were elected to do."
