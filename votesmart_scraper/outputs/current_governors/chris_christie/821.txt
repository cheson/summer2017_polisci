Governor Christie today released the following statement marking Labor Day this year in New Jersey and reflecting on the progress that has been made over the past 3 years to improve the lives and opportunities available to working New Jerseyans:
"As families across our state get a much-deserved break today this Labor Day, I'm reminded of what an honor it is to be governor of a state and people who so fully embody the principles we celebrate on this day - hard work, resilience, looking out for each other, and hope in a better future. For the last four years, we have worked to meet that standard, turn our economy around, and give our hardworking families the relief and opportunities they need and deserve.
"Today, our economy is growing. We've created 143,000 private sector jobs, and we've made New Jersey more competitive by cutting taxes and making smart investments in our infrastructure - like our roads, ports, and higher education institutions. We still have more work to do, but I am proud of what we have accomplished together and of the incredible job the men and women of our state have done in building our state and helping in its recovery. And I am extremely proud of the broad support that has resulted from those partnerships, with support from twenty-six labor and building trades organizations and leaders of our small business community alike. This Labor Day, Mary Pat and I and wish everyone in New Jersey a safe, happy, and much-deserved holiday."
