Governor Christie: In light of recent acts I'm announcing the availability of an additional $1 million in SECUR-NJ grants for nonprofit organizations and religious institutions determined to be at high risk of attack in the nine uncovered New Jersey counties by the Federal government. Those are Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer, Salem, and Warren counties. Representatives of those counties are here from both law enforcement and government and I appreciate their attendance today. By making these additional resources available, it's another really crucial step, and our efforts to enhance security for everybody in New Jersey. So I'd encourage eligible nonprofits to apply for these grants, to help pay for security measures that will help to keep them and their organizations safer, and give their members additional peace of mind when they're attending events put on by these groups. Nonprofits in New Jersey, the other 12 counties are already eligible to receive these grants through federal funding and OHSP administers that as well. These are difficult times when there's hatred in the world and groups that want to spread that hate. It knows no bounds of counties or states, it knows no bounds of any particular religious organization and the emphasis of late has been on anti-Semitism, but we know that there has been over the course of just my time as Governor hate acts against lots of other religions, hate acts against people based upon their sexual orientation, hate acts based upon all kinds of different factors of race and ethnicity. None of those are acceptable and these grants are meant to make sure that we protect against any acts of hate, as are the hate crime laws in New Jersey, which will be vigorously enforced and continue to be vigorously enforced by the state Attorney General.
