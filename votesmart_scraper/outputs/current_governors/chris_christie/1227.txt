Governor Christie: and for them being able to work within the policy parameters that we set forward for what we believe this State needs to do which is first and foremost, get its fiscal house in order. There can't be -- we'll get our fiscal house in order, butwe'll do this. We'll get our fiscal house in order, but we have to make an exception for that. The exceptions in New Jersey have become the rule which is why we have become the fiscal mess that we are. Not on my watch. We are doing this. And in case you haven't noticed, we are leading the rest of the nation in doing it. You look around at what Jerry Brown said in California this week, what Andrew Cuomo said in New York this week, what Scott Walker said in Wisconsin this week, and what I expect John Kasich will say in Ohio next week. They are looking at New Jersey as the model for restoring a broken state to fiscal health and I'm not going to let down the people of this state who voted for me on that basis
