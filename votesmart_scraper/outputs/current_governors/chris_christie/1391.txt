Governor Christie Continues Actions to Prevent Wasteful Spending
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: March 9, 2010
Location: Trenton, NJ

On Friday, March 5th, Governor Chris Christie exercised his veto authority to cut back open-ended and unspecified spending, the second veto of Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) minutes and his fifth such action since taking office. Continuing to take action on his long-term commitment to rein in wasteful and excessive spending in boards and authorities and throughout state government, Governor Christie vetoed two actions taken by the DRBA in the minutes of the authority's February 16, 2010 meeting.
Governor Christie said, "The DRBA has not changed its process of approving open-ended and unspecified spending commitments. As I have stated when previously vetoing the DBRA's actions and those of other state entities, New Jersey simply cannot afford blanket spending orders and ever-expanding budgets from these boards and authorities, now or ever. My Administration will continue to pay close attention when it concerns spending, contracts, and measures that continue to skirt accountability."
The Governor's veto concerns the Authority's blanket authorization of expenditures to four vendors in unspecified amounts in excess of $25,000 for the period January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Additionally, Governor Christie vetoed the Authority's action regarding the authorization of a legal services contract that fails to specify any material terms of the contract -- including the hourly rate of legal services, the term, or maximum annual compensation under the contract.
No veto power was exercised as to any other action taken by the Authority at its meeting on February 16, 2010.
