Joint Statement from Governor-Elect Chris Christie and Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno on Martin Luther King Day
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: Jan. 18, 2010
Location: Trenton, NJ



Today, Governor-Elect Chris Christie and Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno released the following statement:
"As we reflect today on the inspiration and legacy of Dr. King, he would want us to be relentless in our fight for equal education opportunities for our children, no matter where they live in New Jersey. Dr. King would no doubt want us to overcome the powerful interests that seek to preserve the status quo in our schools, especially in our urban centers, where too often the result has been mediocrity or failure.
"This will not be just a hope or a wish, but an imperative of my administration that I will fulfill through the creation of high-quality charter schools, school choice, and other reforms, so that all children can have the same hope and opportunity that comes from a top-notch education."
