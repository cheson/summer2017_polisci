Governor Christie: And I firmly believe we must continue to improve our public charter school system in New Jersey, because our charters are getting results for our families who need them most. Families in low-performing school districts are going to vote with their feet and choose the schools and education options that give their children the best shot at life success. It's our moral obligation, our responsibility as public leaders to give those options to the families, so the families can choose what they think is best for their children. That's why under our Administration, charter schools have grown significantly, 39 new charter schools opened during our Administration, and the number of students attending charter schools have nearly doubled. From 21,687 and in 2009-10 year to over 40,000 in the 2014-15 year. And by 2017, there will be over 50,000 charter seats available here in New Jersey. Our commitment to facilitate the expansion of charter schools has never been stronger. We are aggressively working to prioritize regulatory relief for charter schools. I held a meeting here in Newark with all the major charter school operators to get their input into what kind of relief they would want so we are exploring ways to create greater flexibility in the teacher certification process, we are exploring ways to make it easier for charter schools to find facilities, and we are pursuing regulatory reforms to encourage development of more charter schools to serve our most vulnerable students, such as those with autism or development delays. Charter schools are integral to achieving great centers of learning in all of our communities. And as Governor I'm going to continue to remain committed to that.
