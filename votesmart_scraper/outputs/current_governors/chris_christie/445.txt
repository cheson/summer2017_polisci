Today Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement marking the 99th anniversary of Flag Day, which celebrates the adoption of the flag of the United States by resolution of the Second Continental Congress on June 14, 1777:
"For over 200 years, the flag of the United States has been a symbol of our country's pursuit of liberty and justice to nations around the world. Today we remember our sisters and brothers who have fought for us to defend and preserve those same principles. This great symbol of our unity as a country should be proudly displayed on this 99th anniversary of Flag Day and invoke a sense of pride in all of us. As Americans, we draw inspiration from the flag; a reminder of our past, our present, and our dreams for the future. I encourage all New Jerseyans to look to our Nation's flag today to honor its presence throughout our history serving as a symbol of the hopes and values that our nation was founded upon and that continue to inspire us all."
Governor Christie also proclaimed June 14, 2015 as "Flag Day" throughout New Jersey. A copy of the Governor's proclamation is attached.
