Statement

The position is not changing. There is an Assembly voting session tomorrow. The Speaker should be the interest of Atlantic City and its people and the interest of the credit worthiness of the state of New Jersey in the forefront tomorrow. Post the bill Mr. Speaker. If you want to come down from the rostrum and argue against it and vote against it, you're a member of the Assembly. That is you're right to do. It is not your right to be a one man obstruction crew and causing insolvency in the city of Atlantic City and all of the ripple effects that will have across the state. It's irresponsible, I hope he steps up to his responsibility in the next 24 hours. Maybe the mayor can pray for him. Thanks.
