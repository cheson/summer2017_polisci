U.S. Energy Secretary Dr. Ernest Moniz: This really is the continuation of a very, very strong partnership as we address Sandy, address the state's needs and those in fact of the region and as we'll discuss today moving forward, a project that we think will be a model actually for developing 21st century grid in a way that helps our economy but also helps our resilience.
Governor Christie: The Northeast can lead the way on this. We can show that this type of grid for the first time can be used outside of the military context and I think that can encourage other folks who are concerned for other reasons about the resilience of their own system to be able to look at what we've done and be able to emulate it. I hope that as the Secretary said, no one would have wished that we would have gotten to this option in this way, but now that we have, let's try to make the best of it and to try to improve the lives of the people in this region who have been damaged by the storm.
