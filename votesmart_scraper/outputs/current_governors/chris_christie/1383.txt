Governor Chris Christie released the following statement praising the Assembly Appropriations Committee:
"Today's vote by the Assembly Appropriations Committee is another positive step toward reforming our broken pension system. I applaud the Committee for its passage of this legislation. This brings us closer to completing the work begun over three years ago on these important reforms. The only way we will get our state's finances in order, revive our economy and bring solvency to the system is through working together to make fundamental, needed changes to state and local governments. I look forward to the swift passage of this package of bills by the Assembly so they can be forwarded to my desk to be signed into law. In addition, I am committed to working with members of both parties in the Assembly and in the Senate to pass additional, much-needed reforms."
