Governor Christie today visited the Randolph, New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) agency to announce additional initiatives aimed at reducing MVC wait times and customer costs. These new proposals and improvements to existing programs will cut transaction times and make it easier for drivers to access services.
"Providing excellent customer service at MVC and throughout state government has been a key component of my administration," said Governor Christie. "MVC is continually looking for ways to enhance the customer experience and streamline the transaction process. With these new initiatives, customers will have more options to conduct their business either online or at a variety of locations with some express options. "
To reduce demand at the end of the month, Governor Christie is calling on the legislature to pass a bill that would change driver license and registration expiration dates to drivers' birthdays instead of the last day of the month.
To encourage use of MVC's online tools, by October 1st, MVC will eliminate online transaction fees. MVC will continue to post on its website updated wait times at each agency location and identify low-volume agencies, as well as offer online scheduling of driver tests and online suspension/restoration appointments.
Starting in early 2017, MVC will launch two mobile agency units that will be able to perform all transactions that existing agencies can with the exception of driver testing and titles. They will be deployed in the event of unforeseen agency outages and also will be utilized to service the needs of varying populations. MVC also is working with AAA to develop a system for customers to be able to renew their registration through certain AAA offices.
