Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement on the 67th Anniversary of D-Day.

As America commemorates the 67th Anniversary of D- Day, we salute the bravery, perseverance and camaraderie of our Greatest Generation. We must also take this opportunity to thank and remember all of our brave soldiers who have risked their lives, some making the ultimate sacrifice, for the these same principles."
