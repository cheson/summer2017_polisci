Governor Chris Christie today released the following statement in recognition of the 73rd Anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces landed at Normandy during World War II:
"Today, we join the rest of the world in commemorating the 73rd anniversary of D-Day. All Americans owe a tremendous debt of gratitude and appreciation to our World War II veterans who in themselves represent our nation's greatest values -- bravery, loyalty, and an unbreakable resolve in the face of adversity. On this day, we recognize the thousands of soldiers, sailors, and airmen who invaded Normandy and laid their lives on the line for our country, some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice, and helped turn the tide of the war, forever changing the fate of the world. It is vital for New Jersey residents to join together in expressing gratitude for the service of our veterans, who have risked their lives to provide safety and security of all while also promoting the sacred principles of democracy, liberty, and freedom."
Governor Christie also issued a proclamation marking June 6, 2017 "D-Day Remembrance Day" throughout New Jersey. A copy of the Governor's proclamation is attached to the release.
