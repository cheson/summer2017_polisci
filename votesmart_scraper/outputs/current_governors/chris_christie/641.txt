Today Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement marking the 98th anniversary of Flag Day, which celebrates the adoption of the flag of the United States by resolution of the Second Continental Congress on June 14, 1777:
"Today, we recognize the enduring symbol of America that is our nation's flag. More than 200 years ago, our founding fathers adopted the national flag to symbolize our birth as a unified nation founded on inalienable rights and freedoms, and to instill a sense of pride and strength in all Americans. Both at home and abroad, the flag serves as a representation of our country's founding principles of liberty and justice and as an icon of the freedoms we cherish as Americans. As we mark the anniversary of Flag Day, I encourage all New Jerseyans to proudly fly our nation's flag and reflect on the values that make our nation great."
