Acting on his commitment to help provide students in New Jersey's inner cities and urban communities the opportunity and resources they need to pursue higher educational opportunities they have earned, Governor Chris Christie today unveiled the $1 million Governor's Urban Scholarship Program, first announced in the Fiscal Year 2013 Budget address. This new scholarship builds on Governor Christie's commitment to provide the resources necessary to expand access and opportunities for New Jersey students to pursue their education in college.
"We live in a time when educational attainment and economic success are correlated as never before. A quality education is the key to advancement and an improved livelihood, but the reality is that too many students are not given that choice, not because of a lack of ability but due to financial circumstances. Through the Governor's Urban Scholarship Program, we will be able to provide some of our brightest students from inner cities and urban communities with access to quality higher learning opportunities at our colleges and universities. I believe educating our most talented students is an investment in both our students and New Jersey's future. This program will provide another critical gateway for students to realize their full potential," Governor Chris Christie said.
The Governor's budget proposal provides more than $393.2 million in funding for student financial assistance, the highest funding level in state history, including:
Increasing Assistance For The Neediest Students By $37.5 Million Through Tuition Aid Grants (TAG).
$341.4 million in State funding is provided in total for Tuition Aid Grants, which will allow the average award in each sector to increase.
