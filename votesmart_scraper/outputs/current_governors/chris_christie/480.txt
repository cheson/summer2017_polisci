Governor Christie: "I have to work with Democrats. Democrats run the state Legislature. Now I'd like it to be otherwise but it is what I have to live with. And so I'm going to learn how to work with them and I've had some good partners on the Democratic side of the aisle. We have a 2% property tax cap in effect now, and last year we had the smallest increase in property taxes in twenty years in New Jersey, and it's going to be lower again this year. We have put a cap on the arbitration awards that were driving your property taxes up. And finally we reformed the pension and benefit system, which is going to save the taxpayers of the state $132 billion over the next thirty years and make those pensions more secure for the people who need to receive them. We're doing the things here that they simply won't do in Washington DC. We're leading and making the tough choices."
