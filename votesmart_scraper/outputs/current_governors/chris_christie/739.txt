Governor Christie: This government, our government, we will fight to continue to change so that we value our differences and honor the strength of our diversity. Because we cannot fall victim to the attitude of Washington, DC. The attitude that says I am always right and you are always wrong. The attitude that puts everyone into a box they are not permitted to leave. The attitude that puts political victories ahead of policy agreements. The belief that compromise is a dirty word. You see, as we saw in December regarding the DREAM Act, we can put the future of our state ahead of the partisans who would rather demonize than compromise. As your Governor, I will always be willing to listen, as long as that listening ends in decisive action for the people who are counting on us to do our job.
