Statement From Governor Chris Christie On Comprehensive Mental Health Reform
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: Oct. 16, 2015
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie released the following statement on pursuing comprehensive mental health reform legislation, rather than political grandstanding:
"The issue of mental health and its impact on violent, sometimes deadly behavior in our society is too important an issue to play politics with. Yet, that's exactly what the Senate President has done. Rather than looking for common ground, the Senate President has rejected bipartisan compromise out of hand and put his own political grandstanding and gubernatorial candidacy ahead of public safety and fixing the gaps that exist in our mental health system.
"What our state needs, and what I support, is a comprehensive solution that gets individuals with mental illness the treatment they need, while also helping professionals, courts and families to intervene when the warning signs of mental illness signal someone poses an imminent danger to themselves or others. Senate Minority Leader Kean has set aside politics and is working on a bill that represents such an approach, including a commonsense path forward on the issue of the expungement of mental health records to enhance public safety. I support his efforts and I will sign his legislation when it reaches my desk."
