Governor Christie: This has been hard work by the Labor Department, by the EDA over the course of time, you know, from the late Caren Franzini to Michele Brown and now to Melissa. They've worked extraordinarily hard at the ADA and Commissioner Wirths and Commissioner Fichtner have worked hard at Labor to work with our business partners to show them that there is a different atmosphere in New Jersey the last seven years. That the policies that we've put into effect are now creating these numbers, in some respect, that are happening, and now that we're outperforming the rest of the country, perhaps we can relegate to the dustbin the fact that this idea that New Jersey is underperforming the rest of the country. We're not. We're actually now over-performing the rest of the country, and I would suggest to you that the reason that there is that lag is because New Jersey is still a very expensive place to work and do business, and if the legislature had been willing to do other tax cuts and other measures that I put and recommended on property taxes and income taxes, perhaps we'd be in even better shape and it would've happened even faster. But, we're certainly better off than we were from 2001 to 2009, when there was zero net private-sector job growth during a time when the rest of the country, in that middle period, between about "03 and "08, was growing and New Jersey was not, and it's because New Jersey was a business unfriendly place. We cannot go back to those policies. If we do, we'll wind up with the exact same results.
