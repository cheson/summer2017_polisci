In honor of Memorial Day, Governor Chris Christie released the following statement:
"Today, we pause to honor the American heroes in our military who courageously and selflessly defend our country and our freedom. Throughout history, the brave men and women of our armed forces have served as a constant symbol of patriotism for all Americans. Words alone cannot fully express our gratitude for our veterans and their families who continually support them. On this Memorial Day, I encourage all New Jerseyans to join me in thanking our service members for their willingness to defend our nation and to remember those who have paid the ultimate price for our country. Their unmatched patriotism makes us all proud to be Americans."
