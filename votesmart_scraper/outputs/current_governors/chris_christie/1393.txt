Location: Trenton, NJ

Today Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement in response to the World Trade Center counterproposal produced by the Port Authority:
"We simply cannot delay any longer on the World Trade Center site which is why I have worked with the Port Authority to put together a thoughtful and substantive counterproposal. Now is the time for all interested parties to quickly and responsibly finalize an agreement that both protects the memories of those we lost and the overstretched taxpayers of New York and New Jersey. This is a good first step we must all quickly build upon so we can come to a timely and meaningful conclusion."
