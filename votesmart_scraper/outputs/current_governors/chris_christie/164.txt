Governor Christie: Ninety-eight percent of all the businesses in New Jersey are small businesses. And so we got to remember that when we talk about the economy in this state, small business employs over 1.7 million people in our state or over half of the private sector workforce are employed by small businesses. These businesses have fewer than 100 employees, and they have the largest share of our employment across the entire state. So when you talk about a bill like this, that the Senator, the Assemblyman have put together, this is really touching families all across New Jersey who are supported by and who work for small businesses in this state. So as we begin this new year, that's why I wanted to make my first public act in the new year, this signing, in this place, to let people know that regardless of your party, regardless of what sector of business you work in, regardless of what region in the state you come from, we have work to do this year. We have work to do not only for our economy and our businesses, we have work to do for our families and each other. And that is what I'm going to be committing myself to over the next year in every way that I possibly can. And I thought that starting this year with a hopeful piece of legislation like this, that was unanimously agreed to by the legislature and signed by the Governor, started by a group of diverse people who came to the Governor's residence and advocated for positive change to help the constituencies that they are a part of and represent, would hopefully call us to our better angels.
