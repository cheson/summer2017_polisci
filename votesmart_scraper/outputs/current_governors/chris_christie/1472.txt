Christie Lays Out Theme for Fellow Republicans
Last Tuesday morning, just before Governor Jon S. Corzine delivered his State of the State address, Assembly Republicans met in caucus to hear a talk about the good old days when it was still morning in America for the Republican Party, and Ronald Reagan was their president.
That evening, when Republicans met again, at the Bergen County party headquarters here, some were convinced they had heard echoes of the Great Communicator as they listened to Christopher J. Christie, the former United States attorney for New Jersey who recently filed papers to enter the race for the Republican nomination for governor.
"I think we have someone who is a lot like Reagan again," said Assemblyman Scott T. Rumana, a North Jersey Republican.
Mr. Christie, 46, is still in the honeymoon glow of his candidacy. He said he would not offer specifics about his positions on the nettlesome issues facing the state  from gay marriage to school funding to the state's $2.1 billion budget gap  until his formal announcement later this month.
But in his half-hour talk to a standing- room-only audience of some 250 cheering Republicans on Tuesday, Mr. Christie sounded the theme that is certain to be one of the building blocks of his campaign  the idea that the man who puts criminals behind bars can get things done.
