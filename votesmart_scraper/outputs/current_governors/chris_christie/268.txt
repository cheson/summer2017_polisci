In districts like Newark and Camden, charter schools are educating close to 30% of the public school population, proving that charter schools are a valued option in our public education system, and I'd remind everybody that charter schools are public schools, not private schools. They're public schools. Our commitment to facilitate the expansion of charter schools will continue to be strong and we'll continue to work with great schools like this one to make sure that not only are we providing great opportunity for the kids who go here but also are providing a model for other schools, both traditional public schools and new charter public schools to follow. It's not good enough just for the Thomas Edison School to be great for the children who are here. It's that they set examples for the rest of the state for ways that they can achieve the kind of scores that I heard from those students in there which were all outstanding. What we need to understand is that every child has extraordinary God-given potential, and it's our job to maximize that God-given potential, and when we settle for failed traditional public schools we settle for less for those families and to me that's immoral, and so we have to provide more options and better examples so that students can find whatever their dream is inside the walls of classrooms like the one I just walked through.
