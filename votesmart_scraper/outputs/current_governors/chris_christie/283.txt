I am pleased that the bond act that we passed along with the Legislature was helping to bring this new era to this historic campus, one that is preparing students for careers in the musical arts and performance while also developing future music leaders in our schools, universities, as well as professional and community organizations. Music has been a large part of my life for my entire life, and so this is one of the places I chose to come in highlighting what the Building our Future Bond Act has been able to do for higher education in the state because I do not want the emphasis just to be where I was earlier in the week at NJIT and talking about science and technology and engineering and mathematics. Those are very important, and we have made sure that we've put sufficient funds towards those disciplines as well, but I wanted to come here because I want people to understand that there is much more to an education than just science and technology and engineering and mathematics, and that coming to a place where the arts is celebrated is something that I wanted to make sure that the people of New Jersey understood they are supporting as well. They are supporting people whose passion is in the arts. This is important. It is really important. The arts is part of what feeds the soul of our state. When people think about New Jersey they think about lots of different things, but as I travel around the country what I hear much more about New Jersey is our artistic contributions than almost anything else, from Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi to the late James Gandolfini, to Jack Nicholson, all New Jerseyans who studied the arts here and made their artistic pursuits not only part of their lives but part of the lives of this country and part of the fabric and the culture that is New Jersey, and so continuing to have that type of experience available to everybody in our state who chooses to pursue it is something that is really important to me, because it's an important part of who I am and it is, even more importantly, an important part of what New Jersey is and always has been, and this institution is a part of that cultural fabric that makes people understand that what makes us different as human beings and what makes us particularly different as Americans is the idea that everyone should be able to pursue their passion.
