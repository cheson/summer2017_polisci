The Jersey Journal - Christie's Pitch at Hot Dog Stop is Affordability
By AGUSTIN C. TORRES
Yesterday, there was a larger than usual lunch-hour crowd at Boulevard Drinks, a hot dog eatery in Jersey City's Journal Square that over time has reached icon status.
People were taking cell phone pictures of former U.S. Attorney Christopher Christie, who made Journal Square one of his stops on the day after winning the Republican Party's nomination for governor.
The GOP nominee has been making frequent trips to Hudson County and Hoboken, hometown of Democratic incumbent Jon Corzine. Local Republicans knew that after elections Corzine liked to go to the Brownstone diner in the Paulus Hook section of the city. They said Christie would show up "where the working man" eats.
Just before Christie's noon arrival, there was a Jersey City Incinerator Authority truck blocking the curb in front of Boulevard Drinks, but it was not a Democratic plot, just two hot dog-loving workers who got to say hello to the ex-federal prosecutor.
The nominee acknowledged that many consider this the kickoff of the real election campaign.
"The main thing is to make New Jersey affordable again," Christie said.
