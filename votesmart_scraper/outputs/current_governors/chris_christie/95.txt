Governor Christie Requests Suspension Of Federal Regulations Permitting Airlines To Overbook, "Bump' Passengers
Press Release
By: Chris Christie

Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today wrote to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, asking her to immediately suspend the federal regulation permitting airlines to overbook flights and to remove passengers as a result. The Governor specifically cited the recent actions of United Airlines, which controls 70 percent of the flights in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport, against David Dao who was "bumped" off a flight from Chicago to Louisville.
"This conduct is abusive and outrageous. The ridiculous statements, now in their third version, of the CEO of United Airlines displays their callousness toward the traveling public with the permission of the federal government," Governor Christie said. "I know the Trump Administration wants to reform regulations to help the American people. This would be a great place to start."
The Governor said that New Jersey is examining ways it could curtail this abusive practice, but because of the federal regulation, it can be most immediately dealt with by the federal government.
