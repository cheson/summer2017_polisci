BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Governor Christie: And I'm going to use this opportunity to make sure there is tax fairness. I love reading the editorials and some comments from some members from the legislature who say that the cutting of the sales tax is unaffordable, yet whenever they raise taxes we don't hear issues of affordability. They are advocating for the largest gas tax increase in state history but you don't hear them say that's not affordable to people. Because you see, when they are taking your money, it's affordable, but when they're giving your money back, that's unaffordable. So you know, I don't understand - we're at loggerheads on the general concept. I believe all the money is the people's money and if you want to take it from them in one sense and constitutionally dedicate it, which I am for, then you have got to give them a break someplace else so that this state does not become more unaffordable than it is now. And until we get to that place where they become reconciled to the fact that we're going to have to cut some more spending, if they are ready to do that I'm ready to join in with them. But their recent conduct both in the budget and regarding TTF doesn't give me any hope.
