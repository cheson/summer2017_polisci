Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement in reaction to the announcement that the Atlantic City Alliance is pledging $30 Million to revitalize Atlantic City:

"Atlantic City's tourism and gaming industries are critical to New Jersey's economic health and competitiveness. Atlantic City is at a crossroads and the stakes could not be higher. I'm pleased that members of the casino industry recognize the importance of this effort, support the recommendations my administration has put forward for Atlantic City and have stepped up with a meaningful commitment to turning around Atlantic City. This vote of confidence from the private sector builds on the state's partnership with city government and helps pave the way for legislation we are proposing to create the Atlantic City Tourism District. Through continued cooperation with the legislature, local officials, business and industry and partnerships like this, my Administration is moving forward to secure Atlantic City's place as a premier vacation destination that is safe, welcoming and prosperous."
