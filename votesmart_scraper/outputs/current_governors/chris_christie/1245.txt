Listen first of all, I think it's great. And you know, you and I have had this conversation multiple times Michael about what it means by turning Trenton upside down. Remember now. It's a little over a year ago. I said we were going to turn Trenton upside down. Here's another manifestation of turning Trenton upside down; democrats are talking about business tax cuts in New Jersey. Okay. So, if you don't think this administration's been transformational in a year, than I point you to that example. You have democrats, talking about business tax cuts. Many of them which, were embodied in out "88 Ways to Fix New Jersey." Single sales tax factor being one of them. So, I'm encouraged they want to take up tax cuts.
