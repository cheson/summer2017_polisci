Governor Christie: This type of project allows us to increase the number of seats that are available for New Jersey students to stay and go to college or university here in our state without having to compromise for a moment the quality of the education that they would receive any place else. You know you have lots of people who talk the talk about investing in higher education, and everybody understands that a better higher education institution creates the opportunity for more good paying jobs, not only for the folks who build and renovate these building, but for the folks in the private sector who will come in and then wind up with new opportunities for growth in all these different industries in our state. It's easy to talk about it, the more difficult part is making the decision to commit the resources that are necessary to be able to make it happen. That's why I want to compliment the Senate President Steve Sweeney, the Speaker Sheila Oliver, for doing this is a bipartisan way. And I want to compliment the men and women of New Jersey who went to the polls -- and even during at times of challenging economic times -- said investing $1.3 billion in New Jersey's students will make New Jersey a better and stronger place.
