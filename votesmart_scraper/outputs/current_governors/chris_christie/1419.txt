Today, Governor-Elect Chris Christie issued the following statement in response to Governor Jon Corzine's final State of the State address:
"While we did not always agree, Governor Corzine worked hard and diligently served the people of New Jersey. But now is the time to look to the future and fundamentally change how government works if we are going to revive our state's fiscal health and help struggling New Jersey families. The challenges we currently face are too great to repeat the mistakes of the past and I look forward to working with both Republicans and Democrats to make the hard choices necessary to rebuild New Jersey."
