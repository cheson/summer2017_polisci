Governor Christie: By the time we get to two or three summers from now, every mile of shoreline, from Cape May all the way to the Bay Coast, will have storm protection, dune systems or other systems that will protect us from the next storm that may come to attack New Jersey and its residents, its economy, and our livelihood. None of this stuff is easy as you could see. We're still fighting with some people who think that their view is more important than protecting their neighbors' lives and property, but we'll continue that fight and we'll have those dunes done and the beaches widened to make sure that our entire coastline is not only a great economic engine for our state, but is a place where we can bring our children and hopefully our grandchildren, to be able to enjoy the things that really make New Jersey an incredibly unique and wonderful place to live and to raise a family.
