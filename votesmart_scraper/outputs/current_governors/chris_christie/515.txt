America must remain the home of innovation in the world. This will require investing in research and development, focusing education on the needs of employers and increasing access to capital. In addition to investing in universities themselves through research, the U.S. must do a better job matching the skills students learn with the needs of employers.

America has for many years had the deepest, most liquid, most transparent capital markets in the world. Yet America is now losing its edge, in part due to the unintended consequences of regulation. Reform which makes it easier for young high growth companies to access the capital markets is essential. To further encourage private sector innovation, the R&D tax credit should be made permanent as part of broader tax reform.
