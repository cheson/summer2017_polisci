Governor Chris Christie today released the following statement on the passing of retired Roxbury Police Lt. Joseph Franklin:
"Mary Pat and I were saddened to learn retired Roxbury Police Lt. Joseph Franklin passed away due to the injuries he suffered in a biking accident during the Police Unity Tour. The very fact he continued to join his brethren in the annual, 320-mile trek to Washington, D.C. many years after his retirement is a testament to his dedication, not only to his fellow law enforcement officers, but also to the job he held for 25 years with distinction, inspiring young people to become police officers and firefighters through the Roxbury Explorers Post he initiated back in 1991. Our condolences go out to his family, his friends, the community Lt. Franklin cherished and those he mentored."
