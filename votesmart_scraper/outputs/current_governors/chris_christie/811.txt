Today Governor Christie attended a ceremony for the new global headquarters of Zoetis, a company that is re-locating to New Jersey because of the Christie administration's pro-growth policies that are making the Garden State an attractive place to do business.
The New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) has awarded Zoetis a Business Employment Incentive Program Grant totaling $19.25 million over ten years. Zoetis is locating its headquarters and 400 jobs in Florham Park.
ZOETIS JOINS A LONG LIST OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE COME TO NEW JERSEY BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES OF THE CHRISTIE ADMINISTRATION
Under Governor Christie's leadership, New Jersey has once again become an attractive place to do business. From Fortune 500 firms to small and medium-sized businesses, more than 250 companies have used various economic development assistance offered by this administration, generating and retaining more than 70,700 jobs, bringing more than $11 billion dollars in total public-private investment to the Garden State.
THE CHRISTIE ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING NEW JERSEY COMPETITIVE AGAIN
Under Governor Christie, New Jersey has had three straight years of private sector job growth, the best 12-month period of job growth in a decade, and the best single month of job creation on record.

New Jersey is on pace for four consecutive years of positive private-sector job growth under Governor Christie. (New Jersey Department Of Labor, Private Sector Job Growth: December 2009 - December 2010; December 2010 - December 2011; December 2011 - December 2012; December 2012 - July 2013)
2012 was the best year of private-sector job growth in New Jersey since 2000. (New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, "New Jersey Employers Created 66,400 jobs in 2012," Press Release, 3/18/13)
INCREASING NEW JERSEY'S COMPETITIVENESS FOR JOB CREATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
Governor Christie's commitment to improving the state's climate for economic growth and job creation is getting results for New Jersey. After years of fiscal irresponsibility fueled by 115 tax and fee increases in the eight years before taking office, Governor Christie has turned Trenton upside down and put the state on the path to real growth.
Job-Creating Business Tax Cuts. The fiscal year 2014 budget provides an additional $213.5 million in business tax relief for a total of $540 million in the third year of bipartisan, job-creating business tax cuts to help businesses remain and grow in New Jersey.
The Christie Administration Executed Business Employment Incentive Program Grants with 110 Companies to Encourage Them to Relocate to or Expand in New Jersey. This is leading to the creation of nearly 10,770 new jobs and more than $711 million in leveraged private investment.
39 Large-Scale Redevelopment Projects Received Approval Through the Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit and Economic Redevelopment and Growth (ERG) Programs. These projects are creating an estimated 15,877 new jobs and 20,180 construction jobs, retaining 2,935 jobs certified as at risk of leaving the state, and leveraging nearly $5 billion in private investment.
Making New Jersey More Business Friendly. Through Christie Administration initiatives such as the New Jersey Partnership For Action, the Red Tape Review Commission, GrowNJ and the revitalized Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit Program, New Jersey is sending a clear signal that we are a place that welcomes investment, growth, and entrepreneurship.
