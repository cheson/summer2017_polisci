Executive Order No. 194 - Ordering all State buildings to fly flags at half-staff on Tuesday, November 24, 2015, in recognition of the lives and in mourning of the passing of Anita Datar and the other victims of the terrorist attacks in Bamako, Mali. On November 20, 2015, terrorists attacked a hotel in Bamako, Mali, killing at least 19 people. Among those murdered was a 41-year-old American, Anita Datar, who grew up in New Jersey and graduated from Mount Olive High School in Flanders in 1991, and from Rutgers University in 1995. Anita Datar dedicated her life to helping others by delivering health services to people in some of the poorest parts of the world, exemplified by her work in the Peace Corps and her distinguished career in international development.
"Anita Datar is a true hero and role model of the highest order, who bravely immersed herself in dangerous environments, and whose life's work is a testament to her tremendous courage, remarkable compassion, and unwavering commitment to improving the lives of those most in need," said Governor Christie. "It is with deep sadness that we mourn the loss of Anita Datar and all the victims of the terrorist attack in Bamako, Mali, and we pause to offer our sincerest sympathies to their families, friends, and loved ones."
