Statement by Chris Christie on the Corzine Administration's Latest Out of Touch Statement
Today, Chris Christie released the following statement regarding Treasurer Rousseau's declaration that New Jerseyans were not overtaxed at yesterday's Assembly Budget Committee hearing:
"This is just the latest out of touch comment from an out of touch Governor and administration that has continually turned a blind eye to the pain they've inflicted on New Jersey's middle class. The Corzine administration's arrogance shows their failure to understand the consequences of raising taxes and increasing spending on families simply trying to make ends meet.
I am running to stop the pain Governor Corzine has inflicted on our state's taxpayers and to make sure we have a Governor who understands the concerns of real New Jerseyans."
