Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno today joined Jimmy's Cookies CEO, Howard Hirsch, for the grand opening of the company's new facility in Clifton.
"Jimmy's Cookies had the choice to take their business out of state, and instead showed their confidence in our economy and decided to relocate to a larger facility right here in New Jersey," said Lt. Governor Guadagno. "It is important decisions like this that will save 43 people from losing their jobs and create nearly 80 new quality manufacturing jobs."
Jimmy's Cookies, a gourmet cookie and cookie dough manufacturer, first opened more than 30 years ago in a tiny Hungarian bakery in Manhattan. The company eventually relocated to a 30,000 square-foot facility in Fair Lawn before relocating to its new nearly 90,000 square-foot facility in Clifton.
"Jimmy's Cookies is grateful to the State of New Jersey for the support it continues to provide small business," said Howard Hursch, CEO of Jimmy's Cookies. "With the move into our new facility we will be able to accommodate our future production and sales growth, as we continue to expand our distribution nationally."
The relocation to a larger facility was made possible in part by a $7.53 million Grow NJ award that Jimmy's Cookies received in May 2014. This project is expected to provide the state with a net benefit of $39,492,187 over a period of 20 years.
