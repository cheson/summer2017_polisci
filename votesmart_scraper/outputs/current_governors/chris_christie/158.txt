Governor Christie: Every day we wait, there are more kids and young adults getting bottles of pills, 30 at a time. If we can stop that we can at least save some lives. It's not the be all end all but it's not a bad piece. What I've figured out in all of this is there's going to be lots of different pieces to try to solve this problem. There's a prevention piece, there's a treatment piece, there's a detox piece, there's a post-recovery piece of where do you go when you leave treatment, and sober living homes, and when you go into the emergency room, as that guy talked to me about, we now in 11 of the counties are going to have recovery coaches in the emergency rooms. Someone who is in recovery, who can look you in the eye as an addict and say I've been there, here's what you need to do and here's my number, and you're going to keep in touch with me and I'm going to walk you through this recovery and post recovery process and try to help you be a success. And not from somebody like me who's never had the problem, and you look at me and go what the hell do you know, right? But from somebody who has been there, who has been there, been at the depths, in his recovery and can give you and share that advice to you. So all those things are different little pieces we've got to work with but your story as you probably already know is a really common one and that's why I'm going after the pharmaceutical companies and the doctors to limit it. And they won't like that because that's less money but 1,600 people dying in New Jersey last year is too much, much too much.
