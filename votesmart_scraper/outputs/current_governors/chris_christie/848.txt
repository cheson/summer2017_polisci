Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statement on the Fourth of July:
"Today, we come together to celebrate our independence and the principles of freedom and democracy upon which our nation was founded. As we celebrate with our loved ones, let's take a moment to honor the brave men and women of our military, our veterans and their families who have sacrificed so much to protect our freedom here at home. Whatever else separates us, we are all Americans first, and stand united by the tremendous pride we have for our country. I wish all New Jerseyans a safe and happy Fourth of July."
