We need to examine a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to destigmatizing addiction, enhancing prevention efforts, and strengthening treatment services to address the addiction crisis we have here in our state. The Facing Addiction Task Force will be responsible for developing additional strategies to reduce stigma, reviewing the continuum of treatment services and developing recommendations for strengthening the treatment system in our state, developing prevention strategies and efforts in New Jersey and advising me on all other matters related to this issue. I've signed an executive order to this effect already and so Joe you're already on the job. I look forward to working with this team of people as we seek solutions that will broaden our efforts in removing the stigma of drug addiction, promoting treatment, counseling, and other services in order to help people reclaim their lives. I've said this many times before but it bears repeating. Every life, every life is an individual gift from God, and no one is beyond redemption. Everyone deserves a second chance at making their lives exactly what they want them to be, fulfilling the potential that God has given to each and every one of us. This is not just an assignment. This is a mission. It's a mission for us to pursue together, and I think you see the folks represented up here regardless of party or background are together on trying to make this work and work the right way.
