Location: Trenton, NJ

Reaffirming his commitment to revitalize Atlantic City, Governor Chris Christie today applauded the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority's (CRDA) approval of John F. Palmieri as its new Executive Director, calling it an important next step in realizing the Administration's forward looking, comprehensive reform agenda to bring Atlantic City back. Susan Thompson currently serves as the interim Executive of the CRDA and will return to her role as Deputy Executive Director.
"This Administration is deeply committed to making greater progress on the reform agenda we've laid out to turn around Atlantic City's gaming and tourism economy, make it a premier destination resort, and strengthen its role as an engine of economic growth and job creation for the state and region," said Governor Christie. "Over the past year, the Hanson Commission Report has provided us with a framework to focus our work on job creation, capital investment and regulatory reform. The momentum is with us to bring job creation, growth and hope back to Atlantic City and the region. Every day we are making progress to secure the growth, investment and success of Atlantic City's gaming and tourism industries and I am pleased that John Palmieri will be there to provide leadership in that effort.
"I also want to thank Susan Thompson for guiding the CRDA through this transition period," added Governor Christie. "Her responsible and dedicated leadership has moved Atlantic City forward, spurring the creation of the tourism district and a host of other development activity. I am gratified that she will continue to be a part of our Atlantic City team."
Formerly the Director of Boston's Redevelopment Authority (BRA), Palmieri brings more than 30 years of experience in planning and economic development from three different cities to his new post. While BRA Director, the Authority permitted some of the most significant projects in the city's history and sought creative ways to stimulate job growth. Prior to joining the BRA, he was Director of the Department of Development Services in Hartford, CT.
From 2002 to 2004, John Palmieri served as the first Director of Economic Development for the City of Charlotte, the nation's second largest banking center and fifth largest urban region. John developed an economic development work strategy for Charlotte, attracted a Time/Warner Headquarters and a Johnson & Wales University campus, implemented a new program to provide small businesses with financial assistance, and implemented policy guidelines for transit-oriented development. Palmieri graduated from Temple University in 1972 and earned a master's degree at the University of Rhode Island in 1976.
Since the July 2010 Hanson Commission Report, the Christie Administration has made clear advancements to revive growth and development in Atlantic City. This progress includes:
Revel Casino: The $2.8 billion project, which encompasses a 53-story, 6.3 million square foot, 3,800 room hotel and casino, will be the largest property of its kind in Atlantic City when completed. Total job creation is estimated at more than 10,000 jobs, including 5,500 permanent jobs, 2,600 construction jobs, and 1,100 manufacturing jobs.
"Boutique Casinos:" The Casino Control Commission has received an application for AC Gateway LLC (DBA Hard Rock,) Atlantic City, New Jersey to initially construct a 200-room hotel with a casino of up to 34,000 square feet.
Atlantic City Tourism District: Launched in April, the district is an area in which the CRDA is authorized to facilitate development by assuming planning, zoning and other land use functions and develop and implement a Tourism District Master Plan. These include:
* Land Use Regulation & Enforcement: The CRDA processed more than 90 land use certification applications and approved most of them within 48 hours of receipt of all required materials. Hearings were held on two applications, which are advancing to the CRDA Board for approval.
* Security and Cleanliness: A new police substation is being implemented in mid-town Atlantic City, while CRDA is assisting with converting a former visitor information center to a Boardwalk police substation. In the citywide Demolition Project, 21 structures have been cited for demolition, six have been demolished and 15 are in the hearing process.
* Special Improvement Division: New Boardwalk and beach signs were created and all old signs were replaced, with 65 Boardwalk signs installed and 50 beach signs installed at the beach entrances. Thirty additional beach signs are being created for installation. Additionally, 90 flower boxes have been installed at each beach entrance, with 30 additional boxes being constructed. Throughout the beach and Boardwalk, trash collection and other cleanliness and maintenance functions have been increased.
* Tourism Advisory Commission: The 10-member commission was appointed, met and formed four committees to address neighborhood cleanliness, safety, marketing/public relations and development.
* District Master Plan: CRDA staff is reviewing eight proposals from consultants to prepare the plan; a recommendation will be presented at the CRDA's August board meeting.
* Boardwalk Improvements: The first phase of installation of new lights has begun, Kennedy Plaza landscaping improvements are being installed and four landscaping areas at Boardwalk street ends are in the design phase.
* Facades: Construction of the Boardwalk façade for Ocean Club will begin this fall. Exterior lighting for Boardwalk Hall is being tested, with installation planned for 2012, which will provide dramatic lighting to show the building's iconic features.
* Downtown Plan: The CRDA Board of Directors approved a contract for a Workforce Housing and Retail Market Analysis, which will lay the groundwork for new housing investment. Also, ArtSpace, which the CRDA engaged in 2010, released their market assessment for an artist community. Additionally, Stockton College now holds the lease for Dante Hall and is planning uses for the theater. CRDA is advancing negotiations with The Cordish Group for Atlantic City Live.
The Inlet: A public-private partnership formed between CRDA and Revel Entertainment is facilitating infrastructure improvements and development of new housing and retail projects. Relocation of the Jitney Association is scheduled to be completed in spring 2012. Discussions have begun with regulatory agencies to replace the seawall and repair the Boardwalk in the Inlet. Also, landscape improvements on New Hampshire Avenue have been completed.
CRDA Construction Activities: More than $100 million is being invested by the CRDA in projects including widening and landscaping of Martin Luther King Boulevard, road improvements for improved access to the Revel site, construction of the Christopher Columbus Mixed Use Center (garage) opening early 2012 and Boardwalk façade improvements.
