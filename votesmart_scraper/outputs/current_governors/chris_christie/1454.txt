Chris Christie released the following statement following the passing of Governor Corzine's FY2010 budget:
"In this year's budget, like each year before it, Governor Corzine has failed to manage our state's priorities. The result is a budget that raises taxes, cuts spending for programs that matter, and leaves us in greater debt next year instead of responsibly planning for the future.
When New Jerseyans are faced with mounting unemployment, billions in new taxes and home foreclosures, it's the job of the governor, not middle class families, to plan for the future, fight for meaningful priorities and make the tough choices."
