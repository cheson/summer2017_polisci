Like all New Jerseyans, Chris understands the value of our environment, both as a state treasure and an economic engine. From the beaches and fishing industry of Cape May to ski resorts in Sussex, we need to protect our natural resources.
As US Attorney, Chris punished corporate polluters who dumped in the Delaware River and Atlantic Ocean. Chris obtained millions of dollars in settlements to invest in the preservation of open space and beach restoration.
But another threat to our environment lurks on the horizon - COAH. Chris will gut COAH and prevent the current development plan, which would bulldoze our last acres of open space to develop more than 500,000 new units of "affordable" and "market-rate" housing. There is prime, accessible real estate readily available in already-developed parts of our state - these are the areas in which Chris will focus the development of affordable housing. This will help control property taxes, revitalize our urban and transit centers and save our state's precious dwindling open space.
