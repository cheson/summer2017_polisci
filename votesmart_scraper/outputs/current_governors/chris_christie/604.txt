"North America's Energy Opportunity" - American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico Keynote Address
Thank you very much for that warm welcome.
And thank you to the members of the American Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Chamber, and the Mexican Chamber for coming here to visit with me today.
It is a pleasure and an honor to have been invited to Mexico by President Pe√±a Nieto. I am very much looking forward to my meeting with the President this evening.
I met the President and his wonderful family at a conference in the state of Idaho in the United States. Frankly we hit it off. What we talked about then was the President's commitment to growing Mexico's economy, and to forging the necessary partnerships around the world to do so.
I was very impressed with the President's vision, and with his commitment to growth. And so when he invited me to visit him here in the Mexican capital, I was delighted to accept his kind invitation.
Of course, much has happened in the time since we last met. The President has proposed and fought for historic and dramatic reforms -- in energy, in telecommunications, in the financial sector, in labor markets and education -- all with the goal of modernizing and growing Mexico's economy.
Many of us around the world have watched and admired the President's efforts. And it has been an historic summer, with the passage the energy package in Congress and signing into law this August. I know that these reforms have been the subject of great debate here in Mexico. The President has had to balance historical sensitivities with modern realities and the competitive needs of the future.
