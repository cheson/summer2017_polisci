Governor Chris Christie today announced that he has ordered a Special Joint Session of the Legislature for a second day to immediately address his Cap 2.5 Reform Agenda to provide real, immediate and lasting relief to the highest property taxes in the nation faced by New Jersey families and businesses.
"New Jersey residents have waited far too long for property tax relief. New Jersey families pay an average $7,281 in property taxes, up 70 percent in just 10 years," said Governor Christie. "Now it is time to turn our full attention to enacting real, sustainable property tax relief for New Jerseyans. The taxpayers need relief and expect us to act soon."
Acting under his authority in Article V, Section 1, Paragraph 12 and Article IV, Section 1, Paragraph 4 of the New Jersey Constitution, Governor Christie notified the leadership of the Senate and Assembly today in a letter that a Special Joint Session of the Legislature should be convened this Friday, July 2, 2010 at 12:30 p.m.
In addition to considering the proposed Cap 2.5 constitutional amendment for placement on the ballot for the November General Election, Governor Christie has also ordered the special session to address the thirty-three legislative proposals to reduce costs at the municipal, school and higher education levels.
