Governor Christie: There are three legs to the school of trying to deal with this problem. There's interdiction and enforcement, that's why Fred is here. There's the issue of education and there's the issue of treatment and I could tell you that I think as a country over the last 30 years or so on that three-legged stool we've made the leg of treatment by far the shortest leg. And so part of our goals and our efforts that the National Opioid Commission is pursuing is to even that out. It's not to take less from interdiction or enforcement, and it's not to take away from education, they're both very important, but we need to have a historic evening of those legs of the stool. And I think that we're suffering a great deal today because of our failure to be willing to acknowledge that. I'm near the end of my term, about six months or so left, seven months I guess it is now, left, and all these reporters ask me all the time about legacy and is this bittersweet and all the rest of that stuff. I don't have time yet for that, I've got work to do. I'll have plenty of time to reflect when I'm gone and I will, but I'm not using now to reflect. I've got seven months left to make a difference, and I'm going to use every day of those seven months to try to make a difference, and I hope that you use every day you've got to do the same thing. If you do, you know you'll save lives, and then you'll know you're doing God's work here on Earth, and I can't imagine there's anything better than that.
