Governor Chris Christie released the following statement regarding today's confirmation of Judge Fernandez-Vina to the New Jersey Supreme Court:
"I congratulate Judge Faustino Fernandez-Vina on his unanimous and historic confirmation to become the only Hispanic member of the Court. With his extensive experience in both the private and public sector, Judge Fernandez-Vina is eminently qualified to serve on New Jersey's Supreme Court, and has earned bipartisan support from leaders on both sides of the aisle.
