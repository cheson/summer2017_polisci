New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie today released the following statement regarding the Phase II Interim Consultant's Report on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey:
"Last year, we directed the Port Authority to undertake a full and independent audit of its operations and finances in order to be responsible and transparent to our taxpayers and toll payers. Today's conclusions by two independent reviews show that the Port Authority is finally on the right track, and the necessary reforms put into place by the agency's leadership are beginning to deliver results, just as we demanded. The Port Authority plays a powerful role in the economies and transportation infrastructures of our two states. We thank its management for their hard work, and together we will continue to invest in and rebuild the states of New York and New Jersey."
