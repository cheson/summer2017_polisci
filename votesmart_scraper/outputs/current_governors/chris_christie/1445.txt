Press Release: Governor Corzine's Policies "Fail" To Create Quality, Sustainable Jobs For New Jerseyans
Statement

Today, Chris Christie released the following statement on New Jersey's latest unemployment rate:
"Another month where our unemployment rate goes up is not good news for New Jersey. A 9.3% rate is no reason to celebrate especially when you look at the fact that some of our counties are suffering unemployment rates upwards of 10% and the city of Camden is suffering with 18% unemployment. Governor Corzine's policies have failed to create quality, sustainable jobs that will give New Jersey families security and stability. When you consider that once the summer ends and seasonal jobs at the beach no longer exist, New Jersey's unemployment rate is at a shocking 9.6%, higher than the national average.
Combine today's news with a 30% increase in the number of home foreclosures and the fact that last month we outranked our neighbors in jobs lost and all of this signals a state in crisis. Before Governor Corzine calls today's unemployment "a change in the economy," he should remember that behind these numbers are families struggling to make ends meet with no real relief in sight. Today's news is just the latest in a series of clear indicators that Governor Corzine has merely stood by and watched as our state's economy has only gotten worse, wishing and hoping for a turnaround instead of taking the steps necessary to lead New Jersey to recovery."
