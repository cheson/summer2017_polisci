You know when you're in the silly season like we're in now -- everybody running around and campaigning for different things -- when we see the craziness we're seeing down in Washington DC today where people who say that they want to be in public life to try to run the government and then their solution to doing that is to not speak to each other, not work with each other, and shut our government down, that's a failure. That's a failure of people in public life for everyone in this country who's depending upon a government that will get its stuff together. And notice, since I'm only 35 days away from an election, I said stuff and not something else which I know you all figure I would be more apt to say. But we're 35 days away from an election so I'm trying to clean up my act a little bit. You know, we need to make sure that we have a government that listens to the needs of the people who pay for it. You know it's not the other way around. We're not supposed to be dictating to you, we're supposed to be listening, and I think much too much in politics these days we have folks who have forgotten that one of the most important parts of leadership is listening. Listening to people of divergent views and opinions. Listening to the folks who pay the bills. Listening to the people who are going to lead our state and our country in the future. And so, we're going to do a lot more listening around here and a lot less talking. And I hope in Washington what they figure out is that what we pay them to do when we send them down there is to run the government, not to shut it down.
