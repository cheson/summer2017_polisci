Governor Chris Christie released the following statement on the legislature's consideration of driver's licenses for undocumented individuals:
"I am disturbed by the Legislature even considering making undocumented individuals eligible for New Jersey driver's licenses. As a former United States Attorney, I know that the driver's license is the single most important piece of homeland security identification. Yet, the Legislature proposes giving that to people with no definitive proof of their identity. To consider doing this in the current environment is not only irresponsible, but dangerous. If it were to ever reach my desk, it would be vetoed immediately. Protecting the security of the people of New Jersey is the governor's single most important responsibility."
