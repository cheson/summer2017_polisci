Governor Christie: Cybersecurity attacks continue to rise here and around our nation -- whether it's a department store data breach, a corporate theft or sabotage by bad actors throughout the world. In the past few months alone, New Jersey's public schools, universities, our governments, and small businesses have seen a significant uptick in cyber-attacks--from low-level website defacements to sophisticated denial of service operations, including one that crippled the Rutgers University network for days during final exams. While we worked with our federal partners and responded and were able to mitigate the incidents, it has become increasingly imperative that we do all we can to secure and protect New Jersey's digital landscape. So today, I am signing Executive Order # 178 creating the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell or of course because everything has an acronym, NJCCIC, and since that's kind of long they're going to make me say "NJ KICK." Now I don't quite know how that works exactly, but that's what it says here and I'm sure Rodriguez came up with this. I'm not going to call it much of anything after today, except to call it our defense and our offense against this type of capability. It's a collaboration comprised of representatives from our Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness led by Dr. Rodriguez, New Jersey State Police led by Colonel Fuentes and the Office of Information Technology (OIT), and is located at the Regional Operations Intelligence Center at the ROIC in West Trenton. NJCCIC will act as the central State civilian interface for coordinating cybersecurity information sharing, performing cybersecurity threat analysis, and promoting shared and real-time situational awareness between and among the public and private sectors.
