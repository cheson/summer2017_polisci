Eric Scott: Governor, can we take a couple of minutes, I want to talk to you about the bridgegate trial that has been going on this week and I know you addressed some of this briefly early at the Statehouse. David Wildstein testified today that he and Bill Baroni bragged to you about the lane closures when they were going on. Bragged to you about ignoring calls for help from the Mayor of Fort Lee, that you laughed along with them, that you made sarcastic comments. Did you say to him Mr. Edge wouldn't be involved in anything political?
Governor Christie: Let me tell you, as I said today Eric, first off, I'm not going to get into commenting on every word that comes out of the mouths of every witness because quite frankly there seems to me there's been as much evidence and testimony about people, not just me but others, who are not charged as there has been about the people actually charged. So I'm not going to get into responding to all this stuff. I'll just say this, that I went back today and looked at what I said to you in 2014 in the first Ask the Governor I did after the bridgegate revelations became public. And I said you know what there's not a need for me say anything different than what I said then, which is, let me be really clear, with you as I was today at the Statehouse. I knew nothing about the lane realignments before they happened, I knew nothing about the lane realignments as they were happening, I had nothing to do with the planning of it, I had no, nothing to do with authorizing it and we sit here now, nearly 3 years later and there has not been one scintilla of evidence to contradict what I just said. And you know that's it, I mean there's nothing else I can do.
