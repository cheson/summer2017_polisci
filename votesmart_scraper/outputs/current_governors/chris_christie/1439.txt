Today, Chris Christie released the following statement after home foreclosure rates for July showed an increase of 43 percent:
"In Jon Corzine's New Jersey, foreclosure filings went up 43 percent in July as more and more people lost their jobs and are on the verge of running out of their unemployment benefits. In Jon Corzine's fantasy, he sees our economy rebounding, but the reality is that foreclosure filings increased 50 percent or more in eight different counties as homeowners desperately struggle to make ends meet. New Jerseyans are facing a daunting 9.3% unemployment rate with nearly 200,000 lost jobs in the last year alone, and the only thing Jon Corzine is offering are more broken promises. Enough is enough - the only chance we have to put a stop to Jon Corzine's failed policies which have only driven our economy further into the ground is to change governors."
