The Star-Ledger is reporting that Gov. Jon Corzine has a stake in a hedge fund connected to the ownership of four New Jersey casinos, which potentially creates a conflict with state laws that prohibit state officials from business connections to casinos. Corzine says his investment in with TPG-Axon and is not related to its sister company, Texas Pacific Group (TPG), even though they share the same office and personnel.
This morning, Republican gubernatorial candidate Christopher Christie criticized Corzine for "a colossal error in judgment" and said the governor might be in violation of state laws.
"The real possibility of law breaking should have prevented Jon Corzine from putting his personal financial gain ahead of his role as Governor," said Christie.
Christie called on Corzine to disclose details of his TPG investments and divest himself of any casino-related funds.
"In the interest of transparency... any delay in giving New Jersey taxpayers the complete truth is a continued violation of their trust and will only further raise doubts about his integrity and the integrity of the government he leads," Christie said. "Governor Corzine's latest lapse in judgment raises many questions that will need to be answered in the days ahead."
