Governor Christie: What we're doing here, and why I raised this five years ago, was because of my experience in the federal system. And when I came here as governor, not having engaged in the criminal practice in the State courts at all during my private practice career, I was amazed to hear about the type of problems we were having with people being detained, because they couldn't meet a minimal amount of bail, who had engaged in non-violent activity, and on the flip side, the continued release, mandatory release by our Constitution of really dangerous predators that judges would reluctantly have to let back out on the street. And I heard from county prosecutors, as I began to interview the ones that were already here and then appoint new ones, about what a difficult time they were having in their individual counties trying to control crime while having these folks get back out on the street again. So this was a process that took five years for us to get here, because it was a significant change in the way the New Jersey criminal justice system did business, but I think one that is going to yield great results. We need to be vigilant about this. These changes are some of the most important things that we've been able to accomplish over the last seven years that will have some of the most long lasting effects for our least fortunate citizens, and those folks need our representation, and they need our assistance in making sure this works the right way.
