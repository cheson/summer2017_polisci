Location: Trenton, NJ

Acting on his commitment to ensure a fair application of the state's gun laws that respects individual rights to possess firearms and that also protects public safety, Governor Christie today took action to make commonsense changes to New Jersey's gun regulations that ensure victims of domestic violence or violent crime, or those living under a direct or material threat, have their firearms applications processed quickly and without delay. The Governor announced that the Attorney General will file a regulatory change that will ensure expedited, priority firearm application processing for victims of domestic violence, violent crimes, or those who have a demonstrable threat against them, including those who are seeking to obtain or carry firearms for self-protection.
"I have always said that when there are sensible changes to improve our laws and the fair administration of justice, I will take action, and that is what I am doing today. The Constitution grants and our courts have affirmed the individual right to bear arms as a fundamental right, and that is all the more important for those who are victims of violence or under threat," said Governor Christie. "This commonsense step will protect the rights of victims and people at risk of violent acts by giving them priority, while ensuring the core protections of the permitting process remain fully in effect."
The Governor has spoken out about the tragic murder of Carol Bowne, a Camden County resident, by her ex-boyfriend earlier this month. Bowne secured a restraining order against her ex-boyfriend and filed an application for a handgun permit in April. Less than two months later, and with her application delayed beyond the 30-day statutory deadline for its processing, she was stabbed to death in her front yard by her ex-boyfriend.
Under the changes proposed by the Governor today, such an application would be reviewed and processed for approval or rejection on an expedited, 14-day basis, if possible, if either of the following circumstances exist:
