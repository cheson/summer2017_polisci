Governor Christie: If money equaled success, Newark would be the greatest school system in New Jersey, because it's been more well-funded than any school system anywhere in the state. So you can continue to be part of the old orthodoxy, I understand that. You know, go across the street, you know, talk to those cats. I'm sure they'll tell you that give me more money, and they'll give you even this much better. But go and talk to parents in neighborhoods in Newark and ask them, ask them why they're flocking to charter schools in the thousands. Answer the question as to why our growth in charter schools across the state has been based upon enormous demand in our urban centers, which we're not even close to meeting yet, because those parents want to vote with their feet. So I just continue to reject the premise of your question, which is that more money equals betters results. It simply doesn't. It doesn't, John. And I don't know how many more years we're going to have to spend more money until I can convince guys like you and others that more money doesn't equal better results. Competition will equal better results, longer school day, longer school year, getting rid of these work rules, getting rid of last in and first out. Getting rid of all these things that impedes student progress are as important, if not more important than just continuing to pour more money into the system.
