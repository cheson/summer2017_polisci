Governor Christie: There Is No One Else But Us

Every increase in the dollars devoted to pension and health benefits is a decrease in dollars invested in other priorities that you all talk about on the floor of this chamber and the Senate. It's a decrease in other priorities creating a series of missed opportunities to build a better New Jersey. We will miss the opportunity to give our young children the chance to be successful with a quality education no matter where they liveWe miss the opportunity to give a second chance to those battling drug addiction or reentering society from prison to become valued and contributing members of the communityWe will miss the opportunity to boost take home pay for working class taxpayers by providing tax relief and new jobs which lead to fulfilling careers. That everybody is the cost of inaction. This is the cost of doing nothing. This is the cost of pushing this off to somebody else. There is no one else. There is no one else but us. That's why I am here today to ask you to do what may be politically difficult, but what is morally the right and only thing to do. This is the type of leadership that our state requires. Coming together. Thinking differently. Fighting for all the people who sent us here. Addressing the long-term. That is how we get things done.
