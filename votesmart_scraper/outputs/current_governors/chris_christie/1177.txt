Governor Chris Christie Applauds Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission Action to Eliminate E-Z Pass Perks
Press Release
By: Chris Christie

Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today issued the following statement welcoming the action taken yesterday by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission (DRJTBC) to come into compliance with his September 16, 2010 directive to abolish the practice of providing free E-Z Pass trips that are not available to the general public:

"The granting of free passage to authority Commissioners, officers, employees or retirees, simply by virtue of their current or former employment, sends the wrong message to the toll paying public and represents yet another type of abuse common in New Jersey's "shadow government.' I'm pleased that the DRJTBC has joined the other entities in receipt of my directive and acted to come into compliance with my demand that these inappropriate perks be brought to an end. My Administration will continue to take a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to the abuse and misuse of public resources, and continue to insist on accountability and ethical conduct in the conduct of all authority, board and commission business."

Since taking office, Governor Christie has worked aggressively to rein in the waste, abuse and misuse of public funds and resources at so-called "independent" authorities, boards, commissions and bi-state agencies in New Jersey. The action taken by the DRJTBC brings it into line with similar prohibitions on the use of E-Z Pass and other free passage called for by Governor Christie and implemented by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the South Jersey Transportation Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Delaware River Port Authority, and the Delaware River and Bay Authority.

On September 16, 2010, Governor Christie issued letters to each of those agencies demanding that they move to eliminate the use of E-Z Pass perks at toll payer expense.
