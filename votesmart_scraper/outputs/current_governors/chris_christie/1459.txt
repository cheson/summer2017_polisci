Thank You
Last night we celebrated a victory, but this morning the real work is just beginning. New Jerseyans are struggling and our state faces serious problems.

But we know that New Jerseyans don't back down in the face of trying times and big challenges. We meet them head on. I know this because I am the same way. It was my approach as U.S. Attorney and it's the same philosophy I'll bring to the governor's office. For too long our state has suffered because Jon Corzine and almost every governor and candidate before him has wasted time with empty rhetoric and broken promises that have gone unfilled again and again.

Well, not anymore.

I'm not afraid to put up a fight and work for meaningful change. It's time for a governor who doesn't rely on campaign gimmicks and unrealistic slogans. We need to start taking steps that will get us to where our state belongs. Instead of hoping and wishing for the unattainable, we need to start working on what we can achieve.

At the end of the day, it's not about Republican or Democrat ideas or simplified, partisan talking points. It's about whether government is actually working for the people and whether there is honesty and integrity in government's actions.

I know this is the New Jersey we all want and I am ready to work together to make it happen.
