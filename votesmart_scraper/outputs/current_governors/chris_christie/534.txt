Governor Christie laid out a plan focused on keeping communities safe while helping non-violent offenders reclaim their lives

Camden As National Model For Community Policing

Effective law enforcement requires a police force that is engaged in their community and has the necessary resources and support. In Camden, New Jersey -- long one of the most violent cities in America -- Governor Christie joined a coalition of county and community leaders that brought about a fundamental restructuring of the city's police force and a rethinking of their engagement with those they serve.
Police can build trust while also keep people safe through a focus on community outreach, putting officers right on the streets and investing in cutting edge crime-fighting technology.
In Camden, residents have begun to see the benefits of these types of reforms with a 22 Percent Overall Drop In Violent Crime and a 51 Percent Reduction In Homicides.
Restore Fairness And Common Sense To The Justice System

Focus on Treatment First Through Drug Courts: Governor Christie has championed the use of drug courts in the state of New Jersey, which allow first time, non-violent offenders, the opportunity to get the treatment they need rather than serving jail time. The Governor expanded mandatory drug court for first time non-violent drug offenders across the state, and is calling for the expansion drug courts to every state. Governor Christie is also calling for ending the current dysfunctional, ad-hoc approach for implementing drug courts being used on the federal level and as President, would make drug court mandatory in all 94 federal districts.

Common-Sense Bail Reform: It is fundamentally unfair that in some cases individuals charged with minor, non-violent offenses can be held in jail while awaiting trial simply because they cannot afford bail, while dangerous and violent offenders can be back out on the streets because they can.
