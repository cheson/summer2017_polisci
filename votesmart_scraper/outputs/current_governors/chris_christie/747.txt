Many of our new initiatives recognize a core feature of modern American life: that the quality of education and the quality of life in our communities are inextricably intertwined. That's why this year we need to be more aggressive, and bolder, in fixing our failing schools - and delivering a choice to those for whom today the only option is a bad option: a failing school. It's a moral obligation everybody. We must give every New Jersey child the chance to graduate from high school, to be ready for college if they so choose, and to prepare for a career. If we fail to meet this obligation, we compromise the life of that child, and we hurt the quality of life in our communities all across New Jersey. So, failure is not an option.
