Governor Chris Christie's Statement On The New Jersey Supreme Court Pension Ruling
Statement

Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement on today's New Jersey Supreme Court pension ruling:
"Just one year ago today, New Jersey taxpayers won a major victory against the unsustainably high costs of the public pension system. Under today's Supreme Court decision state taxpayers have won another huge victory, one that spares them from the burden of unaffordable benefit increases for public employee unions. Today's ruling allows the state to continue providing full, on-time payments to the public pension system and avoids more than $17.5 billion dollars in additional, unaffordable costs. It also affirms my administration's position that our Constitution and public pension system must work for all New Jerseyans, not just the special class of public union employees who represent just 8.9% of New Jersey's population.
I continue to urge the Legislature and stakeholders to work with me on a long-term solution to make our pension system and public employee benefit costs affordable and sustainable. That will not be accomplished by the Democrats' current plan to change the state Constitution to impose $3 billion in additional taxes every year on the people of New Jersey."
