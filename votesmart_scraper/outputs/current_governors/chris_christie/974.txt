Statement from Governor Chris Christie on Passage of Budget Legislation
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: June 25, 2012
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie released the following statement:
"With today's budget, Corzine Democrats reversed course and sent a loud and clear signal that they want to go back to the eight years prior to my administration when taxes and fees were raised every 25 days. After two years without raising taxes, the only way to feed the Corzine Democrats' obsession is to hold tax relief hostage. I will not allow New Jersey to go back to the same failed policies that nearly put our state over a fiscal cliff. Tax relief for our hardworking families is long overdue and that is exactly what I will continue fighting for."
