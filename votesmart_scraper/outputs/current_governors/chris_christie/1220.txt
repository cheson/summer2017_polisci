Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement:

"New Jersey has long been at the forefront of efforts to honor the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Our focus now, in order to make Dr. King's dream a reality, is to bring every family hope by transforming our public education system into one that truly gives every child in New Jersey an excellent education. Our current system, which caters to the feelings of adults at the expense of our children's education, must be changed. All New Jerseyans should unite to fix the broken status quo, and make every New Jersey child's dream a reality."
