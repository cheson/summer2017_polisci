Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: May 5, 2016
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today signed A-156 (Tucker, Vainieri Huttle, Dancer, Quijano, Wimberly, Mosquera, Kean, O'Toole) to criminalize "upskirting" under New Jersey's invasion of privacy laws.
"As parents in this highly digital age, we're always concerned about protecting our children and our privacy, and a big part of doing that is for state criminal laws to keep up with new and emerging technologies," Governor Christie said. "This new law targets perpetrators of a perverse and growing form of pornography that victimizes vulnerable women and children in a matter of seconds."
This new law prohibits a person from photographing, filming, publishing and sharing the image of the clothed intimate parts of another person without consent and under circumstances in which a reasonable person would not expect to have his or her private body parts observed. The act of recording "upskirt" images or videos is a fourth-degree crime; the act of publishing or sharing is a third-degree crime; and the law allows victims to seek civil damages.
A fourth-degree crime is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. A third-degree crime is punishable by a term of imprisonment of three to five years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.
The Governor also took the following action on other pending legislation:
