Governor Chris Christie Signs Legislation Enhancing Protections For Domestic Violence Survivors
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: Jan. 9, 2017
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today signed legislation to enhance protections for survivors of domestic violence.
This new law will deter domestic violence, partly by increasing criminal penalties for offences including maximums for repeat offenders, as urged in Governor Christie's conditional vetoes of earlier versions of this legislation.
"This new law will help prevent domestic violence in New Jersey by enhancing criminal penalties and ensuring immediate compliance with stronger protective orders," Governor Christie said. "Survivors of domestic violence will be safer than ever before. I am proud we came together to enact this model legislation that is much more than just symbolic and is real reform that fulfills our primary responsibility of improving public safety in New Jersey."
This new law reinforces existing laws by creating a more in-depth process to ensure domestic violence offenders' firearms, identification cards and permits are confiscated as required while they are subject to restraining orders. It forces offenders to immediately upon sentencing -- rather than after several days -- arrange for the surrender of their firearms, identification cards and permits to a law enforcement officer. It also requires an order for a temporary or final restraining order to include notice to the defendant of the penalties for a violation of any provision of the order, including but not limited to the penalties for contempt of court and unlawful possession of a firearm or other weapon.
In addition to signing S-2483/A-4126 (Weinberg, Beck/Mosquera, Greenwald, Downey, Houghtaling, Munoz, Sumter, Benson, Lampitt, Wimberly) into law, the Governor also took action today on the following legislation:
