Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement in response to new development proposal for World Trade Center site:
"While I am heartened and supportive of the broad outline that is leading to the conclusion of negotiations between the parties, I remain steadfast that any final agreement protect the taxpayers, commuters and toll payers of New Jersey and New York. We have a moral duty to the memories of those we lost in the World Trade Center attacks to rebuild this site, and we also have a fiduciary duty to New Jerseyans and New Yorkers to make sure that our final agreement is financially sensible and fair."
