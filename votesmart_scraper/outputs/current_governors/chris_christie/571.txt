Governor Christie: I think as most of you know this administration takes a pretty aggressive view towards its ability to be able to take steps that it needs to take. I am not at the moment dissatisfied with what's being done. If I become dissatisfied I will sit with my Chief Counsel and the Attorney General along with the Commissioner of Health and the Superintendent of the State Police. I'll ask them what more they think we should be doing and then we'll explore what our legal options are, but I'm not at this point dissatisfied with what's going on and I think from that perspective in terms of what our ability is to do on screening I'm content at the moment, If I become discontent I will take whatever steps I believe are necessary to protect the public health of the people of New Jersey and if someone wants to sue me over it they can.
