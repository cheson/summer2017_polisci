Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement on the 60th Annual National Day of Prayer.
"As New Jerseyans of all faiths mark the 60th Annual National Day of Prayer, we continue a powerful tradition starting back in 1775 of taking a moment and pausing to pray in every corner of our country. Today, as we celebrate unity and prayer, let us remember the common threads that are shared by all faith communities, and join one another in praying for civility, tolerance and peace. I encourage everyone to pray for their families and communities, the leaders of our country and our nation's brave servicemen and women and their families."
