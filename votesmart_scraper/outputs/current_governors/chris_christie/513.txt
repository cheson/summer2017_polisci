Mr. Speaker...

Members of the legislature...
Friends and citizens of New Jersey:
I come before you, as required by the state constitution, to report on the condition of our state.
The state of our state continues to get better.
New Jersey is better off than it was last year at this time, and it is certainly far better off than it was just five years ago.
While many first years of a second term show a hangover from the campaign and its partisanship, we have fought through that tradition and have real accomplishments to show for that action in 2014.
In a year with plenty of politics from some overly partisan corners of this chamber, New Jersey has made progress -- growing our economy, creating jobs, reforming our criminal justice system, and improving some of our most challenged cities -- like Camden.
We've done it because a majority of us care more about our state and New Jersey's middle class than we do about scoring partisan political points.
