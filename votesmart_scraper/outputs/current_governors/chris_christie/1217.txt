Joining a nationwide movement to highlight the need to provide high-quality education to every child, Governor Chris Christie signed a proclamation today designating January 23rd - 29 th, 2011 as School Choice Week in New Jersey.
"Across the county, thousands of people are standing up for our children to demand change that is long overdue in our public schools. Like-minded Democrats and Republicans can seize the moment and the momentum to fundamentally alter education opportunities and pass them on to the next generation," Governor Christie said.
"In New Jersey, over 100,000 children are trapped in nearly 200 chronically failing schools. They need access to a better education and they need it now -- not a year from now or ten years from now. Giving students the opportunity to succeed, to have a better education and to once again have hope is a our moral obligation we must not avoid. I am proud to stand with reform advocates across the nation to continue pressing the need for change."
Across the United States, education reform advocates are utilizing the first-ever National School Choice Week to shine a dramatic spotlight on the need for effective educational options for every child, regardless of their zip code or economic circumstances. More than 150 state and national organizations are planning and are expected to attract tens of thousands of participants.
Governor Christie has made a reform agenda aimed at bringing a great education to every student a top priority of his Administration, and already secured several key achievements to provide more options for children and families trapped in failing schools:
