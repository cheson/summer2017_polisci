Let's face it, if my children are living under the same school calendar that I lived under, by definition, that school calendar is antiquated. It's antiquated both educationally and culturally for the world we live in. Life in 2014 is much different than life 100 year ago, and it demands something more for our students. It is time to lengthen both the school day and the school year in New Jersey.
