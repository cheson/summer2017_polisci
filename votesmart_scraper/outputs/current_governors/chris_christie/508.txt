Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: Feb. 5, 2015
Location: Trenton, NJ

Along with other action taken today, Governor Christie today signed A-3969/S-2647 that will make government smaller and more affordable for taxpayers through a consolidation of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority and the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission. Noting concerns with the bill in its current form, the Governor signed the bill based on negotiations and bipartisan agreement with the bill's sponsors -- Speaker Vincent Prieto and Senator Paul Sarlo -- to move forward with follow-up legislation to address those issues. "Though this legislation is imperfect in its current form, I believe it is important that we act to move forward with this commonsense consolidation of government to deliver savings to New Jersey taxpayers while we move forward with bipartisan agreement to address concerns with the current bill," said Governor Christie.
Governor Christie also took the following action on other pending legislation:
