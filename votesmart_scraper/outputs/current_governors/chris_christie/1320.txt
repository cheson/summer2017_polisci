Hi, this is Governor Chris Christie. Back on March 16th I presented a budget to the State Legislature that closed an $11 Billion budget gap without raising any taxes on the people of the State of New Jersey. At the time, they said it couldn't be done -- that you couldn't bring Republicans and Democrats together to close the largest budget gap of any state in America and do it without raising taxes. Well, today I am glad to report to you that I have signed the budget; the budget that closes that $11 Billion budget gap without any new taxes; the budget that puts us back on the road to fiscal sanity.
Now this is just the first step of what we have to do to make Trenton responsive to the people and to make government smaller and smarter and more efficient. We need now immediately to give you a voice in controlling the biggest problem in the history of New Jersey, property taxes. We have the highest property taxes in the nation and I proposed constitutional cap to cap property taxes at no more than a 2.5% increase per year. And under my plan, the only way that that can be changed is if you voted to change it. But we have little time left. In the next ten days we need the State Legislature to act to put Cap 2.5 on the ballot for this November's election. I need you to call your legislator. I need you to call them now with one simple message -- Let me vote.
If you do that, we can cap property taxes and really put the state of New Jersey on the road to fiscal sanity and property tax relief and reform. It's great being your governor. I'm happy to have been able to do this budget and I look forward to bringing more reform to New Jersey every day I'm in this office. Thank you all very much.
