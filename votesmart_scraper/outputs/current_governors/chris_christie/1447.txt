On Campaign Trail, Christie Says Corruption Tax' Hurts Businesses
In announcing his proposals for ethics reform, gubernatorial candidate Chris Christie said corruption hits business owners hard.
At a small, crowded church hall in Paramus on Wednesday afternoon, the Republican challenger to incumbent Jon S. Corzine cited the potential $1 billion cost of corruption reported by NJBIZ earlier this week, adding that he wasn't sure what the exact cost totals.
"I do know this: There is a corruption tax in New Jersey," Christie said.
Christie said he would work to reduce corruption through a package of 10 proposals, ranging from eliminating the ability to hold multiple public offices and receive multiple public salaries, to requiring officials to relinquish their pensions if they are convicted of corruption.
The candidate also said pay-to-play laws should apply equally to labor unions and other interest groups as they do to business contributors.
Christie emphasized that corruption in the state has crossed party lines, but criticized Corzine's leadership on the issue.
"This is not a Democratic problem. This is not a Republican problem," said Christie, who built his reputation as a corruption buster while serving as U.S. attorney for the state. "This is a New Jersey problem."
He noted a mock headline on the day of the corruption sting that said everyone in New Jersey had been arrested.
"It really would be truly funny if we were not the people who were paying the price, both financial and spiritually" for corrupt officials' conduct, he said.
