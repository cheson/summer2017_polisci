Our destiny is not set -- it is the product of the choices we make. Our future is not set -- it, too, is the product of the choices we make from this day forward. So, let us choose wisely. We're set here to act, let's not fail to act. Let's create an attitude of choice. Let us choose to invest in better schools, and not in a status quo in which we leave some children behind and put the rest at risk of being swallowed up by a rising tide of mediocrity and failure. Let's choose the path of safer streets, let's not leave our families vulnerable to the heartless carjackers who would destroy our quality of life. Let us celebrate every life by creating an opportunity for every citizen, through an excellent education, a productive job, and a safe and thriving community. In this hour of choice, let us choose a better New Jersey. You see, this is what we owe our citizens, our children, and ourselves. New Jersey has long been blessed, really blessed, by an abundance of natural resources, and by our extraordinary human talent. In 2014, we've also been blessed by a return to prosperity. Let us all choose to make the most of it and let us choose to do it together. We have succeeded working together to be an example for the entire country, to spirited bipartisanship, let us not abandon that course. It is the course to success and happiness for all of the people of the state of New Jersey. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the great state of New Jersey
