Statement By Christie-Guadagno Campaign Manager Bill Stepien On Jon Corzine's Latest Television Ad
Christie-Guadagno Campaign Manager Bill Stepien released the following statement regarding Jon Corzine's release of his first positive television ad of the general election:
"Since the start of the general election, it's been nothing but negative ad, after negative ad from Jon Corzine. Now after four misleading, attack ads in a row, Jon Corzine finally launches his first positive ad of the campaign and he doesn't say a word. Considering nearly 200,000 New Jerseyans have lost their job in the last year, unemployment keeps rising and we still have the highest tax burden in the country, it's no surprise Jon Corzine is at a loss for words."
