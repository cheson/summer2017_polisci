Matt Lauer: Alright Meredith thank you. With an economy on edge many states are facing many difficult choice. New Jersey's Governor Chris Christie is making waves for his no-nonsense approach to fixing his state's budget problems. Governor Christie it's good to have you here, good morning.
Governor Christie: Good morning, Matt.
Matt Lauer: So much for flying under the radar --
Governor Christie:
Matt Lauer: You've been in office for about six months now?
Governor Christie: Yes sir.
Matt Lauer: And you're making headlines. Let me give you a sample of what they're saying and writing about you, okay. "The nation's most interesting governor," "governor wrecking ball", "a human bulldozer" and my personal favorite, "Chris Christie may look like Chris Farley, but in terms of conservative principles he's as sexy as Christie Brinkley." Are they all right?
Governor Christie: . Uh, well I don't know about that last one. But you know listen, I think we're taking a very direct, blunt approach to the problems. We're treating the people of New Jersey like adults. And tell them the truth, we're in awful shape and we need to get it together.
