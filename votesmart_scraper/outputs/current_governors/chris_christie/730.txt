Governor Christie: It's just another proof point to the fact that when we work together we can make the dreams and aspirations of children in our state come true no matter where they live, regardless of their zip code, regardless of what those dreams and aspirations are. I believe that each one of these children is an individual gift from God. And if you believe that, as I do, then to do anything other than to try to help them reach the fullest of their God given potential is a sin. And not something that any of us should stand for in this society if we can do something to help it. Brandon, put it very well. You know, if you see a need and you recognize it, there is an obligation for you to do your best to try to fulfill it. The state's trying to do that every day, both in what we do as a government and in the partnerships that we put together with the private sector as well and we have some wonderful private sector partners in this state who're helping us to do that.
