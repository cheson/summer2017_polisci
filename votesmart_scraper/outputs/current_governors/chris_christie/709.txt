Governor Christie Extends Term of Seasonal Alcoholic Beverage Licenses in 2014
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: Feb. 20, 2014
Location: Trenton, NJ

Continuing to support Shore businesses preparing for the 2014 tourism season, Governor Chris Christie signed Executive Order No. 151 allowing seasonal alcoholic beverage licensees to begin serving alcohol on March 1, two months ahead of the normal date of May 1. After many Shore businesses suffered extensive damage from Superstorm Sandy, Governor Christie last year expanded the term for the 2013 summer season.
"Last year's extension spurred much-needed economic activity at the Jersey Shore by allowing businesses to open early and welcome customers ahead of the summer tourism season," said Governor Christie. "Helping Sandy-damaged Shore businesses get back to full strength has been a top priority of my Administration, and we've been working closely with the business community along the Shore to hear their needs and concerns. Because of the additional support and relief these businesses saw from last year's expansion, we will once again advance the start date and allow these businesses to get a head start on the 2014 summer season."
Under the provision of the Executive Order for calendar year 2014, the date on which seasonal alcoholic beverage consumption licensees shall be permitted to commence serving alcoholic beverages shall be advanced from May 1, 2014 to March 1, 2014 and shall end on November 14, 2014.
