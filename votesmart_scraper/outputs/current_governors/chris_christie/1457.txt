Statement by Chris Christie on the Agreement Between Governor Corzine and CWA
Chris Christie released the following statement regarding the hastily reached contract agreement by Governor Corzine and the Communication Workers of America (CWA) union:
"This agreement illustrates all that is wrong with Governor Corzine's timid style of governing. First, he was bullied into a bad deal costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. Just as bad, he tried to pretend that this deal represents savings when all it does is pass along higher costs to taxpayers in the years to come. While Governor Rell of Connecticut got hundreds of millions in savings from her public employees, Governor Corzine has once again sold out taxpayers for his public employee union friends.
As Governor, I will not be bound by this deceptive election year deal which once again hurts New Jersey taxpayers. I will impose the tough decisions Jon Corzine is unwilling to make for New Jersey."
