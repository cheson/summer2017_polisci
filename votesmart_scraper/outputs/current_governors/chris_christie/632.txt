Governor Christie: You Gotta Inflict Some Pain

I started to say this in January, in the State of the State address I told people this is an unsustainable system and we need to get back to fixing it. People don't want to hear that down in the state capitol but it is the truth and the numbers show that and I'm going to spend the rest of this summer traveling around the state showing you the numbers and making the case and because it's my obligation, I will also propose solutions to how to fix the problem. I can guarantee you one thing, I can't tell you about the plan today because I'm not finished with it but what I will tell you is that whenever it's released it will be universally criticized and the reason it will be is because it will inflict pain. Because there is no other way to fix a severe problem like this but with pain. There's no other way to do it and we all know that. When we're trying to balance our checkbooks in our own homes, if one of our spouses loses their job, if we are getting ready to send kids to college and we haven't saved all the money that we should, if we have a disaster in the house, pipes bursts, things happen and we gotta pay expenses we haven't normally had to pay, what do we do? We figure out ways to cut back someplace else.
