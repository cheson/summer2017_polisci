Location: Trenton, NJ

Further emphasizing his commitment to a healthy coastal environment, a strong shore economy and a revitalized Atlantic City, Governor Chris Christie today visited "America's first boardwalk," which National Geographic recently ranked as best in the nation. The Governor also stopped by the site of the new Revel Casino to get a first-hand look at its progress. The $2.8 billion project, which encompasses a 53-story, 6.3 million square foot, 3,800 room hotel and casino, will be the largest property of its kind in Atlantic City when completed. Total job creation is estimated at more than 10,000 jobs, including 5,500 permanent jobs, 2,600 construction jobs, and 1,100 manufacturing jobs.
"Atlantic City is a microcosm of how the environment, tourism and the economy are interwoven," said Governor Christie. "Through landmark legislation, we've taken measures to ensure the growth, investment and success of Atlantic City's gaming and tourism economy, strongly opposed off-shore drilling in New Jersey as well as drilling off the coast of other nearby states and fully restored beach replenishment funding to its full level. We are making progress every day so that Atlantic City will not only have the "best boardwalk in the nation' -- it will be the best vacation and gaming destination in America."
Further demonstrating the appeal of Atlantic City as a place for future development and business investment, the Casino Control Commission recently received three expressions of interest for small-scale or staged casino licenses. The potential licenses include AC Gateway LLC (DBA Hard Rock,) Atlantic City, New Jersey; ACE Gaming LLC, Las Vegas, Nevada; and California Avenue Ventures, LLC, Northfield, New Jersey.
Additional inroads have been made since the launch of the Atlantic City Tourism District in April. The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) has implemented a seamless absorption of the Special Improvement District, approved more than 90 land use certification applications, set in motion implementation of new police substations, embarked on a Boardwalk beautification program, formed an advisory commission and acted on several other initiatives. It also began the process to fold in the Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Authority -- the state agency responsible for tourism marketing and convention sales.
Highlights of the CRDA's progress include:
* Land Use Regulation & Enforcement: The CRDA processed more than 90 land use certification applications and approved most of them within 48 hours of receipt of all required materials. Hearings were held on two applications, which are advancing to the CRDA Board for approval.
* Security and Cleanliness: A new police substation is being implemented in mid-town Atlantic City, while CRDA is assisting with converting a former visitor information center to a Boardwalk police substation. In the citywide Demolition Project, 21 structures have been cited for demolition, six have been demolished and 15 are in the hearing process.
* Special Improvement Division: New Boardwalk and beach signs were created and all old signs were replaced, with 65 Boardwalk signs installed and 50 beach signs installed at the beach entrances. Thirty additional beach signs are being created for installation. Additionally, 90 flower boxes have been installed at each beach entrance, with 30 additional boxes being constructed. Throughout the beach and Boardwalk, trash collection and other cleanliness and maintenance functions have been increased.
* Tourism Advisory Commission: The 10-member commission was appointed, met and formed four committees to address neighborhood cleanliness, safety, marketing/public relations and development.
* District Master Plan: CRDA staff is reviewing eight proposals from consultants to prepare the plan; a recommendation will be presented at the CRDA's August board meeting.
* Boardwalk Improvements: The first phase of installation of new lights has begun, Kennedy Plaza landscaping improvements are being installed and four landscaping areas at Boardwalk street ends are in the design phase.
* Facades: Construction of the Boardwalk façade for Ocean Club will begin this fall. Exterior lighting for Boardwalk Hall is being tested, with installation planned for 2012, which will provide dramatic lighting to show the building's iconic features.
* Downtown Plan: ­ The CRDA Board of Directors approved a contract for a Workforce Housing and Retail Market Analysis, which will lay the groundwork for new housing investment. Also, ArtSpace, which the CRDA engaged in 2010, released their market assessment for an artist community. Additionally, Stockton College now holds the lease for Dante Hall and is planning uses for the theater. CRDA is advancing negotiations with The Cordish Group for Atlantic City Live.
* The Inlet: A public-private partnership formed between CRDA and Revel Entertainment is facilitating infrastructure improvements and development of new housing and retail projects. Relocation of the Jitney Association is scheduled to be completed in spring 2012. Discussions have begun with regulatory agencies to replace the seawall and repair the Boardwalk in the Inlet. Also, landscape improvements on New Hampshire Avenue have been completed.
* CRDA Construction Activities: More than $100 million is being invested by the CRDA in projects including widening and landscaping of Martin Luther King Boulevard, road improvements for improved access to the Revel site, construction of the Christopher Columbus Mixed Use Center (garage) opening early 2012 and Boardwalk façade improvements.
Later in the day, Governor Christie concluded his beach tour with a visit to the Ocean City boardwalk, stopping at Mack and Manco's Pizza, Shriver's Taffy and Johnson's Popcorn along the way. There, he continued his focus on protecting New Jersey's beaches, clean waterways and open space areas.
New Jersey's tourism industry posted $35.5 billion in total expenditures in 2010, representing an increase of 0.8 percent over 2009. The shore economy is a critical aspect of the state's overall tourism economy. The tourism economy across Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Ocean counties represented 193,000 private sector jobs and over $6 billion in wages and salaries in 2010.
