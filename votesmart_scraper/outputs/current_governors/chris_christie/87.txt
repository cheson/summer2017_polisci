You are not only a large part of the protection of our country and its freedoms, but in this part of the state, I will tell you, you are a large part of the state's economy. And we are extraordinarily grateful and will be forever vigilant and protective of the existence of this Joint Base in this part of New Jersey. This is an enormously important part, that contributes not only to the economic fabric of this region, but also the cultural fabric of this region. Our service men and women are contributing each and every day in the community, to help make these communities a more vibrant better place. And so I know that Congressman MacArthur, Congressman Norcross, and the others in the New Jersey delegation will always remain vigilant, as will the state government, about the fact that this Joint Base not only fulfills a vital military and national security mission for our country but also is an indispensable part of the economic future of the State of New Jersey as well. So as Governor, I am really proud to be here, I am thrilled that all of you have come to join us today. I want to thank Deborah and Cooper for their willingness as great corporate citizens to step up and to be there for our veterans. I thank the members of Congress who are here as well for their continued support in Washington D.C. And I look forward to all of the great care that will be given to Veterans and their families through HeroCare Connect. It will be a model that I hope is replicated not only around our state but around our region and our nation to make sure that when veterans need help they get it and they get as soon as it's humanly possible to give it.
