Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: May 20, 2015
Location: Trenton, NJ

Ensuring that the 21st century threats against New Jersey's cyber and digital security are met with 21st century solutions and a coordinated, prepared response across government and with the private sector, Governor Chris Christie today signed Executive Order 178 creating the State's first-ever New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC) within the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness.
"Cybersecurity is not just a national issue -- it's a local one that demands shared responsibility, collaboration, and constant vigilance across industries and sectors, especially in a digitally-dense state like New Jersey," said Governor Christie. "Our interconnectivity is one of our state's strengths, but it's also increasingly a threat for those who would seek to disrupt or harm people in our state. Through the NJCCIC, we're working to protect our citizens' privacy and ensure the public and private sector are prepared to manage their cyber risks."
The NJCCIC will act as the central State civilian interface for coordinating cybersecurity information sharing, performing cybersecurity threat analysis, and promoting shared and real-time situational awareness between and among the public and private sectors.
As one of the first of its kind in the country, NJCCIC will reinforce New Jersey's pro-business environment, empower small businesses to manage cyber-risk, bolster infrastructure resiliency and protect privacy.
