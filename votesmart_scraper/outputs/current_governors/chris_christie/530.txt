Issue Position

This era in which the Obama administration tries to accomplish its ideological goals through the regulatory state must end.Regulation should be used to implement actions explicitly authorized by statute. Further, the next president should review every rule and executive order published under this administration during the transition, so that on day one, the most egregious and unlawful ones can be revoked.

We should restore the principle that for any new regulatory change proposed that the benefits outweigh the costs. We should also impose a "Regulatory Zero" rule in which for each new rule that is imposed, one of equal cost must be sunsetted or removed. Additionally, we should impose a hard cap on what it can cost for employers to complying with all federal regulation.
