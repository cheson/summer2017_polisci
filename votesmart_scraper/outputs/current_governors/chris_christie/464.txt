Governor Chris Christie Takes Action On Pending Legislation
Press Release
By: Chris Christie

Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie today took action on legislation and vetoed several bills, including one designed to revise the Fiscal Year 2015 budget to provide one-half of certain environmental damage recoveries for costs of remediation, restoration, and cleanup and another bill on reporting and disclosure requirements for State tax expenditures.
The Christie Administration fully supports the restoration and remediation of natural resources throughout New Jersey, which is evidenced by the $50 million dollars allocated for these purposes in 2015 directly from recoveries as well as the $334 million dollars appropriated overall to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. The vetoed legislation, S-2791/A-4281, (Sarlo/McKeon, Schaer, Prieto, Quijano, Wimberly, Caride) would amend the Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2015 to allocate one-half of all environmental damage recoveries above $50 million to the costs of remediation, restoration, and cleanup of natural resource damage.
"The protection and preservation of the ecological wonders of which New Jersey is so proud have always been critical considerations when weighing where New Jersey's limited budget dollars should be delivered, but there are always challenging decisions that must be made when balancing a complex State budget," said Governor Chris Christie. "The allocation determined as part of the collaborative State budget process strikes an appropriate balance between the environmental and fiscal needs of the citizens of New Jersey, and goes as far as possible to continue the restoration of the natural spaces and waterways our citizens enjoy."
Governor Christie also conditionally vetoed S939/S-1403 (Singleton, Schaer, Benson, Eustace, Mosquera/Greenstein). The bill, as written, would modify tax expenditure reports produced by the Department of the Treasury during the annual budget process. Further, the legislation would require additional reports regarding tax expenditures associated with development subsidies primarily used to incentivize large-scale development projects in areas companies might not otherwise consider. Governor Christie is recommending modifications to the bill that would take a more holistic view of a project or investment rather than requiring a series of performance indicators that may skew the actual benefit assessment.
