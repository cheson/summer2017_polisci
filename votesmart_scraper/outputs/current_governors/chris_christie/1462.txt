Statement by Chris Christie on the Trial of Joseph Coniglio
"I commend the U.S. Attorney's Office for its continued success in fighting political corruption. The result validates the confidence the Office had in seeking the indictment in the first place. Senator Coniglio's guilty verdict is just the latest example of why a comprehensive reform plan is so badly needed in Trenton."
