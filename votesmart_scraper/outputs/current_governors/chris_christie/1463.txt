Statement by Chris Christie on the Latest Unemployment Numbers
Chris Christie released the following statement regarding the unemployment figures released by the State of New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development today:

"Today's unemployment figures sadly report that New Jersey lost another 17,200 jobs last month. We know Governor Corzine and his administration haven't accepted the fact that New Jerseyans are overtaxed. Given New Jersey ranks last in business tax climate and first in overall tax burden, it's clear to me - our state's high taxes equal less jobs and less opportunity for New Jerseyans.

It is amazing, however, that Governor Corzine actually managed to increase employment in the one place where we need it least - government. Let's face it, New Jersey families are hurting and they deserve a Governor who understands that out of control taxes and a shriveling job market threaten the livelihoods of all New Jerseyans."
