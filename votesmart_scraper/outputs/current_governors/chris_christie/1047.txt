Governor Chris Christie: First, we need to have real civil service reform. We need to have real civil service reform because without it, you will not be able to manage your municipalities in a way that will allow you to maximize the benefit for your taxpayer and the service to your constituents. Second, we need to have real shared services support and reform. So that you can get the obstacles -- and civil service being one of the major ones -- out of the way to begin to share services in a way that will be cost effective for your taxpayers and still provide efficient services to your constituents. And third, we need real sick pay reform. Now on these issues the administration has already -- on two of the three -- we have already put forward our ideas on how to get this done. Like civil service reform, we sent the conditional veto to the legislature quite some time ago to be able to deal with civil service reform. And we are happy to use that as a point of continued discussion and hopefully compromise with the legislature during this lame duck session to get real civil service reform for all of you so that the second point can become possible.
