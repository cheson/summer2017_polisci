Governor Chris Christie today lauded the work of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for moving quickly in order to find a fiscally responsible and cost effective solution that will remedy the height clearance issue of the Bayonne Bridge.

"New Jersey's ports are vital to the economic growth and competitiveness of our state and the region," Governor Christie said.
