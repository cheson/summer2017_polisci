Statement by Chris Christie Following Testimony of David Rosen
Today, Chris Christie released the following statement following the testimony of David Rosen, budget and finance officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, before the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee today in Trenton:
"Just 27 days ago Governor Corzine stood before New Jersey voters and told us that his budget would include a $500 million surplus, something that none of us believed. Today, a non-partisan source finally tells the truth - $100 million in the hole. It's not just disappointing that Governor Corzine's projections were so far off the mark - it's downright scary. It's going to take more than Wall Street smarts to help New Jerseyans, but a governor willing to make the tough choices. New Jersey voters can trust that I'll tackle the tough decisions head on to get our budget in order - like a Constitutional Amendment requiring a 2/3 vote of the Legislature for any tax increase, insisting any new or expanded program have a four year sunset provision and fighting for an independently-elected State Auditor."
