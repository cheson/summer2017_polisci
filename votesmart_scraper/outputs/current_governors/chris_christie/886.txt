Statement From Governor Chris Christie on Holocaust Remembrance Day
Statement
By: Chris Christie
Date: April 8, 2013
Location: Trenton, NJ

In recognition of Holocaust Remembrance Day (Yom HaShoah), Governor Chris Christie released the following statement:
"It is just as important today that we do not forget the memory and lessons of the horrors of the Holocaust. The atrocities and industrialized genocide inflicted on the Jewish people awakened the world community to the true terror of unchecked evil, left permanent scars on our moral conscience, and created an urgency to act in order to prevent such inhumanity from ever occurring again. In many ways, the backdrop of affairs in many parts of our world continue to be shaped by the realities of that experience, both for Israel and the Middle East and for genocide as an issue around the globe. At this time of remembrance, we reflect on the more than six million innocent lives taken in the Holocaust, all those who fought and died to liberate the world from the Nazi regime, and our collective obligation to always remember the lessons from persecution of this magnitude. In doing so, I hope all New Jerseyans will rededicate themselves to our foundational principles of freedom, self-determination and justness in our society and in our world."
Governor Christie proclaimed April 7 -14 Days of Remembrance in memory of the victims of the Holocaust throughout New Jersey.
