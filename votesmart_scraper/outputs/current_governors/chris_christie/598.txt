Governor Christie: We've had the opportunity to talk a number of times over the last few days about the seriousness and the intensity of the threat that now faces us, especially in light of the path that the President has enunciated in his speech to the nation last week. And our job, the job of myself and Governor Cuomo as we see it is to lead and make sure that the appropriate amount of intensity is being brought to the task of protecting our region. And that's why we've issued the directive we have to our State Police and to our Homeland Security Advisors to do an initial review and then a complete review of the way we're protecting our assets and our people in this region. Those reviews will come back to myself and to the Governor and we will take, as he mentioned, whatever steps are appropriate and necessary recommended by law enforcement and in our judgment necessary for the protection of our people and our region to make sure that we are responding appropriately to the current threat. And so I thank the Governor for like this and many other issues, our partnership over the last number of years in making sure that we're doing our jobs for the people of this very interconnected region in a way that's going to keep us safe. I spent seven years as the U.S. Attorney in the immediate aftermath of September 11th. I'm acutely aware of what's been done during those seven years and what has continued to be done since I left that position but we need to make sure that we are ahead of the curve on this and not in a responsive mode but as Governor Cuomo put, in a proactive mode to make sure we're doing everything that needs to be done to protect the people of our region.
