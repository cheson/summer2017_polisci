Governor Christie Takes Action On Pending Legislation
Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: May 1, 2017
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Chris Christie signed into law today several bills to empower New Jersey's military members and veterans, including a bipartisan initiative to create the "Veterans Diversion Program."
The new law, S-307/A-4362 (Van Drew, Allen/Andrzejczak, Mazzeo, Land, Tucker, Benson, Bramnick), requires the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs to collaborate with its federal counterpart and develop a statewide program providing appropriate case management and mental health services to eligible military service members who have committed nonviolent offenses. The department will publicize a directory of existing federal and State case management and mental health program locations, which will serve as points of entry to facilitate support and services.
"It is impossible to imagine the courage, sacrifices and experiences of the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect the American people and our freedom," Governor Christie said. "This critical legislation gives back by supporting New Jersey's military service members when they need it most and when their lives depend on it. This new program will strengthen families and communities, by empowering veterans with individualized, holistic care and steering them clear of the criminal justice system."
Other military and veterans' bills signed by Governor Christie today require the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMAVA) to develop an informational website for Gold Star families; require DMAVA to notify local county veterans' affairs offices and State veterans service offices of the death of a New Jersey or other service member whose surviving beneficiary resides in the State in order to inform the beneficiaries of federal and state benefits and creates a designated Gold Star family member liaison for each county veterans' office; and, retains eligibility for New Jersey National Guard members or reserve components of the U.S. Armed Forces called to active federal military service who met maximum age requirements at the closing date of civil service examinations.
Governor Christie also took action on the following bills:
