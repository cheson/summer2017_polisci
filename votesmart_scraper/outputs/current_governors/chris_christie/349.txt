Today, Governor Chris Christie issued the following statement after learning of the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia:
"The tragic passing of Justice Antonin Scalia is an enormous loss to our entire country. Justice Scalia was the bedrock of the Court who, with unmistakable wit and good humor, was unwavering in his fidelity to the Constitution and a fierce advocate and protector of the liberties and freedoms it grants to us all as Americans.
"Justice Scalia was a Trenton-born New Jerseyan and the first Italian American to serve on the Supreme Court. He was an example and inspiration, and a leader we are proud to call a native son of New Jersey. Mary Pat and I send our thoughts and prayers to his family and loved ones, and the countless friends who mourn him tonight."
