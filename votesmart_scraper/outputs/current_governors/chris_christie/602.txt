BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Governor Christie: I'm happy to be back in Camden, and thank you Principal Dixon for having us here at the Catto School, and I had an opportunity to walk around the cafeteria and meet some of the kids and have a good conversation and then also go to a first grade class. They drew me pictures, which was great. It's great to see how each one of them thinks I actually look in the first grade, which was really good, and as Dana said this is a city that's near and dear to my heart. I believe in the people of this city and I believe in the leadership of this city and this county. What I tell people all the time when I talk about Camden is that unlike other places in our state this is a place that has truly come together to welcome partnership, to welcome change that we all knew was necessary because in this city the interests of the children have really been placed first.
