Press Release
By: Chris Christie
Date: April 20, 2011
Location: Trenton, NJ

Governor Christie has provided strong leadership on the most pressing environmental issues facing New Jersey. The Governor and his Administration have acted on a commitment to protect New Jersey's natural resources and environment, improve air and water quality, incentivize the cleanup of contaminated sites, and better manage the State's natural resources, while also making the Garden State competitive and attractive for business investment.
"From our beautiful shore to our rivers, mountains and farms, our state's environmental landscape is full of invaluable treasures that are inseparable from our New Jersey identity," said Governor Christie. "Our collective obligation to carefully and responsibly preserve these gifts for our children and grandchildren is a top priority of my Administration, and a principle that will continue to guide our environmental policy every single day."
Governor Christie has protected New Jersey's shore economy and coastline by opposing off-shore drilling in New Jersey and off the coast of other states that could negatively impact our State, opposed LNG (liquefied natural gas) facilities off the coastline, and unveiled a 10-point plan of action to restore Barnegat Bay. At the same time, Governor Christie has moved New Jersey forward with an agenda to promote our clean and renewable energy industries. Governor Christie signed key legislation into law to grow New Jersey's renewable energy industries by removing barriers to the growth and expansion of solar technology, promoting offshore wind projects and working aggressively with fellow east coast states and the federal government to promote commercial wind development.
