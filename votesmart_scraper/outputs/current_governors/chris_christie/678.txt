Governor Christie: I Never Thought I'd Be The Weather Governor
Statement

When you elect a governor you never know what's going to come across his or her desk. Believe me, when I was elected in 2009, I never thought I would be like the weather governor. I mean it's pretty much the first four years I have been the weather governor. It's been blizzards, snowstorms, three feet of snow one day, a foot and a half the next, you know, 500,000 tons of salt that we've used already this winter compared to last winter when we used 225,000 tons of salt, two hurricanes, four nor'easters, and thirty-plus declarations of a state of emergency in four years. I didn't think that's what I was signing up for. The point is when you become governor you never know what you're signing up for, except for this, that you owe everybody every day your honesty and your best effort, and that's what I try to bring to you every day. I know that there are plenty of people, some here, some outside of here, who don't agree with everything I do. And if you're looking for the perfect candidate to vote for - for any one of these jobs - I suggest you go home and look in the mirror. You are the only person that you agree with all the time. You're it. You are it. You're the only person you agree with all the time. So the great thing about what's happened in New Jersey over the last 4 Â½ years between us has been that I know there are some times I say things that you don't agree with and I'm sure that you shake your head over. There's certainly things I've done that you don't agree with, but in the end the support that I felt from people has been that you believe I think in the main that I'm doing my best, and I'm trying to work as hard as I can for you.
