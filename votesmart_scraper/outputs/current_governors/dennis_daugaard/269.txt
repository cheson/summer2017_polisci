Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that Standard & Poor has revised South Dakota's state outlook from "stable" to "positive" and renewed the state's AA+ issuer credit rating.

"This is good news for South Dakota. Not only did S&P grant us a strong credit rating, they affirmed our optimism about the state's direction," said Gov. Daugaard. "We've worked hard to place our state on a firm financial footing, and that stewardship is paying off."

The outlook evaluation serves as a measurement of how a state is trending. South Dakota earned a positive outlook thanks in part to strong personal income growth relative to the nation, its historical record of conservative budgeting, and recent legislative and executive changes in monitoring and forecasting revenue.

S&P cites the state's fully-funded pension program among the reasons for an improvement in outlook, and says if the state continues on the same path they could raise South Dakota's rating.

Recent changes to the state's long-term financial planning practices also contributed to the improved outlook, and S&P indicated that, as these changes become reliable practices over time, they will have an even greater effect on South Dakota's issuer credit rating.

In their release of the rating, S&P indicates South Dakota is on the right track to be considered for future upgrades. "Should the state continue to demonstrate prudent fiscal management and structural budgetary balance in the next two years as it implements and indoctrinates the new policies to meaningfully influence continued stability in its historically strong financial position, operations and debt burden, we could raise the rating."
