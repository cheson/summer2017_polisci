Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that the state Bureau of Finance and Management has released for public review the State of South Dakota Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.

The annual report contains state government's complete financial statements and other financial information. All of the statements are audited by the Department of Legislative Audit. CAFR received an unqualified "clean" opinion for the 26th consecutive year.

Contained in the report is information about the state's economic conditions and outlook, the profile of the government, major initiatives, and financial analysis of the state government funds. A discussion of those topics can be found in the Letter of Transmittal and Management's Discussion and Analysis.

"South Dakota's economy continues to grow even during times of national and global economic uncertainty," Governor Daugaard said. "Our state's favorable business climate and strong agriculture base has helped the South Dakota economy outperform the national economy over the past several years. Recent data supports this, as the state's average annual income growth rate from calendar year 2008 through 2011 was 4.2 percent, or the second highest growth rate of all states and much higher than the national growth rate of 1.3 percent in the same period."

CAFR can be viewed online at http://bfm.sd.gov/cafr/SD_CAFR_2012.PDF or for printed copies, please contact the Bureau of Finance and Management at 605-773-3411.
