As a part of Gov. Dennis Daugaard's efforts to make government more efficient, the State of South Dakota today rolled out a pardon website for individuals seeking clemency, making South Dakota the only state in the nation with such a tool.

"I am proud South Dakota is the first to have an online, paperless pardon process," said Gov. Daugaard. "The task of making state government more efficient and accessible requires a constant effort. In the last six-and-a-half years we have also created a Boards and Commissions portal and an administrative rules website, and put more online than ever before. Economic development grants, restaurant inspections, payroll information and vendor payments are now posted and easy to find."

The new website, doc.sd.gov/pardon, is a guided, interactive process to help applicants determine eligibility, complete the application and submit a request online. It is mobile-friendly and clemency seekers can complete the application on their phones.

There is no cost to apply for a pardon on the website. Fees to obtain court documents and assessments still apply.
