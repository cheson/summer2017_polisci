Gov. Daugaard Says State Government Preparing for Federal Shutdown
Press Release
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: April 8, 2011
Location: Pierre, SD

As uncertainty looms in Washington D.C., Governor Dennis Daugaard would
like to reassure South Dakotans that appropriate steps are being taken by state government to minimize disruption to citizens if the federal government shuts down. The Governor's primary concern is for citizens relying on federally-funded programs. The Governor understands that a number of programs -- such as Medicaid, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and Social Security -- will be unaffected by a partial federal government shutdown.
However, much of this programmatic information may not be available until after a federal government shutdown occurs. The Governor has requested Cabinet officials to evaluate every program to determine potential impacts.
A second concern of Gov. Daugaard is the possible impact on the more than 11,000 federal employees and another 4,000 federally-funded state employees in South Dakota. The Cabinet has been requested by the Governor to analyze the impact on each and every position supported
by federal funds.
"There is still significant uncertainty surrounding which state employees, if any, will or will not be affected if there is a partial shutdown of the federal government," Gov. Daugaard said. "We are not going to make rushed judgments based on incomplete information from the federal government so I have directed all state employees to report to work on Monday and conduct business as usual. Once we have better information appropriate actions will be taken. I am hopeful by then that the folks in Washington have come to resolution on behalf of the American people."
