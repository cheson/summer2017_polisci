The Daugaard Administration has reached new tax agreements with three of South Dakota's tribes, the Governor announced today. The Crow Creek Sioux, Oglala Sioux and Sisseton-Wahpeton tribes entered into agreements with the state earlier this summer.

"I thank tribal officials for working with us on tax collection. The relationships formed between the tribes and state officials have resulted in solid agreements which are beneficial to both parties," Gov. Dennis Daugaard said. "These tax agreements help tribes by providing thousands of dollars in tax revenue. They also benefit our state by advancing tax uniformity and fairness."

The new tax deals are the three latest tribal tax agreements put in place under the Daugaard Administration. The state also has agreements with the Cheyenne River, Rosebud, Standing Rock and Yankton Sioux tribes.

The Department of Revenue works with tribal officials to collect the taxes enumerated in each agreement. Each tribe's portion of revenue collected under the agreement goes back to the tribe, and the tribe retains full discretion over how to use that revenue.
