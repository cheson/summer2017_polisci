Press Release

Gov. Dennis Daugaard praised South Dakota legislators today for their passage of the state government budget in General Appropriations Bill.
"This budget meets my goal to eliminate our $127 million structural deficit this year," the Governor said. "We did this by making tough choices and cutting spending. We did not raise taxes or use emergency reserve funds to continue overspending. We have put South Dakota on a sound financial footing for the future."
The state budget, which Gov. Daugaard will sign into law when it reaches his desk, includes general fund cuts of at least 10 percent to every Executive Branch agency. The plan also includes provisions that allow for smaller cuts to K-12 schools and Medicaid providers.
"We listened to the concerns of the voters about our schools and our health care providers," the Governor said. "I appreciate the efforts of our legislators, who worked closely with me to craft a budget that addresses these concerns but adheres to our principles."
The FY2012 budget meets the principles Gov. Daugaard set forth in his Jan. 19 budget address:
* Eliminate the $127 million structural deficit and balance the budget, this year.
* Do not use emergency reserve funds or other one-time funds for ongoing
expenses, because we should not spend more than we take in.
* Do not raise taxes.
