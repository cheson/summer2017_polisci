Gov. Dennis Daugaard has announced today that Waterfowl Production Area lands closed as part of the federal government shutdown have now been re-opened effective immediately.

"I applaud the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for their decision to re-open Waterfowl Production Areas to public use," the Governor said. "These public lands are a valuable asset to our citizens, and are of particular importance during our fall hunting seasons."

Lifting the closure on WPAs opens more land available during South Dakota's resident-only pheasant season Oct. 12-14, open only on public hunting land. The traditional statewide pheasant season will open on Oct. 19.
