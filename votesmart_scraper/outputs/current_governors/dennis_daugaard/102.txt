Press Release
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: March 7, 2016
Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard has signed Senate Bill 114, the USS South Dakota bill, into law.
The bill appropriates $100,000 to the South Dakota Department of Military to support the USS South Dakota (SSN-790) Commissioning Committee's activities. The Committee will be raising additional funds from the private sector.
The Virginia-class submarine is under construction and is expected to be completed in August of 2018. It will be the first submarine to bear the name USS South Dakota.
In the twentieth century, two naval battleships were named after the state: the USS South Dakota (ACR-9) commissioned in 1908 and the USS South Dakota (BB-57) commissioned in 1942.
