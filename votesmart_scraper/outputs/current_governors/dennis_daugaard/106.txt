Governor Holds Press Conference On Medicaid Expansion
Press Release

Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard today held a press conference on Medicaid expansion at the Capitol. The Governor announced he would ask legislators to remove federal funding authority from the state budget to expand Medicaid this legislative session.

South Dakota received a formal decision on the Indian Health Services policy change from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services late last week. With only a few days left of the legislative session, the Legislature does not have adequate time to thoroughly consider the issue, Gov. Daugaard said.

The Governor expects the proposal will be ripe for legislative consideration later this year or in the 2017 Legislative Session.
