Governor's Column: Paying Down Debt To Make College More Affordable

About 15 years ago, Linda and I added a small addition to our house near Dell Rapids. We took out a small mortgage on our home to pay for that improvement. Until about three years ago, we were making a monthly payment against that debt. Every once in a while, when we had extra cash, we paid more than was required so that we could pay it off faster.
When state government builds a building, we "issue bonds" rather than "take out a mortgage." But it works in basically the same way. The state commits to making regular payments for many years to repay these debts. And if we repay early, we can stop making the payments.
A couple of years ago, our state received some unexpected, one-time revenue. I joined with the Legislature to dedicate that money to early repayment of tens of millions of dollars in debt. The payments we'd been making were repurposed to increase state aid for K-12 schools, Medicaid providers and state employees.
This year, I am proposing something similar. Our state's rainy day funds have increased beyond our targets, and the state again has some one-time revenues. In my budget, I proposed that the state use $42 million to repay debts from building projects at our state universities and technical schools.
The state universities and the technical institutes will no longer need to make payments against these debts. They have committed to use the annual savings to avoid increasing tuition. If my budget proposal is adopted, tuition and fees will be frozen -- there will be no increase next fall.
We all read about the increasing cost of education and about student loan debt. We do not want students to be forced to leave school because they cannot afford it, or to graduate with a too-heavy debt load. The best way to avoid that is to make school more affordable by holding down tuition.
