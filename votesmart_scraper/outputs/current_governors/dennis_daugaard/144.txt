Gov. Dennis Daugaard today offered testimony on the Endangered Species Act at a House Natural Resources Committee hearing in Washington, D.C.
"In South Dakota, we take an active role in protecting and promoting species present in the state," said Gov. Daugaard. "Unfortunately, state governments are often left out of the conversation when it comes to ESA decisions. Allowing state agencies to play a more active role in the administration of the ESA is an adjustment that can and should be made."
"In a state like South Dakota where approximately 80 percent of land is privately owned, it is critically important to take into account the potential impact an ESA action could have on landowners. More importantly, landowners need to be engaged with ESA candidate species discussions early in the process," Gov. Daugaard said.
