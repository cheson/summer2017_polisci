Gov. Dennis Daugaard discussed federal transportation funding with members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation at a roundtable meeting this morning in Washington, D.C. Gov. Daugaard attended the meeting as a part of a delegation from the Western Governors' Association.
"States need a federal transportation program that is flexible and reliable, and involves state and local governments in the decision process," said Gov. Daugaard. "It's particularly important for western states, which make up two-thirds of America's land mass, to have adequate transportation systems in order to ship goods to the rest of the nation."
