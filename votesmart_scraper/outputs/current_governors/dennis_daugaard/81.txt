Gov. Dennis Daugaard issued the following statement today on the passing of Colette Abbott, wife of USD President Jim Abbott:
"I first met Colette Abbott 25 years ago when she and Jim hosted a fundraiser for Children's Home Society. She and Jim continued their support over the years and Colette joined the board and was an advocate for abused and neglected children and battered women. Linda and I were shocked and saddened to learn of the loss of this great South Dakota woman. Her family will be in our thoughts and prayers."
