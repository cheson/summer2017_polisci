Governor Favors Surplus State Land Sales for Economic Development
Press Release

Gov. Dennis Daugaard is asking the Legislature to approve the sale of surplus state-owned land and related personal property in several counties as a means to boost the amount of funds available for economic development grants and loans.
"This is an idea I talked about during the campaign," the Governor said. "Shortly after taking office, I initiated an audit of state-owned land to find property that the state simply doesn't need. Rather than holding onto these scattered parcels, we will redeploy the proceeds from these sales
to invest in business development in South Dakota."
Proceeds from real estate sales will be put into the Revolving Economic Development and Initiative Fund (REDI), which is used to foster business expansion and create jobs. In addition, the Board of Regents will be authorized to sell extraneous university system real estate and use
those proceeds to acquire desirable real estate or make capital improvements to the public higher education system.
Gov. Daugaard is asking for discretion to sell state-owned real estate belonging to the Department of Corrections in Custer, Minnehaha and Aurora counties; land belonging to the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs in Fall River County (but not real estate intended for construction of a new veterans' home); real estate under control of the Bureau of Administration in Hughes County; and Department of Human Services real estate in Spink and
Yankton counties.
Proceeds from the sale of Human Services Department property in Yankton County would be dedicated for the use and benefit of the Human Services Center at Yankton.
The Governor's proposals are included in two bills that will be introduced Monday in the Legislature.
