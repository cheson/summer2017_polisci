The 88th South Dakota Legislative Session concluded last week. During our two month legislative process, the demands are great on our legislators. They come to the Capitol early and leave late. They study policy, work with constituents, and gain perspective on the process.

Nearly 500 bills were introduced in the 2013 legislative session. Unlike Congress, our legislature gives a public hearing and an up-or-down vote on every bill. South Dakota's system allows for public input and open discussion of the issues our state faces.
South Dakota's way works. We do not have a full-time legislature with thousands of staffers. South Dakota relies on the neighborly, common sense approach of its citizen legislators.

This session brought great examples of cooperation and productivity from the legislature, even as Washington, D.C. continued to find division and deadlock. In South Dakota, our work this session has been heralded as "one of the most productive in recent memory."

We passed monumental reforms to our prison system by bringing together law enforcement, judges, treatment providers, defense attorneys, and legislators from both political parties. The reforms will make our state safer while holding offenders more accountable and saving taxpayer dollars. These changes will more effectively change the behavior of non-violent offenders. This could have been a controversial bill, but it won broad bipartisan support.

We authorized an extension of the Mickelson Trail to Mount Rushmore, and founded Good Earth State Park at Blood Run, South Dakota's first new state park in forty years.
