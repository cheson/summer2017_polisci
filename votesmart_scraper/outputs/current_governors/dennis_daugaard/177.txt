Statement

Location: Pierre, SD

This morning, the United States Supreme Court announced its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, holding that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states.

"I would have preferred for this change to come through the democratic process, rather than the courts," said Gov. Daugaard. "We are a nation of laws, and the state will follow the law. I will be working with the Attorney General to ascertain what this ruling means for state and local governments."
