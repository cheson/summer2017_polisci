The Western Governors' Association today elected Gov. Dennis Daugaard to serve as the organization's vice chair.
"The Western Governors' Association is an effective coalition of states," Gov. Daugaard said. "Our states are geographically large and we share common ground on issues like energy, transportation, invasive species and management of federal lands. I am honored to have the opportunity to help lead this group."
As vice chair, Gov. Daugaard will lead the WGA resolution process and work with the WGA chair, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock. After serving for one year, the vice chair generally succeeds the chair.
The Western Governors' Association is a bi-partisan group made up of 19 states and 3 U.S.-flag islands. The election of chair and vice chair took place at the WGA annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Nine western governors attended the meeting which was hosted by outgoing chair Gov. Matt Mead.
Also at the gathering, the governors adopted seven new policy resolutions.
