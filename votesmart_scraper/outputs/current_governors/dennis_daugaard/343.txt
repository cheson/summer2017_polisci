As part of his mission to streamline government and promote openness, Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced on Tuesday the launch of an administrative rules website.

"Government should be open and transparent," said Gov. Daugaard. "The state rule-making process can be confusing, but this site is going to make it much easier for citizens to track our efforts and to comment on proposed rules."

The website will provide the public with the relevant information about previous and currently pending administrative rules in one location for easy access.

The new website includes an archive section for rules that have already been passed, links to audio and minutes from public rules hearings and interim rules committee hearings, hearing notices, hearing dates, drafts of the rules packages, and effective dates.

Subscribers can sign up to be notified when an agency posts a new rules package and interested parties are also able to submit comments about rules packages through the website.
