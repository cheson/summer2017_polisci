Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard departed today (Friday, April 5) with a group of South Dakota business and agriculture leaders on a trade mission to China.

"South Dakota companies have immense growth potential in the Chinese market," the Governor said. "I am pleased to have representatives from so many excellent, export-ready South Dakota companies joining me, and I hope to continue developing relationships that were formed during last year's trade mission."

Representatives from 15 business and agricultural groups will go with Gov. Daugaard on the April 5-12 trip to China. The trade mission is made possible by a State Trade and Export Promotion grant awarded to South Dakota by the Small Business Administration.

"As an increasingly global company, China is a very important market for Raven Industries, and having the support of Governor Daugaard during our trade mission is a great benefit," said Michelle M. Lavallee, Global Leader of Sales and Marketing at Raven Applied Technology Division. "We are also delighted to get to know colleagues throughout our state who intend to do business in China."

The delegation will travel to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong for scheduled meetings to discuss exporting their products and commodities.

"Most people don't realize that South Dakota companies of all sizes are fully capable of selling their products throughout the world," said Brian Klock, president, Klock Werks in Mitchell. "We are living in a global economy, and Klock Werks is looking forward to this opportunity to become a more active participant in it. It is an honor to be a part of this mission. Kudos to Governor Daugaard and the Governor's Office of Economic Development for their continued efforts to grow South Dakota's economy."
