Gov. Dennis Daugaard has appointed Deb Shephard of Watertown and has reappointed Don Kirkegaard of Sturgis to the South Dakota Board of Education.

"I want to thank Ms. Shephard and Mr. Kirkegaard for agreeing to serve on the Board of Education," Gov. Daugaard said. "Don has been invaluable as president, and I look forward to the perspective that Deb will bring as a former president of Lake Area Tech."

Kirkegaard is the superintendent of the Meade School District. He has been serving on the Board of Education since 2006.

Shephard retired at the close of the 2014 school year from a 36-year-long career at Lake Area Tech where she worked as an instructor prior to serving as president for eight years. Shephard is replacing Dr. Richard Gowen of Rapid City.

The nine members of the Board of Education serve four-year terms.
