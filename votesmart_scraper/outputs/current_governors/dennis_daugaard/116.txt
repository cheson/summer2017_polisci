Gov. Dennis Daugaard today signed the first bill of the 2016 Legislative Session into law. The piece of legislation, House Bill 1032, enables state and local governments to enter into guaranteed energy savings contracts.

The bill establishes a process for the contracts. The contracts allow for energy efficiency upgrades to be financed through the ongoing energy savings they will create.

"The enactment of House Bill 1032 will allow public officials to be better stewards," Gov. Daugaard said. "Guaranteed energy savings contracts have long been used in the private sector to pay for energy efficiency upgrades. Under this new provision, state and local governments will now be able to save taxpayer dollars by taking full advantage of these contracts. Governments that choose to enter into these contracts will not only be making their buildings more energy efficient, but also increasing equity and reducing ongoing liabilities."
