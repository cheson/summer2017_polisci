Press Release
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: March 11, 2011
Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard, accompanied by a top official of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will discuss spring flooding potential and preparedness with local officials and citizens in three eastern South Dakota counties on Wednesday, March 16.
"It has been a terrible winter, and the melting of large amounts of snow in some areas may cause extreme -- if not record -- flooding on many rivers and streams in the eastern part of the state," the Governor said. "If predictions prove true, flooding could be especially bad along the Big Sioux River."
Gov. Daugaard and FEMA Regional Administrator Robin Finegan will travel to Sioux Falls, Brookings and Watertown on March 16. The public meeting schedule:
* 7 a.m. CDT, Sioux Falls, Convention Center, meeting rooms 11-14
* noon CDT, Brookings, Swiftel Center, Daktronics Room B
* 4 p.m. CDT, Watertown, Redlin Art Center, Amphitheatre
The Governor will talk with local officials and interested citizens about the flooding outlook and what is being done to prepare for flooding. He will also outline steps that individuals can take to protect themselves, their families and property.
"I cannot stress enough that those people who live in flood-prone areas get prepared as early as possible. Don't wait until the last minute, when not only your property but also your life may be in danger," Gov. Daugaard said.
The Governor issued an Executive Order today that declares a state of emergency in South Dakota, allowing the use of state resources to assist communities and counties with floodresponse efforts.
