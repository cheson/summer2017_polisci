Gov. Dennis Daugaard signed the initial legislative bills of his new
administration today.
The first measure signed by the Governor was SB17. The new law will provide the South Dakota Science and Technology Authority with a tax exemption if it leases land or other property in Lawrence County to a nonprofit entity organized as a limited liability company for scientific research and related educational purposes.
The Science and Technology Authority owns the Sanford Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory at Homestake. STA currently pays no property taxes, and the new law would assure that none would be owed in the future as the laboratory is developed and expanded.

HB1004 - An Act to codify legislation enacted in 2010.
HB1014 _ An Act to revise certain provisions regarding the purpose of the 911 emergency surcharge and provide rulemaking authority to the 911 Coordination Board to establish allowable recurring and nonrecurring costs for the operation of a public safety answering point.
HB1017 -- An Act to authorize the release of offender photographs and physical descriptions for
purposes of victim and community notification.
HB1018 -- An Act to provide for a partial early final discharge from parole.
