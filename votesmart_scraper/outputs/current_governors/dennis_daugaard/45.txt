Gov. Dennis Daugaard has appointed Gopal Vyas of Mitchell to the South Dakota Board of Education.

"I want to thank Gopal for agreeing to serve on the Board of Education," Gov. Daugaard said. "In addition to being a valued member of the Mitchell community, Gopal's experience at Tessier's Inc. has given him the opportunity to experience the importance of Technical Institute graduates to South Dakota's workforce."

Gopal joined Tessier's in 1977 as executive vice president and was responsible for all construction. Vyas was co-owner when APi Group acquired Tessier's in 2007. He now serves as the chairman of Tessier's Inc., a premier mechanical contracting company specializing in HVAC, custom fabrication, service and environmental controls.

Prior to moving to South Dakota, Vyas worked as an R &D engineer for a start-up and as a mechanical engineer in the greater Boston area. Vyas received his BSME in India, his masters in Mechanical Engineering from Ohio University and his MBA from Boston University.

Vyas will replace Terry Sabers who resigned from the board last month. His appointment extends through December of 2019. The nine members of the Board of Education serve four-year terms.
