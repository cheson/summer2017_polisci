Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard today (Monday) activated the state Drought Task Force to monitor drought conditions across South Dakota. The task force also held its first meeting today in Pierre.

The latest U.S. Drought Monitor indicates that abnormally dry conditions are scattered in the central and eastern parts of South Dakota. Moderate and severe drought conditions are found in most of western South Dakota as well as in the extreme northeastern part of the state. There are still areas of the state not considered to be in a drought.

"While rainfall has been adequate in some areas, the recent hot, dry weather has increased drought conditions in other parts of South Dakota," Gov. Daugaard said. "The Drought Task Force gives us a way to share information so we can all respond appropriately. We want to be ready in case drought conditions persist."

Task Force members will coordinate the exchange of drought information among government agencies as well as agriculture, fire and water-supply organizations. Officials say the exchange of information will allow the task force to better monitor the development and seriousness of the drought. The task force also will evaluate the impact of drought on economic sectors of the state.
