Statement

Gov. Dennis Daugaard offered the following statement about discussions surrounding Medicaid expansion:
"On Monday, I met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and discussed the Trump Administration's plans for repealing or reforming the Affordable Care Act. Based on that discussion, I will not recommend that South Dakota pursue Medicaid expansion in 2017.
"Over the past two years, we have been working with the federal government to reduce federal cost-shifting to the state for Native American healthcare, and those discussions led the federal government to change its policy relating to Medicaid reimbursements for Indian Health Service enrollees.
"With the national election results, the prospect of reforming Medicaid in our country is real, and I intend to work with the Trump Administration and with our congressional delegation to find a way to leverage the IHS policy change to improve access to health care through Medicaid reform. If successful, these efforts could save our state tens of millions of dollars a year."
