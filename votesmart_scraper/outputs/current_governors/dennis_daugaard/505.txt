In South Dakota, we take pride running a state that is friendly to private enterprise and prudent
with taxpayer dollars. Recently, our state was recognized by two high-profile national
organizations for our sound management.
South Dakota has been rated No. 1 by the Small Business & Entrepreneurship (SBE) Council in
its Business Tax Index. The ranking is based on taxes at the state and local level.
In South Dakota, we know that the best way to entice small businesses and entrepreneurship is to keep taxes low and live within our means. Small businesses create jobs, and they drive South
Dakota's economy. As we emerge from the national recession, we need to maintain this
environment so that we can create more jobs and expand our state's tax base.
The business community is also taking note of South Dakota's sound fiscal management.
Standard & Poor's is one of the world's most respected sources for independent credit ratings
and financial research and risk analysis. S&P recently issued a report that upgraded South
Dakota's credit rating from AA to AA+. The report credited our state's prudent fiscal
management, including the fact that we eliminated our structural deficit and balanced the state
budget this year, without raising taxes and while protecting state reserve funds. The S&P report
also recognized South Dakota's business-friendly tax climate.
