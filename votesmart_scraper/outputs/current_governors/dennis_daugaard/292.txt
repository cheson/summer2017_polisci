More than 80-percent of Republicans who voted in Tuesday's primary election chose Governor Dennis Daugaard as their candidate for governor. Daugaard won the GOP primary race over former State Representative Lora Hubbel.
"There's a lot more we can be doing in the years ahead and I'm just very grateful the Republicans in this state have seen fit to give me another chance," Daugaard said to his crowd of supporters at RedRossa in Pierre.
The incumbent said, if elected for a second term in November, he would like to continue what he started during his first term. So far during his campaign, Daugaard has emphasized balancing the state budget, his response to several disasters -- including floods, fires and a devastating blizzard -- as well as strengthening South Dakota's business climate.
"South Dakota is a place to be," Daugaard said.
Should he win November's general election, he said he wants focus on expanding educational opportunities.
"Many of our students are convinced that just getting a college degree will be the ticket to success and I think that used to be true, but today, it is not just a college degree. It's the right degree," Daugaard said.
In the past, Daugaard has put an emphasis on fields including engineering, information technology, health care and manufacturing. All of these he calls "high-demand" jobs. He said these could be the keys to entice younger people to stay in, or move to South Dakota. Ultimately, it will be up to voters in November whether Daugaard sees another term as governor.
"Thank you all so much for your support. Look forward to brighter days ahead still," Daugaard said.
