Gov. Dennis Daugaard has awarded just over $4 million in Future Funds to the state's four technical institutes for priority equipment needs and expanding programs in high-demand workforce areas. Funds will be used to purchase dozens of items at each school.

"We want students to be fully prepared for the workforce they will enter after graduation," said Gov. Daugaard. "That requires the most current and effective training on the most advanced equipment possible. These grants will help our state's technical institutes keep pace with industry demands."

The funds are focused on adding capacity to Build Dakota-eligible programs.
