Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that Kimball has been chosen to be South Dakota's Capital for a Day on Wednesday, July 15.

"I look forward to the Kimball event, and thank community leaders for offering to host it," Gov. Daugaard said. "It's an excellent opportunity for me to become better acquainted with the community and learn about the issues impacting the Kimball area."

The Governor's activities for the day will include a main street walk, business tours around town, and a community social and coffee hour. The Governor will also hold a roundtable lunch for community leaders to meet and discuss the needs of the city.

"Thank you for the opportunity to host Capital for a Day, we are very excited to showcase Kimball. We look forward to Gov. Daugaard joining us for our ribbon cutting on our new Kimball Health and Dental Clinic that morning. With the help of the community block grant of $257,000 and the huge support we received from the community, this clinic is a huge asset," said Kimball Mayor Wayne Tupper. "We also look forward to visiting with the Governor about issues affecting small towns in rural America."
