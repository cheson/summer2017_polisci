There's Nothing Quite Like The State Fair

For one week each year, a few acres in Huron are transformed from an unassuming collection of streets and buildings into one of the premier events in South Dakota -- the South Dakota State Fair.

Whether you're riding the Ferris wheel or playing games on the midway, finding room for another corn dog, listening to the free entertainment and grandstand acts, watching a 4-H steer or lamb show, searching for a new camper or tractor, or simply catching up with friends and family, there's nothing quite like the State Fair.

In recent years, the South Dakota State Fair has enjoyed a tremendous run of success and become one of our state's most family-friendly events. Since 2007, attendance, camping and vendor numbers have increased each year. Grandstand ticket sales, livestock entries and revenues have increased as well. During that same period, more than 830,000 people passed through the gates -- and with good weather, the fair may host 200,000 people this year alone.

If you haven't visited the State Fair in a few years, you will be pleasantly surprised by what you find. Stop in at the Wine Pavilion for South Dakota wines, beers and cheeses; watch a cooking demonstration or sample beef ribs at the BBQ cook-off; sign up for the arm wrestling competition; check out scores of new booths in the Expo building; pull up a seat at a free show on the Freedom Stage; or take your kids to the FFA animal nursery.

The trolley rides are still free, and if you stay aboard for one full circuit of the fairgrounds you're almost guaranteed to run into someone you haven't seen for ages.

This year, bring your family to Huron and experience one of South Dakota's great traditions -- because there's nothing quite like the State Fair.
