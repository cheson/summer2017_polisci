Gov. Dennis Daugaard today released the results of an independent audit of the Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED).

The audit was conducted by the Department of Legislative Audit, state government's independent accounting agency that reports to the state Legislature, not the Executive Branch.

"I am pleased that, like the earlier reports, this audit does not indicate any wrongdoing beyond the Attorney General's findings," said Gov. Daugaard. "I believe we should always welcome input from the outside, and I am glad that this process has recommended improvements in our processes."
