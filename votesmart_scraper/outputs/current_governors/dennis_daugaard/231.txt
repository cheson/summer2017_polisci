Location: Pierre, SD

As part of his mission to streamline government and promote openness, Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced on Tuesday the launch of a state Boards and Commissions Portal.

"Government should be open and transparent," said Gov. Daugaard. "This portal will serve as a central hub for many of our state's gubernatorial appointed boards and commissions, where South Dakotans can easily find minutes, information on members and upcoming meetings."

South Dakota has more than 100 boards and commissions whose members are appointed by the Governor.

The portal will provide the public with access to a master calendar, meeting materials and information on each board and its members.
