Gov. Dennis Daugaard is asking Thanksgiving holiday travelers to make safe, smart choices on the highways.

Thanksgiving weekend marks the beginning of a long holiday season. Gov. Daugaard says the holidays are a time to be with family and friends, but that means more places to be and traffic that is heavier than normal. Combined with South Dakota's uncertain and quickly changing weather, that means people need to be even more safety-conscious than ever.

"We all love the holiday season, and I encourage every South Dakotan to travel safely and avoid a tragedy," the Governor said. "The fast-moving snowstorm earlier this month is a reminder of how quickly travel conditions can deteriorate. Please be alert to changing weather, put down the phone and any other distractions, buckle up and, of course, never drink and drive.''

Two people died on South Dakota highways last Thanksgiving, and 39 others were injured in crashes. South Dakota has recorded an average of nearly 210 highway crashes in each of the last four Thanksgiving holiday travel periods. About 15 of those crashes each year involved alcohol.

"Every alcohol-related highway crash is avoidable,'' Gov. Daugaard said. "Please, have a sober driver behind the wheel every trip. Don't drink and drive.''

The national Thanksgiving Day holiday fatality-reporting period this year runs from 6 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 26, through 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 30.
