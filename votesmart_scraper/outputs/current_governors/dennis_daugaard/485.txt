Today, Governors and representatives of 7 states impacted by the recent flooding of the Missouri River met in Omaha to discuss concerns with and issues related to Missouri River flood control in the wake of this year's historic flooding. Gov. Heineman (NE), Gov. Sam Brownback (KS), Gov. Jack Dalrymple (ND), Gov. Dennis Daugaard (SD), Gov. Jay Nixon (MO), Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds (IA) and a representative for Gov. Matthew Mead (WY) attended the meeting.
The Governors signed a letter to John McHugh, Secretary of the United States Army. Secretary McHugh has statutory responsibility for all matters relating to the Army, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The letter states, "There is clear consensus that flood control must be the highest priority in the
operation of the Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir System."
Additionally, it reads, "We strongly request the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers thoroughly examine future management of the Missouri River in light of this year's precipitation and flooding and report to us on alternate actions to reduce flood damage from future high flow events. We also request that the Corps provide recommendations for specific operational changes to afford greater flood protection in the basin in the future and consult with the states and tribes in selecting and implementing any changes."
