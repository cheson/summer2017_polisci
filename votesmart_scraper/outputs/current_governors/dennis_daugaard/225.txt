At the request of Governor Daugaard, the South Dakota Bureau of Finance and Management (BFM) has released three long-term financial plans.

"It is important when making decisions about South Dakota's finances that we remember it is our responsibility to be good stewards of taxpayer money," said Gov. Daugaard. "These three plans will further strengthen our financial practices and hopefully help South Dakota take strides toward attaining AAA credit rating."

Gov. Daugaard signed Executive Order 2014-06 in July of 2014, which called for BFM to prepare and present a General Fund Long-Term Financial Plan, a Five-Year Capital Expenditure Plan and a Debt Limitation and Management Policy to the Governor prior to Jan 10, 2015.

BFM met the January deadline and not only presented the plans to Governor Daugaard, but also presented the plans to credit ratings agencies in New York earlier this month.

The General Fund Long-Term Financial Plan is a thorough long-term forecast estimate for all general fund revenues and all general fund expenditures. The Five Year Capital Expenditure Plan outlines capital projects including new construction, expansion and maintenance and repair projects. The Debt Limitation and Management Policy establishes limits and metrics for both total debt and annual debt service payments in South Dakota and provides current measurements to ensure South Dakota is meeting the established metrics.
