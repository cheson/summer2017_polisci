Gov. Daugaard Holds Final Legislative Press Conference
Press Release
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: March 3, 2016
Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard today at the Capitol held his final press conference of the legislative session.
In the press briefing, he talked about the passage of HB 1182 by the state Senate this week and the status of SB 131 and SB 133 -- all parts of the Governor's teacher pay proposal.
The Governor also spoke about the work left to be done on the general budget bill. He is optimistic the appropriations committees will adopt a responsible budget with conservative revenue estimates.
"Many states still do not adopt very conservative revenue estimates," Gov. Daugaard said. "They're either considering tax increases to cover spending they have already authorized or they are considering what spending they have authorized they have to cut; and I'm happy South Dakota is not a state like that."
The Governor noted that per capita, South Dakota has the smallest general fund budget in the nation. "We don't raise a lot and we don't spend a lot."
