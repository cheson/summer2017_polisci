Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that he will appoint Magistrate Judge Matthew M. Brown of Custer as a circuit court judge in South Dakota's Seventh Circuit Court in Rapid City.

"I thank Judge Brown for agreeing to take on this new role," said Gov. Daugaard. "He is a well-respected magistrate judge and will be an excellent circuit judge."

Brown will fill a new judgeship in the Seventh Circuit that was created by the 2015 State Legislature. The Seventh Circuit includes Custer, Fall River, Oglala Lakota and Pennington counties.

"I am both honored and humbled to be asked to continue to serve the Seventh Circuit in this new capacity," Judge Brown said.

Brown currently serves as a magistrate judge in the Seventh Circuit, a position he has held since 2014. Prior to that service, he worked for Black Hills Legal Services, for the Pennington County State's Attorney's Office and for the Custer County State's Attorney's Office. He has also served as a special assistant attorney general.

Brown is a 1996 graduate of Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, and a 1999 graduate of The University of South Dakota School of Law.

Brown is an active member of many community organizations in the Custer area. He and his wife, Joy, have three children.
