Forty new South Dakota high school graduates have been awarded Dakota Corps scholarships to pursue careers in critical-need occupations within the state.

Each year, Dakota Corps recipients receive funding equivalent to the cost of tuition and applicable fees at their postsecondary institution. Once graduated, they are required to enter into a critical-need occupation in South Dakota, with terms of service equivalent to the number of years they received the scholarship, plus one year. The scholarships are supported entirely by private donations.

"By choosing careers in critical-need occupations, these students give back to our state," said Gov. Dennis Daugaard. "They will be educated in South Dakota and then remain here to provide important services and support for fellow South Dakotans. That is a win for all of us, and I thank the private businesses and non-profit organizations that recognized the importance of providing these students with scholarships."

Current occupations that qualify for Dakota Corps Scholarship support include teaching K-12 special education; teaching high school math, science, or career and technical education; working as an accountant or auditor; working as an engineer (all fields except mining); working as a registered nurse; or working in the information technology field.

The South Dakota Board of Regents administers the Dakota Corps Scholarship program. For more information about this program, contact the board office at 1-800-874-9033 or send an e-mail to DakotaCorps@sdbor.edu.
