Gov. Daugaard's Statement On RESTORE Resolution
Press Release
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: June 2, 2015
Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard issued the following statement today in support of U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds' bipartisan Regulation Sensibility Through Oversight Restoration (RESTORE) Resolution:

"Federal rules have huge impacts and are very burdensome on states and citizens, and I know my fellow governors are very concerned by it. I hope Congress will embrace Sen. Rounds' proposal and will take this opportunity to reassert its authority over rule making, and I commend him for advancing it."

If passed, the resolution would create a Joint Select Committee to consider the practicality of establishing a rules review process for Congress. South Dakota and 40 other states use comparable processes at the state-level which allow legislatures to weigh in on executive branch rules.

The committee would also hold hearings on the effects of current regulations and recommend ways to eliminate unnecessary or overly burdensome regulations.
