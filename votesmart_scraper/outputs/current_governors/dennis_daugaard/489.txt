Gov. Daugaard Meets With Corps of Engineers On Flooding
Press Release
By: Dennis Daugaard

Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard met today on Missouri River flooding with officials of
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, including Brig. Gen. John McMahon, Col. Robert Ruch, Jody Farhat, Chuck McWilliams and Eric Stasch.
The Corps of Engineers is visiting with each Governor along the Missouri River to announce the schedule of water releases through the end of September. Gov. Daugaard said that announcement will be made on Friday by the Corps.
"Out of respect for those Governors who have not yet had conversations with the Corps, we should not pre-empt that announcement," he said.
"We did agree on three points in our meeting. No. 1: The most important thing is to ensure that actions taken before winter will get the mainstem reservoirs in a position to avoid a repeat of flooding next year. No. 2: The 85,000 cfs (cubic feet per second) level would put the river within its banks and will get people back into their homes and businesses. Variations of flow above that level are less important than reaching 85,000 cfs as soon as possible. No. 3: The Corps should consider the National Weather Service's forecast for above-average rainfall in the next few months as it builds the release schedule for the mainstem dams."
