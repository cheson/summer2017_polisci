South Dakota ranks third in the nation for fiscal condition according to a Mercatus Center study on state solvency released on Tuesday.

"Ranking just behind Alaska and North Dakota in fiscal solvency is something to be proud of," said Gov. Dennis Daugaard. "While Alaska and North Dakota derive a large percentage of their revenues from oil production, we have to be diligent about keeping our state on a firm financial footing. In South Dakota, we don't spend money we don't have, we keep our budget structurally balanced and we seize opportunities to spend in the short-term where it can lead to savings."

The study conducted by Eileen Norcross compares states by their abilities to pay short-term bills, meet long-term spending obligations and increase spending. The study also takes budget and trust fund solvency into account.

Norcross based her research on the comprehensive annual financial reports from each state for fiscal year 2013.
