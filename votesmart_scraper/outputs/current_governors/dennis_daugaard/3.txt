Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard today is joining seven other governors at the White House to discuss workforce. The meetings will include discussions with President Donald Trump, cabinet secretaries and White House senior staff officials.

"I thank President Trump for engaging the states on workforce, and I appreciate that his administration has consistently involved state leaders in discussions on issues of national importance," Gov. Daugaard said. "Every state is dealing with a shortage of qualified workers, and this is an area where we can learn from one another."

The meeting is being held as a part of the President's workforce development week, an effort led by Assistant to the President Ivanka Trump. Discussions are expected to center on best practices, apprenticeship opportunities, education, intragovernmental efforts and public-private partnerships.

During the meeting, Gov. Daugaard plans to highlight current workforce efforts being undertaken in South Dakota, including the Build Dakota scholarship, South Dakota Works job search website and the state's dual credit program. The Governor hopes to bring home best practices from the gathering and to encourage federal support for state workforce development efforts.
