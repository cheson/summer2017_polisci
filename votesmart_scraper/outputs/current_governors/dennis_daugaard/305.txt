A state career camps website is being launched today to inform students of camp opportunities around the state.
"In South Dakota, we have a demand for workers in areas like engineering, information technology, health care and manufacturing," said Gov. Daugaard. "It is important for students to have the chance to learn about the skills that are in demand before they make decisions about college and careers. By establishing this new website, we hope to spread the word about the opportunities out there."
Put on by universities and technical institutes with help from the private sector, camps are geared toward middle school and high school students. The camps are typically daylong events where students learn about specific careers by hearing from professionals and participating in hands-on activities.
The types of camps listed on the website include agriculture, business, engineering, health care, information technology, and trade and technical.
