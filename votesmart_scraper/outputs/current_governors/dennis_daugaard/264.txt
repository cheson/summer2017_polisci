Gov. Dennis Daugaard accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge on Wednesday evening at the Governor's residence to support finding a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

"There is treatment available for those who suffer from ALS, but today there's no cure for the disease," said the Governor. "Through this national viral movement, I'm hopeful we'll make a difference."

Under the rules of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, a person who receives a challenge can either accept the challenge and dump a bucket of ice on their head, or donate $100 to an ALS charity of their choice. Gov. Daugaard decided to accept the ice bucket challenge and give $125 to the ALS Association in honor of South Dakota's 125th anniversary.

Gov. Daugaard was challenged by Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead on Tuesday, Aug. 19, and Gov. Daugaard issued the challenge to North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple, whose state is also celebrating 125 years of statehood.
