The Honorable Barack Obama
President of the United States of America
The White House

Dear President Obama:
As governors who support the public policy and economic benefits that flow from biofuels, we write today to express our strong opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed rule that would significantly reduce ethanol and biodiesel choices for consumers as enabled in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The EPA proposal would have a negative impact on family incomes, the diversification of our energy portfolio, economic development in rural communities, and emissions reduction across our nation.
The renewable fuels that are proudly used by consumers across the country, are produced with American-grown corn, soybeans, wood chips and other important biomass resources that are processed through biofuels facilities that employ thousands, all while injecting millions into agribusiness and local economies. More than 400,000 Americans depend on renewable fuels for good-paying jobs that support rewarding careers in our states. According to the Renewable Fuels Association and LMC International, 44,500 of these jobs could be lost due to the EPA proposed rule. This proposed rule would greatly hinder our states' efforts to foster policies that create jobs, grow family incomes, and revitalize our economies.
