Gov. Dennis Daugaard issued an executive proclamation designating Sept. 11 as Patriot Day.
"Ten years ago, on Sept. 11, 2001, terrorists ruthlessly attacked the United States, causing the tragic deaths of thousands of innocent United States' citizens and citizens from more than 90 other nations," said Daugaard. "In response to the attacks, firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians, physicians, nurses, military personnel and other first-responders immediately -- without concern for their own well-being -- rose to service in many heroic efforts to protect the lives of those still at risk, consequently saving thousands of men and women."
Daugaard said it is a fitting tribute to observe this Sunday, Sept. 11, as Patriot Day in remembrance of those who were lost and those who continue to serve.
"These first-responders, soldiers and their families are worthy of eternal gratitude we can express through prayer and kind actions and voluntary services for others," he said.
* Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D.:
Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., had distinct memories of the day he learned of the Sept. 11, 2011 attacks.
"As I drove to work that morning, I heard on the radio that a plane had crashed into the (World Trade Center)," he said. "I thought that was strange but assumed it was some sort of accident. When I got to the office, staff told me that a second plane had crashed into the WTC complex and that a third plane had crashed into the Pentagon."
