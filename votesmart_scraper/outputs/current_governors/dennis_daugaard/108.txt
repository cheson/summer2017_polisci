Gov. Dennis Daugaard today held a legislative press conference at the Capitol.

In the press briefing, the Governor talked about the upgrade of South Dakota bonds from Moody's. The state received a ratings improvement from Aa2 to Aa1 this week, which is the highest rating the state can receive and, according to Gov. Daugaard, "the equivalent of the AAA we received from S&P last spring."

Also at the press conference, the Governor spoke about his trip to Washington, D.C., for the National Governor's Association meeting.
