In light of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests which occurred in North Dakota, South Dakota's state and tribal law enforcement are having public safety discussions. The first strategic planning meeting was held on Friday, April 28, in Mitchell, where participants discussed potential pipeline protests.

Tribal Relations Secretary Steve Emery, who attended the roundtable, described the meetings as an opportunity to work together and keep communications open so citizens can exercise their rights in a safe, lawful manner.

"It's important that we bring tribal and state officials together to address possible protests," said Secretary Emery. "These talks also open the door to discussions of other significant issues law enforcement face throughout the state; issues such as drug use, emergency management and police training. There are a number of areas where we can work together."

Other roundtable attendees included: Secretary Trevor Jones, Department of Public Safety; Col. Craig Price, SD Highway Patrol; law enforcement officials from the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe and Yankton Sioux Tribe; and representatives from the Division of Criminal Investigation.

"Communication with other agencies is key. In our communities we serve both native and non-native. The tribe and the state are in this together," said Yankton Sioux Tribe Chief of Police Chris Saunsoci.

Two additional regional public safety roundtable discussions are scheduled in Pierre and Wall for this month.
