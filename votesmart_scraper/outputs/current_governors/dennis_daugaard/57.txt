Gov. Dennis Daugaard has appointed Kay Schallenkamp of Spearfish to the South Dakota Board of Education.
"I want to thank Kay for agreeing to serve on the Board of Education," Gov. Daugaard said. "Kay's many years working in education will be of tremendous value to the board and the people of South Dakota."
In addition to her term as Black Hills State University's ninth president, Schallenkamp's 40-year career in higher education included nine years as president of Emporia State University in Kansas. She also served as provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and provost at Chadron State College in Nebraska.
She holds three degrees in communication disorders: a B.S. from Northern State University, a master's degree from the University of South Dakota and a Ph.D. from the University of Colorado.
Schallenkamp will replace Julie Mathiesen, who resigned from the board last month.
