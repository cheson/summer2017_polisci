Statement
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: March 26, 2014
Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard has signed House Bill 1166, "An Act to revise the telecommunications services program to include current and developing technology," into law.
The bill, brought at the request of the Governor's Office, received unanimous support from the state Senate and broad support from the state House.
HB 1166 expands the services and devices that can be provided by the telecommunications fund which was established 25 years ago. Under the new law, those who are deaf, hard of hearing or speech impaired will be able to receive newer devices such as iPads from the Telecommunications Equipment Distribution Program (TEDP).
"Technology has come a long way since 1989 and the devices currently covered under the telecommunications fund are mostly outdated," said Gov. Daugaard. "Under this new law, those in the deaf community will have better options of tools to help them communicate."
TEDP and the telecommunications fund are administered by the Department of Human Services. To find out more about the program and how to apply, visit relaysd.com or call 605-773-5990.
