Governor: Hold Off On Mowing East River Ditches
Press Release

Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard is reminding East River landowners to hold off until July 10 to mow ditches along the state highway system.
"Roadside ditches provide valuable nesting cover for pheasants, especially in portions of the state with limited CRP land or other upland nesting habitat. Mowing too early can kill hens and newly hatched broods, and result in lower pheasant populations," stated Gov. Daugaard. "In a state where pheasant hunting is an honored tradition, abiding by these regulations is important."
Under state law and administrative rule, all counties east of the Missouri River must wait until July 10 to begin mowing right-of-way highway ditches. As of June 15, mowing is permitted in all West River counties. Mowing prior to the established dates is a class 2 misdemeanor.
Though the rules are only applicable to state highways, the Governor asks landowners to consider postponing mowing on all roadside ditches until July 10.
"Even the delay of a week or two can result in more successful nest attempts," Gov. Daugaard said.
The South Dakota Department of Transportation can mow specific areas when noxious weeds exist or public safety concerns arise.
Any person wanting to mow Interstate right-of-way ditches at the allowable times must apply for a permit. Preference is given to abutting landowners. Other persons wishing to mow must also obtain a waiver from the abutting landowner.
