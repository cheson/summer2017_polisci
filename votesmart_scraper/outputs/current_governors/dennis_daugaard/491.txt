When many states are still struggling to recover from tough economic times, South Dakota has much good economic development news to share.
I'm pleased that our mainstream media is paying attention to South Dakota's economic success stories. Doing so helps spread positive business news, buoying consumer confidence and encouraging further economic growth in our state.
Editorials from our state's newspapers recently have discussed the positive impact Northern Beef Packers at Aberdeen will have on South Dakota. While we are enjoying this great news out of Aberdeen, it is a perfect time to showcase some of South Dakota's other recent economic development success stories.
In the last three months, there have been numerous major economic development announcements in South Dakota. They include:
o Adams Thermal Systems in Canton is expanding and adding 50 new jobs -- the company's fifth addition to its Canton campus since 2005
o Eleutian Technology opened a teaching center in Spearfish, adding 50 new job so For the second time in two years, Madison-based Custom Touch Homes is expanding and adding 50 new jobs
o In late June, a dedication ceremony was held for the $363 million Crow Lake Wind Project near White Lake
o Dakota Trailer Manufacturing in Yankton is expanding and adding more than 60 newjobs. In the last six years, the company has grown from an eight-person operation to a 140-employee firm
