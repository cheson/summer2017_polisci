Gov. Daugaard Commends Release Of Additional CRP Acres
Press Release
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: June 29, 2017
Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard issued the following statement in response to the USDA's decision to allow further release of CRP acres to South Dakota producers living in drought-stricken areas:

"I thank Secretary Perdue and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for widening the scope of the release of CRP for emergency grazing. This will provide some much needed relief for the South Dakota farmers and ranchers who are struggling with drought."

The Governor last week sent a letter to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue requesting the department make CRP acres available as soon as possible. The USDA on Friday announced the release of CRP acres to counties in the severe drought (D2) and extreme drought (D3) categories. Today's announcement expands that allowance to counties within 150 miles of a D2 or D3 county. Additionally, the mid-term management hay donation program has been reinstated with provisions that the hay needs to be donated to an area of identified drought.

Producers who have questions are encouraged to contact their local FSA office.
