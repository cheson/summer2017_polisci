Gov. Dennis Daugaard and First Lady Linda Daugaard rolled up their sleeves today to get vaccinated against the flu and encourage other South Dakotans to do the same.

"As grandparents we know that yearly vaccination is important. Not only does the vaccine protect us from the flu, it also protects our grandchildren -- one of which is too young to get the vaccine," said Gov. Daugaard. "We encourage everyone, especially other grandparents with infant grandchildren, to get vaccinated."

Children account for a significant number of flu cases and hospitalizations each year and also spread flu in communities. The state provides free flu vaccine for all kids from six months through 18 years of age.

Yearly flu vaccinations are recommended for everyone. Some groups are at higher risk for complications caused by the flu, including infants. Pregnant women, people older than 50 and those with chronic medical conditions are also at higher risk.

The state Health Department says South Dakotans can help stop the spread of the flu by practicing common sense measures such as frequent hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home when ill. Learn more about flu prevention at flu.sd.gov.
