The Western Governors Association last week voted to approve a resolution on federal transportation introduced by Gov. Dennis Daugaard.

"Western Governors agree that states need a federal transportation program that is flexible and reliable, and involves state and local governments in the decision process," said Gov. Daugaard. "It's particularly important for western states, which make up two-thirds of America's land mass, to have adequate transportation systems in order to ship goods to the rest of the nation."

In addition to voicing their support for a federal transportation infrastructure investment with fewer regulations, the governors are also urging Congress to approve legislation to make the Surface Transportation Board more independent, transparent and broader in membership.

A bill (S. 808) introduced by U.S. Sen. John Thune would alter the Surface Transportation Board in the ways specified by the WGA resolution. Sen. Thune's bill was unanimously approved by the Senate on June 18 and is pending action in the House of Representatives. The resolution also contains language that supports Sen. Thune's port metrics legislation (S. 1298) that was approved by the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee last week.

The Western Governors Association is a bi-partisan group made up of 19 states and 3 U.S.-flag islands. The governors approved Gov. Daugaard's resolution at the WGA 2015 annual meeting last week in Incline Village, Nevada.
