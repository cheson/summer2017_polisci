Gov. Dennis Daugaard expressed his dismay today with the United States Supreme Court's decision to uphold President Obama's health law.

"I am disappointed with the Court's decision, but I am proud of the effort put forth by South Dakota and the other states involved in the lawsuit," the Governor said. "It is up to state leaders to stand up for the rights of our citizens when we believe the federal government steps beyond the bounds of the Constitution."

As a result of the Supreme Court decision, on Jan. 1, 2014, every individual American will still be required to purchase health insurance or pay a fine, and a health insurance exchange will be required in every state.

"I am still convinced that the President's health law is bad policy and I will continue to fight to protect South Dakota citizens from its harmful effects," Gov. Daugaard said. "I hope the next President and Congress will repeal this law after the election."

"Now that the lawsuit is behind us, it is our duty to study all the available options and make an informed decision that minimizes the damage this law could do to South Dakota's health care and insurance industries."
