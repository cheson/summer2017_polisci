Here is a statement from Gov. Dennis Daugaard on today's preliminary injunction on HB 1217 by U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier:
"This preliminary decision is not a surprise. I believe everyone agrees -- no matter what their stance on abortion -- that it's a laudable goal to reduce abortions by encouraging consideration of other alternatives. The three-day waiting period called for in HB1217 gives women time to reflect and make good choices."
