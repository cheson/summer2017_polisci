Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that the South Dakota Department of Transportation has been awarded a $12 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant.

"This grant is the culmination of a lot of effort from the Department of Transportation, the Legislature and many local citizens who supported this project. Thanks also go to Sen. Thune and the rest of our federal delegation for their support for the project," said Gov. Daugaard. "Now more than ever, our state needs good rail infrastructure to move grain to out-of-state markets."

The grant will go toward the reconstruction of a portion of the state-owned MRC Railroad between Chamberlain and Presho. The 41.6 miles of rail will be improved by repairing bridges and culverts, and replacing broken and damaged ties. The longest bridge spans the Missouri River at Chamberlain.

Darin Bergquist, SDDOT Secretary, said, "Once completed, the line will serve as a vital link to grain elevators that plan to locate along the line. Without the extension of the line, the construction of these expected facilities would not happen."

"We will be replacing roughly 1,300 ties per mile. We will add approximately 1,000 tons of rock per mile and fix all the bridges to be able to carry rail cars that weigh 286,000 pounds," said Bruce Lindholm the director of the Air, Rail and Transit Division of the South Dakota Department of Transportation.
