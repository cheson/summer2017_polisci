The South Dakota Department of Health has received its third grant from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. The grant, announced by Gov. Dennis Daugaard at a press conference this morning, will enable DOH to support the newly formed Task Force on Community Justice and Mental Health Early Intervention.
"Mental illness and substance use issues are often overlooked and underserved conditions, especially in rural areas," said Walter Panzirer, a trustee of the Helmsley Charitable Trust. "By researching and studying existing municipal or county models across the U.S. and adapting them for a rural, statewide population, South Dakota has the opportunity to provide a model that can be replicated by other states."
In 2015, the results of a healthcare survey funded by the Helmsley Charitable Trust were released in a report entitled Focus on South Dakota: A Picture of Health. The survey found that South Dakota may have a higher prevalence of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol misuse compared to national rates, and that the state's emergency rooms see a high rate of individuals with mental health concerns.
According to the report, addressing the mental health needs of individuals is more challenging with the state's mental health professional worker shortages and geographic maldistribution.
The task force established by Supreme Court Chief Justice David Gilbertson, with support from Gov. Dennis Daugaard, will examine mental health as it relates to the state's criminal justice system.
