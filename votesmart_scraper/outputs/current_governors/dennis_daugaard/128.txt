The Public Safety Improvement Act Oversight Council has released its annual report to update the public on progress made under Gov. Dennis Daugaard's criminal justice reforms.
"We are already seeing positive results of the Public Safety Improvement Act which was passed less than three years ago. The prison population is now below initial projections; we saved millions of dollars this year by not having to build a new women's prison; parolees have earned over 700,000 days of parole credit; and we have increased the state's drug court capacity by five times," said Gov. Daugaard. "While this report demonstrates a comprehensive review of the policy's results, every number in this annual report represents a mother, father, son or daughter that has benefited from the criminal justice reforms."http://news.sd.gov/newsitem.aspx?id=18662
