The sixth season of free weekly tours at the South Dakota Governor's Mansion will begin next month.
First Lady Linda Daugaard said she and the Governor are happy to again open the home on the shore of Capitol Lake to the public.
"We are pleased to host another year of summer tours," Mrs. Daugaard said. "The Governor's mansion belongs to the people of South Dakota, and Dennis and I invite every South Dakotan to enjoy this special home."
Beginning June 1, weekly public tours will be conducted each Wednesday in June, July and August. Guests attending the first tour of the summer on June 1 will be greeted by the Mount Rushmore mascots in celebration of the 75th anniversary of the completion of the national memorial.
"It's truly a pleasure to welcome guests to the Governor's mansion. For those signed up to tour on June 1, make sure to bring your cameras for a photo with the Mount Rushmore mascots," First Lady Daugaard said.
The 30-minute tours will begin at 1 p.m. CDT and will be conducted by volunteers, including the First Lady. Tour groups will consist of up to 40 people.
Public tour tickets, at no charge, must be obtained in advance and will be available only from the Pierre Area Chamber of Commerce. Those interested in a tour should call the Chamber at 605-224-7361.
