Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that the State of South Dakota is accepting proposals through May 31, 2013, for development and restoration of certain buildings on the old campus of the Human Services Center in Yankton.

"During the 2013 legislative session, I proposed and the Legislature approved House Bill 1033, which authorizes the state to dismantle, demolish, preserve or rehabilitate buildings on the old Human Services Center campus," the Governor said. "The majority of the buildings have been vacant for decades and are in extremely poor condition. However, I wanted to provide one final opportunity for interested parties to submit restoration plans for the show barn, dairy barn, Herreid building, Mellette building and Ordway building. If we don't receive viable proposals, the only responsible course of action is to demolish them."

State government is working closely with the Yankton Office of Economic Development to solicit financially sustainable proposals for the buildings that would complement economic development priorities of the City of Yankton and the State of South Dakota.
At a minimum, any proposal should adequately address the following criteria:
Financial sustainability
Compatible use
Appropriate liability insurance
A performance bond, and
Indemnity
The State of South Dakota will work with any successful bidder regarding easement and platting issues. If no successful proposal is received, the buildings will be listed for future demolition.

Proposals should be submitted to Mike Dellinger at the Yankton Office of Economic Development, 803 East Fourth Street in Yankton, or telephone him at 605-665-9011. Requests to tour the buildings should also be directed to the Yankton Office of Economic Development.
