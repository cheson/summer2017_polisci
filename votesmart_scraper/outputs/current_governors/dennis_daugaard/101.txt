Gov. Dennis Daugaard has signed two measures into law to allow for the sale of surplus lands at the South Dakota Developmental Center in Redfield and the Human Services Center in Yankton.
"South Dakotans expect their state government to be a good steward of public assets," Gov. Daugaard said. "These bills will save the state money and put land back to productive use and on property tax rolls.
House Bill 1207 authorizes the sale of approximately 52 acres of HSC land. The money from the sale will be directed to a trust fund for the operation of HSC. The bill also authorizes the state to sell the land at appraised value to the Yankton Historical Society, which has expressed interest in creating a historical park around the historic Mead Building. The local historical society has entered into a long-term purchase agreement with the state to buy the Mead Building.
House Bill 1208 approves the sale of over 130 acres of land at SDDC. Half of the funds from the sale will go to SDDC. The other half will be used to pay for demolition, advertisement and appraisal, with the remaining dollars going to the state's general fund.
