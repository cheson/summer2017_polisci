Gov. Dennis Daugaard has appointed Rev. Patricia White Horse-Carda of Wagner to the South Dakota Board of Pardons and Paroles.

"I want to thank Rev. White Horse-Carda for her willingness to serve on the Board of Pardons and Paroles," Gov. Daugaard said. "Her unique insight will be invaluable to the board which is tasked with making weighty recommendations."

White Horse-Carda has served the Diocese of South Dakota as an Episcopal priest since 2010. Previously, she spent 20 years working at the Wagner Community School as both a teacher and an administrator.

The Governor, state Supreme Court and Attorney General each appoint three members to serve on the Board of Pardons and Paroles for four year terms.

White Horse-Carda fills a vacancy created by the resignation of Debra Flute earlier this year. Her term will expire January of 2015.
