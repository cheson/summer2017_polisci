Gov. Dennis Daugaard attended a Rapid City, Pierre & Eastern Railroad (RCP&E) grand opening ceremony in Aurora earlier today, Friday, July 8. The event was held to celebrate the completion of a $5.65 million project to construct 17,520 feet of main line sidings in Aurora and Huron on the RCP&E line.

"I thank the RCP&E and the South Dakota Department of Transportation for partnering together on this addition," said Gov. Daugaard. "Dependable rail service is particularly important to our state. Because South Dakotans consume only a modest share of the grain we produce, we rely almost entirely on railroads to deliver our grain to out-of-state markets."

The sidings will allow for greater carrying capacity and more efficient interchanging with major railroads by permitting trains coming from opposite directions to pass one other.

The project, funded equally by state Future Funds and the RCP&E, was completed $1.85 million under budget. It was one of four rail investments announced by Gov. Daugaard in December 2014. The other investments announced that day remain in progress: the $37.4-million MRC Rail Line project from Chamberlain to Presho; the $7.3-million project to upgrade the Sioux Valley Line in southeast South Dakota; and the $10.5-million project to upgrade the Britton Line in northeast South Dakota.
