The recession brought tougher times for young adults across the nation. More people than ever are attending technical schools and colleges, but when they finish, some are having a difficult time finding jobs and repaying student loans.
While this has been a national phenomenon, the prospects for a young graduate are much, much better in South Dakota for a number of reasons.
First, we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the nation at 3.6 percent, compared to the national rate of 6.7 percent. We're second to only North Dakota (and they have oil).
Secondly, the tax burden in South Dakota is low. We are among only a few states without an income tax, meaning graduates keep more of the money they earn. Money that can repay student debt, buy a house someday or replace that car they drove to the ground in school.
Third, not only do young adults keep more of the money they earn in South Dakota, but that money will buy more here than in other places. Type "Regional Price Parity" into your web browser, and you will find the U.S. Department of Commerce report which shows South Dakotans have the lowest cost of living in the United States. We don't spend as much money on housing, insurance, food and the other everyday needs.
Now some people will say, "There may a low tax burden and low cost of living, but I won't get paid as much if I live in South Dakota." Actually, when it comes to per capita personal income, we fare pretty well. Nationally, we rank in the top half and we do better than states like Texas, Florida and Wisconsin.
