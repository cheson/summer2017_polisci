The South Dakota Transportation Commission awarded nearly $1 million in Bridge Improvement Grant funds for preliminary engineering at their monthly meeting today in Pierre.

The grants are a result of Senate Bill 1 of the 2015 Legislative Session, a comprehensive road and bridge funding bill championed by Gov. Dennis Daugaard.

"Legislators showed true courage last year in addressing our road and bridge problem. These grants are the result of that courage," Gov. Dennis Daugaard said.

The South Dakota Department of Transportation received 70 applications in the preliminary engineering category and recommended the award of 40 grants totaling $908,000. Two grants will go to two cities and 38 grants will go to 17 counties.

The preliminary engineering grants include funding for survey, hydraulic analysis and structure sizing. Department of Transportation staff are in the process of reviewing and ranking bridge replacement and bridge rehabilitation requests, the other two categories of Bridge Improvement Grants.

"These initial grants will help local governments fund the first step of bridge building, leaving BIG recipients in a better position to apply for a replacement grant or fund bridge construction on their own," said Transportation Secretary Darin Bergquist.

The Department expects the replacement and rehabilitation grants will be awarded at the Commission's April meeting.
