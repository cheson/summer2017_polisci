Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard has signed HB 1177, "An Act to prohibit certain use of handheld electronic wireless communication devices while driving and to provide a penalty therefor."
"Texting while driving is dangerous," said Gov. Daugaard. "It is my hope that, by prohibiting this practice, we will remind South Dakotans and all those who use our roads to keep their eyes on the road, not on their phones."
The new law, which takes effect July 1, prohibits drivers from using a handheld electronic wireless communication device to write, send or read text-based communications while the vehicle is in motion. The law includes exceptions for contacting emergency services, making phone calls and using hands free technology.
