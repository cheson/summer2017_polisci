Gov. Dennis Daugaard today announced the launch of a campaign to help South Dakota landowners maintain and improve habitat on their property.
"Habitat conservation is important in South Dakota. These efforts don't only enhance our wildlife population and preserve our outdoor traditions, they also benefit farmers and ranchers," Gov. Daugaard said. "I commend the departments of Agriculture and Game, Fish and Parks for finding common ground and working together on this common sense solution."
