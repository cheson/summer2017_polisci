Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that Leroy "J.R." LaPlante, the Secretary of the Department of Tribal Relations, is resigning from his position, effective Aug. 1.

LaPlante is the state's first Secretary of Tribal Relations, a post he has held since early 2011. LaPlante has accepted a position with the United States Attorney's Office in Sioux Falls.

"It has been an honor to serve my state and the tribes as Secretary, and I want to thank Gov. Daugaard for the vision he showed in creating this Department," said LaPlante. "I have loved my time as Secretary, and will continue to build upon the relationships I have made as I embark on a new challenge in public service as an assistant United States attorney."

"I want to thank Secretary LaPlante for his service," said Gov. Daugaard. "Thanks to J.R.'s efforts, we have continued the important work of strengthening the bonds between state and tribal governments, and of building relationships with tribal leaders. I wish J.R. the very best as he assumes his new role."

LaPlante, a graduate of Carson-Newman College in Jefferson City, Tennessee, and of the USD School of Law, is an enrolled member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.
