Statement From Gov. Daugaard On Non-Meandered Waters
Statement
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: June 2, 2017
Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard issued the following statement today in response to the legislative interim committee's passage of a draft bill to open non-meandered waters for public recreational use.

"This bill is a good compromise that balances the rights of landowners with the ability for sportsmen to use public waters for recreation. I support this bill and encourage the Legislature to work together so that we can finally achieve a solution to this long-standing issue. I will confer with legislative leaders to identify possible dates for a special session soon."
