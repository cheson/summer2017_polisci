Gov. Dennis Daugaard has joined with other governors from across the country to urge President Obama to reconsider his decision to veto the Keystone XL pipeline bill.

"If built, the pipeline would transport about 100,000 barrels of oil per day from the Bakken. That would help alleviate some of the congestion we're experiencing with our rail system and allow farmers better access to ship their products to market," said Gov. Daugaard. "In making his decision, I hope the President will take the needs of South Dakota and other states into consideration."

Twenty-four governors signed the Keystone XL letter which details how the United States would benefit from the pipeline. The governors cite support from some of the nation's largest labor unions and the State Department Analyses which concluded that the project will not have a significant environmental impact.

The U.S. House approved the Senate version of the Keystone XL bill yesterday by a 270 to 152 vote. The bill now goes to the President.
