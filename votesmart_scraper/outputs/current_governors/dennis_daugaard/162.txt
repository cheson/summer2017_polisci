Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that Paul Kinsman, the Commissioner of the South Dakota Bureau of Administration, has retired for health reasons.

"I am very sorry to see Paul go," said Gov. Daugaard. "Paul has led many important projects to strengthen our state in the long-term. His priority has always been good stewardship of state assets, and he has exemplified that value in his leadership at BOA."

Under Kinsman's leadership, BOA has emphasized improved ongoing maintenance and repair of state buildings to avoid long-term costs. Kinsman played a key role in implementing the plan to deal with unused and deteriorating facilities at the Human Services Center in Yankton. Kinsman also led efforts to preserve and beautify the State Capitol Complex, including the stained glass restoration and the planting of many new trees.

Kinsman is a 28-year veteran of state government. After working in the Department of Labor, he joined the Bureau of Administration, becoming deputy commissioner in 1996. In 2000, he became the state administrator of property and special taxes in the Department of Revenue. During the Rounds Administration, Kinsman served as Commissioner of BOA from 2003 to 2006, and as Secretary of Revenue from 2006 to 2011. He returned to BOA as Commissioner in 2011, at the request of Gov. Daugaard.

"I want to personally thank Gov. Daugaard for allowing me the opportunity to lead a state agency these past five years," Kinsman said. "Participating in setting statewide policy and action has been my distinct privilege."

Gov. Daugaard will announce a successor to Kinsman at a later date. BOA Deputy Commissioner Jeff Holden will serve as acting Commissioner in the interim.
