Gov. Dennis Daugaard has appointed Tom Jones of Viborg to the Board of Economic Development. Jones is a former Democratic state legislator who represented District 17 in both the House and Senate chambers.

"I want to thank Mr. Jones for agreeing to serve on the Board of Economic Development," Gov. Daugaard said. "Tom previously sat on the board as a legislative, ex officio member, and we are pleased that he has agreed to serve in this new capacity."

"Tom's combined business and legislative experience made him an excellent ex officio member of the board," said Pat Costello, Commissioner of the Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED). "I look forward to the opportunity to continue working with Tom."

Tom is a small businessman who has resided in Viborg with his wife Linda for more than 30 years. Previously, Tom taught and coached at both the high school and collegiate levels.

The 13 members of the Board of Economic Development serve four-year terms. Jones will fill the position formerly held by Rob Skjonsberg who recently resigned. His term will expire in April of 2016.
