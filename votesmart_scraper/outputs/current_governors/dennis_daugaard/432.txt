Press Release

As part of Gov. Dennis Daugaard's "Better Government" initiative, a series of new laws taking effect July 1 will repeal more than 400 sections of state law that are unnecessary, out-of-date or too complex.

In addition to those statutory changes, the Governor initiated the elimination of more than 1,100 state government regulations through the administrative rules process.

"It's my goal to get rid of laws and regulations that are not needed and are a burden on South Dakotans," Gov. Daugaard said. "I want to compliment my Cabinet and staff for doing their best to conduct a very successful review of red tape."

Examples of rules and laws to be repealed include outdated banking provisions; burdensome insurance regulations; redundant measures governing the construction and inspection of burial methods; and information that was collected to obtain federal funds that no longer are appropriated.

The Red Tape Review is part of the Governor's "Better Government" initiative to make state government more open, efficient and accessible.

"State government, unlike the federal government, strives to be as user-friendly as possible," Gov. Daugaard said. "I believe South Dakotans deserve the very best from their public servants, and we try to fulfill that expectation. This is the first year of the Red Tape Review, but it won't be the last."
