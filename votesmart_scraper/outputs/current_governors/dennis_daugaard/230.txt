Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard has awarded nearly $1 million in matching funds to help communities across the state take an active role in addressing their own workforce issues.

In September, the Governor challenged the business, education, government and other sectors to work together to submit plans for the South Dakota Workforce Development Council to consider. Sixteen applications were received.

"I wanted to hear community-specific ideas and innovative plans to meet communities' workforce needs," said Gov. Daugaard. "Applications addressed a variety of topics, such as housing, internships, certification and training programs, and English as a Second Language classes."

Communities receiving awards include:

Aberdeen Development Corporation, $60,000
Associated General Contractors of South Dakota, $50,000
Belle Fourche Development Corporation, $175,200
Black Hills Community Economic Development, $70,000
Brookings Economic Development Corporation, $174,750
City of Pierre, $20,480
DeSmet Development Corporation, $8,100
Greater Huron Development Corporation, $125,000
Gregory Business and Industrial Development Corporation, $7,000
Mitchell Technical Institute and Mitchell School District, $115,332
Wagner Area Growth, Inc., $22,239
Watertown Development Company, $50,000
Yankton Area Progressive Growth, Inc., $60,000
Yankton Rural Area Health Education Center, $50,000
The council evaluated the proposals on several criteria, including cross-sector involvement, sustainability in the community, consistency with statewide initiatives and quality of matching funding. The application narrative needed to detail the targeted workforce need and the proposed activity, as well as the cross-sector engagement each community used to develop the proposal.

The program is being administered by the Department of Labor and Regulation and the Governor's Office of Economic Development. For more information and to view all submissions, visit www.SouthDakotaWINS.com.
