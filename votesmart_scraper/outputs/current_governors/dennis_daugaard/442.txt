Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that Valhalla, a historic cabin in Custer State park, will again be opened to the public for the summer season.

"I'm pleased to open this rustic landmark to the public," the Governor said. "Valhalla is truly a gem in the heart of one of the most spectacular state parks in the nation."

The cabin will be available on a limited basis for public tours, day rentals, business meetings and retreats. Public tours will begin during the state park system's annual Open-House Weekend May 18-20; thereafter, tours will be allowed two Mondays each month, through September.

Dates for public tours are: June 11 & 25, July 9 & 23, August 13 & 27, September 10 & 17. Those interested in seeing the cabin need only show up between the hours of 2 p.m. -- 4 p.m.; no reservations are needed.

During Open-House Weekend, visitors can view Valhalla from 1 p.m. - 4 p.m. on Friday, May 18; from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. on Saturday, May 19; from 9 a.m. -- 4 p.m. on Sunday, May 20.

Day rentals will be available on Tuesdays through Thursdays for meetings and retreats at a cost of $200 daily. Reservations must be made at least 30 days in advance by calling (toll-free) 1-888-875-0001. A $200 deposit is required.

Valhalla was built in the late 1920s by U.S. Sen. Peter Norbeck, who is considered the "Father of Custer State Park."

Prior to 2011, use of Valhalla had been limited to South Dakota governors and their guests. Gov. Daugaard opened Valhalla last year for limited public use and viewing. To help preserve and limit wear and tear on the historic cabin, more extensive public access is not allowed.
