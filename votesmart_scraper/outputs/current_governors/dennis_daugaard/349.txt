Gov. Dennis Daugaard has extended his executive orders on cattle to accommodate ranchers who have experienced losses.

"Ranchers across the state are still dealing with the devastating losses from Winter Storm Atlas," said Gov. Daugaard. "With cattle losses estimated between 15,000 and 30,000, it's necessary that we lift weight limits and give ranchers the time they need."

The executive orders waive overweight limits for truckers hauling carcasses of cattle and the standard 36-hour carcass disposal requirement for animals killed in the blizzard.

Both orders were initially signed on Friday, Oct. 11, and were set to expire Oct. 25. The executive orders have both been extended until Nov. 30.
