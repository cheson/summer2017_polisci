Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that he will not call a special session of the South Dakota State Legislature to address the expansion of Medicaid.
"We have a good plan that would increase healthcare access at no additional state cost and guarantee that the federal government won't shift its responsibility to pay for Native American healthcare to the state," said Gov. Daugaard. "Still, I have heard from legislators that they would like more time to study this plan, and in particular want to wait to consider the issue until after the presidential election. For that reason, I will not be calling a special session to take up this issue."
