The Surface Transportation Board today issued an order requiring railroads to regularly provide shipping status updates to the public.

"The state's departments of Transportation and Agriculture have been working with my office on this issue daily since March, and each month the Surface Transportation Board has become more engaged on the issue," said Gov. Dennis Daugaard. "Grain leaving South Dakota must navigate a complicated transportation network that is affected by many factors. With the information the STB has ordered, shippers can see for themselves how efficiently, or inefficiently, their grain is moving into the marketplace."

The order will require all class I railroads to report certain information each week to the Surface Transportation Board, including grain train speeds, dwell times, oil train volumes and the amount of grain moved from each state classified by the type of grain.

This information will then be made available to the public to use for planning, lodging complaints and suggesting solutions to resolve the issue.

Sec. Lucas Lentsch said, "This order is the result of the culmination of many stakeholders sharing their concerns with our office, with Sen. Thune's office and personally with the Board. Without their participation, I do not believe the Board would have issued this order. Timely grain transportation into the market place is imperative to our agricultural economy and the Board clearly recognizes how important it is to a state like South Dakota."
