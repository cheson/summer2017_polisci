Press Release

Location: Pierre, SD

Individuals who have moved into a new or different home over the last year have until Saturday, March 15, to file for the owner-occupied, single-family dwelling certificate to be eligible for a property tax reduction.

"We want to make sure the property tax reduction is received by everyone eligible," said Gov. Dennis Daugaard. "If you've moved into a new home over the past year, check your assessment notice to ensure your home is classified as owner-occupied."

Any South Dakota homeowner who owned and occupied a home on Nov. 1, 2013, is eligible for the classification and property tax reduction. Taxpayers who have received the reductions previously and still own and occupy the same home will continue to receive the property tax reduction without filing a new certificate.

Before filling out the application, new homeowners are advised to check their valuation notices. New homeowners whose property is classified as owner-occupied on the valuation notice will receive the property tax deduction automatically and do not need to fill out an application. Homeowners should be receiving those notices in the mail.

Taxpayers who have purchased or built a new home prior to Nov. 1, 2013, and homeowners who have not previously applied for the classification must apply to their county director of equalization by March 15. Applications postmarked by March 15 will qualify.

The Certification of Owner-Occupied Dwelling form is available on the Department of Revenue website at http://dor.sd.gov/Taxes/Property_Taxes/Forms.aspx.

Homeowners who need forms or have questions regarding the owner-occupied certificate should contact their county director of equalization or the Property and Special Taxes Division of the South Dakota Department of Revenue in Pierre at 605-773-3139.
