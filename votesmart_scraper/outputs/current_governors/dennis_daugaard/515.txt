Public Statements
Big Sioux River Closed to Recreational Uses
Press Release
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: March 18, 2011
Location: Pierre, SD

In the interest of public safety, Gov. Dennis Daugaard on Friday declared the
Big Sioux River closed to boating and other recreational uses until further notice.
The closure order is effective on the river from Codington County through Union County. State law gives the Governor authority to prohibit or restrict recreational use or navigation on any portion of a river, lake or stream to protect the public peace, health or safety.
"The rising water level and rapid flow of the Big Sioux River as the spring melt takes place simply makes it unsafe for citizens to use the river for recreation,'' the Gov. Daugaard said.
Public notices will be posted along the Big Sioux River at high-traffic intersections. A violation of a prohibition or restriction order is a Class 2 misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30 days in jail, a fine of $500 or both.
