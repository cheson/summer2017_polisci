Governor Offers To Keep Mount Rushmore Open
Press Release

Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard has sent a letter to the director of the National Park Service offering state personnel and resources to keep Mount Rushmore open in the event of a federal government shutdown.

"Mount Rushmore is a national treasure and is a special location for South Dakotans and citizens across the country," Gov. Daugaard said in the letter. "I am confident state government could work with the federal government and private vendors to securely and competently manage Mount Rushmore during a federal shutdown."

The letter to the director includes an attachment outlining how the state would operate Mount Rushmore.

The Governor is willing to raise private funds to pay for the lighting of the memorial and use state personnel to provide security. The visitor center would not be open for operations, but the concessions and gift shop would remain open.
