Statement
By: Dennis Daugaard

Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard issued the following statement today in response to the passage of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act:
"I am pleased that Congress has passed the FAST Act, which will provide five years of funding certainty for our state transportation system. In January of this year I provided written testimony to the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the need for a long-term, fully funded federal highway bill. I underscored the importance of providing flexibility to the states in the program, while also advocating for a large portion of the funding to be dedicated to the program formula, which benefits rural states like South Dakota.
"I sincerely thank Sen. Thune, Sen. Rounds and Rep. Noem for their efforts on this important piece of legislation. It will benefit South Dakota and our nation's roadways well into the future."
