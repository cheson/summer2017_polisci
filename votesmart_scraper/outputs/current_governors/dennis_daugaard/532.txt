Heidepriem Questions Daugaard Administration Coddling of TransCanada Following EPA Ruling
The TransCanada Corporation's proposed Keystone LX pipeline deal that would build a pipeline beneath South Dakota to move oil sands crude oil to Texas and that the Daugaard Administration has been coddling for the past couple of years, has taken an unfortunate, if not predictable, turn when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled yesterday the draft environmental impact study for TransCanada "inadequate" and said it needed to be revised.
"We had major concerns about the safety of the pipeline which crosses several rivers and aquifers including the Ogallala aquifer which supplies South Dakota water, so we sponsored legislation to enact a two cent a barrel fee to create a cleanup fund should there be a disastrous break in the pipeline. The Daugaard Administration opposed it," Senator Scott Heidepriem said today.
"We had major concerns that we were funding too much of the pipeline by giving unnecessary tax breaks in the tens of millions of dollars to TransCanada, so we sponsored legislation to stop this waste of tax dollars. The Daugaard Administration opposed it," Heidepriem said.
"We had major concerns that TransCanada would be built in the most environmentally safe manner because a spill into the vital Ogallala aquifer under South Dakota would be absolutely devastating. The Daugaard Administration did nothing and now the EPA is calling TransCanada's environmental impact study "inadequate.' If there was ever an issue that shows an Administration more out of touch with protecting South Dakota, its pristine natural resources as well as its precious tax dollars, I would be hard pressed to find it," Heidepriem said.
