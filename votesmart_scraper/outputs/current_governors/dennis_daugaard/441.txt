The United States Department of Health and Human Services notified the State of South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation today that it has been awarded a $5.9 million grant to continue research into the possibility of a state-run health insurance exchange. The state applied for the grant in March, 2012.

South Dakota has not decided whether to pursue a state-run health insurance exchange. The grant announcement will have no effect on the state's decision to wait to decide on whether to run a health insurance exchange until after the U.S. Supreme Court decision on the President's health law (PPACA).

"Receiving this grant does not change our plans." Gov. Daugaard said. "South Dakota will continue to wait for the outcome of the lawsuit before we decide whether to pursue a state-run exchange."

The Governor added that the grant award provides funding for the state to continue researching all options in order to make an informed decision that protects South Dakota citizens from the negative effects of PPACA.

"The best case for South Dakota would be if the Supreme Court overturns PPACA in its entirety in June," Gov. Daugaard stated. "If that doesn't happen, South Dakota will be prepared to do everything within its power to protect our citizens from this harmful law."
