Governor Waives Weight Limits To Speed Removal Of Dead Cattle After Blizzard

Gov. Dennis Daugaard has issued an executive order waiving overweight limits for truckers hauling carcasses of cattle killed in last weekend's blizzard in western South Dakota.

The order allows trucks to exceed normal weight limits while removing dead cattle from the storm-impacted areas of the state. The order says an emergency situation exists while the carcasses are on the ground, and the animals should be removed as quickly as possible for protection of life and property.

"The weekend blizzard already has caused untold devastation,'' Gov. Daugaard said. "The number of livestock actually lost in the storm isn't certain, but it will range in the thousands of head. We need to lift weight limits temporarily to make sure the process of removing those cattle proceeds as quickly as possible.''

The overweight waiver does not apply to specific roads or bridges with posted maximum weights. The order will expire at the end of the emergency.

On Saturday, Oct. 5, Gov. Daugaard issued an emergency order to allow state assets to be used in response to the blizzard. Because of that order, many federal restrictions on motor carriers were waived, including hours of service. Trucking companies have a responsibility to make sure their drivers are able to operate equipment safely.

The waiver of weight limits applies only to truckers serving in the storm-impacted area of South Dakota.
