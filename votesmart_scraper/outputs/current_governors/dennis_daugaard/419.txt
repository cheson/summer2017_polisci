Public Statements
Open Government Task Force Created
Press Release
By: Dennis Daugaard

Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard and Attorney General Marty Jackley today announced formation of an Open Government Task Force that will study open record and open meeting laws in South Dakota to ensure maximum public access to state government business.

"The workings of government should be as transparent as practicable," the Governor said. "Unless there is a compelling reason otherwise, I believe government information should be open and easily accessible."

The task force includes media; city, county and state officials; representatives of various organizations; law enforcement; prosecutors; and others.

"This task force will continue work that has been done in the past decade that led to creation of the Open Meeting Commission and an Open Meeting statute that presumes most state government records are public," the Attorney General said. ""Reviewing the current process with those who deal with open records and meetings each day is invaluable and should be considered."

The Open Government Task Force will meet several times this summer and fall, and then report its findings and recommendations to the Governor and Attorney General. The initial meeting of the group will be Aug. 22, at 1 p.m. CDT, in the Capitol Lake Visitor Center at Pierre.

A likely result of the study will be legislation that would continue to improve and update open record and open meeting laws.
