Statement From Gov. Daugaard On Keystone XL
Statement
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: Nov. 6, 2015
Location: Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard issued the following statement today in response to President Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL Pipeline:
"I'm disappointed in President Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Oil will still be produced in Alberta, Canada, and shipped by rail or piped elsewhere. By halting the Keystone Pipeline the President is eliminating an opportunity for America to be more reliant on trusted North American friends and less reliant on oil producers from other places -- many of whom do not respect nor share our values."
