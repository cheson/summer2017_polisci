Location: Pierre, SD

Pat Costello will leave his position as Commissioner of the Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED) at the end of this month, Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today.
Costello, who has served as commissioner since Gov. Daugaard took office in 2011, is leaving for an opportunity in the private sector. His last day will be June 30, 2016.
"Pat has been an outstanding representative for South Dakota, and under his leadership, our state has added thousands of jobs and continued to be one of the best places in America for business," said the Governor. "I sincerely thank him for his service and wish him the very best in the future."
Costello is a businessman and, prior to serving in the Daugaard administration, spent four years on the Sioux Falls city council. In addition to serving as GOED commissioner, Costello has also served on the Governor's Executive Committee.
"I'd like to thank the Governor for the opportunity to serve as GOED commissioner," said Costello. "It has been a personally rewarding experience. I'm very proud of what the Governor and our team have accomplished, and I'll always value the friendships across the state I've made."
Aaron Scheibe, GOED's deputy commissioner, will serve as interim commissioner from July 1 until a new commissioner is named.
