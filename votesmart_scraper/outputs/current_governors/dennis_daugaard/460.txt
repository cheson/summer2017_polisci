A statement from South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard on President Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL Pipeline:
"President Obama's decision to deny a presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline is disappointing on many levels, but most of all it is unfortunate for the thousands of welders and construction workers who would have been hired to build it. We still need to strengthen our country's energy security, we still have not recovered from one of the worst recessions in decades, and we still have too many people out of work. We still need this project."
