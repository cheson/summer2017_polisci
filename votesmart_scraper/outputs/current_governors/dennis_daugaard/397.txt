Gov. Dennis Daugaard is continuning his efforts to further develop South Dakota's dairy industry at the World Ag Expo in California this week.

Representatives of the state Department of Agriculture have joined him in the endeavor.

"Our reasonable feed costs, favorable tax climate, strong demand for milk, and unwavering support for agriculture make South Dakota a perfect place for the dairy industry to expand," the Governor said.

In addition to major dairy processors already operating in South Dakota, Bel Brands is currently constructing a $100 million cheese-processing plant at Brookings that will begin operating in the summer of 2014.

South Dakota's current herd of about 92,000 dairy cows must be doubled to keep up with the capacities of the state's milk processors, Gov. Daugaard said.

"We are open for business and continue to invite dairy producers to grow with us in South Dakota," the Governor said. "This is a great place to raise cows, and it's also a great place to raise families."

Gov. Daugaard and state Agriculture Department officials are at the World Ag Expo in Tulare, Calif., through Feb. 14.

Agriculture is South Dakota's No. 1 industry, generating more than $21 billion in annual economic activity and employing more than 122,000 South Dakotans. The South Dakota Department of Agriculture's mission is to promote, protect, preserve and improve the industry for today and tomorrow.
