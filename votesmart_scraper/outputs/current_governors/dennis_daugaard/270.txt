Nineteen South Dakota college students have been awarded a state scholarship that supports new teachers who serve in critical-need teaching areas. Gov. Dennis Daugaard today announced the first recipients in the Critical Teaching Needs Scholarship Program.

"The goal is to encourage high school graduates to obtain their teaching degree in South Dakota, then remain here and contribute to the state and its citizens by working in a critical-need teaching area," Gov. Daugaard said. "We have 19 very deserving future educators in this program, who will give back so much to South Dakota students and communities."

Scholarship recipients agree to remain in South Dakota and work in a critical-need teaching area for five years after college graduation. If terms of the agreement cannot be met, the scholarship converts into an interest-bearing loan. Subject areas of critical teaching need are determined by the South Dakota Department of Education, based on data collected from local school districts.

The teaching scholarship may be awarded to a student for up to two years, with the maximum annual award not to exceed the cost of tuition and general fees for 30 credit hours at a South Dakota public university. The program is open to all accredited postsecondary institutions in South Dakota that offer degrees in elementary or secondary education and that agree to participate.

The scholarship program, created by the 2013 South Dakota Legislature, is administered by the South Dakota Board of Regents.
