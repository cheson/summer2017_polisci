Gov. Dennis Daugaard and the state's tribal leaders are joining together to improve the achievement levels and graduation rates of Native American students.

The Governor has established the Native American Student Achievement Advisory Council, which will consist of a variety of stakeholders including tribal leaders and representatives from the Indian Education Advisory Council, the South Dakota departments of Education and Tribal Relations, and education groups.

"Today's world demands that, in order to succeed, students must graduate from the K-12 system prepared for postsecondary education and careers, and many of our Native American students face unique challenges in achieving these goals," said Gov. Dennis Daugaard. "This is an issue we must all confront. By bringing stakeholders together, I am confident we will establish an effective dialogue and move toward solutions."

The council will report its findings to the Legislature and the Governor by Dec. 1, 2015.
