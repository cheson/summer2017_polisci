Gov. Daugaard To Call Special Session

Gov. Dennis Daugaard will be convening the South Dakota Legislature for a special legislative session on Saturday, June 22 to obtain legislative support to use fiscal year-end funds for the new State Veterans Home in Hot Springs.

After the State Engineer opened the bids for the project, it became apparent that the amount estimated by the architect would not cover the cost of the Veterans Home.

"My priority is to build a durable, quality facility for our veterans -- they deserve nothing less," said Gov. Daugaard in an email to legislators. "I do not believe we can afford to wait until January to take action, because we would lose this construction season."

A special legislative session is necessary to prevent the state from losing a $23 million federal grant already designated to the Veterans Home.

Gov. Daugaard is hopeful the setback will not delay progress on building the new home. As the state approaches the end of the fiscal year, current estimates indicate tax revenues will be $7-10 million higher and expenses $7-10 million lower than expected, leaving $14-20 million.
