Today Gov. Dennis Daugaard is asking South Dakotans to remember the anniversary of the state constitution, which was passed on Oct. 1, 1889.

"I'm very grateful that exactly 125 years ago, voters in southern Dakota voted to accept the constitution," said Gov. Daugaard. "Our constitution is the solid foundation of our state. It has kept us grounded in the rule of law and steered us toward order and prosperity."

Voters accepted the constitution by a wide margin, with 70,131 voting in favor and 3,237 against.

Also on that day, the voters passed prohibition, rejected women's suffrage and proportional representation, and elected Arthur Mellette as the final territorial governor. Mellette was then elected to serve as the first governor of the state on Nov. 2, 1889.
