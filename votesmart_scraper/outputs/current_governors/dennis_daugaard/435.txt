A statement from Gov. Dennis Daugaard on referral of HB1234:

"I'm not surprised that the Teacher Bonus Bill was referred because the teachers' union put a lot of work into collecting signatures. I look forward to furthering the discussion with the people of South Dakota on this very important topic. The bill is aimed at improving student achievement by channeling extra money directly to our best teachers and phasing out teacher tenure."
