Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that he will appoint Conrad Adam of Pierre to the South Dakota Board of Regents.
Adam will serve as the student member of the Board of Regents. He is entering his junior year at the University of South Dakota, where he is majoring in finance.
"Conrad Adam will be an excellent representative of the student perspective on the board," said the Governor. "He is an impressive young man, and I appreciate his willingness to take on this role."
"I am honored to be appointed by Governor Daugaard as student regent," Adam said. "I look forward to advocating on behalf of students in our state university system."
The South Dakota Board of Regents is the state governing board for the six state universities and two special schools. The student member is one of the board's nine members and is a full voting member of the board.
Adam will succeed Joseph Schartz, who concluded three years of service on the board this month following his graduation from South Dakota State University.
