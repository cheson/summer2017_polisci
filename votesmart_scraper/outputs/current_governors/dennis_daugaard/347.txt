Yankton, the capital of Dakota Territory, is hosting several special events free to the public on Saturday, Nov. 2, to kick off the coming of South Dakota's 125th anniversary of statehood in 2014.

A special walking tour of historic Yankton sites will begin at 3:30 p.m. CDT where along the way participants will encounter re-enactors portraying individuals important in South Dakota's history.

The Riverfront Event Center will host a social hour from 6 -- 7 p.m. and a special statehood anniversary program from 7 -- 7:30 p.m. with Gov. Dennis Daugaard, First Lady Linda Daugaard, Lt. Gov. Matt Michels and Karen Michels.

The 125th anniversary statehood ball begins at 7:30 p.m. featuring the Gale Pifer Orchestra. People are encouraged to dress in period-appropriate costumes, but costumes are not required. Prizes will be awarded for the best costumes.

All of the events are appropriate for all ages and children are encouraged to attend.

"Although most statehood anniversary activities will occur in 2014, these events will be a kickoff for next year's celebration," said Gov. Daugaard. "The people of Yankton fought hard for statehood 125 years ago and their enthusiasm is still alive and well today."

Lt. Gov. Michels, a Yankton native, said, "We are very proud of our heritage in Yankton and the role our city played in South Dakota becoming a state in 1889."
