Gov. Dennis Daugaard will speak about his Fiscal Year 2012 budget proposal in a series of community appearances across South Dakota over the next week.
The Governor has asked the state Legislature to balance the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 by ensuring that ongoing state spending does not exceed ongoing state revenues. To do so, it is necessary to make substantial reductions in state government spending.
"Although the South Dakota budget is in better shape than that of nearly any other state in the nation, we must not spend more money than we receive," Gov. Daugaard said. "Taxpayers expect us to always be frugal with their money, and I am asking the Legislature to honor those wishes. We must pass a budget that hits the reset button and puts us on a sustainable financial path -- without raising taxes.
The Governor will meet community groups to discuss his budget proposal on the following schedule:
