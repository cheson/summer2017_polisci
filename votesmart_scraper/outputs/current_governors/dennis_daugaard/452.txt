The Honorable Matt Michels
President of the Senate
500 East Capitol Avenue
Pierre, SD 57501-5070

Dear Mr. President and Members of the Senate:

I respectfully return Senate Bill 194 with the following recommendations as to STYLE and FORM.

Senate Bill 194 is entitled, "An Act to make an appropriation to fund tax refunds for elderly persons and persons with a disability, to revise the income eligibility requirements for property tax and sales tax refunds, and to declare an emergency."

Section 7 amended the maximum multi-member household income in two places to "thirteen thousand two seven hundred fifty dollars." The first is found on page 4, line 17 and the second is on page 4, line 20 of the Senate Bill.

The bill failed to make that same change in a third place. On page 4, lines 18-19 of the Senate Bill, the maximum household income is described as "thirteen thousand two hundred fifty dollars."

This problem can be solved by making the following style and form correction to the Senate Bill as follows: On page 4, line 19, delete "two" and in its place insert "seven."

I respectfully request you concur with my recommendations as to style and form.

Respectfully submitted,

Dennis Daugaard

The Honorable Val Rausch
President of the Senate
500 East Capitol Avenue
Pierre, SD 57501-5070

Dear Mr. Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives:

I respectfully return House Bill 1058 and pursuant to Article IV, Section 4 of the South Dakota Constitution, I exercise a LINE ITEM VETO on the same.

House Bill 1058 is entitled, "An Act to make an appropriation to the Unified Judicial System court automation fund and revise certain record search fees charged by clerks of court".

This bill appropriates one dollar ($1) in Section 1 of the bill which is unnecessary.
Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the bill relate to the appropriation of one dollar ($1) to the Unified Judicial System. Sections 4, 5, and 6 of House Bill 1058 amend SDCL 16-2-29.5 to change the records search fee from fifteen dollars ($15) to the new fee of twenty dollars ($20). This new fee becomes effective January 1, 2013 and will sunset June 30, 2017.

Because of this unnecessary one dollar ($1) appropriation in Section 1, I am exercising a line item veto to strike the portion of the bill which relates to this appropriation. I specifically request that, Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the bill be deleted.

This eliminates the one dollar ($1) appropriation and the other sections relating to this special appropriation.

Finally, I strike the following phrase in the title "make an appropriation to the Unified Judicial System court automation fund and." This changes the title of the bill so that the title relates only to the fee increase.

I respectfully request that you concur with my LINE ITEM VETO of House Bill 1058.

Sincerely,


Dennis Daugaard
