A Statement from Gov. Dennis Daugaard on Today's Unanimous South Dakota Supreme Court Ruling That the State System of Funding School Districts is Constitutional
Statement

"I'm pleased with this opinion because the appropriate place to determine school funding is the
Legislature, not the courts. I believe we should focus on student achievement, not spending, as
the best measure of educational success. That approach is very consistent with the Supreme
Court's decision."
