Legislative leaders and Gov. Dennis Daugaard have agreed to a package of amendments to HB 1234, the education reform bill that the Governor proposed earlier this year.

(A summary of the proposal is included at the end of this release.)

"This proposal maintains the Governor's goal to focus on student achievement by investing in teaching," said Senate Majority Leader Russell Olson. "The Legislature is offering its ideas to reach that goal."

"Legislators reached out to educators and to their constituents for feedback and ideas," said House Majority Leader David Lust. "We have responded to those ideas, while still focusing on student achievement."

Gov. Daugaard applauded the Legislature's efforts.

"My goal is to strategically invest in teachers to improve student achievement, and this proposal meets that goal," the Governor said. "This is the legislative process at work, and I appreciate the effort that our legislators put into crafting these proposals."
