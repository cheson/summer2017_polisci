Statement
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: July 29, 2011
Location: Pierre, SD

"We can now see the light at the end of the tunnel. The Corps release schedule will allow most evacuated homeowners back into their homes by early September and will remove pressure from the levees. The Corps must be vigilant in monitoring snowpack and precipitation in the watershed, however, to prevent a recurrence of flooding next spring. "
