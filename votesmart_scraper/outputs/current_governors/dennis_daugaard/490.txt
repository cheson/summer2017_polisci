A statement from Gov. Dennis Daugaard on the potential
closing 80 Post Offices in South Dakota by the Postal Service:
"Although I understand the need for efficiency in the Postal Service, I am nervous about the impact this could have on these communities. I am particularly concerned about mail service being discontinued in county seats. The idea of 'village post offices' is promising, and I hope to learn more as the postal service continues its review."
