Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that he will appoint Jim Morgan of Brookings to the South Dakota Board of Regents.

Morgan retired in 2013 after twelve years as president and CEO of Daktronics, concluding a four-decade career at Daktronics, and remains on the company's board of directors.

A graduate of South Dakota State University, Morgan earned his B.S. Electrical Engineering in 1969 and his M.S. Electrical Engineering in 1970. He joined Daktronics in 1969, while still a student, during the company's first year of operation.

"Jim Morgan spent years leading one of South Dakota's iconic businesses, and he understands the critical role that our universities play in preparing our young people for successful careers in South Dakota," said Gov. Daugaard. "Daktronics pioneered the linkage between university research and business development, as well as the value of internships in higher education and workforce development. With this experience, Jim will be an excellent regent and I thank him for agreeing to serve."

Morgan's appointment is effective April 3, following the Board's April meeting. He succeeds Regent Dean Krogman, who is retiring from the Board after 12 years of service, including two as board president.
