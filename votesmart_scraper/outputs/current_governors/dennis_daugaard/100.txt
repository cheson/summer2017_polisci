Gov. Dennis Daugaard signed the components of his education proposal -- House Bill 1182, Senate Bill 131 and Senate Bill 133 -- into law today.
"I thank legislators for partnering with me to pass this historic package of legislation. Thanks to their support, South Dakota will no longer be in last place for teacher pay and we will be able to better compete with our surrounding states," said Gov. Daugaard. "This is going to make all the difference for our students whose achievement depends upon a good workforce of teachers."
HB 1182 increases the sales tax by a half-penny and dedicates $36 million for property tax relief. The new revenue will increase South Dakota's average teacher salary from $40,000 by setting a target average of $48,500. Individual teacher salary levels will be set by local school districts. The bill requires school districts to use at least 85 percent of new funds for teacher pay or benefits.
SB 131 reforms the school funding formula to increase transparency and accountability. The bill also imposes new caps on school general reserve funds and on the growth of capital outlay levies.
SB 133 includes a number of proposals to recruit and retain more teachers and to create new opportunities for school efficiency.
