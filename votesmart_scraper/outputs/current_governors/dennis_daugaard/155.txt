Classes are beginning again, football season will soon be underway and South Dakota's favorite end-of-summer event is coming up -- the South Dakota State Fair, held Sept. 3 through Sept. 7 in Huron.
The State Fair has a proud history of educating children (and their parents) about how our farmers and ranchers produce food. Whether it's watching a livestock show, getting "up close and personal" with a calf or lamb, sitting in the seat of a new combine or tractor, asking an exhibitor what their goats eat, or learning Mrs. Olson's secret for growing massive pumpkins, there are a host of opportunities for inspiring and educating young people about the wonders of agriculture.
Of course, the State Fair is located in Huron, but for a few days each year, the fairgrounds become a community unto itself. Be sure to stop at the FFA Animal Nursery and ask state officers how their year of service is going. Take a walk through the exhibition halls and chat with 4-H'ers about their projects. Visit with the vendors. Dozens of families from South Dakota and around the country come back year after year because they have such a good time. And everyone has a story to share.
This annual celebration wouldn't be complete without the great fair food, exciting carnival rides and unique activities. Enjoy The Band Perry concert at the grandstand, try your luck in the arm wrestling competition, take your spouse for a twirl in the jitterbug contest, or play a game or two on the midway. No matter your interest, you're bound to have a good time.
I am proud of our State Fair. It's a one-of-a-kind celebration of agriculture and community. I hope you will mark the dates on your calendar and make plans to come out for at least one day. It's worth the trip.
