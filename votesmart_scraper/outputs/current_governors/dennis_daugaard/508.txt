Press Release
By: Dennis Daugaard
Date: April 15, 2011
Location: Pierre, SD

Governor Dennis Daugaard today released additional information on the
procedure that has followed the incident at the South Dakota State Penitentiary on Tuesday,
April 12, that resulted in the death of corrections officer Ronald Johnson.
"Even as we remember Ron Johnson and pray for his family, we have already taken steps to
investigate this crime and review Penitentiary procedures," the Governor said.
As is standard operating procedure, a critical incident review is under way by the Department of
Corrections. That review will be incorporated into a more thorough report, which will be
completed within 30 days. The DOC's final report will be released to the public, with redactions
only relating to safety, security, or the pending prosecution of those charged with murder in the death of the correctional officer.
"Throughout this process, it has been my direction to be as open and forthcoming as possible,"
Gov. Daugaard said. "We will release all information that does not adversely affect safety or
security at the Penitentiary, or the state's prosecution of those responsible. In making these
decisions, I am guided by the advice of the warden of the Penitentiary and the attorney general."
