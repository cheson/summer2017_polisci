Gov. Dennis Daugaard announced today that he will appoint Kim Malsam-Rysdon as Secretary of Health.

Malsam-Rysdon has held the position in an interim role since last month. She will replace Secretary Doneen Hollingsworth, who retired after nineteen years as secretary.

"Public health has never been more important as we see the need to respond to emerging issues such as Ebola and a recent outbreak of contagious diseases like measles", said Gov. Daugaard. "Kim will not only be able to lead our state's response to these issues but also ensure we are doing all we can to address chronic diseases and access to quality health care services across our state".

Malsam-Rysdon will continue to serve as senior advisor to the Governor and as a member of the Governor's Executive Committee. She previously served as Secretary of the Department of Social Services.

"I appreciate the ability to serve the state of South Dakota in this role and look forward to leading our state's health department," said Malsam-Rysdon. "Public health issues and access to health care are critical issues that impact individuals and families across South Dakota. I look forward to working with stakeholders throughout our state to address these needs."
