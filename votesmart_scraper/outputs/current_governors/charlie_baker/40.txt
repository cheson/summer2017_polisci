The Baker-Polito Administration today awarded $11.8 million in Workforce Skills Capital Grants to 32 vocational schools, community colleges, and traditional public high schools, which will use the funds to purchase vocational technical equipment and expand skills training programs for careers in growing industries. Twenty institutions are first-time recipients of the Workforce Skills Capital Grants.
"These investments have a major impact for the educational institutions training our workforce and the students who stand to benefit from enhanced skills and career paths," said Governor Charlie Baker. "Strengthening relationships between educational institutions and local industry as this program seeks to do is crucial to the success of our communities and Commonwealth as a whole."
The Workforce Skills Capital Grants program was created by the Baker-Polito Administration last year to assist educational institutions in demonstrating partnerships with industry and aligning curriculum and credentials with local businesses' demand, maximizing planning objectives and hiring or internship opportunities regionally.
"We are pleased these investments are already benefitting students and adult learners across our Commonwealth," said Lt. Governor Karyn Polito. "The training students receive on the most up-to-date equipment purchased with these grants makes all the difference to them when they go into the workplace."
To date, the Baker-Polito Administration has awarded more than $24 million in Workforce Skills Capital Grants to 63 different institutions, improving programs that impact more than 7,100 students per year. The economic development bill signed by Governor Baker last year includes $45 million for the awards over the next three years to increase the capacity and quality of vocational educational programs.
Governor Baker today visited Greater Lowell Technical High School to announce the latest round of grant awardees. Greater Lowell Technical received $466,000 to create an Agile Digital Fabrication/Maker Space where high school and adult education students will engage in technological experimentation, hardware development, and idea prototyping.
The Governor was joined by the Workforce Skills Cabinet he established shortly after taking office, consisting of Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Ronald L. Walker, II, Education Secretary James Peyser, and Housing and Economic Development Secretary Jay Ash. The Cabinet, which seeks to align education, workforce and economic development strategies and improve job opportunities, worked to establish the Workforce Skills Capital Grant Program.
"In the Workforce Skills Cabinet, we are focused on making sure residents have access to education and training that aligns with industry demand so all Massachusetts residents have an opportunity to be successful," said Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Ronald L. Walker, II. "These grants enable educational institutions to partner with local businesses to give their students a jump-start on careers."
"The goal of these grants is to update capital equipment, expand capacity, and launch new programs at educational institutions in order to create high-quality career pathways for more people across the Commonwealth," said Education Secretary James Peyser. "These grants give students and adult learners more opportunities to be successful through training, education and experience in fields that are growing and in-demand."
"The best way to support our local and regional economies, and to grow our companies, is to foster a workforce that is ready for the jobs of today and tomorrow," said Housing and Economic Development Secretary Jay Ash. "These grants will help us to continue training the nation's most competitive workforce, by training students on industry-standard equipment and processes, and creating new employment opportunities for students and adult learners throughout the Commonwealth."
