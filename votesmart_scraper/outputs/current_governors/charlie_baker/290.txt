Patrick's reckless spending gives Beacon Hill different set of rules
Standing with small business leaders today, Charlie Baker said Governor Patrick's reckless spending during the past four years has sent the wrong message to employers and taxpayers struggling to pay the bills and has set Massachusetts up with a $2.5 billion budget deficit for next year and left more than 300,000 people without a job.
Instead of forcing state government to live within its means, Governor Patrick has increased spending by $3 billion and has continued to spend taxpayer dollars on frivolous items such as a horse bridge in Randolph ($4.6 million) and leased parking spaces that are most often empty ($3 million). And in one year alone, Governor Patrick increased 500 different line items in the budget, increasing spending by $1.1 billion.
However, Governor Patrick has never believed that he could cut more from state government. In 2008, Governor Patrick declared on WTKK, "There's nowhere near the amount of fat [in state government] that people think there is." And just last week at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce forum, Patrick said that "we're doing the best we can."
Baker has proposed limiting state spending on an annual basis to 99 percent of the revenues the state collects, something Governor Patrick has never achieved. Under Patrick's watch, Massachusetts spent more than it took in every year, leaving a huge budget hole Patrick used tax increases to help fill.
"Governor Patrick must be the only person in Massachusetts who thinks state government isn't bloated with bureaucracy," said Baker. "Governor Patrick has been living with a different set of rules than businesses and families have had to, and if he's re-elected, we can expect little to change."
