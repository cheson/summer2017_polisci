Location: Quincy, MA

Governor Charlie Baker, joined by state and local officials, today announced that Walgreens is the first pharmacy in Massachusetts to launch a new safe and convenient medication disposal program to reduce prescription drug misuse while visiting a new kiosk at the Walgreens Quincy Avenue store in Quincy. Walgreens installed 13 drug take-back kiosks in pharmacies throughout Massachusetts for easy disposal of unwanted, unused or expired medications at no cost and no questions asked.
"Opioid misuse and addiction can often start at home in our own medicine cabinets, and today we are pleased to partner with Walgreens to take more steps toward combating this public health crisis," said Governor Charlie Baker. "Increasing drug take back opportunities and installing free safe disposal kiosks in pharmacies across the Commonwealth is another step in the right direction as the Commonwealth works collaboratively to bend the trend on opioid and heroin misuse."
Installation of the statewide kiosks is another step forward in the Commonwealth's commitment to battling the opioid and heroin epidemic that has impacted communities from Cape Cod to Western Massachusetts. Take-back kiosks are located at Walgreens stores in East Boston, Fall River, Framingham, Gloucester, Lowell, Malden, Quincy, Randolph, Roxbury, Stoneham, Stoughton, Springfield and Worcester.
