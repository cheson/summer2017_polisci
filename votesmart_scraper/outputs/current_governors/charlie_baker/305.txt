Tax Rate Cited as Real Issue Delaying Economic Growth

A new study released on Thursday shows that 77 percent of business leaders surveyed in Massachusetts believe that the state's tax policy is the biggest indicator of the business climate, a tax rate they say is uncompetitive and unpredictable.
According to the survey released jointly by the Massachusetts High Technology Council and the Pioneer Institute, Massachusetts is currently unable to "create jobs at a rate which matches the state's need for revenues," and business leaders say the business climate is worsening. This study comes as the state announced that roughly 4,000 jobs were created in Massachusetts during the month of August, with more than 300,000 residents still unemployed here.
Charlie Baker, the only candidate to support reducing the business tax rate -- cited in the business survey as the most important single aspect of state tax policy -- said the study reflects the need to reduce taxes to truly create job growth, and that the tax hikes of the past four years have contributed to the record job losses. Baker has proposed reducing the business tax rate to 5 percent during his first term in office if he's elected governor.
"We have to get serious about cutting taxes if we want businesses in Massachusetts to start re-hiring the more than 300,000 people who are out of work today," said Baker. "This isn't the time for a victory lap. Governor Patrick continues to miss the larger picture here: Massachusetts is the fifth most expensive state in which to do business and it's the policies of the past four years that have gotten us there."
