Press Release
By: Karyn Polito Charlie Baker
Date: March 4, 2015
Location: Boston, MA

Today, the Baker-Polito Administration filed a budget proposal with the Legislature for Fiscal Year 2016 that right-sizes state government and fuels economic growth across the Commonwealth. The budget recommendations include increased investments in local aid, education, homelessness and reliable transportation, while instituting reforms to curb overall spending, and holds the line on new taxes and fees.
"Our budget today sets the stage for a competitive and stable economic environment by making investments essential to future growth," said Governor Baker. "By right-sizing the budget now and investing in transportation, education and our communities, we are making Massachusetts a better place to live, work and raise our families. This budget will allow our economy to grow, strengthen our schools, and build healthy communities across the Commonwealth."
"Massachusetts families make tough choices to live within their means and they expect lawmakers to do the same with their hard-earned taxpayer dollars," said Lt. Governor Polito. "This budget proposal responsibly addresses our deficit while maintaining our commitment to boost local aid in our cities and towns, support schools and set the tone for a healthy economic environment."
"The budget we are filing today solves a $1.8 billion budget gap while maintaining core state services and providing increases to many priorities," said Administration & Finance Secretary Kristen Lepore. "We accomplished this without raising fees, taxes or drawing down on the stabilization fund -- the first time it has not been used in four budget cycles."
