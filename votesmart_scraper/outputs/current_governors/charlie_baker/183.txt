Today, Governor Charlie Baker nominated veteran prosecutor Paul M. Treseler to the Massachusetts Parole Board, the agency within the Executive Office of Public Safety authorized to grant paroles and supervise parolees. If confirmed, Treseler would be designated Chairman by Governor Baker.
"Over the course of a prosecutorial career spanning nearly 20 years, Paul has taken the lead on a number of high profile cases and has distinguished himself through his commitment to the law and achieving justice for victims of crimes," said Governor Baker.
"Paul Treseler's depth in criminal investigations makes him an ideal candidate to lead an agency that is critical to our goal of enhancing the Commonwealth's reentry programs and reducing our rate of recidivism," said Public Safety Secretary Daniel Bennett. "He will bring a thorough and evenhanded approach to the critically important cases that come before the Board."
The seven members of the Parole Board are appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Governor's Council. Members are appointed for five year terms or to fill the unexpired term of a prior member. Board members serve on a full time basis. The Governor designates one member of the Board as the Chairman, who acts as the executive and administrative head of the Board.
