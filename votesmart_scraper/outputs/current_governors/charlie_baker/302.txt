Statement

Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker on Monday released the following statement on Governor Patrick's failure to manage the state's budget crisis, specifically recent news that Beacon Hill is circulating a new spending bill that would address deficiencies in the current fiscal year.
"Governor Patrick has failed to manage the state's budget since the moment he got into office. Fewer than three months into the fiscal year, Governor Patrick's budget -- which was out of balance to begin with -- continues to spiral out of control. The Governor clearly intends to spend more money, but rather than taking ownership of the problem, he's hiding behind the Legislature. The people of Massachusetts deserve a leader who will take this deficit head on and that's what I'll do if I'm elected governor."
