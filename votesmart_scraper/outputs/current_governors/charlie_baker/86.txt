Press Release
By: Charlie Baker
Date: Aug. 8, 2016
Location: Boston, MA

Governor Baker today announced the launch of the Baker-Polito Administration's hiring transparency initiative, providing new online search features for new hires in Executive Department offices. Effective immediately, the public will have access to a web page within the state's transparency website, Open Checkbook, that provides more detailed information on recently hired state workers.
"We are pleased to deliver on our promise to increase transparency around the hiring of state employees," said Governor Charlie Baker. "The people of Massachusetts and prospective job applicants deserve a state government that conducts an accountable and fair hiring process when it comes to filling publicly posted positions in the Executive Department."
The information that can now be found on the View New Hires website includes: the start date of the position; the name of the selected candidate; their annualized salary; their relevant years of experience; their education, licenses and certifications held; as well as an indicator of whether a written reference was issued by an elected state official on behalf of the candidate selected.
"We are glad to take an important step today towards a more transparent state government," said Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito. "The new policy implemented today will ensure that the applicants chosen to fill open positions are qualified and fully disclose any recommendation made on their behalf by an elected official."
Data on hires made between July 10 and July 23 appear in the first publication and the site will be regularly updated on the Monday following the first and third Saturday of each month.
