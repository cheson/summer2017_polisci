Across the country, the heroin and opioid crisis claims the lives of 78 people every day. This horrible epidemic is the most urgent public health and safety challenge currently facing states.
As governors, there is hardly a room that we walk into where we don't encounter someone affected by addiction. The harsh reality is that many of us know someone, be it a family member, best friend, neighbor, classmate or colleague, affected by the surge in opioid addiction. And surge it is--since 1999, the rate of deaths from opioid overdose has nearly quadrupled, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The crisis reaches beyond its victims and their loved ones to the health care workers, first responders and law enforcement officers who literally staff the front lines of the opioid epidemic every day in our communities. It is devastating families, businesses and communities in every corner of our country.
A challenge of this magnitude requires an unparalleled amount of coordination among all levels of government. States have been leading the way in working to save millions of citizens' lives and put an end to this epidemic.
As the leaders of the National Governors Association and the NGA Health and Human Services Committee, each of us has worked with our fellow governors to bring attention to this issue and highlight successes some states have already had with addressing the epidemic.
As governors, we have developed a comprehensive approach to combating the epidemic that focuses on prevention, intervention, treatment and recovery while supporting the law enforcement community.
