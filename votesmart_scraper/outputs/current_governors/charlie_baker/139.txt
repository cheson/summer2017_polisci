Governor Baker Statement on White House Opioid Abuse Proposal
Statement
By: Charlie Baker
Date: Feb. 3, 2016
Location: Boston, MA

Today, Governor Charlie Baker released the following statement supporting $1.1 billion in new funding from the President's FY17 budget that will address prescription opioid abuse and the heroin use epidemic that is plaguing the Commonwealth and nation:
"President Obama's comprehensive proposal aimed to help states combat the opioid epidemic, including additional funds to expand treatment options and overdose prevention efforts, is a positive development for Massachusetts' own efforts to address this public health crisis. It is encouraging that the President is taking action on a recommendation from our opioid working group to create a pilot program for nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine. With nearly four people dying per day from overdoses in our state, it is clear that this epidemic transcends partisan boundaries and our administration looks forward to the legislature taking action on a bill to target the drivers of opioid and prescription painkiller abuse."
