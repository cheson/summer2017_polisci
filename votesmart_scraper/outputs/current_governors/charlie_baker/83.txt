Governor Charlie Baker has signed legislation supporting major new investments in the Commonwealth's local transportation infrastructure, including a $50 million Municipal Small Bridge Program, the broadening of the Complete Streets Funding Program to support projects in more municipalities, and a $750 million authorization for federal highway aid.
"We recognize the important role transportation infrastructure plays in the strength of our communities and economy," said Governor Baker. "I am pleased to sign this legislation providing additional support for our cities and towns to focus on important local projects and accessibility."
The legislation, An Act providing for the financing of certain improvements to municipal roads and bridges (H. 4424), authorizes $50 million in investments over five years for the Municipal Small Bridge Program, first introduced by the Baker-Polito Administration earlier this year to support approximately 1,300 bridges on municipal roads across Massachusetts spanning lengths between 10 and 20 feet. The program targets small bridge projects not eligible for federal aid under existing replacement or rehabilitation programming and are at high risk for full or partial closure due to present condition, at up to $500,000 per year, per municipality for administration, design and construction.
