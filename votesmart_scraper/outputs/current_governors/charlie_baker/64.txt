The Baker-Polito Administration received federal approval today for its innovative five-year Medicaid (MassHealth) 1115 waiver. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved waiver supports the restructuring of the MassHealth program to provide integrated, outcomes-based care to 1.9 million Massachusetts residents.
"Our administration is pleased to announce this innovative waiver as a major step toward creating a sustainable MassHealth system for the people of the Commonwealth," said Governor Charlie Baker. "This waiver is the first major overhaul of the MassHealth program in 20 years and includes critical reforms to promote coordinated care, hold providers accountable and offer expanded access for substance abuse disorder services driven by the opioid crisis. I appreciate CMS's collaboration and the hard work of Secretary Marylou Sudders and Assistant Secretary Dan Tsai to deliver a waiver to support the people of Massachusetts."
