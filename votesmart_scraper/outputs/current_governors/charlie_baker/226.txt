Statement
By: Charlie Baker
Date: April 15, 2015
Location: Boston, MA

Governor Charlie Baker released the following statement on One Boston Day, commemorating the second anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings:
"Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, who seek to make sense of that awful day two years ago. In many respects, those most affected by the events of two years ago have shown us all the way back -- with their courage, grace and determination. They honor the past, remember and treasure loved ones lost and injured, and look forward to a better future. We should strive to do the same."
Governor Baker joined Boston Mayor Marty Walsh for memorial ceremonies this morning. He and Lt. Governor Polito will join members of their Cabinet and staff in a moment of silence this afternoon at 2:49 PM in Memorial Hall at the State House.
