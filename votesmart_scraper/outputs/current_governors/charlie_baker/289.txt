Today's job numbers show two straight months of job losses
Massachusetts officials announced today that the state has lost nearly 21,000 jobs in September and revised its previously-reported figure from August, showing two straight months of job losses for Bay State residents.
In August, instead of the previously-reported 2,100 gain in jobs, Massachusetts actually lost 3,000. On the campaign trail and in his campaign ads, Governor Patrick has boasted Massachusetts gaining 64,000 new jobs this year.
"Massachusetts needs a governor who has real plans for job growth that will actually make a difference in getting people back to work," said Charlie Baker. "Governor Patrick makes a lot of claims, but as these job figures today show, he has no real plans to grow jobs and turn the state's economy around. Job growth is my biggest priority, and more than ever, Massachusetts needs a turnaround."
