Governor Baker, Mayor Walsh Testify to Urge Passage of Opioid Legislation
Statement
By: Charlie Baker
Date: Nov. 16, 2015
Location: Boston, MA

Governor Charlie Baker today testified before the Joint Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse, alongside Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh and a representative from Attorney General Maura Healey's office, in support of the Governor's bill, "An Act Relative to Substance Use Treatment, Education and Prevention." Filed in mid-October, the landmark legislation has gained significant momentum across the state in support of its critical provisions developed to address the Commonwealth's opioid epidemic that is claiming the lives of nearly four Bay Staters every day.
"I understand that some of our proposals disrupt the status quo. They are supposed to," said Governor Baker. "Our legislation aims to bend the trend on opioid misuse and provide much needed prevention and education programs, while continuing to expand access to treatment and recovery programs across the Commonwealth."
