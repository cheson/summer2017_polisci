Press Release
By: Charlie Baker
Date: July 8, 2016
Location: Boston, MA

Governor Charlie Baker today signed compromise legislation, An Act relative to transgender anti-discrimination (S. 2407), to extend protections against discrimination for gender identity to any place of public accommodation, with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) adopting regulations or policies to enforce its provisions. The bill, passed by the House and Senate this week, further directs the Massachusetts attorney general's office to issue regulations or guidance for referring to law enforcement any person whose assertion of a gender identity is for an improper purpose.
"No one should be discriminated against in Massachusetts because of their gender identity," said Governor Baker. "This compromise legislation extends additional protections to the Commonwealth's transgender community, and includes language to address the public safety concerns expressed by some by requiring the Attorney General to issue regulations to protect against people abusing the law."
"We thank the Legislature for sending us a compromise proposal that assures additional protections from discrimination based on gender identity to Massachusetts' transgender community and provides for guidance from the Attorney General to address issues of public safety that have been raised by some," said Lt. Governor Polito.
The legislation provides for the MCAD and attorney general's office to report their recommendations, regulations or guidance by September 1st, with full implementation of the law taking effect on October 1, 2016.
