Patrick still unwilling to support program after four successful years in effect in Boston
Gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker on Wednesday released the following statement following another news report of Governor Patrick's unwillingness to sign onto an agreement with federal immigration officials, known as Secure Communities, which would allow local law enforcement across Massachusetts to share information with federal immigration officials about dangerous criminals who are arrested.
Baker last week called for Patrick to sign the agreement with federal immigration officials.
According to a FOX25 news report tonight, the pilot program has been completed in Boston for two years now, despite Governor Patrick's comments last week that he is waiting for the pilot to be completed before discussing whether or not he will sign the agreement. Patrick Administration officials interviewed for tonight's story reiterated the governor's resistance to giving local law enforcement these tools to take dangerous criminals off the streets with this program.
"Governor Patrick has changed his story once again on illegal immigration and is standing in the way of giving local law enforcement additional tools to take dangerous criminals who are illegal immigrants off the streets," said Baker. "Massachusetts needs to be doing everything it can to enforce and strengthen our laws against illegal immigration, and the governor should stop turning a blind eye to the problem."
