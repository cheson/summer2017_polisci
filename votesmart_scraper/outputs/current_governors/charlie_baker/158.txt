Governor Charlie Baker and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito announced today that the final economic trigger was met in order to lower the state's income tax from 5.15% to 5.10%. The income tax cut for all Massachusetts residents will become effective January 1, 2016.
"Meeting the requirements needed to reduce the income tax rate is a sign that the Massachusetts economy remains strong," said Governor Baker. "Allowing citizens across the Commonwealth to keep more money in their pockets will allow the state's economy to continue growing in 2016."
