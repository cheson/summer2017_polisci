Governor Charlie Baker and Lt. Governor Karyn Polito released the following statement after the passage of House Bill 52, the proposed legislation to close the Fiscal Year 2015 budget gap, that will now be sent to the Governor's desk for his signature:
"Today, after working in close collaboration with Senator Rosenberg, Speaker DeLeo, Senate and House Leaders and the General Court, we were able to put the Fiscal Year 2015 budget deficit behind us in an overwhelmingly bipartisan manner that protected funding for our local communities without additional burdens to taxpayers," said Governor Baker. "I'm thankful for the hard work of the Senate and House and am encouraged we will be able to move forward on next year's budget and the issues that matter to the people of Massachusetts."
"I'm proud of the work my former colleagues have done with our administration on correcting this year's budget deficit," said Lt. Governor Karyn Polito. "Together, we were able to solve a substantial budget gap, without impacting aid for our cities and towns, the Department of Children and Families and homelessness programs in Massachusetts."
