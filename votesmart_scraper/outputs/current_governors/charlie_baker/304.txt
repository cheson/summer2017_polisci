Baker: Border Towns Still Feeling the Pain of Tax Hikes
Press Release
By: Charlie Baker
Date: Sept. 20, 2010
Location: Methuen, MA

Visiting with business leaders here today, where the unemployment level has nearly doubled during the past four years, Charlie Baker said the policies of the past four years to spend first and tax later are disproportionately hurting businesses along the New Hampshire border.
This comes on the heels of a new report last week showing that business leaders in Massachusetts overwhelmingly view the state's tax policy as the biggest indicator of the economic climate. Those business leaders believe the current tax rate is "uncompetitive" and "unpredictable."
In Methuen, the unemployment rate has risen from 5.3 percent in 2007 to 10.2 percent today. Employers and consumers here have been hit hard by the 25 percent sales tax increase last year, and the 625 percent increase in the alcohol tax. Just three miles up the road in New Hampshire, consumers pay no sales or alcohol tax.
"Massachusetts has become a punch line for New Hampshire and if Governor Patrick or Treasurer Cahill is re-elected, the joke will only get worse," said Baker. "There are still more than 300,000 people out of work in Massachusetts and we cannot afford to leave them behind with a mediocre recovery."
If elected, Baker will push lower the sales tax to 5 percent, eliminate the alcohol tax, and lower the income tax and business tax to 5 percent. Baker is the only candidate pushing a clear slate of reform proposals that will save taxpayers nearly $1 billion.
