Press Release

Location: Boston, MA

Today, in a press conference at the State House, Governor Charlie Baker signed Massachusetts' sales tax holiday weekend for 2015 into law. Surrounded by members of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, Governor Baker spoke about relief for consumers and increased sales for retailers through the suspension of the state's 6.25% sales tax for the weekend of August 15th and 16th.
"The sales tax holiday gives consumers a much needed break while bolstering business across the Commonwealth for our hardworking retailers," said Governor Baker. "We appreciate the legislature's work on this important weekend that many people look forward to each year and encourage the Commonwealth to shop local and enjoy this opportunity to make purchases tax free."
"A tax free weekend is a great chance to support our local businesses and save a few extra dollars, and we thank the legislature for their efforts to deliver this opportunity once again," said Lt. Governor Karyn Polito. "We encourage folks to mark their calendar and help boost business in our state to support our economy."
"The Sales Tax Holiday has become an annual event that everyone looks forward to," said Jon Hurst, President of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts. "It's a proven winner, incentivizing shoppers to invest back into our local economy, while allowing Massachusetts businesses to recapture more than $168 million in sales otherwise headed to nearby states or online. And consumers get a few dollars back in their pockets, too."
