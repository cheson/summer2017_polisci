Statement
By: Charlie Baker
Date: Nov. 24, 2015
Location: Cambridge, MA

Today, Governor Charlie Baker announced the first round of several new policy initiatives developed collaboratively by the Baker-Polito Administration's Workforce Skills Cabinet, aimed at addressing a gap between employers' needs for skilled workers and residents' ability to get training and education for jobs in growing industries in the Commonwealth. Amazon, Inc. hosted the announcement at their facility in Kendall Square after working with the Cabinet to increase the company's presence in Massachusetts.
"The successful model for a coordinated response across state agencies to recruit new investments from Amazon is one we look forward to replicating across the Commonwealth," said Governor Charlie Baker. "These new initiatives developed by our Workforce Skills Cabinet streamline efforts to meet business needs, employ our residents, and be demand-driven in spreading economic prosperity throughout Massachusetts."
