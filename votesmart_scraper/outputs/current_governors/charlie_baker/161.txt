Press Release
By: Charlie Baker
Date: Dec. 7, 2015
Location: Boston, MA

Today, Governor Charlie Baker and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito introduced " An Act to Modernize Municipal Finance and Government ," aimed at improving critical components of the partnership between state and municipal governments by eliminating or updating obsolete laws, promoting local independence, streamlining state oversight and providing municipalities with greater flexibility. This bill reflects the fact that expectations have changed concerning municipal government, ushering in significant improvements in professional management, and that advances in technology have profoundly changed the manner in which municipalities operate. Today's announcement follows hundreds of meetings, conversations, and proposals between the administration and municipal officials, including over 130 municipalities the Lt. Governor has met with as part of her "Building Stronger Communities" tour.
"As two former local officials, the Lieutenant Governor and I promised to make partnership with cities and towns a focus and priority of our administration," said Governor Baker. "We were proud to establish a Community Compact Cabinet and keep our commitment to increase local aid by 75% of revenue growth in our first budget, the largest such boost in nearly a decade, and look forward to implementing greater independence and flexibility that empowers our local municipal officials to best serve their communities."
