Location: Boston, MA

Governor Charlie Baker announced today a $5 million investment in the Regional School Transportation Reimbursement Fund (RTR Fund) that supports student transportation efforts of 85 regional school systems throughout the Commonwealth. The Baker-Polito administration made the appropriation through a supplemental allotment to the RTR Fund for Fiscal Year 2015.
"Our communities depend on local aid for transportation and education and that support remains a top priority for our administration despite the budget deficit we inherited upon taking office," said Governor Charlie Baker. "We are proud to include in our budget proposal significant increases for education and are pleased to now take this step to support those districts that need it."
"The Massachusetts Association of Regional Schools (MARS) is very appreciative of the Baker Administration for providing $5 million for regional transportation during this fiscal year," said MARS Executive Director Stephen Hemman. "The large 9c regional transportation cut by the previous administration has caused fiscal concerns within regions. This will help toward providing regions with funds that they were counting on receiving this year. We clearly understand what the Baker administration faced when they came into office and we say thank you for your efforts in providing these funds."
