Press Release

The Baker-Polito administration today released the Fiscal Year 2016 (FY16) capital budget, including a $2.125 billion bond cap on General Obligation Bonds, the same level as Fiscal Year 2015, and an accompanying spending plan that invests in communities by budgeting for Chapter 90 transportation funding, extends the Accelerated Bridge Program, makes critical investments in economic development and devotes significant funds toward fixing and maintaining state assets.
The collaborative plan addresses the needs of communities and public sector agencies across state government and invests the taxpayers' money prudently across several essential areas while responsibly managing the Commonwealth's debt.
"Communities in every region can count on over $30 million in assistance through grants for vocational schools, cultural facilities, and mutually agreed upon capital projects to build better places to live and work," said Governor Baker. "This plan directs more than $200 million in grants for manufacturing job training, MassWorks Infrastructure, Life Sciences Center programs, and funds to grow the innovation hub and dredge Boston Harbor, keeping the Commonwealth ahead of the competition for tomorrow's jobs. We are also investing in our transportation infrastructure while prudently managing the people's money to tackle the Commonwealth's debt."
"This plan addresses the balance of meeting our long-term capital needs without crowding out future discretionary spending in our budgets," said Administration and Finance Secretary Kristen Lepore. "We inherited a high demand of capital requests and the added pressure of nearly $29 billion in existing debt authorizations, and we were still able to responsibly invest in several priority areas while ensuring that state government lives within its means in our capital investment strategy."
