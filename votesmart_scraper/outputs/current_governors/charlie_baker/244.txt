Baker-Polito Administration Announces FY 16 Budget To Include Tax Amnesty Program
Press Release
By: Charlie Baker
Date: Feb. 28, 2015
Location: Boston, MA

Today, Governor Charlie Baker announced that the 2016 fiscal year budget proposal will include a tax amnesty program to generate $100M. The program is for taxpayers of all tax types who have not previously filed in Massachusetts (non-registrants), plus taxpayers known to DOR who have not filed and have not yet been assessed by the Department of Revenue (DOR) for failing to file. The amnesty program would run for all of fiscal year 2016.
"Creating incentives for businesses to follow through and pay what they owe will help generate much needed revenue as our administration fixes the budget problems we inherited and brings filers into the system for future payments," said Governor Baker. "This amnesty program will help craft a fiscally responsible budget that protects taxpayers, delivers much needed services to those who need it the most while protecting local aid for our cities and towns."
The last non-filer tax amnesty program ran in 2002, and generated $176 million.
