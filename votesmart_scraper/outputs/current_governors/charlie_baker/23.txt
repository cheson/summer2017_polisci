Statement
By: Charlie Baker

Location: Boston, MA

Today, Governor Charlie Baker released the following statement on the passage of the American Health Care Act:
"Massachusetts leads the nation in health care coverage and I am disappointed by today's vote as this bill would significantly reduce critical funds for the Commonwealth's health care system. As the U.S. Senate takes up this bill, we will continue to advocate for the Commonwealth's priorities so that all residents have access to the health coverage they need. Maintaining flexibility through the Medicaid program is critical to the Commonwealth's ability to provide coverage for the needy and I urge Congress to reject this bill in its current form."
