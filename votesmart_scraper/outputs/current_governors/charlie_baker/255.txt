Proclamation of Governor Charles Baker
Statement
By: Charlie Baker
Date: Feb. 13, 2015
Location: Boston, MA

Whereas the recent, unprecedented snow fall has taken a tremendous toll on the retailers and restaurants in local cities and towns across the Commonwealth; and
Whereas access and travel to businesses has been difficult for both patrons and workers; and
Whereas Saturday, February 14 is officially Valentine's day, a day when many purchases and reservations are traditionally made; and
Whereas the people of the Commonwealth are generous and caring; and
Whereas the spirit of Valentine's Day is the expression of kindness, friendship and support and need not be limited to just one day
Now, Therefore, I, Charles D. Baker, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, do hereby proclaim the week of February 14 to February 21 to be
VALENTINE'S WEEK
And urge all the citizens of the Commonwealth to participate fittingly in its existence by extending the spirit of Valentine's Day through the entire week by visiting and supporting local retailers, restaurants, and small and family businesses.
Given at the Executive Chamber in Boston, this thirteenth day of February, in the year two thousand and fifteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the two hundred and thirty-ninth.
