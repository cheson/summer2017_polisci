As House leaders try to push through a new $400 million spending bill, Republican candidate for governor Charles Baker is seizing on the campaign season legislation to hit Gov. Deval Patrick's budget management.
"Governor Patrick has failed to manage the state's budget since the moment he got into office. Fewer than three months into the fiscal year, Governor Patrick's budget -- which was out of balance to begin with -- continues to spiral out of control," Baker said in a statement.
"The Governor clearly intends to spend more money, but rather than taking ownership of the problem, he's hiding behind the Legislature. The people of Massachusetts deserve a leader who will take this deficit head on and that's what I'll do if I'm elected governor."
The budget allocates a portion of $450 million in onetime health care funds granted to Massachusetts in August by Congress and President Barack Obama. The bill before the House was drafted by the House Ways and Means Committee after Patrick, who promised to file a supplemental budget based on the new federal funds, did not file such a bill. House Republicans criticized Patrick for not following through with his own bill.
House budget chief Charles Murphy on Monday declined to comment when asked about Patrick's non-filing. Murphy said the bill needs to pass soon to prevent two prisons from closing, to avoid State Police layoffs and to preserve services to the disabled and homeless.
