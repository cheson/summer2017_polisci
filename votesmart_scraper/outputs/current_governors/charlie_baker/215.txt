Today, Governor Charlie Baker and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito issued the following statements to commemorate Memorial Day:
"We gather with loved ones this weekend in honor of our fallen heroes who courageously, and beyond shadow of doubt, made the ultimate sacrifice to defend the freedoms and liberty we hold so dear," said Governor Baker. "Our communities, our Commonwealth and our country will always remain indebted for the devotion and bravery of our servicemembers and their families. Today, I urge everyone to find your own way to recognize Memorial Day, whether attending a ceremony, marching in a parade or spending time with family, to honor the fallen and celebrate the incredible men and women serving our great nation."
"Today, we remember our brave men and women in uniform, and their families, for their service and sacrifice to this country," said Lt. Governor Karyn Polito. "While Memorial Day offers a unique chance for our communities to join together and celebrate our incredible servicemembers, let us never forget to honor those who selflessly devoted their lives to protect our homeland."
In honor of Memorial Day, Governor Baker has ordered that the United States flag and the Commonwealth flag be lowered to half-staff at all state buildings from sunrise until noon and full staff from noon until sunset on Monday, May 25th, 2015. The order applies to the main or administration building of each public institution of the Commonwealth, other state-owned or state-controlled buildings and all state military installations.
