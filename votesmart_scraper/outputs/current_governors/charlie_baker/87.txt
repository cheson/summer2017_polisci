Location: Boston, MA

Today, Governor Charlie Baker signed bipartisan legislation creating a modern statewide regulatory framework for transportation network companies (TNCs), prioritizing public safety and recognizing Massachusetts' role as a leader in transportation innovation. The legislation, An Act regulating transportation network companies (H. 4570 includes support for transparent pricing, properly marked and inspected vehicles, clear insurance standards, authorization of service at Boston Logan International Airport and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (BCEC), and the strongest state background check requirements in the nation.
"I am pleased to sign bipartisan legislation to ensure Massachusetts remains a leader for innovative new technologies, with safe and diverse transportation options and opportunities for hardworking individuals to earn a living, said Governor Charlie Baker. "This regulatory framework includes many of our own proposals to embrace disruptive technology and prioritize public safety to give consumers safe and reliable travel choices."
Governor Baker first filed TNC legislation in April, 2015. The bill enacted today provides for the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to have regulatory authority over TNCs, establishes minimum disqualifying offenses for drivers, and requires companies to maintain active rosters of their drivers who must undergo a full state Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) background check, including sex offender registry status, and a bi-annual national commercial background check conducted by the TNC company. The legislation further closes existing insurance coverage gaps by setting adequate insurance liability and coverage requirements for TNCs and their drivers, including a guaranteed $1 million minimum coverage as soon as a TNC driver accepts a request for a ride.
