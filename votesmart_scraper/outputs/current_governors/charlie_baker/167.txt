Location: Boston, MA

Today, Governor Charlie Baker stood with administrators and front-line workers from the Department of Children and Families to announce major changes to DCF policies and practices focused on ensuring the safety of children in the Commonwealth's child welfare system. The new Intake Policy substantially updates and clarifies protocols for DCF's screening and investigation of reports of abuse or neglect. The changes also include a first ever Supervision Policy designed to support DCF front-line workers in decision-making and to identify circumstances where cases need to be elevated for collaborative higher-level review. Preparation for training on the two policies will begin immediately with full, statewide implementation commencing on February 1st.
"The new intake and supervisor policies that DCF is announcing today represent the first step in a much needed systemic reform of DCF policies and practices," said Governor Charlie Baker. "These new policies provide the framework for DCF to be responsive and accountable in its mission to protect every child we serve in every way we can."
