Today, Governor Charlie Baker issued a statement on the Senate's passage of a budget amendment establishing a fiscal management and control board to oversee the MBTA:
"Establishing a focused, dedicated group of experts to diagnose and fix the problems of the MBTA is an important first step toward creating the world class transit system the Commonwealth deserves and I am pleased the Senate acted on this measure tonight. I thank Speaker DeLeo for his leadership on this issue, and the House for also including an important provision aimed at granting the T the necessary flexibility to increase both the system's efficiency and the speed at which reforms may be enacted -- and I look forward to the Senate adopting the bipartisan measures to fix our rapid transit system. Taxpayers contribute over a billion dollars to this system every year while millions of riders depend on it to get to work and pay the bills, so we owe it to them to act now and fix the T."
