Friends,
We have two simple and important words to say -- THANK YOU!
Thank you for your tireless hard work knocking doors, making phone calls and sharing our optimistic vision with your friends and family.
Thank you for your support, your contributions and for opening your homes and businesses as we crisscrossed this state for the last year.
Thank you for your votes, for putting your faith in us, and for believing that we can take this great state in a new and better direction.
We did it, and we did it as a team!
Know that we will bring to state government the same passion and enthusiasm that we brought to this campaign -- every single day.
With your continued support, we will deliver on our plans to create great jobs, strengthen our already great schools, and make every community in Massachusetts a great place to live and raise a family.
Let's get to work!
Charlie and Karyn
