Location: Boston, MA

Governor Baker today issued a statement on H.R. 34, the 21st Century Cures Act:
"Our administration supports the 21st Century Cures Act as an effort to advance Massachusetts' leadership in biomedical innovation and expedite new ways to treat disease and addiction--including the opioid and heroin crisis that has devastated every corner of our state. This important legislation provides $1 billion for state grants for opioid prevention and treatment activities, provides nearly $5 billion in new funding and investments for diseases such as Alzheimer's and reauthorizes the National Institutes of Health. Massachusetts is a global leader in medical research and development and a strong partnership with our federal partners is important to ensuring future advances in this field. We further support these provisions to accelerate FDA regulatory modernization to speed up the approval process for new drugs and devices to safely enter the market."
