Tightening our Belts and Protecting Taxpayers
The Commonwealth faces one of its deepest financial crises in history, but it did not happen over night. Over the past three years, the Patrick Administration and politicians on Beacon Hill have failed to make tough choices. State government continues to mismanage our hard-earned taxpayer dollars.
While families and businesses are tightening their belts, politicians on Beacon Hill are on a path of reckless and wasteful spending, forcing local leaders to cut vital services, like police and firefighters. The Administration also squandered a $2.4 billion rainy day fund created under previous Republican Governors -- spending rainy day funds before it ever started raining. Our rainy day fund is gone, just when we need it the most.
But we have an opportunity to turn Massachusetts around right now. As Governor, I will build on my record of results, and get Massachusetts back on the right track.
I'm proud to have helped Governor Bill Weld and Governor Paul Cellucci restore fiscal sanity to our state during the 1990s. As a former CEO, I helped transform our state's largest non-profit healthcare provider into the highest ranked health plan in the country for member satisfaction and clinical effectiveness for five years running.
Every successful turnaround begins with accountability.
As Governor, I will:
* Cut government spending, and reduce the state payroll.
* Rollback the sales tax hike, which hurts working families and our economy.
* Streamline government, and demand more accountability at state agencies.
* Subject state programs to yearly performance measures to justify their existence.
