Governor Charlie Baker and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito today filed legislation to advance job creation and economic growth by empowering communities and regions to reach their potential, expanding workforce development efforts to close the skills gap and connect residents with economic opportunities, and investing in emerging technologies to set the stage for future job growth across the Commonwealth.
"We are committed to creating a platform for growth and prosperity across the Commonwealth, and this legislation will make key investments in the economic potential of our communities and residents," said Governor Baker. "Strong communities, a highly-trained workforce, and our commitment to welcoming emerging technologies will ensure Massachusetts' continues to have a pro-growth business environment providing economic opportunities for all."
The legislation, "An Act to Provide Opportunities for All," reflects and begins to implement several aspects of the Baker-Polito Administration's comprehensive economic development plan, including investments of up to $918 million in capital funding for local infrastructure, Brownfields site cleanup, Gateway Cities development, development site assembly and site readiness, smart growth housing, workforce development, emerging technologies, and community-based innovation.
"Community development and revitalization have been priorities of ours since day one, and this bill will provide new investments and tools to enable and leverage private development toward that goal," said Lieutenant Governor Polito. "Opportunities to expand the successful MassWorks infrastructure program, spur industrial and commercial development outside Route 128 and reform housing production incentives will help build strong, vibrant communities and drive growth across the Commonwealth."
