Making Public Benefits Available to Only Those in This Country Legally
Without action from the federal government to toughen the country's illegal immigration laws, states must be able to respond to the problems created by illegal immigration. The state of Arizona recently passed a law that strengthens the state's authority in enforcing immigration policy. Unfortunately, President Obama has filed a lawsuit to challenge the law. I believe that this lawsuit is inappropriate.
In Massachusetts, I support putting strict laws and polices into place that require state agencies to verify the legal status of applicants before providing state benefits. I do not support providing public assistance to illegal immigrants. Doing so sends the wrong message to those who play by the rules.
While Deval Patrick has been raising taxes for the past four years and cutting core services to our legal residents, Beacon Hill refuses to pass laws that will ensure state funding is not funneled to illegal residents. I would establish regulations, to the extent granted to me by law, which would not allow illegal immigrants to receive public assistance..
As governor, I would reissue the executive order that Deval Patrick rescinded to allow the state police to work with federal agencies to enforce immigration laws.
Other than raising taxes and increasing spending, the only other issue Deval Patrick has been consistent on as governor is siding with illegal immigrants. Deval Patrick wants to give illegal immigrants drivers' licenses, in-state tuition and access to state benefits no matter what the cost to the taxpayer. I don't support these policies and I would require positive affirmation of residency to ensure that state services are provided only to legal residents.
