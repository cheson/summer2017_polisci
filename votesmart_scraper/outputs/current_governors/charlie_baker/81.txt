Press Release

Location: Boston, MA

Today the Baker-Polito Administration announced awards to fund the development, renovation and preservation of affordable rental housing across the Commonwealth. This award round builds on the Administration's commitment to expanding affordable housing options for Massachusetts families.
"These affordable housing awards reflect our administration's commitment to a stronger, more prosperous, and more inclusive Commonwealth," said Governor Charlie Baker. "By increasing affordable housing production, and stabilizing working families, low-income senior citizens and homeless families or those at risk, these housing awards will strengthen communities across Massachusetts."
Governor Baker, Housing and Economic Development Secretary Jay Ash, Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders, and Undersecretary of Housing and Community Development Chrystal Kornegay made the housing funding announcement today at 48 Boylston Street in Boston, a historic rehabilitation project for formerly homeless residents sponsored by St. Francis House and the Archdiocese of Boston's Planning Office for Urban Affairs.
"Our administration is dedicated to improving economic and social outcomes for the residents of Massachusetts," said Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito. "By partnering with cities and towns, and the affordable housing development community, we are making targeted, impactful awards that will improve the lives of our state's most vulnerable residents."
The 26 projects awarded will create or preserve 1,420 rental units, including 1,334 affordable units, across 16 Massachusetts communities. The Department of Housing and Community Development is awarding over $31 million in state and federal low-income housing tax credits, which will generate over $218 million in equity for these projects. Additionally, the administration is awarding over $59 million in housing subsidy funds, including federal HOME funds and state capital funds, across the 26 projects.
Projects will serve a wide variety of constituents, including individuals and families transitioning out of homelessness, persons with disabilities, and the elderly. Four projects are focused on senior housing, five will provide supportive services to residents and all 26 will include deeply affordable units. Reflecting the Baker-Polito Administration's commitment to creating more housing units for homeless residents, the administration prioritized applications that included a 10 percent allotment for individuals and families who are, or are at risk of becoming, homeless.
"Affordable housing production serves as a catalyst for broad-based neighborhood revitalization efforts," said Secretary of Housing and Economic Development Jay Ash. "By connecting working families and at-risk populations to stable, affordable housing, we will ensure that Massachusetts remains a place where people succeed, and businesses flourish."
"St. Francis House is a perfect example of an organization committed to ending homelessness for individuals and families by providing safe and affordable housing and meeting the full needs of their tenants," said Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders. "These awards will help support vulnerable citizens in the Commonwealth."
"Working families need income security in order to achieve economic prosperity," said Undersecretary of Housing and Community Development Chrystal Kornegay. "Through these affordable housing awards, we are creating new opportunities for families to sink roots into their communities, and thrive."
The 2016 affordable rental housing award round reflects the Baker-Polito Administration's ongoing commitment to substantially invest in housing across the Commonwealth. In May, the Administration unveiled a 5-year capital budget plan that includes a $1.1 billion commitment to increasing housing production, an 18 percent funding increase for mixed-income housing production, and affordable housing preservation. In May, the Administration and MassHousing committed $100 million, to support the construction of 1,000 new workforce housing units. Since 2015, the Baker-Polito Administration has provided funding to create and preserve 2,856 units of affordable housing, including 874 deeply affordable units for at-risk populations.
