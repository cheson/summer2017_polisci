Location: Tel Aviv, Israel

During a stop on Governor Charlie Baker's Economic Development Mission to Israel, economic development leaders took part in the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative and Israel's CyberSpark, a non-profit private organization focused on the promotion of the unique cybersecurity ecosystem in and around Be'er-Sheva, Israel, which includes a combination of academic, industry, and government resources. The MOU was signed during a lunchtime meeting in Tel Aviv which was attended by CyberSpark's leadership team and executives from many of the leading cybersecurity firms in the country.
"Massachusetts and Israel each maintain highly skilled workforces, eager investors, and innovative economies that make us natural partners ready to lead on the future of cybersecurity," said Governor Charlie Baker. "I want to congratulate MassTech Collaborative and CyberSpark on today's agreement. The Commonwealth looks forward to the shared success your collaboration will bring to development, research, and training related to cybersecurity."
The memorandum was officially signed by MassTech CEO Tim Connelly and CyberSpark CEO Roni Zehavi on behalf of their organizations and will focus on several potential key areas of collaboration, including:
Applied research projects focused on healthcare technology-related cyber issues;
Roundtables to discuss emerging trends in technology, policy, and regulation;
Practical trainings for students in the cybersecurity fields in both regions; and
Visits of delegations consisting of representatives from academia, industry, and the political arena to campuses in both regions.
