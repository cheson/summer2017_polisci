Today, Governor Charlie Baker vetoed H.58, An Act further regulating the compensation of certain public officials, which would increase the pay of legislators, constitutional officers and the judiciary.
"While I value and respect the role and work of the Legislature, and particularly appreciate your willingness to collaborate on so many critical initiatives, I am returning to you unsigned H. 58, 'An Act Further Regulating the Compensation of Public Officials,' because it is fiscally irresponsible, would eliminate voter-approved term limits for constitutional officers, and was enacted after limited debate and without a reasonable opportunity for public comment," wrote Governor Baker in his veto message.
