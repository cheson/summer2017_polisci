The Truth Behind the Job Numbers
Press Release

New federal data shows MA third worst job losses in Sept.
Governor Patrick has long boasted his record of job creation as rationale for deserving a second term.
"With seven straight months of job growth and the unemployment rate dropping, Massachusetts continues to move forward. And that's no accident. By focusing on our strengths, we've created nearly 65,000 jobs since December, are top tier in the nation for job growth and are on track to emerge from this recession faster and stronger than other states. I know there is more to do, more people who need work. So, for them, we will keep fighting." (Executive office of Governor Patrick, Press Release -- September 16, 2010)
Yesterday, the state announced yesterday that Massachusetts lost nearly 21,000 jobs in the month of September -- the largest loss of jobs in one month in nearly 20 years. The state also revised its August job figures showing Massachusetts has lost jobs for two months straight.
And a further look at the job figures as they compare to the rest of the nation paints another ugly picture for Massachusetts. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics information released today:
* Massachusetts lost 3 times as many jobs during the month of September than all of the other New England states combined, and New Hampshire actually gained 5,300 jobs.
* During the month of September, only California and New York lost more jobs than Massachusetts.
"Governor Patrick's record of job losses and tax increases is crystal clear," said Charlie Baker. "And given these latest figures it's clear what he will do with another four years -- he will raise taxes and Massachusetts will lose jobs. The only way to change the direction of Massachusetts is to change governors."
