Governor Baker today issued a statement on the charter school legislation proposed by the Massachusetts State Senate:
"While I thank the Senate for their work, the proposal offers no relief to 34,000 students currently on a waiting list to access high-performing public charter schools and the new mandates for local spending in this proposal could place a further burden on taxpayers. I look forward to continuing to work with the legislature to provide high quality educational options for these tens of thousands of kids and families, most who live in low-income urban neighborhoods, but have been clear that these families need relief now, regardless of how it is achieved."
