For Charles Baker, it couldn't have been a more charmed childhood: loving parents, the homes in Needham, then in Rockport, the three boys who had jobs delivering newspapers, mowing lawns, and pumping gas. The calendar was stuffed with sports, school performances, church choir, and family vacations. There was a family mutt named Sam Dog.
Young Charlie played football in the fall, hockey in the winter, and baseball in the spring. He and his friends rode their bikes everywhere. On Coolidge Avenue, where he lived, children would "run from one end of the street to the other through everyone's backyard'' until their mothers called them in for dinner.
"We played tons of street hockey, and I shoveled a lot of snow and raked a lot of leaves,'' said Baker, the eldest son and the fourth generation of "Charles Bakers''; his son is the fifth.
When you tell him that his childhood seems too perfect, he doesn't disagree. "It was pretty all-American,'' he said.
If Baker ever got into trouble as a boy -- even a fight -- it left no footprints. He was a good, though not brilliant, student and a good, though not brilliant, athlete. He was born on Nov. 13, 1956, in Elmira, N.Y. where his father was a buyer for Westinghouse. His mother, Betty, stayed home until her youngest son went off to junior high school.
Theirs was a "mixed marriage,'' as Baker often likes to say on the campaign trail: she was the liberal Democrat, her husband the more conservative Republican, which made for lively, and mandatory, dinner table conversation.
