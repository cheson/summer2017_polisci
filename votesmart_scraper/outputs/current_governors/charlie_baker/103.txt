Letter

To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives,
I am filing for your consideration a bill entitled "An Act to Reform Sick Time."
This bill will limit sick time accruals that have led to excessive payouts upon retirement from state government by capping the accrual of sick time for state employees in the Executive Department at no more than 1,000 hours.
The bill grandfathers in approximately 5,800 state employees who have accrued more than 1,000 hours. These employees will be capped at the number of hours they have accrued as of date of enactment.
The legislation ensures that the use of sick time is consistent with its intended purpose, which is to help employees deal with health and family issues and not to provide a retirement bonus. It will also bring Massachusetts in line with other states and the private sector. Accordingly, I urge you to enact this legislation promptly.
Respectfully submitted,
Charles D. Baker
Governor
