Today, Governor Charlie Baker, Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito, and Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Ron Walker released the following statements regarding December job growth and unemployment figures announced this morning:
"Today's jobs report shows progress as the Commonwealth continues to reduce unemployment, but there is still much work to be done. Our Administration is committed to closing our state's deficit and focusing on meaningful steps to improve employment opportunities for everyone everywhere, especially veterans returning home, students entering the workforce, and those living in regions of our state still waiting for economic recovery," said Governor Baker.
"I am pleased to see positive movement in the latest jobs report and look forward to replicating the same success seen in the greater Boston area in every region of the Commonwealth," said Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito.
"Fostering a better economic environment in every corner of the Commonwealth will require a balanced approach of fiscally responsible planning, improved job training programs and increased partnerships between our universities and businesses--a formula set to get more people into sustainable and good-paying jobs," said Secretary Ron Walker.
