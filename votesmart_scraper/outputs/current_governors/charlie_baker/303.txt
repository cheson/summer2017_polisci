Baker Calls on Gov. Patrick to Sign Agreement With Fed Immigration

Charlie Baker on Thursday called on Governor Patrick to sign an agreement with federal immigration officials that would allow local law enforcement to share information with federal immigration officials about dangerous criminals who are arrested.
Governor Patrick has refused to sign an agreement with federal immigration officials for a year now that would activate a program known as Secure Communities in Massachusetts. According to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), this program is ongoing in 32 other states -- including the City of Boston -- and has helped remove more than 41,000 illegal aliens with a criminal background from the streets.
"I don't think keeping dangerous criminals on the streets by not coordinating with local law enforcement is a good value to support," said Baker. "I think Massachusetts needs to be doing everything it can to enforce immigration laws and at the very least, we should sign this agreement with the federal government. Many communities in Massachusetts need the tools necessary to clean up their streets before they can attract the businesses to get people working again."
Governor Patrick has also opposed bipartisan reforms that would ensure state benefits go only to those residents who are here legally, and upon taking office repealed an agreement between the state police and federal immigration officials to specially train troopers and allow them to arrest and detain immigration violators. Baker has said he will immediately reinstate that agreement upon taking office as well.
