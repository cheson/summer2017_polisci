Press Release

Location: Boston, MA

Governor Charlie Baker today appointed the five-member Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's (MBTA) Fiscal and Management Control Board (FMCB) and designated Joe Aiello as Chair immediately after signing into law the Fiscal Year 2016 budget. A key reform recommended by the Governor's MBTA Special Panel following unprecedented winter weather that crippled service at the MBTA, the FMCB is set to begin working immediately, holding its first meeting on Tuesday, July 21st.
"Fixing the MBTA will be a complex task, but moving forward with a Fiscal and Management Control Board dedicated solely to the T's operations and finances is an important step toward delivering accountability for taxpayers and riders," said Governor Baker. "I want to thank the legislature for putting this board in place with other measures that will allow us to begin fixing the T. I especially want to thank the five talented individuals who have agreed to serve in this crucial capacity, and who bring decades of combined experience and different but complementary perspectives as they get to work fixing the status quo at the MBTA, and begin the process of delivering a world-class public transit system that the people of Massachusetts can be proud of, and deserve."
"By signing this bill into law we now have two crucial tools to begin fixing the MBTA, a dedicated group focused solely on the T and new tools that will allow the MBTA to operate more reliable services, repair critical infrastructure and explore more efficient ways to serve our riders," said MassDOT Secretary Stephanie Pollack. "Board members will be meeting on Tuesday, along with the expanded MassDOT Board, for briefings that will help them quickly begin their work to get the MBTA back on track."
Governor Baker appointed in February a Special Panel to carry out an extensive analysis of the underlying functions of the MBTA's governance, finances and capital planning which became apparent throughout historic snowfall and persistent freezing temperatures earlier this year. Among the panel's recommendations were the call for a FMCB to assume control of the MBTA, a reconstituted Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) Board of Directors, lifting of efficiency restrictions at the MBTA, and a separation of the MBTA's capital and operating budgets among a number of recommendations.
