Governor Charlie Baker today named Christopher Willenborg to serve as Executive Director of the Military Asset and Security Strategy Task Force, created in 2012, to promote and strengthen the Commonwealth's six military installations and their impact on local communities and economies at the federal, state and local level.
"Massachusetts' military installations are highly regarded here at home and throughout the ranks of the U.S. Armed Services," said Governor Charlie Baker. "From the Natick Soldier Systems Center to advances in cybersecurity at Hanscom Air Force Base, the Commonwealth and its service members are critical to both our local economies and communities and our national defense, and will remain a priority for the Lt. Governor and I throughout our administration. I look forward to Chris Willenborg's service in this important role as one of the Commonwealth's chief advocates for our military families."
Tomorrow, Tuesday, July 28th, Governor Baker is traveling to Washington, DC to meet with top defense officials, including U.S. Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and Jack Reed (D-RI) who are members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services overseeing the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, and Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment John Conger who will play a key role in BRAC for the U.S. Department of Defense.
"The Commonwealth's six military installations serve as critical defense infrastructure, and generate substantial economic activity in the surrounding region," said Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development (EOHED) Secretary Jay Ash. "Mr. Willenborg's management experience in the airport industry will be an asset to the administration as we work to retain a robust defense and an expanding economy."
