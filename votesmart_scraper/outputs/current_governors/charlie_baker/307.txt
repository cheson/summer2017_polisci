Baker says failed policies of past four years resulted in record unemployment
Governor Patrick's campaign rhetoric was in full effect on Wednesday morning as he repeated the lines of former Democratic candidates and pushed off responsibility for record job losses during his administration.
In response, Charlie Baker released the following statement:
"At some point, Governor Patrick will realize it's his tax increases, spending increases and additional costs on businesses that are responsible for the record unemployment and 100,000 jobs lost during the past four years. It's his policies that are to blame, while we have plans to enact the reforms needed to get our state moving again in the right direction and put people back to work."
