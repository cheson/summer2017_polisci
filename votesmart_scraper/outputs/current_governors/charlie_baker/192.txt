Today, Governor Charlie Baker was named the Chairman of the National Governors Association (NGA) Health and Human Services Committee by NGA Chairman Governor Gary Herbert (R-Utah) and NGA Vice Chairman Governor Terry McAuliffe (D-Virginia).
"I'm honored and excited to take on this position, using my personal background and Massachusetts' role as a national leader in healthcare, to share ideas and policies with other states on effectively improving the delivery of care and services we provide to our most vulnerable," said Governor Baker.
The Health and Human Services Committee handles issues dealing with health care, particularly as they relate to Medicaid, and federal-state safety net programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other social services. Members of the committee ensure that the governors' views are represented in the shaping of federal policy.
In February, Governor Baker was elected the Vice Chairman of the Coalition of Northeast Governors (CONEG).
