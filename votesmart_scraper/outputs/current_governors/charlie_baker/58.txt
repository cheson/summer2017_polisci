Location: Boston, MA

Today, Governor Charlie Baker joined Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Ronald L. Walker, II and Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders to announce a new voluntary program to assist injured workers who have settled workers' compensation claims get treatment for pain management, aimed at limiting the use of opioids or other narcotics.
"Coordinating alternative viable chronic pain management options between an injured worker and their insurance company can reduce the chance of addiction to prescription opioids," said Governor Baker. "Judges have seen a rising number of overdoses and deaths as these proceedings play out in the courts and this pilot will help resolve cases more swiftly as another tool for fighting the opioid epidemic."
The program seeks to resolve court cases more swiftly by assigning a care coordinator to mediate treatment options between an injured worker and the insurance company paying for medical care.
"This program is an important tool for changing behaviors and curbing the devastating opioid epidemic impacting Massachusetts," said Lt. Governor Karyn Polito. "Instead of sending injured workers home with prescription opioids to ease the pain in the short term, we can assist them in understanding the long-term repercussions and other pain management options available to them."
