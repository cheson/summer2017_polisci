Press Release

Location: Boston, MA

Governor Charlie Baker today announced a $1.25 million funding increase for the Shannon Grant program to support regional and multi-disciplinary approaches to combat gang and youth violence. Communities and organizations from Pittsfield to Boston will see a funding boost to combat youth violence this summer.
"I am pleased that we are now able to increase our investment in these important programs as summer sets in to combat youth violence and gang activity that threatens public safety and access to opportunity in communities across the Commonwealth," said Governor Baker. "These programs have delivered meaningful results and show the positive impact we can have when state and local partners join forces to tackle a serious and recurring problem such as youth violence."
The Shannon Community Safety Initiative provides funding to communities that demonstrate high levels of youth violence and gang problems, a comprehensive plan to work with multi-disciplinary partners, and a commitment to coordinated prevention and intervention strategies.
"As summer begins, it is crucial that we continue to find ways to engage our youth and provide them with real alternatives to violence. Fully funding the Shannon program enables my department to continue working with at risk youth and provide them opportunities that might not otherwise be available," said Commissioner William Evans. "I want to thank Governor Baker for his commitment to public safety and protecting our youth."
Governor Baker authorized a $1.25 million supplemental allotment to the 15 Shannon Grant Community Safety Initiative Sites and Local Action Research Partners (LARPs). Communities customarily use this funding for social intervention and opportunity provision programs as well as gang task force personnel costs and overtime crime analysis. The governor's action means that the Shannon Community Safety Initiative will be fully funded at $8.25 million.
