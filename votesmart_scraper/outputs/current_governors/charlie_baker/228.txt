Location: Boston, MA

Ahead of tonight's Frozen Four hockey semifinal matchup between Boston University and the University of North Dakota, Governor Charlie Baker and North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple have staked a friendly bet on the game's outcome.
"Playing on home-ice where they already landed this year's Beanpot, and with the backing of some lucky cupcakes, the Terriers are poised for victory and to move on to another championship game tonight," said Governor Baker. "I'm looking forward to a great game between these two teams and in good fun, some chocolate-covered potato chips from Governor Dalrymple."
Governor Baker has wagered the same lucky Boston cream pie cupcakes from the Koffee Kup Bakery in Springfield, Massachusetts that brought a Patriot's Super Bowl trophy home earlier this year, while Governor Dalrymple has offered up a package of chocolate-covered potato chips from Carol Widman's Candy Company in Fargo, North Dakota.
"UND has had a remarkable season and I'm confident that coach Hakstol's team will advance to pursue their eighth national championship on Saturday," Dalrymple said. "Tonight's semifinal game should be an exciting matchup, and I look forward to a UND victory as well as Governor Baker's Boston cream pie cupcakes."
The two teams face off tonight at the TD Garden in Boston at 8:30PM.
