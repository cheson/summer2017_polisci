Statement
By: Charlie Baker
Date: Aug. 10, 2015
Location: Boston, MA

As you know, we are here today to celebrate round two, the second chapter, of the most successful public awareness and fundraising campaign in the history of the fight against ALS: the Ice Bucket Challenge. We are honored and thrilled that we have Pete Frates and his family here today to celebrate with us. I don't know what the record is but we have 300 people here today, some wearing suit coats, who are here today to show our solidarity and our support for Pete, his family and everybody else dealing with this dreaded disease. As soon as we finish doing this, the challenge is on to Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo. Bring it on down and let it go, guys.
