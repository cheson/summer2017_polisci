Today, Governor Charlie Baker was joined by Attorney General Maura Healey, House Speaker Robert DeLeo, Senate President Stan Rosenberg, Representative John Fernandes and a representative from the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police to sign the fentanyl trafficking bill into law. This legislation, titled "An Act Relative to the Trafficking of Fentanyl," was authored by Attorney General Healey and will increase the penalty for the possession and distribution of fentanyl to 20 years for distributing more than 10 grams.
"We must use all the tools in the toolbox to fight the opioid epidemic plaguing the Commonwealth, and I am pleased to sign this bill into law as a step in the right direction to crack down on the trafficking of one of the most lethal drugs on the street," said Governor Baker. "I appreciate the efforts by Attorney General Healey and the legislature to put this bill on my desk and look forward to aggressively pursuing additional legislation to address this public health epidemic."
