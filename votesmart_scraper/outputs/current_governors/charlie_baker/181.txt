Governor Charlie Baker today announced the appointment of Russell Gittlen to the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). The MassDOT Board was expanded to 11 members by the Legislature this year based upon a recommendation by Governor Baker's Special Panel of transportation leaders that was assembled to review structural problems with the MBTA and deliver recommendations for improvements.
"With Mr. Gittlen's appointment, all of the seats on the Board of Directors are now filled with members who bring to the table skillsets that are diverse, experienced, and well-rounded," said Governor Baker. "I want to thank Russ for joining the Board and look forward to the full Board engaging in a thoughtful, constructive dialog about how we move our transportation system forward in a way that benefits the Commonwealth's economy and our quality of life."
"I am happy to welcome Russ Gittlen to the Board and look forward to his contribution, including his experience in negotiating large contracts with major global transportation companies throughout New England," said MassDOT Secretary and CEO Stephanie Pollack. "I am looking forward to working with Russ to address the challenges we have faced in delivering efficient, transportation services throughout the Commonwealth."
