Today the Baker-Polito Administration's Workforce Skills Cabinet announced two grant programs aimed to improve economic and job training opportunities for residents across the Commonwealth. The first grant program will support the opening of a $12 million workforce skills capital grant round, to provide workforce training equipment to high schools, community colleges, and community-based nonprofits. The administration also awarded $1.45 million in Advanced Manufacturing Training Program workforce development grants, to eight regional workforce development teams from across the Commonwealth.
"We continue to make the Commonwealth's manufacturing base more competitive by building a highly-skilled workforce for employers so they can grow their businesses and support the economy," said Governor Charlie Baker. "These workforce development grant programs will equip students and workers in Massachusetts with the skills they need to connect with middle-class career pathways in key industries, including advanced manufacturing."
