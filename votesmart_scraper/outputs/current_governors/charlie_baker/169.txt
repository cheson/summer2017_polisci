Governor Baker on Veterans Day: "Thank You from a Grateful Nation"
Statement

Location: Boston, MA

"The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their nation. One of the great things I've observed as I've gotten older is people have gotten much better about separating the serviceman or the servicewoman, and their commitment, and their dedication, and yes, their sacrifice and the sacrifice of their families, from whatever people think about the conflict. You walk through an airport, you watch the way people treat and deal with members of our armed services who are in uniform, you can see it every day. Thank you for what you've done, the choice you've made, and the commitment you made to all of us. Every day somewhere in this great country of ours, someone is told thank you from a grateful nation. We should all say it a lot, every day, as often as we possibly can, because it's a debt we can never repay. Thank you very much."
