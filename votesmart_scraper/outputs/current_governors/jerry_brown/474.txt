Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Oct. 8, 2010
Location: Los Angeles, CA

Building on the groundswell of support for Attorney General and Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate Jerry Brown, the Brown Campaign tomorrow will hold more than 70 volunteer-driven events throughout California to register voters, get-out-the-vote and ensure victory on election day.
"Meg Whitman can hire every high-priced consultant in the country and blanket every television in California with false ads, but that won't match the power and impact of our grassroots support," Brown said. "From the ground up, we have built a volunteer-driven campaign that will lead us to victory in November."
The Brown Campaign's "Statewide Day of Action" will mobilize thousands of volunteers, who will contact voters in every major city and every corner of the state. The events include door-to-door canvassing, phone banks, rallies, tabling and voter registration drives.
The "Statewide Day of Action" will utilize the robust volunteer network the Brown Campaign has built in conjunction with the California Democratic Party, Organizing for America and local Democratic groups.
This comprehensive and coordinated grassroots partnership between the statewide campaigns and local Democratic organizations has empowered volunteers to build, organize and mobilize strong local groups of supporters.
This network includes more than 80 field offices and volunteer coordinators in every county in the state. Already, tens of thousands of volunteers have dedicated their time and energy to the Brown campaign.
Californians interested in getting involved in the Brown campaign have a number of ways of connecting with volunteer opportunities.
