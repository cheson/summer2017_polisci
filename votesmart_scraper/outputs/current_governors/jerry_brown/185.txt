Following his inauguration, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. swore in Justices Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar and Leondra R. Kruger to the California Supreme Court today in Sacramento.
"What I'm looking for is insight and growing wisdom over time so we can create a measure of harmony in what is a very conflicted society," said Governor Brown at today's ceremony. "And I think we are going to do very well in helping build the respect for the law, for the courts, for their independence, so that all of us - whatever our particular ideological or philosophical proclivities - at the end of the day are very thankful that we have honest, intelligent and fair-minded people making sense out of the complexities."
Governor Brown nominated Justice Cuéllar in July and Justice Kruger in November to the California Supreme Court. Justice Cuéllar was confirmed in August and Justice Kruger last month by the Commission on Judicial Appointments, composed of Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, Attorney General Kamala D. Harris and senior presiding justice of the state Court of Appeal Joan Dempsey Klein.
