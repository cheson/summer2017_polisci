Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Sept. 27, 2012
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed the Energy Security Coordination Act of 2012 (SB 1409), authored by Senator Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), which strengthens the clean energy partnership between California and the U.S. military.
"The health of the environment, job creation and indeed, the security of the nation, depend on how we end America's dangerous addiction to foreign oil," said Governor Brown. "California and the U.S. military are working together to build a clean energy future and this bill helps make sure it happens."
"I am grateful to Governor Brown for strengthening public-private partnerships with the U.S. military, the state and private sector R&D firms who are working to achieve energy security and create new jobs," said Senator Pavley.
Under SB 1409, the Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR) will serve as a liaison between the state and the U.S. Department of Defense to coordinate and collaborate on clean energy policy. OPR will work directly with state energy agencies, including the California Energy Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission, to ensure the military is included in the development and implementation of state energy and environmental policy.
"SB 1409 recognizes the existing partnership between the military and California in the development of renewable energy technology, resources and the large potential for future enhancement of this partnership," said Deputy Department of Defense Regional Environmental Coordinator Christopher L. Stathos in a letter supporting SB 1409. "With the military's aggressive renewable energy goals, and California's leadership and innovation, SB 1409 provides the Governor's Office of Planning and Research additional tools that will enable further success."
