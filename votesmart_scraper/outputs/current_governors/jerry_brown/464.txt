Governor Brown Orders Massive Cell Phone Cutback for State Employees
Press Release

In his first executive order since taking office, Governor Jerry Brown today directed state agency and department heads to collect and turn in 48,000 government-paid cell phones--half of those now in use--by June 1, 2011.
Brown said the state now pays for 96,000 cell phones, one for 40 percent of all state employees. He estimated that the state will save at least $20 million a year by cutting cell phone usage in half.
"It is difficult for me to believe that 40 percent of all state employees must be equipped with taxpayer-funded cell phones," the Governor said. "Some state employees, including department and agency executives who are required to be in touch 24 hours a day and seven days a week, may need cell phones, but the current number of phones out there is astounding."
Brown said his goal is to cut the number of phones in half by June 1, and said he believes the state can continue to reduce cell phone usage throughout the year. He explained that some cell phones may be under term contracts with cell carriers, and he wants to make sure that the state does not incur early termination penalties that exceed the monthly savings.
"Because of contract obligations, it is possible that we may not be able to eliminate all 48,000 cell phones by June 1, but it is also conceivable that we can do it earlier -- and that is my hope," Brown said.
"Even with a 50 percent reduction, one-fifth of all state employees will still have cell phones," he said. "That still seems like too much and I want every department and agency to examine and justify all cell phone usage."
