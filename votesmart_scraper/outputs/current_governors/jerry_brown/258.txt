Press Release

Date: Oct. 22, 2013
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced that he will seek a cooling-off period in the labor dispute between AC Transit and its unions tomorrow in Alameda County Superior Court.
"Another strike in the Bay Area is the last thing we need," said Governor Brown. "I urge the parties to resolve their differences, keeping the bus-riding public in mind."
On Monday, the board of investigation, appointed by the Governor last Wednesday to examine the dispute, issued its findings.
The report concluded that a strike will cause "significant disruption in public transportation services and significant harm to the public's health, safety, and welfare."
The Alameda County Superior Court will consider the Governor's request on Wednesday morning. If the court finds that a strike will significantly disrupt public transportation services and endanger the public's health, safety or welfare, an order will be issued enjoining the strike for a period of 60 days.
Wednesday's hearing will be held at 9:00 a.m. at Alameda Superior Court with Judge Evelio Grillo presiding. For more information on media coverage of the hearing, please contact the court's media liaison Adam Byer at abyer@alameda.courts.ca.gov or 510-891-6213.
