CHUCK TODD:
And welcome back. This week, there was more evidence that climate change is indeed having a big impact with the news that the level of sea ice in the Arctic has now fallen to a record low. And while the issue is still polarizing there in Washington, President Obama has tried to make fighting climate change a priority in his second term. On Thursday, he signed an executive order that directs the federal government to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 2008 levels and to make that cut over the next decade.
And California's Governor, Jerry Brown is now proposing $1.1 billion emergency funding package to deal with that state's severe drought. And it has blighted that state for four years. On Friday, I was joined by Governor Brown. And I started by asking him if drought conditions in California are now the new normal.
GOV. JERRY BROWN:
It's turning out that way. What we're really doing here is accelerating funding that I asked for in January. We're moving it faster, adding some new programs, trying to push the envelope, as it were, because any kind of building or technology, whether it be for efficiency or storage, it does take time. And we are running out of time because it is not raining.
California has to take decisive action, and it has. We have the first water action plan in the state's history, we have a $7 billion water bond that we're drawing funds from, and very importantly, for the first time, the state of California has the authority to start regulating the water that's under the ground, on private property. Very far-reaching and the implementation of that will go a long way to helping us.
