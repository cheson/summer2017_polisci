Governor Brown Signs Legislation to Boost Renewable Energy
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: April 12, 2011
Location: Milpitas, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. today signed SBX1 2, which requires one-third of the state's electricity to come from renewable sources. The legislation increases California's current 20 percent renewables portfolio standard target in 2010 to a 33 percent renewables portfolio standard by December 31, 2020.
"This bill will bring many important benefits to California, including stimulating investment in green technologies in the state, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, improving local air quality, promoting energy independence, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions," said Brown in his signing message.
"While reaching a 33 percent renewables portfolio standard will be an important milestone, it is really just a starting point - a floor, not a ceiling," Brown continued in the message. "Our state has enormous renewable resource potential. I would like to see us pursue even more far-reaching targets. With the amount of renewable resources coming on-line, and prices dropping, I think 40 percent, at reasonable cost, is well within our grasp in the near future."
