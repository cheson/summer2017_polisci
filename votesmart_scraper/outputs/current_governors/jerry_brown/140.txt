Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. met with Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi today in San Jose to discuss the global fight against climate change. During the meeting, the Governor and Prime Minister agreed to a partnership between California and Indian states, in which California would provide expertise to help India reduce air pollution and combat climate change. The Prime Minister's visit is the first trip by an Indian head of state to California in more than three decades.
"California and India have a very close and very dynamic relationship," said Governor Brown. "California has pioneered cleaning up the air and cleaning up the environment over many years. Collaboration on a regulatory and technical level could be helpful. There's a lot to do."
The meeting with Prime Minister Modi is the latest in a series between Governor Brown and world leaders. In Seattle on Tuesday, Governor Brown met with President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China after co-chairing the Third U.S.-China Governors Forum and on Friday, Governor Brown continued discussions on climate change in New York City with heads of state from South America and Europe, including Chile's President Michelle Bachelet, Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Hungary's President János Áder.
