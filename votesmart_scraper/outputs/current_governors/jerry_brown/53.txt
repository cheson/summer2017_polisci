Governor Brown Issues Statement on California Air Resources Board's Draft Plan to Achieve 2030 Climate Goals
Statement
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Dec. 2, 2016
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today issued the following statement on the California Air Resources Board's initial draft plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 - the most ambitious target in North America. The initial draft plan, released today, builds on the state's successful efforts to reach its more immediate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and outlines the most effective ways to reach the new 2030 goal, including continuing California's Cap-and-Trade program.
"This plan lays out a road map for California - and the rest of the world - to achieve climate goals that were inconceivable only a decade ago," said Governor Brown, who established this 2030 target by Executive Order in April 2015 and signed SB 32 in September to codify it. "There are steep hills ahead, but we'll scale them by continuing to take a series of bold actions, including extending California's Cap-and-Trade Program."
