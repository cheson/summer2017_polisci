Press Release

Location: San Diego, CA

Taking action to help California veterans find decent housing, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. joined local veterans, lawmakers and community leaders in San Diego today to sign legislation to expand housing opportunities for veterans.
"After veterans serve our country, it's our duty to serve them," said Governor Brown. "This new reformed housing program will make life better for veterans for years to come."
The legislation (AB 639), authored by Assembly Speaker John A. Pérez (D-Los Angeles), will ask voters to repurpose $600 million of existing veterans' housing bond funds to use for multifamily, transitional and supportive housing. The bond will go before the voters on the June 2014 primary ballot. The Governor signed the bill at Veterans Village of San Diego.
"I am proud of the actions that the Governor and the Legislature have taken this year to tackle veterans' homelessness in our state," said Speaker Pérez. "Veterans have devoted their lives to the protection of our country and it is absolutely unacceptable when they cannot afford a place for them and their families to sleep. As citizens, it is our basic obligation to stand up for these men and women who have served our nation, and I look forward to seeing California voters approve this measure."
