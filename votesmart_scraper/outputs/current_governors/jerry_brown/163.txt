Seeking to further collaboration amongst states and provinces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ahead of this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. will join other international leaders, including former U.S. vice president and Nobel laureate Al Gore and former president of Mexico Felipe Calder√≥n, to deliver keynote remarks at the Climate Summit of the Americas next month in Toronto, Canada.
"California and Ontario are working hand-in-hand to pave the road to Paris by convening states and provinces committed to doing their part," said Governor Brown. "This is a call to arms in the fight against climate change and the Climate Summit of the Americas is another step forward."
