Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today issued the following statement on President Obama's climate change plan:
"The President's action plan to reduce greenhouse gases is absolutely essential," said Governor Brown. "California stands ready to do its part to ensure that America successfully asserts its leadership on climate change."
Last month, Governor Brown joined hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists to release a groundbreaking call to action on climate change. The consensus statement, produced at the Governor's urging and signed by hundreds of concerned scientists, translates key scientific findings from disparate fields into one unified message for policymakers, industry and the general public. This statement aims to improve the nexus between scientific research and political action on climate change.
Governor Brown has shared the consensus statement with Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the mayors of California's largest cities and other civic leaders and policymakers.
