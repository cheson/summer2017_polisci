Governor Brown Issues Proclamation Declaring LGBT Pride Month
Statement

Our nation was founded on the principle of equal rights for all people, but the fulfillment of this promise has been long in coming for many Americans. Some of the most inspiring moments in our history have arisen from the various civil rights movements that have brought one group after another from the margins to the mainstream of American society.
In the movement toward equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, a historic turning point occurred on June 28, 1969, in New York City, with the onset of the Stonewall Riots. During these riots, LGBT citizens rose up and resisted police harassment that arose out of discriminatory criminal laws that have since been declared unconstitutional. In the four decades since, civil rights for LGBT people have grown substantially and LGBT pride celebrations have taken place around the country every June to commemorate the beginning of the Stonewall Riots.
California has been a leader in advancing the civil rights of its LGBT citizens. This year, we have seen powerful statements in support of the right of every person to marry the person they love: two opinions from federal appellate courts and, for the first time, a statement from a sitting president in support of this right. While further progress is needed, it is proper and important to recognize and celebrate the substantial and important gains that have been achieved.
NOW THEREFORE I, EDMUND G. BROWN JR., Governor of the State of California, do hereby proclaim June 2012, as "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month."
IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Great Seal of the State of California to be affixed this 31st day of May 2012.
