Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Dec. 13, 2016
Location: Sacramento, CA

Taking action to combat climate change and help protect California's oceans, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today called on President Barack Obama to use his authority to permanently prohibit new offshore oil and gas leasing in federal waters off the coast of California, signed an agreement with U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell to help expand offshore renewable energy development and joined global leaders to launch the International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification.
"Climate change degrades our oceans and coastline," said Governor Brown at a meeting of the International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification in Coronado. "Today, California is taking additional steps to reduce ocean acidity, boost renewable energy and prevent further coastal oil and gas drilling."
Stopping Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling
In a letter sent today to President Obama, Governor Brown called on the administration to use its authority under Section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to permanently withdraw federal waters off the coast of California from new offshore oil and gas leasing and guarantee that future oil and gas drilling in these waters is prohibited.
"Clearly, large new oil and gas reserves would be inconsistent with our overriding imperative to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and combat the devastating impacts of climate change," Governor Brown wrote. "Now is the time to make permanent the protection of our ocean waters and beaches from new oil and gas drilling."
