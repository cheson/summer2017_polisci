Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today issued the following statement in response to President Barack Obama's announcement of new stringent emissions and fuel economy standards:
"President Obama's bold action today marks a major advance towards a more sustainable environment and less oil-dependent economy," said Gov. Brown. "As Attorney General, I sued the Bush Administration and major automobile companies so that California could adopt the bold emissions standards on which these new federal standards are based. California led the way, and all Californians can be proud that President Obama adopted our state's forward-thinking policy as a model for the nation."
