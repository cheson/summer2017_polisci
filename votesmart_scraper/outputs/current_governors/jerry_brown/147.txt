Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. joined Attorney General Kamala D. Harris today to present the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor to Sonora Police Department Officer Ryan D. Webb and San Bernardino Police Department Officer Marcus Pesquera, who went above and beyond the call of duty.
"The whole basis of any society is individuals who can act beyond their own particular interest and comfort and needs," said Governor Brown at today's ceremony. "This ceremony is a very important way of communicating to the people of California that courage is still a fundamental pillar of our society."
The Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act of 2003 gives the Governor the authority to award a Medal of Valor to public safety officers who are cited by the Attorney General for extraordinary valor above and beyond the call of duty. The Attorney General's Office receives nominations from public safety agencies. These nominations are reviewed by the Medal of Valor Review Board, which makes a recommendation to the Attorney General.
"The two individuals we honor today have shown remarkable courage, skill, and selflessness in protecting their community and our society," said Attorney General Harris. "These two individuals, like all men and women who wear the badge, do this work without any expectation of award or reward. They do it because they have taken a solemn duty to protect people they may never meet and people who may never know their names."
