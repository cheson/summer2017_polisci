Governor Brown Issues Statement on Supreme Court Result
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: June 23, 2016
Location: Sacramento, CA

Following the U.S. Supreme Court's 4-4 split in United States v. Texas, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today issued the following statement in continued support of President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration:
"Today's Supreme Court deadlock leaves millions of families in America facing a troubled and uncertain future. It's time for Congress to do its job."
Last year, California filed a friend-of-the-court brief with more than a dozen other states, noting that these executive actions "will benefit millions of people and their families, as well as the states in which they reside."
Since taking office, Governor Brown has signed the California Dream Act, which allows top students who are on the path to citizenship to apply for college financial aid; AB 60, which extends the legal right to drive on the state's roadways to millions more Californians; and a number of other bills to enhance school, workplace and civil protections for California's hardworking immigrants. The Governor has also signed legislation to provide legal services to the unaccompanied minors arriving in California from Central America and extend health care coverage and other protections to undocumented children and their families across the state. Earlier this year, Governor Brown appointed a director of immigrant integration to serve as the statewide lead for coordinating immigrant services and monitoring the implementation of immigration assistance programs.
