Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today proposed a $176.6 million spending plan to fund expedited and expanded testing and cleanup of residential properties, schools, daycare centers and parks around the former Exide Technologies facility in Vernon, California.
"This Exide battery recycling facility has been a problem for a very long time," said Governor Brown. "With this funding plan, we're opening a new chapter that will help protect the community and hold Exide responsible."
The Administration's plan was detailed today in a Department of Finance letter sent to the California State Senate and Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee chairs. The $176.6 plan will ensure all residential properties, schools, daycare centers and parks within the 1.7 mile radius of the Exide Technologies facility are tested and contaminated soil removed where lead levels are the highest and potential exposure the greatest. This plan expedites and expands efforts already underway and includes an exemption to the California Environmental Quality Act.
