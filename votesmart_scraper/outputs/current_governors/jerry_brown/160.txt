Press Release

Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced a budget agreement with Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins and Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Le√≥n, consistent with prudent May Revision revenue estimates, that saves billions of dollars and pays down debt, while directing more resources to schools and low-income Californians.
Governor Brown also announced that he is calling two special sessions to fix how California funds roads, highways and other infrastructure and the state's core health program -- Medi-Cal.
"This is a sound, well thought-out budget," said Governor Brown. "Yet, the work never ends and in the coming months we'll have to manage our resources with the utmost prudence and find more adequate funding for our roads and health care programs."
