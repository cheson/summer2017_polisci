Location: San Francisco, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today joined with Ambassador of Peru to the United States Harold Forsyth and Portugal's President Cavaco Silva for meetings in San Francisco. In his meeting with Ambassador Forsyth, Governor Brown signed an agreement with Peru to strengthen cultural, economic and academic ties and tackle shared challenges, including climate change.
"The ambassador from Peru and the President of Portugal are here. They want California investments. They want to trade with us, exchange science, culture and they also want to work on climate change," said Governor Brown.
The memorandum of understanding signed today builds on months of collaboration between Peru and California, including a meeting last August where the Governor shared the consensus statement on climate change with Ambassador Forsyth. This document translates key scientific findings from disparate fields into one unified message for policymakers, industry and the general public.
Through today's agreement, Peru and California have committed to exchanging "experts and joint projects in climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, air quality, forest management, water quality and water management" and promoting the public and private use of clean technologies. Additionally, the two parties agreed to cooperate on food safety, fishery management and agricultural sustainability and collaborate on educational and cultural exchanges and promote trade and tourism.
