Governor Brown Signs Compact with the Pala Band of Mission Indians
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: May 9, 2016
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced that he has signed a tribal-state gaming compact between the State of California and the Pala Band of Mission Indians.
The terms of the new compact are consistent with provisions of more recent compacts related to licensing, compliance enforcement and mitigation of off-reservation gaming impacts and reflects, among other things, the evolving nature of financial markets, as well as the professionalism of the Tribe's regulators and their constructive relationship with state gaming regulators.
The compact provides incentives for revenue sharing with and mutual support of local jurisdictions for fire, emergency medical services, law enforcement, public transit, infrastructure improvements, education and other services that in part serve the needs of the community. It also includes terms to stimulate investments in renewable energy, recycling or water conservation projects, non-gaming-related economic development and health care facilities that provide a mutual benefit to the Tribe and the local community. The terms reflect a continued commitment by the Tribe to revenue sharing with non-gaming and limited gaming tribes so that the economic benefits of gaming reach tribal governments that have not chosen to operate a tribal casino.
The compact supersedes the 2004 compact between the Tribe and the State of California.
