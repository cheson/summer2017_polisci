Location: Mexico City, Mexico

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed an agreement with the Mexican Ministries of Public Education and Foreign Affairs and the National Council for Science and Technology to forge greater ties between institutions of higher education in California and Mexico, with particular emphasis on online learning.
"The ties between California and Mexico began before the Declaration of Independence and today we take one more step by bringing our institutions of higher learning closer together," said Governor Brown.
The scope of the agreement includes cross-border online learning, student and teacher exchanges, joint research and scholarly endeavors.
"As a symbol of our commitment to deepen our educational links, California is the first state with which the government of Mexico signs a Memorandum of Understanding to promote the cooperation in the fields of education, research and scholarly activities since the official launching of FOBESII two months ago," said Secretary of Foreign Affairs José Antonio Meade Kuribreña.
Specifically, the agreement will enhance cooperation through a range of activities, including:
- An exchange of students and teachers;
- Implementation of joint research and scholarly activities;
- Organization of conferences and seminars;
- Exchange of academic materials and other information;
- Short-term stays for students and teachers;
- Teacher training courses for English language teachers;
- Fellowship programs for students (undergraduates and graduates), teachers, academics and researchers; and
- Online programs.
In order to further these objectives, a new California-Mexico Higher Education Working Group held its first meeting yesterday at the Casa de California in Mexico City. Members of this group include representatives of the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, the University of California Office of the President, the California State University Chancellor's Office and the Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities.
The Governor first announced the Trade and Investment Mission to Mexico in his 2014 State of the State address and met with Mexican Consuls General from cities across California in March. Last week, ahead of the trip, Governor Brown met with Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Affairs José Antonio Meade Kuribreña in Sacramento and invited Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to meet later this year in California.
The Governor is joined on the Trade and Investment Mission to Mexico by a delegation of state legislators and senior administration officials. A delegation organized by the California Chamber of Commerce with the help of the California Foundation for Commerce and Education that includes approximately 90 business, economic development, investment and policy leaders from throughout California is also participating in the trade mission.
