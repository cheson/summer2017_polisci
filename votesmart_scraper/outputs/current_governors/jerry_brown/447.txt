Agriculture Leaders Support Governor Brown's Balanced Budget Plan
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: March 11, 2011
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Jerry Brown today announced that a coalition of more than two dozen California agriculture organizations support his budget plan and letting voters decide whether or not to temporarily extend existing taxes.
"Farmers and growers understand the importance of putting California's economy on track," said Governor Brown. "I'm glad to have their support and look forward to working with them to deliver a budget that balances cuts with tax extensions."
"Many of our Asian, Hispanic, and African American members came to California for a better life. They, their families and the people they employ work hard in the fields every day trying to capture the dream that once was California. We need to give these people hope that California has a plan that will restore its greatness," said Manuel Cunha, president of the Nisei Farmers League.
"We in agriculture recognize that now is the time to correct runaway government waste and inefficiency. It's also the time for our public officials and the public to recognize that it took us a long time to get in this hole and it's going to take a while to get out of it. A budget that recognizes both of these realities is what we are looking for," said Joel Nelsen, president of California Citrus Mutual.
"This budget situation is such a wreck, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. It was not created in one year and will take several years to correct but we have to get started. That means all of us cooperating and compromising on fundamental infrastructure reforms," said Frank Rehermann on behalf of the California Rice Industry Association.
