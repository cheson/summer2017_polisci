Governor Brown Signs Same-Day Voter Registration Law
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Sept. 24, 2012
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed a bill that makes it easier for Californians to vote by allowing same-day voter registration.
"Voting--the sacred right of every citizen--should be simple and convenient," said Governor Brown. "While other states try to restrict voters with new laws that burden the process, California allows voters to register online--and even on Election Day."
Assembly Bill 1436 (Feuer) allows same-day voter registration, giving Californians the right to vote with a provisional ballot if the conditional voter registration is deemed effective. Same-day registration will be permitted once the Secretary of State certifies California's new statewide voter database, VoteCal. Last year, Governor Brown signed Senate Bill 397 (Yee) allowing Californians to register to vote online.
In addition, Governor Brown signed the following political reform and election-related bills:
* AB 216 by Assemblymember Sandr√© Swanson (D-Oakland) -- Voters: residency confirmation.
* AB 481 by Assemblymember Richard Gordon (D-Redwood City) -- Political Reform Act of 1974: campaign disclosure.
