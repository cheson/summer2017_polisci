Moving to maintain the state's precariously balanced budget, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced that he has vetoed a package of bills that would have created new tax credits or expanded existing tax credits.
"Despite strong revenue performance over the past few years, the state's budget has remained precariously balanced due to unexpected costs and the provision of new services," Governor Brown said in his veto message. "Given these financial uncertainties, I cannot support providing additional tax credits that will make balancing the state's budget even more difficult."
