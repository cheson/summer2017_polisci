Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. today issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Plata:
"The Supreme Court has upheld a lower court's decision that California must reduce its prison population. In its ruling, the Supreme Court recognized that the enactment of AB 109 is key to meeting this obligation. We must now secure full and constitutionally guaranteed funding to put into effect all the realignment provisions contained in AB 109. As we work to carry out the Court's ruling, I will take all steps necessary to protect public safety."
