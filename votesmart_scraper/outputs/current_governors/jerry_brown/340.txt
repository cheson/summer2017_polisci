Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today issued the following statement regarding the California Legislature's vote on workers' compensation reform:
"I commend the Legislature for an extraordinary workers' compensation reform bill that helps injured workers and averts an imminent crisis of skyrocketing rates. Again, Republicans have joined Democrats to work together -- perhaps, a portent of good things to come."
