California faces unique challenges in education. Despite passage of Proposition 98 in 1988, per pupil spending lags behind most other states. In 1972, California was in the top 20 for per pupil spending; by 2009, we had dropped to the bottom 10.
This is particularly challenging since one out of four K-12 students in California is not yet proficient in English, 17 percent live in poverty, and half qualify for free or reduced price meals. Despite these challenges California students have made significant gains on state tests. For example, in algebra just 106,000 students were proficient in 2003, but this doubled by 2009 to 212,000. Yet, we have a long way to go.
Higher education is also suffering in California, especially in the last decade. From a system that was essentially tuition free, fees have skyrocketed at both the University of California and California State University systems. When I was Governor, the price students paid for a higher education was a fraction of what it is today. At that time, the state devoted 3 to 4 times more to higher education than to prisons; today that ratio is even. That's not right.
I have been studying education and working on related issues ever since I was elected to the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees in 1969. I approach this task with some humility, and a realization that there is no silver bullet that will fix everything. Education improvement takes time, persistence, and a systematic approach. California's education problems are not limited to just the lowest performing schools and teachers.
The proposals below will start this journey to a better future for our students.
