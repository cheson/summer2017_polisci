Statement

Location: Paris, France

Joining the world's top climate leaders on his fourth day at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today spoke at events highlighting California's bold action to accelerate zero emission vehicles, reduce short-lived climate pollutants and build partnerships with other states, cities and regions to cut dangerous carbon pollution.
"We are really a crucial element in making the fundamental change from a carbon intensive economy to one that is on the side of nature, and therefore sustainable," said Governor Brown. "Individual jurisdictions - cities, states, provinces and regions - can be a coalition of the willing."
Governor Brown started his day by opening a UNFCCC event organized to highlight city and regional climate leadership with former Vice President Al Gore, France's Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy Ségolène Royal and Libreville, Gabon Mayor Rose Christiane Ossouka Raponda.
Governor Brown then joined U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz to announce that in June 2016, San Francisco, California will host the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM7), an annual meeting of energy ministers and other high-level delegates from the 23 countries and the European Commission.
"I can think of no better place than California to play host to the world's clean energy leaders," said Governor Brown.
