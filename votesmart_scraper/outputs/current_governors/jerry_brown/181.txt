As U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez helps mediate discussions between dockworkers and port operators, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Oregon Governor Kate Brown today called for a quick resolution to the harmful labor impasse impacting West Coast ports and businesses, issuing the following statements:
"This impasse is disrupting international trade and jeopardizing thousands of jobs," said California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. "After nine months of bargaining, to be hung up on what appears to be arcane process issues is unacceptable. Get it done, guys."
"I told Secretary Perez how much I appreciated the attention that he and President Obama are giving this dispute, and that I hoped his direct engagement with the parties would help bring a swift resolution," Washington Governor Jay Inslee said. "This impasse has dragged on way too long and is playing havoc with international trade, an essential component of Washington's economy. I understand there are important issues at stake, but it is time to settle before any more damage is done."
"Our local farmers, small businesses and communities in Oregon are in limbo because of the uncertainty surrounding the West Coast and Oregon ports," said Oregon Governor Kate Brown. "We urge all parties to rise above their differences and find a common solution to avoid the disruptions that are beginning to suppress our efforts to ensure a strong, growing economy across the state."
Yesterday, California Governor Brown discussed the impasse with Secretary Perez by phone and earlier this month, sent a letter to the President of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Chairman and CEO of the Pacific Maritime Association urging them to quickly resolve this dispute.
