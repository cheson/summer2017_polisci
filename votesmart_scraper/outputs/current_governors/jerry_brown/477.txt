Brown Commits to Fresno Bee/Univision Debate, Calls on Whitman to Accept a Los Angeles Forum
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Sept. 8, 2010
Location: Oakland, CA

California Attorney General Jerry Brown sent letters today confirming his participation in the Fresno Bee/Univision gubernatorial debate on October 2, 2010, and reiterated his call for a debate in the Los Angeles area.
"I have always believed the voters should hear from the candidates directly, which is why I asked for 10 debates at the start of the campaign," Brown said. "I'm looking forward to debating in Fresno, Sacramento and San Rafael, and I call on my opponent to stop ignoring Los Angeles, and give voters in that important region a chance to see and participate in a debate as well."
Brown's original debate schedule included 10 forums spread around the state, covering a variety of formats and host organizations. More than a month after Brown accepted 10 debate invitations, Meg Whitman declined all but two.
The forum at Fresno State will co-produced by Univision Television Group, moderated by a Univision network news anchor and broadcast state-wide in Spanish.
"The management at Univision have put together what should be an outstanding event," Brown said. "They have worked very hard to create an historic and valuable opportunity to address important issues facing the Latino community."
Whitman and Brown are scheduled to debate at UC Davis on September 28, and at Dominican University October 12. Southern California debates have been proposed by, KCBS, and KABC.
