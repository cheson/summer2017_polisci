Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today marked "National Plug In Day" by signing a half dozen bills to support California's burgeoning electric vehicle market.
"Today, we reaffirm our commitment in California to an electric vehicle future," said Governor Brown.
The Governor signed the following bills today:
* AB 8 by Assemblymember Henry T. Perea (D-Fresno): Extends to 2024 programs aimed at reducing auto emissions in California, including the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program, the Air Quality Improvement Program, the Enhanced Fleet Modernization Program and the Carl Moyer Memorial Air Quality Standards Attainment Program.
* AB 266 by Assemblymember Robert Blumenfield (D-Woodland Hills): Extends the white sticker program allowing for certain low-emission vehicles to drive in high-occupancy or "diamond" lanes until 2019 or until federal authorization expires.
* AB 1092 by Assemblymember Marc B. Levine (D-San Rafael): Requires the California Building Standards Commission and the Department of Housing and Community Development to develop standards for electric vehicle charging infrastructure in multi-family housing and non-residential developments.
* SB 286 by Senator Leland Yee (D-San Francisco): Extends the green sticker program allowing for certain low-emission vehicles to drive in high-occupancy or "diamond" lanes until 2019 or until federal authorization expires.
* SB 359 by Senator Ellen Corbett (D-Hayward): Provides $30 million to fund the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project and the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project; $10 million to fund the Heavy-Duty Vehicle Air Quality Loan Program; and appropriates $8 million for the enhanced fleet modernization program.
* SB 454 by Senator Ellen Corbett (D-Hayward): Creates the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Open Access Act, which removes obstacles to using electric vehicles by making electric vehicle charging stations accessible to all electric vehicle drivers, easier to locate and more convenient to use.
This legislation builds on the state's efforts to help California's electric vehicle market grow, including an Executive Order issued by Governor Brown that established a target of 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles on the road in California by 2025 and a number of other long-term goals.
Earlier this month, Governor Brown joined dozens of California business, automotive, consumer, technology and utility leaders to discuss and highlight public and private sector efforts to expand the state's electric vehicle market at the "Drive the Dream" event sponsored by the California Plug-in Electric Vehicle Collaborative.
National Plug In Day is a nationwide celebration of all-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles and includes more than a dozen events across California during the weekend of September 28th to 29t
