Press Release

Date: April 15, 2013
Location: Guangzhou, China

On day six of California's trade and investment mission to China, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. committed to building stronger ties with China's most populous and economically productive province, Guangdong.
In Guangdong's capital city on Monday, Governor Brown spoke at a forum hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce -- South China, met with Guangdong's Governor and Party Secretary and announced two agreements between California and Guangdong to further strengthen cooperation on trade, investment and climate change.
"I want to create more partnerships among business, in agriculture and technology, in hotels and tourism. Any way that the people of Guangdong can collaborate with Californians, I'm going to encourage that," said Governor Brown. "I want to see Guangdong and California work on our joint problems, and our joint problems are cleaner energy and greater social harmony among our people."
Today's meetings and agreements build on the partnership established when Governor Brown met with Hu Chunhua, who was then Party Secretary of Inner Mongolia and is now Guangdong Party Secretary. The meeting came in February 2012 during the then-Vice President of China's visit to Los Angeles.
Guangdong is China's most populous province -- with more than 100 million people -- and the largest by GDP -- at nearly $1 trillion. It is also the home province of many of California's Chinese immigrants.
The agreement, signed by Governor Brown and Guangdong Governor Zhu Xiaodan, is the first between California and Guangdong province, and formalizes cooperation on trade and investment, science and technology, environmental conservation, education, tourism and culture.
California Environmental Protection (CalEPA) Secretary Matthew Rodriquez also joined his counterpart, Guangdong Development and Reform Commission Director-General Li Chunhong, on Monday to sign an agreement to advance collaboration on climate change, namely low carbon development between the two regions.
Guangdong is one of six provinces and municipalities that will participate in the China-California Joint Working Group established last week with the Ministry of Commerce to bolster trade and investment ties between California and China.
On Sunday, the Governor visited California's Chinese sister-state, Jiangsu, and signed an agreement to partner on climate change, technology, education and tourism with the province's top government official.
Last week, Governor Brown traveled to Shanghai, Governor Brown opened the California-China Office of Trade and Investment, spoke at Visit California's news conference and met with Shanghai's top government official, Party Secretary Han Zheng.
This followed a number of events in Beijing earlier this week, including remarks at Tsinghua University, meetings with China's Premier, Minister of Commerce, Minister of Environmental Protection, Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, a forum with the American Chamber of Commerce -- Beijing and a reception at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing with the U.S. Ambassador to China.
Tomorrow, the last day of the Governor's trade and investment mission, the Governor will travel to Shenzhen for a meeting with senior government officials and a tour of BYD's Worldwide Headquarters.
The Governor's trade and investment mission follows more than a year of significant diplomatic and business exchanges between the State of California and China. In February 2012, Governor Brown welcomed His Excellency Xi Jinping, then-Vice President, and now President of China, to California. During the visit, Governor Brown announced his intention to visit China, open a trade and investment office and form a China-California Joint Task Force to drive more collaboration, investment and trade between California and China. Later in 2012, the Brown administration convened the inaugural Joint Economic Committee between California and China's Jiangsu Province, hosted a Chinese delegation led by the Vice Minister of China's Ministry of Commerce and met with a Chinese delegation led by Deputy Governor Xia Geng of China's Shandong Province.
Joining the Governor on the trade and investment mission is a delegation organized by the Bay Area Council that includes approximately 90 business, economic development, investment and policy leaders from throughout California. Senior administration officials are also accompanying the delegation.
