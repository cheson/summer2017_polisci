Governor Jerry Brown has endorsed Rep. Scott Peters for re-election, calling Peters "someone you can trust and California needs."
"Scott Peters is that rare person who can rise above the partisan bickering in Washington and get things done. He's been a champion for biotechnology, healthcare and the cutting edge industries that drive San Diego's economy," Gov. Brown said. "Scott is someone you can trust and California needs."
Gov. Brown's endorsement is the latest for Peters, who is backed by groups ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
"I want to thank Gov. Brown for recognizing that I'm actually getting things done in Congress," Peters said. "The last thing we need is more partisan gridlock and flame-throwing, which is exactly what would happen if Carl DeMaio is elected."
