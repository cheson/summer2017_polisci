Location: Los Angeles, CA

Moving boldly to combat climate change and curb toxic carbon pollution, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed landmark legislation - SB 350 by Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Le√≥n (D-Los Angeles) - that establishes world-leading energy efficiency and renewable energy goals for California.
"California has taken groundbreaking steps to increase the efficiency of our cars, buildings and appliances and provide ever more renewable energy," said Governor Brown. "With SB 350, we deepen our commitment."
Governor Brown signed the legislation from the East Terrace of the Griffith Observatory overlooking the City of Los Angeles and was joined by dozens of government, climate, business, environmental justice and community leaders.
SB 350 codifies goals Governor Brown laid out in his January 2015 inaugural address to double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings and generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030.
