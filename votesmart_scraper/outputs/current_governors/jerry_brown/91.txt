As millions of people around the globe celebrate Earth Day and renew their commitment to protecting the planet, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. will join dozens of world leaders on Friday at the United Nations Headquarters in New York to participate in events marking the first day that the Paris Agreement is open for signature.
"While national governments came together to reach a historic climate agreement in Paris last December, it's up to the world's states, regions and cities to make it a reality in the years ahead," said Governor Brown. "The task before us is daunting, but California will continue to lead the charge."
At the United Nations Headquarters, Governor Brown will attend a luncheon with France's President François Hollande, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and other government, climate, business and civil society leaders. He will then participate in a panel discussion moderated by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres and COP21 President Ségolène Royal on the work being done to ensure the Paris Agreement is fully and effectively implemented.
