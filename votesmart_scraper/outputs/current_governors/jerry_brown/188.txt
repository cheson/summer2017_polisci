Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued the following statement tonight after President Barack Obama announced a series of executive actions on immigration:
"Tonight, in the face of Washington gridlock, the president stepped up for hard-working families across America. This is the right thing to do, and it's time for Congress to finish the job."
Since taking office Governor Brown has signed the Dream Act, which allows top students who are on the path to citizenship to apply for college financial aid; AB 60, which extends the legal right to drive on the state's roadways to millions more Californians; and a number of other bills to enhance school, workplace and civil protections for California's hardworking immigrants. Earlier this year, Governor Brown also signed legislation to provide legal services to the unaccompanied minors arriving in California from Central America.
