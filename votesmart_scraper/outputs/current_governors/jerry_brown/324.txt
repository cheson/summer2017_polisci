Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed a bill to boost the commercial space-travel sector in California. Assembly Bill 2243 (Knight) limits liability for space-flight companies.
"California aerospace pioneers like Virgin Galactic, SpaceX and the Spaceship Company are blazing a path to the stars with commercial space travel," said Governor Brown. "This bill allows commercial space-travel companies to innovate and explore without the worry of excessive liability."
"California has long been known as a place that breaks down barriers and fosters innovation -- from social movements like environmentalism to the start-up culture of Silicon Valley," said Virgin Group Founder Sir Richard Branson. "The teams at Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company are forging entirely new paths in travel, science and exploration, and this legislation will ensure that California continues to be a place that looks forward -- and not back."
