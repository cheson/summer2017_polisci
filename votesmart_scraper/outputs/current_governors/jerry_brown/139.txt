Location: Richmond, CA

Taking action to improve gender wage equality and boost worker protections, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today joined dozens of state and local leaders, women and girls at the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park to sign SB 358 by Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), the bipartisan California Fair Pay Act.
"Sixty-six years after passage of the California Equal Pay Act, many women still earn less money than men doing the same or similar work," said Governor Brown. "This bill is another step toward closing the persistent wage gap between men and women."
The equal pay legislation, among the strongest in the nation, received broad support from both Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature.
