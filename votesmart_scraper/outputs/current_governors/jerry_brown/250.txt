Governor Brown Signs Compact with Karuk Tribe
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Dec. 5, 2013
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed a tribal-state gaming compact between the State of California and the Karuk Tribe.
The Karuk Tribe is the second largest tribe in California with approximately 3,700 members and is located in one of the most economically depressed regions of the State. The revenue generated by the gaming facility will provide the Karuk government with additional means to promote the healthcare, educational, natural resource and other needs of the membership of the Tribe. Although, as required by federal law, the Tribe will be the primary beneficiary of its gaming operation, the construction of the gaming facility itself will result in a substantial investment of economic resources in the surrounding community. The compact includes provisions to protect employees and patrons as well as measures that the Tribe must take to protect the environment during the construction and operation of gaming facilities.
The compact allows the operation of a maximum of 1,500 slot machines. The Tribe will pay to the State its pro rata share of the costs the State incurs for the performance of its duties under the compact as well as 10 percent of the casino's net win, if it operates more than 350 devices, to be shared with non-gaming tribes within California.
