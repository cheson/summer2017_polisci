Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed SB 130 (Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review) which expands the existing Vehicle License Fee Adjustment to the cities of Eastvale, Jurupa Valley, Menifee and Wildomar, allowing them to receive millions of dollars in additional property tax revenue.
"With this bill, millions of tax dollars will flow to benefit the people of Eastvale, Jurupa Valley, Menifee and Wildomar," said Governor Brown. "Senator Roth and Assemblymember Cervantes pushed hard to ensure these communities weren't left behind."
Based on Department of Finance estimates, these cities are expected to collectively receive up to $19 million in additional funding annually. This revenue will help these cities fund critical needs.
"I thank the Governor for recognizing the critical nature of this funding for our cities, particularly with respect to keeping our neighborhoods and families safe," said Senator Richard D. Roth (D-Riverside). "This has been an issue I have fought for since before I was even elected, and I am proud to have partnered with Assemblymember Cervantes in delivering this major victory for our cities."
"This is a momentous day for the cities of Eastvale and Jurupa Valley. With this funding restored, we can once again provide critical public safety services and the community benefit programs that our residents seek and deserve," said Assemblymember Sabrina Cervantes (D-Corona). "I want to thank Senator Roth and Governor Brown for working with me to save our cities."
