Press Release

Location: Los Angeles, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed two bills which will give local governments more economic development tools to help improve struggling communities. SB 107 and AB 2 will help cities and counties streamline efforts to enhance affordable housing in areas that need it the most.
"These important new measures enacted today will help boost economic development in some of our most disadvantaged and deserving communities," said Governor Brown. "California owes a debt of gratitude to Speaker Toni Atkins for her leadership on these issues over the years. Without her tireless efforts, these bills would never have passed."
SB 107 by the Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review includes provisions that will streamline the current redevelopment agency dissolution process, enhance affordable housing by providing increased statewide funding and improving transparency, and expand the type of loans for which cities and counties can seek reimbursement.
SB 107 also includes language to correct a long-standing property tax problem for the counties of Stanislaus, Lassen, Plumas and Trinity and also gives relief to California's newest cities: Jurupa Valley, Menifee, Eastvale and Wildomar.
