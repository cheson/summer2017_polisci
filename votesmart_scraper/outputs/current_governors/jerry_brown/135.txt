Governor Brown Signs Legislation, Announces New Actions to Protect Salton Sea
Press Release

Location: Sacramento, CA

As water levels in the Salton Sea continue to drop, exposing thousands of acres of barren shoreline, California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced action on legislation -- AB 1095 by Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia (D-Coachella) -- and a series of measures to help protect Salton Sea habitat and air quality in nearby communities.
"The Salton Sea has a long and storied history in California and with these key restoration projects, the state is helping protect air quality, while maintaining a viable water supply in the region," said Governor Brown.
The Salton Sea, a man-made lake 125 miles southeast of Los Angeles, was created in 1905. Since then, water levels have steadily declined, leaving thousands of previously submerged acres exposed, increasing the risk of dust storms.
