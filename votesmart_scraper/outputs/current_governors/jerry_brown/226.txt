BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Joining me now, California Governor Jerry Brown. Governor, it is good to see you. It is good to hear that perhaps you are gaining on these fires. Give us an update.
BROWN: We are gaining. A few more fires have been put out. The 5,000 firefighters are getting ready to go back to their normal places where they live or they work. So, yes, it's progress for now, but we are in a very dry year, the third driest. And, yes, fires are going to be an ever-present threat and as this climate tilts drier and drier in the west, we are going to have mounting challenges and mounting expenses.
CROWLEY: And how do you meet those challenges? I know in our interview with our Wolf Blitzer earlier this week, you blamed climate change for, you know, some of the atmospheric and some of this but I wanted to draw to your attention something that the spokesman for Cal Fire, your fire agency, Daniel Berlant told the "National Geographic" recently when he said, "weather does not cause fires, weather just causes a fire to burn. It's the people that have the role of actually preventing that fire."
So, moving forward and aside from a sort of long-term climate change policies, what now, looking at what's been a pretty horrific year, should Californians do?
BROWN: Well, not do anything stupid, of course, avoiding using -- first of all, throwing cigarette butts around or dangerous camp fires. That has to be controlled. And in many places, shouldn't occur at all but even driving -- using a different kind of equipment or driving tractors or certain vehicles can cause sparks. The sparks can cause fires. Then of course, we have lightning and there's just a series of forces of which human beings are certainly a major component.
