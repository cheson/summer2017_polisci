Governor Brown Highlights Clean Energy Manufacturing Jobs in San Diego
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Dec. 16, 2011
Location: San Diego, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today joined business leaders and elected officials for the dedication of Soitec's North American headquarters in San Diego.
Soitec's San Diego headquarters will produce concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) modules for the U.S. renewable-energy market and employ 450 people, while supporting an additional 1,000 indirect jobs in the region.
"I'm glad to be here for the dedication of Soitec's manufacturing plant," said Governor Brown. "The expansion of clean energy businesses is a direct result of a law I signed that requires one third of our electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020. That's a goal and we're going to meet it."
Today's dedication follows the Governor's climate conference in San Francisco and highlights how fighting climate change and meeting California's 33 percent renewable energy goal will continue to create jobs.
The Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GoBiz) has worked with Soitec since 2009 to locate the headquarters in San Diego. The California Public Utilities Commission recently approved 155 MW of electricity purchase between Soitec and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E). The project also received support from the City of San Diego.
Soitec has not relied on any government funding for this project.
Governor Brown was joined today by San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher, SDG&E CEO Jessie Knight, CPUC Commissioner Timothy Simon and CleanTech San Diego President & CEO Jim Waring.
