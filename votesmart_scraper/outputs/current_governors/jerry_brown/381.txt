Governor Directs State Agencies and Departments to Identify and Eliminate Unnecessary Legislative Reports
Press Release

Location: Sacramento, CA

In another move to make government more efficient and reduce unnecessary costs, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today issued an Executive Order directing the state's agencies and departments to review the approximately 2,600 annual reports they are required to submit to the Legislature, and identify those that are no longer useful or necessary.
"My administration remains committed to keeping the Legislature informed, but churning out 2,600 annual reports -- some ordered more than two decades ago -- is a waste of time and money," Governor Brown said. "All state agencies and departments have been asked to take a closer look at these reports and will work with the Department of Finance and the Legislature to get rid of those that are no longer needed."
Under today's Executive Order, agency secretaries and department directors will prepare a list of all reports that they are required to submit to the Legislature, and identify those that may no longer be of significant value. Each agency and department will report its findings to the Department of Finance.
The Department of Finance will then review the findings and work with the Legislature to determine whether specific reports should be discontinued.
Today's directive follows an Executive Order issued last week to cut costs, increase efficiency by using honest, common-sense budgeting methods.
The full text of the Executive Order is below:
EXECUTIVE ORDER B-14-11
WHEREAS my Administration is committed to keeping the Legislature fully and properly informed on matters for which it requests information from state agencies and departments; and
WHEREAS state agencies and departments are required to submit to the Legislature approximately 2,600 reports every year; and
WHEREAS the requirements to submit these reports were, in some instances, established over 20 years ago, and some of these reports may no longer be of significant value to the Legislature; and
WHEREAS substantial efforts and costs are expended in preparing, tracking, and filing these reports; and
WHEREAS my Administration is committed to identifying and eliminating administrative inefficiencies and reducing costs.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, EDMUND G. BROWN JR., Governor of the State of California, do hereby issue the following orders to become effective immediately:
IT IS ORDERED that agency secretaries and department directors prepare a list of all reports that they are required to submit to the Legislature, and identify those that may no longer be of significant value to the Legislature.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each agency and department report their findings to the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance shall provide agencies and departments with reporting instructions.
In determining whether reports may no longer be of significant value, the following issues should be considered:
* Whether the report is the result of a specific budget bill and the required information is no longer timely or relevant;
* Whether the report is still relevant or necessary given a change in law or circumstances;
* Whether other sources of information or other reports provide the same or similar information; and
* Whether interested stakeholders continue to rely on the report, or whether there are other public interests in continuing to prepare the report.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Department of Finance review the findings and work with the Legislature to determine whether specific reports should be discontinued.
IT IS REQUESTED that entities of State government not under my direct executive authority also determine whether they are submitting reports that are no longer of significant value and should be discontinued.
This Executive Order is not intended to create, and does not create, any rights or benefits, whether substantive or procedural, or enforceable at law or in equity, against the State of California or its agencies, departments, entities, officers, employees, or any other person.
I FURTHER DIRECT that as soon as hereafter possible, this Order shall be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State and that it be given widespread publicity and notice.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Great Seal of the State of California to be affixed this 12th day of December 2011.
