Governor Brown to Meet with Local School Superintendents Tomorrow
Statement
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: April 23, 2013
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. will meet with local school superintendents from across California tomorrow to discuss his proposal to provide more flexibility to local school districts over how state money is spent and provide additional funding to school districts with more lower-income students and English language learners.
The meeting is closed to press and a media availability will follow in Room 1190 at the State Capitol.
"My 2013 Budget Summary lays out the case for cutting categorical programs and putting maximum authority and discretion back at the local level -- with school boards. I am asking you to approve a brand new Local Control Funding Formula which would distribute supplemental funds -- over an extended period of time -- to school districts based on the real world problems they face," Governor Brown said in his State of the State address. "This formula recognizes the fact that a child in a family making $20,000 a year or speaking a language different from English or living in a foster home requires more help. Equal treatment for children in unequal situations is not justice."
According to a recent PPIC poll, 78% of adults support the Governor's proposal to give local districts more flexibility and 71% of adults support the governor's plan to direct more funding to lower-income students and English language learners.
