BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
CROWLEY: Governor, first of all, thank you so much for joining us. I wanted you to take a California look at what has been going on in Washington. We have just finished up a very grueling debt debate. From your perspective, what did that tell you about Washington?
BROWN: Well, the obvious is that it's dysfunctional, but more than that, that the Washington of today is suffering and experiencing a governability crisis. America can't govern when you have two parties so diametrically opposed, I think that is an ominous sign going forward.
CROWLEY: Do you have a solution for that? Because I think you are right, I think people look and say, they are on different planets, and it's no wonder they can't come to an agreement. What do you think would help?
BROWN: I will tell you, we are at a crossroads that if the Republicans cannot give up some of their ideological baggage, and if the Democrats can't find a way to create common ground, the country is going to face some decline.
BROWN: And I think the only way out of that would be a very vigorous election where people lay out the stark alternatives, not muffle it like politicians like to do, kind of, you know, smooth out the rough edges.
I think we need a very clear, decisive election. I would say that the Republicans are gearing up to destroy the president, that the president will have to respond in a very powerful way, and the result for the country could be calamitous.
