S. California Business Leaders Endorse Governor Brown's Efforts to Let Voters Decide How to Address Budget Crisis
Press Release

Location: Los Angeles, CA

Governor Jerry Brown today announced that two of Southern California's premier business leadership groups -- the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and the Valley Industry & Commerce Association (VICA) -- have endorsed his plan to put tax extensions to a vote of the people in June.
"I thank both the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and VICA for their support and am hopeful others who have a stake in getting our state back on track will follow suit," said Governor Brown. "Given the fiscal challenges we face, it is very appropriate for the voters of California to weigh in with their vote; is it all cuts, or is it part cuts and part tax extensions?"
"Governor Brown's proposal to combine dramatic budget reductions with a temporary extension of higher rates on the state income tax, sales tax and the motor vehicles registration fee is fiscally responsible," said L.A. Area Chamber President & CEO Gary Toebben.
"In addition to balancing the budget today, California needs reforms that will have a positive and long-term impact on revenue and expenditures in the future," said Joseph Czyzyk, chair of the Chamber's Board of Directors and chairman & CEO of Mercury Air Group, Inc. "We look forward to continuing to work with the Governor on these reforms, because we share the common goal of putting California on a path to fiscal stability and economic growth as soon as possible."
"The dire situation with California's budget means that difficult decisions have to be made," said VICA chair Daymond Rice. "The decision about whether to cut another $12 billion from the budget that has already been slashed by $12 billion or extend these higher tax rates should be left up to those who will bear the burden -- the voters."
