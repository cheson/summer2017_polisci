A fired-up Jerry Brown previewed his general election themes in two gubernatorial campaign stops Thursday, framing the state's present straits as a chance to bring Californians together for a common purpose.
Although he criticized Republican rival Meg Whitman for attempting to "buy" the election, the Democratic nominee's message was largely optimistic and centered on the argument that his decades of political life were not an albatross at a time when anti-incumbent sentiment has been tilting electoral races across the nation. Rather, Brown contended that his life experience could bring Sacramento partisans together for the betterment of the state.
Jerry Brown: An article in Friday's LATExtra section about gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown's campaign events referred to him as California's last two-term governor. Brown was the last Democrat to serve two full terms. Republicans George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson served two full terms after Brown. --
"At this stage in my life, I don't have anything to prove, OK? I've done it all before," said California's last two-term governor and its current attorney general, speaking Thursday morning in the quad of Laney College in Oakland. "And I just want to go back to Sacramento and I want to do everything I can to pull Republicans and Democrats together. It's not a time for increasing the partisan divide. It's time for thinking as Californians first. I'm not saying it's easy, but we've had tough times before and we've always come out of it."
Brown's message came as his campaign, which operated largely below the radar this summer, geared up for the sprint to November's general election, charting events for the candidate across the state over the Labor Day weekend and preparing to air television ads for the first time.
