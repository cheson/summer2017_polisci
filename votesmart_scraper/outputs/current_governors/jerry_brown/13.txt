Governor Brown Issues Statement Ahead of US House of Representatives Vote on TrumpCare
Statement
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: May 4, 2017
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued the following statement ahead of today's vote on Trumpcare -- the American Health Care Act -- in the U.S. House of Representatives:
"This cruel and ill-conceived bill -- the so-called American Health Care Act -- rushed to a vote with no fiscal analysis, will hurt American families and it's bad for California. Millions will lose coverage, those with pre-existing conditions will be abandoned and costs will skyrocket.
"Just look at the districts of Representatives David Valadao (R-Hanford), Jeff Denham (R-Turlock) and Steve Knight (R-Lancaster) where 111,000, 109,000 and 76,000 Californians, respectively, are at risk of losing coverage because of this legislation.
"The fig leaf amendments tacked on in the eleventh hour don't change this massive assault on so many decent and hard-working people. Our California congressional delegation should vote no on this abomination."
