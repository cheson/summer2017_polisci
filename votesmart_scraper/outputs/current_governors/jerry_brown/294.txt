Governor Brown Issues Proclamation Declaring A "Day of Prayer"
Statement

Date: May 2, 2013
Location: Unknown

Each year, in accordance with Public Law 100-307, the President proclaims the first Thursday in May as a National Day of Prayer.
A National Day of Prayer is an occasion for each of us to reflect more deeply on the eternal verities and those matters which transcend our everyday routines. Through prayer, one opens the heart and stills the mind so that the Divine Presence may be directly encountered.
I encourage Californians to participate in this day in the manner that is most appropriate to their own religious or spiritual beliefs and experience.
NOW THEREFORE I, EDMUND G. BROWN JR., Governor of the State of California, do hereby proclaim May 2, 2013, as a "Day of Prayer" in California.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Great Seal of the State of California to be affixed this 1st day of May 2013.
