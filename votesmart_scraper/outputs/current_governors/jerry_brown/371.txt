"High-Speed Rail is a key step in modernizing our transportation system and will create much needed and good paying jobs," said Governor Brown. "Secretary LaHood and I have joined together to advance the cause of California High-Speed Rail."
"Over the past week, I have traveled all over the Golden State and have found a strong base of support for the California High-Speed Rail project, from workers who will build it, manufacturers that will supply the trains to run on it and businesses that will benefit from using it," said Secretary LaHood. "The Obama Administration is committed to High-Speed Rail because it is good for the economy and the nation. I look forward to working with Governor Brown to make this project as successful as possible."
