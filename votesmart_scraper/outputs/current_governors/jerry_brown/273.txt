Dear Ms. Crunican, Ms. Bryant, Ms. Sanchez, and Ms. Hamilton:
At the request of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, I am appointing a board to investigate the threatened strike that would disrupt public transportation services in the Bay Area. This board is appointed under the authority of Government Code, ยง 3612, subdivision (a), because the strike will significantly disrupt public transportation services and will endanger the public's health, safety, and welfare.
The three individuals appointed to the board of investigation are:
Jacob Appelsmith, Chairman
Robert Balgenorth
Micki Callahan
The Government Code prohibits any strike or lockout while the board completes its investigation. (Gov. Code, ยง 3612, subd. (b).)
The board is directed to provide me with a written report within the next seven days. For the sake of the people of the Bay Area, I urge - in the strongest terms possible - the parties to meet quickly and as long as necessary to get this dispute resolved.
Sincerely,
Edmund G. Brown Jr.
