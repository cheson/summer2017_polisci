Press Release

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today released a revised state budget that prudently pays down debt and saves billions of dollars, while carefully directing funding where it's needed most -- to improve schools, help low-income Californians, prevent tuition increases and respond to drought and climate change.
"Another recession is on the way -- we just don't know when. That's why this budget locks billions into the Rainy Day Fund and pays down debt," said Governor Brown. "At the same time, this budget spends more than ever on schools and creates a new tax credit to help California's working poor."
The May Revision also continues to focus on the key elements of the January budget -- carrying out the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), federal health care reform, public safety realignment, the Water Action Plan and the cap-and-trade expenditure plan.
When Governor Brown took office, the state faced a massive $26.6 billion budget deficit and estimated annual shortfalls of roughly $20 billion. These deficits, built up over a decade, have now been eliminated by a combination of budget cuts, temporary taxes and the recovering economy.
