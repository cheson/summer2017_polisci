As momentum builds around the world ahead of this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today welcomed 14 new signatories, including New York City and Italy - one of three founding endorsing nations - to the Under 2 MOU climate agreement at a ceremony in New York.
With the addition of the 14 new signatories, a total of 38 jurisdictions representing 17 countries and five continents have signed or endorsed the Under 2 MOU, collectively representing more than $8.7 trillion in GDP and more than 313 million people. If the Under 2 MOU signatories represented a single country, it would be the third largest economy in the world behind only China and the United States.
"California is not standing alone in the battle against climate change, but is joining with dozens of other states, cities - and even nations - to cut dangerous carbon emissions," said Governor Brown.
The Under 2 MOU is an agreement amongst cities, states - and now countries - around the world to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius - the warming threshold at which scientists say there will likely be catastrophic climate disruptions.
