Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued the following statement as the Paris Climate Agreement comes into force today, less than a year after the global pact was reached at the United Nations' 2015 Climate Conference (COP21):
"Today on climate, the world moves from commitment to action. Now it's up to cities, states and provinces to drastically cut toxic carbon pollution and get us to our goal. The clock is ticking."
Last year, Governor Brown attended COP21 at the invitation of UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres and France's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development Laurent Fabius. Over the course of the conference, the Governor met with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, China's Special Envoy on Climate Change Xie Zhenhua, France's Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy Ségolène Royal, U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and former Vice President Al Gore, and participated in a number of events with world leaders.
