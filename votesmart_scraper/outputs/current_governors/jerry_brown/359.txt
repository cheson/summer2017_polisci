Press Release

Location: Sacramento, CA

In a move that will shrink the state's environmental footprint and save millions of taxpayer dollars, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued a sweeping executive order today directing agencies and departments to take immediate steps to green the state's buildings, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency.
"Doing something real about the growing threat of global warming requires more than just new laws. We must lead by example," said Governor Brown. "Greening the state's buildings will shrink our environmental footprint and save taxpayers millions of dollars."
Today's executive order calls for new or renovated state buildings larger than 10,000 square feet to achieve the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED "Silver" certification or higher and to incorporate clean, on-site power generation, such as solar photovoltaic, solar thermal and wind power generation and clean back-up power supplies.
The order also sets a target of zero net energy consumption for 50% of the square footage of existing state-owned buildings by 2025 and zero net energy consumption from all new or renovated state buildings beginning design after 2025.
Additionally, the executive order directs state agencies and departments to:
* Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10% by 2015 and 20% by 2020, as measured against a 2010 baseline;
* Reduce overall water use by 10% by 2015 and 20% by 2020, as measured against a 2010 baseline; and
* Reduce grid-based energy purchases and other non-building, grid-based retail energy purchases by 20% by 2018, as compared to a 2003 baseline.
