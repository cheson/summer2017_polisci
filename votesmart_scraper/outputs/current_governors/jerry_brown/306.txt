PROCLAMATION
BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Over two million Americans served in the Vietnam War and related conflicts in Southeast Asia between 1959 and 1975. More than 58,000 did not return. Of those who survived, over 300,000 suffered physical injuries in combat, and an even greater number developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric ailments as a result of their service.
Our treatment of the veterans of Vietnam and other wars reflects profoundly on our character as a nation. Too many of our veterans suffer from unemployment, poverty, homelessness, substance abuse and disability. For this reason I signed Executive Order B-9-11, creating the Interagency Council on Veterans to coordinate the state's efforts in providing assistance to veterans in need. While the Council continues to explore every possible improvement in policies and programs related to veterans' issues, I urge all citizens to act in the same spirit by welcoming home our veterans, thanking them for their service and assisting them in every conceivable way.
NOW THEREFORE I, EDMUND G. BROWN JR., Governor of the State of California, do hereby proclaim March 30, 2013, as "Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day."
IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Great Seal of the State of California to be affixed this 29th day of March 2013.
EDMUND G. BROWN JR.
Governor of California
