Updated: Governor Brown to Host Inaugural Subnational Clean Energy Ministerial in California
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: May 31, 2016
Location: San Francisco, CA

Moving to further mobilize states, provinces and cities in the fight against climate change, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. will convene mayors, governors and other regional leaders from around the world next week at the inaugural Subnational Clean Energy Ministerial (SubCEM) in San Francisco. This gathering will be held in conjunction with the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM7), an annual meeting of national energy ministers and other high-level delegates from 23 member countries and the European Commission, where the Governor will also speak.
"California is now part of a worldwide movement of states and provinces that have committed themselves to combating climate change," said Governor Brown.
The inaugural SubCEM will highlight action from states, provinces and cities to use cleaner energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, in addition to Governor Brown, will feature Oregon Governor Kate Brown, Washington Governor Jay Inslee and other subnational leaders from the United States, Germany, Mexico, Canada, Spain, Kenya, Italy, China and India. This event - and these actions - complement the CEM7, which brings together national energy ministers and other high-level delegates to promote policies and share best practices to accelerate the global transition to clean energy.
Together, these events represent an opportunity to discuss how states, provinces, cities and countries will follow through on the commitments made at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, where Governor Brown and U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz first announced that California would host the CEM7.
