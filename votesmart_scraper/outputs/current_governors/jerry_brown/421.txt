Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced that an executive order to purge unnecessary vehicles has already cut the state's fleet by 3,800, which is expected to save $11.4 million next year and bring in $5 million from auction revenue. These cuts meet approximately 32 percent of the state's goal to reduce 5,500 passenger cars and trucks, and deeper cuts will continue as the state eliminates more unnecessary vehicles across every department.
"Significant progress has been made, but we are not done yet," Governor Brown said. "I'm not satisfied with purging just 3,800 vehicles--state departments can make deeper cuts. Every department must eliminate the unnecessary vehicles that waste taxpayer money. There is no excuse for an excessive state fleet."
The Department of General Services, charged with implementing the Governor's executive order, estimates this first reduction phase will save the state more than $11 million annually by eliminating surplus cars, trucks, vans, buses and heavy equipment. Auctioning these vehicles is estimated to bring the state at least $5 million more in additional revenue. The Department of General Services is prepared to begin holding auctions in the Fall.
The largest reductions come from the following eight departments, which operate the largest fleets:
- California Department of Transportation 926
- Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation 795
- California State Parks 388
- California Highway Patrol 322
- California Department of Fish & Game 251
- CAL FIRE 234
- California Department of Water Resources 204
- California Department of Food & Agriculture 111
On average, a state vehicle remains useful for five years and costs $3,000 per year in maintenance, insurance and depreciation costs. Based on those figures, today's reductions could save the state up to $57 million over five years.
The Department of General Services will continue to make even deeper cuts in the coming months to eliminate unnecessary vehicles across every department. In addition to reducing the size of its state fleet immediately, the state is examining its need for vehicles going forward. This examination will include reviewing how, when and why vehicles are used and will help departments implement more practical and cost-effective plans for the amount and type of vehicles needed to achieve their missions.
Departments have also eliminated more than 600 vehicle home storage permits that are nonessential or cost ineffective. The Department of General Services expects to eliminate hundreds more.
In addition to cutting the state fleet, Governor Brown has already slashed spending in his own office by more than 25 percent and ordered state agencies and departments to:
- Recover millions of dollars in uncollected salary and travel advances;
- Ban spending taxpayer dollars on free giveaway and gift items;
- Eliminate 30,000 cell phones; and
- Freeze hiring across state government.
