Governor Brown Redoubles Commitment to Fiscal Prudence in Revised Budget
Press Release

Location: Sacramento, CA

As revenues fall short of projections and California stretches into an eighth year of economic recovery, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today released a revised state budget that funds core programs while paying down debt, saving money and holding the line on new obligations.
"The surging tide of revenue has begun to turn," said Governor Brown. "Quoting Aesop's fable of the ant and the grasshopper: 'It is best to prepare for the days of necessity.'"
When Governor Brown took office, the state faced a massive $26.6 billion budget deficit and estimated annual shortfalls of roughly $20 billion. These deficits, built up over a decade, have now been eliminated by a combination of budget cuts, temporary taxes and the recovering economy.
Barring any significant changes, the budget over the next two years remains in balance. However, in the years that follow, the state's commitments will exceed expected revenues with annual shortfalls forecasted to exceed $4 billion by 2019 - or worse with an economic slowdown or recession.
Significant details of the May Revision:
The Challenge of Fiscal Balance
The May Revision revenue forecast has been reduced by $1.9 billion, reflecting poor April income tax receipts and more sluggish sales tax receipts than expected, while Proposition 2's required contributions have been reduced by a combined $1.6 billion. Even if the voters pass an extension of taxes, the longer-term budget outlook would be barely balanced. Until the voters decide in November whether temporary taxes should be extended, the May Revision reflects the principle that no significant new ongoing spending commitments should be made.
