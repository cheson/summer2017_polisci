Eleven years ago today, Al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners to use as suicide missiles against major American landmarks, including the Pentagon and New York's World Trade Center, where most of the nearly three thousand victims perished.
Each year since those terrible events, we have observed September 11 as Patriot Day to honor both those who lost their lives and the men and women who showed such bravery in responding to the attacks and aiding the victims. In the words of President Obama, "We mourn again the men, women, and children who were taken from us with terrible swiftness, stand with their friends and family, honor the courageous patriots who responded in our country's moment of need, and, with God's grace, rededicate ourselves to a spirit of unity and renewal."
On this somber anniversary, I urge Californians to commemorate the lives we lost and the bravery of those who responded. I have ordered all flags on state buildings to be flown at half-staff.
NOW THEREFORE I, EDMUND G. BROWN JR., Governor of the State of California, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2012, as Patriot Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Great Seal of the State of California to be affixed this 8th day of September 2012.
