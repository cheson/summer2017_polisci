Governor Jerry Brown today announced that key California business leaders support his budget plan and letting California voters decide whether or not to temporarily extend existing taxes.
The Silicon Valley Leadership Group (SVLG), California Small Business Association, California Black Chamber of Commerce and the California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce all pledged their support today for the governor's balanced budget solution.
"Business leaders know that closing the budget gap is the first step in righting California's economy," said Governor Brown. "Creating a robust, trustworthy economic environment is critical to supporting businesses and getting Californians back to work."
Today's endorsements continue the steady drumbeat of support for the Governor's plan, which has been backed by the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, the Valley Industry & Commerce Association (VICA), the Bay Area Council, the California Association of Independent Business (CAIB), and the Central City Association of Los Angeles.
"We know in life that you never get exactly what you want, but this is the point where you find that 90 percent you can agree on and it's important to make a deal that is good for California and move forward," said Carl Guardino, SVLG's chief executive officer.
