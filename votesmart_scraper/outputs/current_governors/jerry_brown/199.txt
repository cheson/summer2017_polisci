Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. was joined by Attorney General Kamala D. Harris today to present the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor to 14 law enforcement officials who went above and beyond the call of duty.
This year's recipients of California's highest public safety award included 4 individuals from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, one from the Santa Monica College Police Department, two from the Santa Monica Police Department, one from the Shasta County Sheriff's Office and six from the Los Angeles International Airport Police Department.
"It's always an honor to be here as we award the Medal of Valor," said Governor Brown at today's ceremony. "It's really about recognizing the absolute human necessity of duty, of courage and of solidarity so that our community, from the bottom up, gets stronger and stronger."
The Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act of 2003 gives the Governor the authority to award a Medal of Valor to public safety officers who are cited by the Attorney General for extraordinary valor above and beyond the call of duty. The Attorney General's Office receives nominations from public safety agencies. These nominations are reviewed by the Medal of Valor Review Board, which makes a recommendation to the Attorney General.
"Today's recipients of the Governor's Medal of Valor Awards represent the very best of California's public safety officers. Each showed extraordinary bravery in the face of grave danger, and each did so without any expectation of reward or recognition," said Attorney General Harris. "I thank them - and all of California's public safety officers - for the sacrifices they and their families make every day to keep our great state safe."
