Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Dec. 5, 2015
Location: Paris, France

California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today kicked off the first of five days at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, participating in the UNFCCC COP21's official "Action Day" event and a panel with Oscar-winning director Charles Ferguson and world-renowned primatologist and conservationist Dr. Jane Goodall following a screening of the new climate change documentary, "Time to Choose."
"We've got a long way to go to deal with climate change - a lot of inertia, a lot of complacency - and we need the energy from the grassroots and the states," said Governor Brown in remarks at the UNFCCC COP21 Action Day event. "Political will is not yet fully mobilized and our Under 2 MOU is enlisting subnational regions and provinces to actually lower the carbon footprint and also serve as a catalyst to get our nation states moving more than they are doing today."
