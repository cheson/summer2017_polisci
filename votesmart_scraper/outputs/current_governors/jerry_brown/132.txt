Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today issued the following statement after numerous states took legal action to block the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan, which sets nationwide limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants:
"While the world's scientists warn of the existential threat we face, these misguided political representatives seek to take America into a dark age of climate denial," said Governor Brown. "I will do everything in my power to fight this pernicious lawsuit."
Power plants are the largest emitters of greenhouse gases among stationary sources in the United States, making up roughly one-third of all emissions. The Clean Power Plan sets greenhouse gas emissions guidelines for each state based on current levels of pollution. On average, this plan will help cut pollution from existing power plants nationwide approximately 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
California is already on track to meet and exceed these new, national reduction targets, having committed to cutting emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 under an executive order Governor Brown issued earlier this year - the most ambitious target in North America and consistent with California's existing commitment to reduce emissions 80 percent under 1990 levels by 2050.
