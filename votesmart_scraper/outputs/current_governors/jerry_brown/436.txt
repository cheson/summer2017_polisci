Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: April 22, 2011
Location: Sacramento, CA

Between 1915 and 1923, 1.5 million Armenians were subjected to torture, starvation, mass murder and exile from their historic homeland. The Armenian Genocide, also known as the "First Genocide of the Twentieth Century," represented a deliberate attempt by the Ottoman empire to eliminate all traces of a thriving noble civilization.
Armenian communities all over the world commemorate this tragedy on April 24. On this day, and the week leading up to it, we honor the Armenian victims and survivors of the genocide, and reaffirm our commitment to preventing future atrocities from being committed against any people.
THEREFORE I, EDMUND G. BROWN JR., Governor of the State of California, hereby proclaim April 24, 2011, as "California Day of Remembrance of the Armenian Genocide".
IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Great Seal of the State of California to be affixed this 18th day of April 2011.
