Governor Brown, Senate President Pro Tempore and Assembly Speaker Support Raising California's Minimum Wage
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Sept. 11, 2013
Location: Sacramento, CA

"The minimum wage has not kept pace with rising costs," said Governor Brown. "This legislation is overdue and will help families that are struggling in this harsh economy."
"For millions of California's hard working minimum wage employees, a few extra dollars a week can make a huge difference to help them provide for their families," said Senate President pro Tempore Steinberg. "They deserve a modest boost and after six years, an increase in California's minimum wage is the right thing to do."
"The real winner here is the economy. A $10 hour minimum wage boosts earnings by $4,000 a year and will put $2.6 billion dollars back into the hands of workers," said Speaker PÃ©rez. "This is money that will be spent at grocery stores, on school supplies and invested in education, and that ultimately strengthens the recovery and ensures California's job market continues growing faster than the rest of the nation."
AB 10 will raise California's minimum wage in two one-dollar increments, from $8 per hour today to $9 per hour, effective July 1, 2014 and from $9 per hour to $10 per hour, effective January 1, 2016. More than 90 percent of minimum wage workers in California are over the age of 20, and 25 percent of California children -- nearly 2.4 million -- live in a household with one minimum wage-earning parent.
"AB 10 is about equity. It puts more money directly into the pockets of workers struggling to provide food, clothes, and housing for their families. I'm proud to author this measure on behalf of hard working families in California," said Assemblymember Alejo.
