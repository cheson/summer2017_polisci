Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced that with the addition of the Federal Republic of Germany, along with the German regions of Bavaria, Schleswig-Holstein and Thuringia and the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna to the Under 2 MOU climate agreement, the combined GDP of signatories and endorsers has surpassed that of the United States, the world's largest economy.
"From Germany to Brazil to China and beyond, this pact is uniting the world's leaders around a common goal: preventing catastrophic changes to our climate," said Governor Brown. "If enough cities, states, regions - and even countries - join us, we can overcome the sheer complacency that threatens the well-being of humanity itself."
