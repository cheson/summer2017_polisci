With devastating fires burning across California, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today joined CAL FIRE Director Ken Pimlott, Governor's Office of Emergency Services Director Mark Ghilarducci and other fire and emergency personnel at the State Operations Center for a briefing on the latest fire conditions.
"I came here to give my encouragement to all of the people who are doing everything they can to coordinate and combat these fires," Governor Brown said during a media availability after the briefing. "Government is about many things, but its fundamental obligation is public safety."
On Sunday, Governor Brown declared a state of emergency in Lake and Napa counties due to the effects of the Valley Fire and on Friday, declared a state of emergency in Amador and Calaveras counties to help fight the Butte Fire. The center was activated to its highest level over the weekend.
