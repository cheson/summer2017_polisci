Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today concurred with the Department of the Interior's decisions to allow 305 acres in Madera County to be placed in trust for the North Fork Rancheria Band of Mono Indians for the purpose of establishing a class III gaming facility and signed a tribal-state gaming compact between the State of California and the Tribe.
The compact includes provisions to protect employees and patrons as well as measures to protect the environment during the construction and operation of gaming facilities. It also funds programs in local communities to mitigate the effect of gaming activities and address gambling addiction
The compact allows the operation of 2,000 slot machines. The Tribe estimates that the project will create approximately 750 construction jobs and 1,500 jobs at the new facility. The compact requires regular audits of gaming operations and other enforcement and public safety measures.
A copy of the compact can be found here. The Governor's letter to Secretary Kenneth L. Salazar concurring with the U.S. Department of Interior's decision is copied below:
