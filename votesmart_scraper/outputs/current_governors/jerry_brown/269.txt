Statement
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Sept. 4, 2013
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued the following statement after a party-line vote today on AB 84 in the Senate Budget Committee:
"The plan approved by the Senate Budget Committee is an inmate release plan by another name, totally dependent on an illusory legal settlement.
I will not turn over our criminal justice system to lawyers who operate at the behest of their inmate clients, and not the people, whose interests we are sworn to uphold. Moreover, the plan adds huge burdens to local government, which threaten to undo the remarkable progress we've made in realignment."
