Location: Sacramento, CA

Our coastline, farmland, mountains, deserts and urban environments all make up the great and unique landscape of California. They form the basis for tourism, agriculture, energy development, recreation and California's ability to attract and retain businesses. Protecting the environment is essential to our long-term prosperity. I have long recognized that environmental protection and economic development go hand in hand and will continue to promote both as Governor.
