Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Sept. 20, 2012
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed several bipartisan bills that improve services and opportunities for veterans in California.
"Yesterday, a bill to invest in job training for veterans was blocked because of Washington political infighting," said Governor Brown. "Here in California, Republicans and Democrats joined together to support our veterans. These bills respect the honor and dignity of those who serve."
"This comprehensive package of legislation signed by Governor Brown continues to demonstrate that California is fulfilling its obligation to our veterans and their families who have sacrificed so much," said Maj. Gen. David S. Baldwin, California National Guard Adjutant General.
"Veterans issues should never be partisan," said California Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Peter J. Gravett. "These bills show our commitment to serving those who served."
