Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. and Mexico's Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare Alfonso Navarrete Prida met today and committed to work together to protect the rights of Mexican migrant workers in California.
"Temporary workers from Mexico play an important part in California's economy, and we must ensure that these workers are treated fairly and with respect," said Governor Brown
"It is primordial for STPS to ensure the rights of Mexican migrant workers in California are thoroughly respected. Specifically, we seek to support workers in situations of great vulnerability," said Secretary Navarrete.
During today's meeting, Governor Brown and Secretary Navarrete signed a letter of intent to cooperate in the creation of a voluntary pilot program to help prevent abuses in the recruitment of Mexican H-2 temporary workers going to California.
The hiring of H-2 workers is generally done through private recruitment and hiring agencies. The Governor and the Secretary discussed measures to improve transparency and accountability in the recruitment of these workers to reduce exploitation and prevent labor violations.
Today's agreement follows Governor Brown's meetings with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Secretary of Foreign Affairs José Antonio Meade Kuribreña, Governor of the State of Mexico Eruviel Ávila, U.S. Ambassador to Mexico E. Anthony Wayne, Secretary of Energy Pedro Joaquín Coldwell and President of the Senate Raúl Cervantes Andrade. The Governor has also signed agreements with Mexican officials on education, renewable energy, trade and to reduce greenhouse gases.
