Press Release

Date: Aug. 9, 2013
Location: Oakland, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced that he would seek a court ordered cooling-off period on Sunday if the parties fail to resolve their ongoing contract dispute.
"I urge all parties to think of the public and resolve this matter without delay, but if there's no resolution by Sunday, I will seek a 60 day cooling-off period," said Governor Brown.
Earlier today, the board of investigation, appointed by the Governor last Sunday to examine the dispute, issued its findings.
The report concluded that "a strike will cause significant harm to the public's health, safety and welfare."
If the parties fail to resolve their dispute over the weekend, the San Francisco Superior Court will consider the Governor's request on Sunday morning. If the court finds that a strike will significantly disrupt public transportation services and endanger the public's health, safety or welfare, an order will be issued enjoining the strike for a period of 60 days.
Sunday's hearing will be held at 9:00 a.m. at San Francisco Superior Court with Judge Curtis E.A. Karnow presiding. For more information on media coverage of the hearing, please contact Ann E. Donlan, communications director at the San Francisco Superior Court, at adonlan@sftc.org.
