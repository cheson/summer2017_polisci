Governor Brown Declares State of Emergency in El Dorado and Siskiyou Counties
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Sept. 17, 2014
Location: Sacramento, CA

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today issued an emergency proclamation for El Dorado and Siskiyou counties due to the effects of the King and Boles fires, which have burned thousands of acres, destroyed homes and other structures and damaged critical infrastructure.
"The wildfires in Northern California serve as a reminder that dry conditions can be the precursor to devastating loss," said Governor Brown. "Anne and I extend our deepest sympathies to those who have suffered such terrible losses in the fires."
Today's proclamation follows the emergency proclamation issued in early August for wildfires in El Dorado, Amador, Butte, Humboldt, Lassen, Madera, Mariposa, Mendocino, Modoc, Shasta and Siskiyou counties and this month's executive order waiving fees to replace documents such as driver's licenses and birth certificates for those affected by the fires. This week, Governor Brown secured federal Fire Management Assistance Grants for the King, Boles and Courtney fires.
