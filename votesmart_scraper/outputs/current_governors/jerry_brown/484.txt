Our coastline, farmland, mountains, deserts and urban environments all make up the great and unique landscape of California. They form the basis for tourism, agriculture, energy development, recreation and California's ability to attract and retain businesses. Protecting the environment is essential to our long-term prosperity. I have long recognized that environmental protection and economic development go hand in hand and will continue to promote both as Governor.
INTRODUCTION
Our coastline, farmland, mountains, deserts and urban environments all make up the great and unique landscape of California. They form the basis for tourism, agriculture, energy development, recreation and California's ability to attract and retain businesses. Protecting the environment is essential to our long-term prosperity. I have long recognized that environmental protection and economic development go hand in hand and will continue to promote both as Governor.
MY PLAN:
1. Reduce dangerous emissions that contaminate the air we breathe.
Over 90% of Californians live in areas with unhealthy air. This isn't just a cosmetic problem. According to respected medical journals, air pollution permanently damages children's lungs, increases asthma attacks and the incidence of bronchitis. (Close to five million people in California suffer from asthma, including one in six kids under age 18.) Recent scientific research has found that residents living near freeways suffer a hardening of the arteries that leads to heart disease and strokes at twice the rate of those who live farther away. Dangerous air emissions also cost farmers billions of dollars in crop damage.
* The vast bulk of air pollutants come from cars and trucks. The solution requires transforming our transportation system to steadily reduce our use of fossil fuels. This means introducing more hybrid, electric and alternative fuel vehicles. By 2015, California should have 250,000 full or partial plug-in electric vehicles. Cities and counties, as well as the State, should accelerate the use of clean vehicles through fleet purchasing requirements.
* Take all reasonable steps to promote the development and use of advanced biofuels--from algae, agricultural waste and biodiesel.
* Provide incentives to California's cutting-edge industries that are developing electric vehicles and advanced biofuels,
* Strengthen enforcement and adopt incentives to get the dirtiest vehicles off the road. The dirtiest 7-10% of cars cause half of all vehicle pollution in California.
* Monitor and encourage current efforts by California ports to retrofit or replace polluting trucks with clean vehicles.
* Take all necessary steps to ensure that vessels docked in California ports use onshore electric power rather than burning dirty bunker fuel.
* Require vessels entering California waters to reduce speeds, substantially lessening harmful air emissions.
* Enlist Congressional and Obama Administration support for controlling air emissions from shipping through the International Maritime Organization. Ocean-going vessels are a major source of air pollution.
2. Promote Clean Energy and Jobs (See also Clean Energy Jobs Plan for more details).
Climate disruption and rising temperatures threaten serious harm to California by increasing the number and intensity of forest fires, severe flooding, water shortages, coastal erosion and air pollution. Climate scientists are virtually unanimous in calling for significant reductions in greenhouse gases. To accomplish this, California should continue leading the nation in controlling greenhouse gases and promoting clean energy technology, a major source of new jobs. California attracted over $3.3 billion in clean tech venture capital in 2008, far more than any other state.
* Oppose Proposition 23, bankrolled by Texas oil companies. This measure, if successful, would deal a crippling blow to California's pioneering efforts to control greenhouse gases and build a clean energy economy.
* Promote energy efficiency and electricity from renewable sources, creating 500,000 new jobs in California (see my "Clean Energy Jobs Plan" for more details).
* Promote measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, including use of low-carbon fuels, increased rail and transit, and incentives for development around transit hubs.
* Support high speed rail as a clean, fast, accessible alternative to air transportation and long in-state automobile trips. This will create jobs and bring our communities closer together. Europe and Japan have used high speed rail for decades. As our airports and highways become more crowded, the need for high speed rail becomes even more acute.
3. Protect California's Coastline and Ocean Resources.
California's coastline is a precious resource vulnerable to offshore oil spills, urban and agricultural waste (including plastics), and erosion and sea level rise due to climate change.
* Oppose additional offshore oil drilling. Given the current state of technology, California should not risk the devastation caused by the recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
* Increase enforcement efforts aimed at controlling urban and agricultural runoff.
* Complete and implement California's Climate Adaptation Plan aimed at protecting against sea level rise, salt water intrusion, and increased erosion.
* Ensure that the California Coastal Commission and Coastal Conservancy act to protect California's coastline and beaches while at the same time respecting the rights of property owners and local communities.
4. Reduce Dangerous Toxic Chemicals.
The use of chemicals is part of modern life and its many conveniences. But many of these chemicals can threaten human health and contaminate the environment. There are over 80,000 chemicals in commerce today, with 2,000 more introduced each year. Yet only a small fraction of these chemicals have been tested for their toxicity.
* Support the Green Chemistry Initiative to reduce chemical hazards in consumer products.
* Step up research on the effects of chemicals on human health, particularly on children and reproduction.
* Ban the use of the most dangerous chemicals.
* Protect children from toys, baby bottles and other products contaminated with toxic chemicals. Too many times, we have learned after the fact that toys and bottles are contaminated with lead or other harmful chemicals.
5. Build Livable Communities.
California's population is expected to increase to 60 million by 2050, which -- in the absence of sound policies -- will increase congestion, vehicle miles driven, and air pollution; it will also result in paving over more than a million acres of the State's most productive farmland. Improving the quality of life in California communities requires that jobs be located closer to where people live, thereby allowing people to spend less time commuting and more time with their families and friends.
* Ensure that the Strategic Growth Council provides resources for more sustainable local development.
* Provide incentives for development near transportation and business hubs.
* Link state transportation funding to projects that avoid sprawl, reduce vehicle miles traveled and encourage livable communities.
* Encourage businesses to adopt programs that reduce dependency on solo automobile trips.
* Promote safe routes to school that encourage kids to walk and bike instead of being driven.
6. Protect Parks, Open Spaces, and Wildlife.
Parks, open space and abundant wildlife are fundamental to a vibrant California. Wilderness and open spaces protect California's unique natural beauty, wildlife, water quality, and renowned outdoor recreation. Fish populations in California, including salmon, steelhead and trout, are in serious trouble.
* Assure funding to maintain existing parks and wildlife areas.
* Protect vulnerable species and habitat through conservation agreements and enforcement of state resource protection laws.
* Take reasonable steps to ensure a healthier habitat for California's unique fish species by limiting sediment and other runoff entering streams, replacing culverts that impede fish passage with salmon-friendly pipes, and working with local ranchers to fence off cattle from sensitive streams.
7. Conserve California's Rich Farmland.
California's farms and ranches help feed the world. California's more than 81,000 farms and ranches produce more than $36 billion in fruits, nuts, vegetables, grains, dairy products and livestock. California's agriculture industry is a critical source of jobs, employing 1.3 million people.
* Direct growth away from the most productive agricultural land.
* Ensure reliable and adequate water supplies.
* Increase programs to fight invasive species that damage crops (e.g. European Grape Vine Moth) and diseases that threaten livestock. We should strengthen our system of agricultural inspection stations at the state's borders, ports and airports.
* Explore development of compatible renewable energy facilities on farmland.
