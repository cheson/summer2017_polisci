Governor Brown Signs Bill to Help Protect and Preserve California's Coast
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Sept. 21, 2013
Location: Sacramento, CA

As tens of thousands gather across the state for California Coastal Cleanup Day, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced that he has signed AB 754 by Assembly member Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance), which gives taxpayers the opportunity to support coastal conservation efforts with the check of a box on their state income tax return.
"The beauty and allure of California's coast is unrivaled and this bill gives taxpayers a simple way to help keep it that way," said Governor Brown.
Each September, on the third Saturday of the month, Californians gather to take part in the state's largest volunteer event, California Coastal Cleanup Day. Last year more than 65,000 volunteers removed nearly 770,000 pounds of trash and recyclables from California's beaches, lakes and waterways. In 1993, California Coastal Cleanup Day was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the "largest garbage collection" ever organized. Over the years, California Coastal Cleanup Day has spread inland from the beaches and now includes urban efforts to "stop trash where it starts" before litter can make its way into the state's waterways.
AB 754 will create a check-off box on California personal income tax forms. This will allow taxpayers to make charitable contributions to the California Beach and Coastal Enhancement Account. Funds will be available through the California Coastal Commission's WHALE TAIL Grants Program, which supports public education on the state's marine and coastal resources, Adopt-A-Beach programs and other beach maintenance and coastal habitat restoration projects that have an educational component.
