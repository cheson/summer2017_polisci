The Office of Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., today issued the following statement in response to the Senate Republican Caucus:
"The Governor's plan to fix California's budget has been consistent since January 10: a balance of deep spending cuts and a vote on temporary tax extensions. Republicans blocked a June vote on a balanced budget, which created the need for a bridge to protect schools and public safety from devastating cuts.
For them to claim otherwise now is simply untrue.
Today they've again shown what they're best at--grandstanding without solving problems. We could have had regulatory reform, a spending cap and pension reform--without a bridge--in March.
If they think the state budget can be balanced without tax extensions, then they should show that plan to the people."
