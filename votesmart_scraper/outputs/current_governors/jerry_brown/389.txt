Dear Senator Negrete-McLeod and Assemblymember Furutani:
As I indicated today in our conversations, I very much look forward to working with you and the other members of the Conference Committee in taking the necessary steps to improve our retirement systems. On Thursday, you will receive my updated pension reform proposals for review at your next hearing.
Given the paramount importance of pensions to both taxpayers and public employees, it is absolutely critical that we carefully examine our current assumptions and practices. We have to do our best to make sure that we have a system that is fair and truly sustainable over the long time horizon that our pension and health systems require.
Sincerely,
Edmund G. Brown Jr.
