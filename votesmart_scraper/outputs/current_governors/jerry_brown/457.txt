Governor Brown Orders Statewide Hiring Freeze
Press Release
By: Jerry Brown, Jr.
Date: Feb. 15, 2011
Location: Sacramento, CA

Continuing his work to save scarce taxpayer dollars, Governor Jerry Brown today issued a hiring freeze across state government.
"We have a $25 billion deficit, and we must do everything possible to save money and make government leaner and more efficient," Brown said.
The hiring freeze is comprehensive, applying to vacant, seasonal and full and part-time positions. It prohibits hiring outside contractors to compensate for the hiring freeze, converting part-time positions into full-time positions and transferring employees between agencies and departments.
This action is part of Brown's efforts to save money this fiscal year and to cut $363 million in operational costs next fiscal year.
"The hiring freeze will be in effect until agencies and departments prove that they can achieve these savings," Brown said.
The order allows for limited exemptions, subject to the approval of the Governor's Office. It permits agencies to fill positions that are critical to public safety, revenue collection and other core functions, in cases where these essential duties cannot be carried out at current staffing levels. Examples include positions that provide hands-on patient support in 24-hour care facilities and those that respond to emergencies, disasters or other life-threatening situations. The order will not prevent Brown from making senior-level appointments as he forms his new administration.
Earlier this year, Brown issued Executive Orders to cut state cell phones and the passenger vehicle fleet by 50 percent.
