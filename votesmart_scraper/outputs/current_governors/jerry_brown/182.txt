Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued the following statement today after a federal judge in Texas blocked a series of executive actions on immigration reform:
"California stands firmly with the White House. Further delay will not fix our broken immigration system."
Since taking office Governor Brown has signed the Dream Act, which allows top students who are on the path to citizenship to apply for college financial aid; AB 60, which extends the legal right to drive on the state's roadways to millions more Californians; and a number of other bills to enhance school, workplace and civil protections for California's hardworking immigrants. Last year, Governor Brown also signed legislation to provide legal services to the unaccompanied minors arriving in California from Central America.
