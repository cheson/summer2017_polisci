Press Release

Location: Lincoln, NE

This afternoon, Governor Pete Ricketts issued the following statement after the Legislature's decision to override his veto of LB623, which grants driver licenses to illegal immigrants.
"The Legislature's decision to provide driver licenses and state identification cards to illegal immigrants is an inappropriate benefit to non-citizens," said Governor Ricketts. "The legislation passed today extends these benefits to any illegal immigrant who has "approved deferred action status,' and not just the young adults many senators intended to help."
