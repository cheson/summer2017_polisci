Today, Governor Pete Ricketts surveyed storm damage and flooding in Hebron, Deshler, Roseland, and near Lincoln via helicopter. Following the flight, the Governor held a brief media availability at the Nebraska State Patrol hanger in Lincoln to announce that he had declared a State of Emergency for the affected areas.
"I have authorized an emergency declaration. At this time the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency is in contact with other state agencies and they are actively monitoring the situation and will provide assistance as needed," said Governor Ricketts. "The good news is nobody was hurt and everybody is safe. Utility crews are out there working. We did have a power outage last night in about a third of the town. As we flew over the state, we saw more utility crews continuing to work to restore power to folks in Roseland."
At the news conference, he urged Nebraskans to use caution and avoid taking unnecessary risks in flooded areas. Anyone needing assistance from the American Red Cross should immediately call 844-334-7569.
