Pete Ricketts this afternoon announced State Auditor Mike Foley as his running mate, following the resignation of Lt. Gov. Lavon Heidemann earlier today.
"Mike Foley is a principled, independent, and reform-minded advocate for the people of Nebraska," Ricketts said. "As auditor, he's worked tirelessly to protect Nebraska taxpayers. As a state senator, he was a fearless champion of the unborn and our state's most vulnerable citizens. Mike has an unyielding commitment to making state government work better for all Nebraskans."
"Not long ago, we were competitors. Today, I am proud to say we are teammates. Together, we will deliver a message of new growth and responsible reform that helps shape a brighter future for families and communities across our state."
