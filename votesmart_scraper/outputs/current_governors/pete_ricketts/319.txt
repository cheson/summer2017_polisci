Friends:
We did it!
When we began the campaign over 14 months ago, we set out with this goal: Listen and work with Nebraskans to determine how we best grow our state, from one end to the other.
I am honored and humbled to have earned your support. As I said Tuesday night, I am continually inspired by Nebraskans. Nebraska is a reflection of what America is supposed to be.
Now the work of governance begins, and I am very excited to get started. I am excited to continue working with you, and your representatives in the Unicameral, to put the plans in place to grow Nebraska.
Thank you for the time and resources you dedicated to our campaign. I can't wait to continue this journey with you.
Sincerely,
Governor-elect Pete Ricketts
