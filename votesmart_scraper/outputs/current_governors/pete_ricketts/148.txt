Gov. Ricketts Comments on SCOTUS Denial of Marijuana Case
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: March 21, 2016
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following a decision by the United States Supreme Court to deny Nebraska's request for a hearing on Colorado's unconstitutional legalization of marijuana.
"Law enforcement and leaders in communities along the Nebraska-Colorado border have shared with me stories about crime, drug trafficking, and other activities associated with Colorado's marijuana industry that have spilled over into our state. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case leaves Nebraska and other states bordering Colorado to deal with the fallout from the Colorado drug trade and the failure of the Obama Administration to enforce federal drug laws.
"To date, Nebraska has wisely avoided Colorado's mistake in legalizing this dangerous drug, and my administration will continue to work with senators to protect our families and stop efforts to circumvent federal law here in Nebraska."
