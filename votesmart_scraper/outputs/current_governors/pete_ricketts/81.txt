Gov. Ricketts Comments on Obamacare Insurance Rate Hikes
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Sept. 2, 2016
Location: Lincoln, KS

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following news that Nebraskans buying insurance through the exchange created under Obamacare would see another significant rate hike in the coming year.
"The rate increases for Obamacare insurance underscore the negative impact the President's healthcare plan is having on Nebraska families. They reinforce why the Legislature and I have rejected the expansion of Obamacare, and instead focused on innovative ways to expand access to healthcare by creating a framework for direct primary care and by giving nurse practitioners the freedom to practice."
