Today, Governor Pete Ricketts called on Senator Ernie Chambers of Omaha to issue a public apology following unacceptable comments he made during a committee hearing:

"As public officials, we are held to a higher standard, and we should be. No one should ever suggest the use of violence against law enforcement officials. I have reviewed the transcript from the Judiciary Committee hearing in question, and Senator Chambers' comments were out of line. Words matter. At a time when we need to develop better relationships between law enforcement and our communities, Senator Chambers' comments are irresponsible and only promote distrust and the potential for violence. I urge Senator Chambers to issue a full apology for his remarks and to condemn all violence against law enforcement."

Yesterday, Governor Ricketts tweeted his support for law enforcement. He encourages Nebraskans to tweet their support using the #SupportBlue hashtag. Twitter users can follow @GovRicketts for updates.
