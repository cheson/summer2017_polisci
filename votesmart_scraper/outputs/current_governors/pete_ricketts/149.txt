Today, Governor Pete Ricketts announced that he and the Revenue Committee have agreed on a proposed amendment to LB958, which provides property tax relief. Property tax relief is the Governor's number one priority this legislative session.
"I appreciate the continued work of Chairman Gloor and the Revenue Committee as they have collaborated with my team on designing a property tax relief plan," said Governor Ricketts. "Continued collaboration will be important as we work together to deliver much-needed property tax relief for hard-working Nebraskans."
The components included in the proposed amendment for LB958 include:
A limit on the carryover of unused restricted funds by community colleges to 3%
Targeted additional direct property tax relief for ag land property taxpayers
"The Revenue Committee appreciates the dedication of the Governor to providing property tax relief," said Revenue Chairman Mike Gloor. "Over the past year, we have heard repeatedly about the importance of property tax relief from Nebraskans everywhere, and I look forward to bringing a bill to the floor for consideration by the entire Legislature."
The Revenue Committee will hold a new hearing on the proposed amendment to LB958 on March 24, 2016. The public is invited to testify.
