Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts, in partnership with ServeNebraska and the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), recognized veterans who have continued their service to America as AmeriCorps members and Senior Corps volunteers.
The event held at the Nebraska State Capitol recognized these dedicated individuals as members of National Veteran Corps, which is part of a larger effort to raise awareness of the value veterans bring to communities. The event today in Lincoln was one of nearly 200 recognition ceremonies featuring National Veteran Corps pin presentations taking place across the country throughout the month of November.
"Our servicemen and women risk their lives to protect our freedom and way of life," said Governor Ricketts. "As Americans, it is our solemn obligation to support them and their families when they come home. Serving those who served us and engaging the talents of our veterans and military families is a priority for my administration and many Nebraskans."
