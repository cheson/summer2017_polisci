Press Release

Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts announced a national search for a permanent Director to lead the Nebraska Department of Roads. This announcement comes at the conclusion of three successful national searches for innovative and transformational leadership to lead the Departments of Corrections, Economic Development and Health and Human Services.
The search for a new Director of the Nebraska Department of Roads will follow a similar process to previous searches. With statewide financial support, the Greater Omaha Chamber Foundation has hired a search firm to conduct the search. Finalists identified by the firm will be forwarded to Governor Ricketts and his Chief of Staff, Matt Miltenberger, for interviews.
Ted Ford Webb of Ford Webb Associates, Inc. based in Concord, Massachusetts will assist with the search. Webb previously assisted with the successful searches that identified Scott Frakes to lead the Nebraska Department of Corrections and Courtney Phillips to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.
"After successful national searches to lead key state agencies, it made sense to utilize a similar approach with the Department of Roads," said Governor Pete Ricketts. "Building 21st-century infrastructure with fiscally-responsible funding mechanisms is critical for our state's future. Forward-thinking leadership for the department can help accomplish these goals."
Donors who contribute to the search process will be disclosed after the conclusion of the search.
