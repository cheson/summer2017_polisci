Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services (NDCS) Director Scott Frakes announced that the department has successfully purchased all three drugs necessary to carry out Nebraska's death penalty under the current protocol. NDCS currently possesses one of these drugs, and the other two will be delivered in the near future.
Currently, NDCS possesses potassium chloride. The department has ordered sodium thiopental and pancuronium bromide from HarrisPharma.
"The functionality of the death penalty in Nebraska has been a management issue that I have promised to resolve," said Governor Ricketts. "Through the work of Director Frakes, the department has purchased the drugs that are necessary to carry out the death penalty in Nebraska in the near future."
"The responsibilities of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services Director are varied and extensive," said Director Frakes. "One of those important duties is to carry out the order of the court. In the past few weeks, the department has been able to purchase the necessary drugs to carry out the death sentence that inmates have received."
Currently, there are death row inmates who appear to have exhausted their appeals.
Updates will be provided when drugs are received from the distributor.
