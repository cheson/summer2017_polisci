Ricketts Wants A More Business-Like Washington
By Tracy Buffington/Executive Editor
Listening to him talk about the issues, you learn a lot about Pete Ricketts' background.
The Republican candidate for U.S. Senate doesn't talk about past political offices that he held or the numerous campaigns he's worked on. Instead, he talks business and his experiences in the working world.
"I think one of the reasons why voters in Nebraska ought to send me to Washington is because I've had the background in business. We've made the hard decisions at Ameritrade," Ricketts said during an exclusive interview with the Fremont Tribune.
"We need more people who have that experience going to Washington to help change that culture in Washington so that we're not doing business as usual."
Ricketts officially joined the race for the Republican nomination for Senate in August. That's when he left his post as chief operating officer at Ameritrade, the company his father founded.
Ricketts decided to run for Ben Nelson's Senate seat after getting involved in the anti-gambling group Gambling with the Good Life and listening to Carl Rover speak about Social Security reform.
