"The Legislature is out of touch with Nebraskans on their vote to repeal the death penalty. The overwhelming majority of Nebraskans support the death penalty because they understand that it is an important tool for public safety. I will continue to work with senators to sustain my veto when I issue it."
-Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts
