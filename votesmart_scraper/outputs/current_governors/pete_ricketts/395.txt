I support the War on TerrorismÂ….and I would much rather fight the terrorists outside America.
We must follow through and ensure that Iraq and Afghanistan are able to protect themselves. If we leave before the mission has been accomplished, we will open the gates of radicalism and ensure a new haven for terrorism. We have a historic opportunity in the Middle East to help democracy grow. The challenges we face today pale in comparison to what we could face in the future if we abandoned our mission.
