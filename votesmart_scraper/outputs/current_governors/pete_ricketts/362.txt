NELSON'S DISMAL LEGISLATIVE RECORD CONTINUES
Omaha, Neb. - Earlier this week, Ben Nelson tried to attach an amendment for federal drought relief on to a Senate bill regarding American ports security. The move was rebuffed by the Senate Majority Leader's office because the bill was unrelated to port security.
"Typical of his record, Ben Nelson is once again playing politics with a serious matter," Pete Ricketts said. "Help to farmers who need it should not be toyed around with as a political gimmick. Many Nebraska farmers are suffering due to ongoing drought conditions, and they need relief - not grandstanding."
"By offering proposals that go nowhere, Ben Nelson is not helping anyone," Ricketts said. "Nelson's efforts have only amounted to a headline. This is why he has such a dismal record of legislative success in Washington. Leaders are motivated by conviction - they don't govern by sticking their finger in the air."
