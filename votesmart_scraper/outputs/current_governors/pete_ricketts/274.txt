Today, Governor Pete Ricketts urged Nebraskans to support relief efforts in Nepal following last week's devastating earthquake that killed at least 6,200.
"Nebraska is a welcoming place, and many Nepalese have chosen to make Nebraska their home," said Governor Pete Ricketts. "As the people of Nepal seek to put their lives back together, Susanne and I are urging Nebraskans to join our family in supporting relief efforts."
"This is a critical time for the people of Nepal as we support their efforts to put their lives back together," said Amrit Kandel of the Nebraska Nepalese Society. "Nebraskans are already stepping up to help support relief efforts, and I know firsthand that this generosity will really make a difference."
