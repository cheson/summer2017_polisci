Gov. Ricketts Comments on the EPA's Failure to Keep the RFS Promise
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Dec. 1, 2015
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) release of the final Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) rule.
"Today, the EPA made formal a policy decision that is already negatively impacting future investment in Nebraska's biofuels industry. By lowering the Renewable Fuels Standard figures committed to in legislation almost a decade ago, the EPA has broken a promise to Americans and created an uncertainty that investors will not soon forget.
"The decision to lower the RFS will hamper investment in existing businesses, as well as in research and development of the next generation of biofuels. In Nebraska, we've already seen the impact. News of the plan to decrease the RFS earlier this year caused a major biofuels company operating in Nebraska to cool a proposed expansion project.
"The figures released today are an improvement on what the EPA proposed earlier this year, but an olive branch won't provide the certainty that is needed for ongoing development in the biofuels sector in Nebraska."
