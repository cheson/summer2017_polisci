Agriculture is the backbone of our state and its economy. I want to serve Nebraska's current and long-term agricultural interests by expanding opportunities for Nebraska farmers and ranchers; increasing the production of bio-fuels and other bio-based products; opening new global markets; helping to promote free and fair trade for Nebraska products; trimming the regulatory burdens placed on producers; working for more abundant and affordable sources of domestic energy; and sustaining a fiscally sensible safety net for our farmers and ranchers.
In the United States Senate, I would work to serve on the Agriculture Committee to ensure Nebraska's interests in agriculture policy receive full consideration.
