Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following news that the Legislature's Appropriations Committee had advanced adjustments to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 budget.
"Thanks to the swift action of Chairman John Stinner and his committee on my budget adjustment recommendations, the Legislature is progressing towards cutting the current year's budget to address the downturn in revenue. As the committee moves to consideration of the next biennial budget, I urge them to keep the focus on constraining spending and balancing the budget without raising taxes."
In addition to the budget adjustments advanced by the Appropriations Committee, the Governor has also proposed his next two-year budget recommendations for FY2018-2019, which are currently under consideration by the committee.
