Today, Governor Pete Ricketts was joined by Nebraska law enforcement and public safety officials to promote safe travel and the "Click It or Ticket' initiative. This is the 11th year the state has participated in the national safety campaign, which began May 18th and runs through May 31st.
"We are quickly approaching a period of increased travel on Nebraska roadways during the busy summer months," said Governor Ricketts. "As Memorial Day weekend approaches, I encourage drivers and passengers to buckle up."
So far in 2015, the state has recorded 86 traffic fatalities, up from 75 fatalities compared to the same period one year ago. Of the 70 occupants who died in motor vehicle crashes on Nebraska roadways, 55 of them were not wearing seat belts.
"Federal highway safety grant funding provides us the ability to put additional troopers, deputies, and officers on Nebraska roadways over this very busy two week period," said Col. Bradley Rice, Superintendent of the Nebraska State Patrol. "By reminding drivers of the need for voluntary compliance with all traffic safety laws, we hope to positively influence safe driver behavior throughout the summer travel season."
In addition to the Nebraska State Patrol, the "Click It or Ticket' enforcement mobilization involves 30 county sheriff's offices and 19 community police departments from across the state. The effort provides more than 7,500 hours of additional traffic enforcement, emphasizing the use of seat belts and proper child restraints.
Road construction projects typically increase during the summer months. Drivers are encouraged to pay extra attention in work zones and to remember that fines for infractions double when workers are present.
