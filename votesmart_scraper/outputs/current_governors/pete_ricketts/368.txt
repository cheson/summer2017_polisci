August 01, 2006 - Ricketts Calls on U.S. Senate to Increase Energy Independence
Last month, the House of Representatives passed legislation to allow drilling off the Eastern and Western coasts of the United States. Today, the Senate is considering a similar, but more limited, bill to allow offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
"It is my hope that the Senate will pass The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act in order to increase access to energy supplies and reduce our reliance on foreign imports," said Pete Ricketts. "The outdated federal laws that limit exploration of energy supplies along the Outer Continental Shelf increase our reliance on foreign energy sources. "
Ricketts said, "This is not simply an energy supply issue. It is also an employment issue. Increased prices for natural gas in the United States lead U.S. companies to lose market share to foreign competitors with cheaper access to energy. This in turn results in layoffs and decreased employment among Americans with good-paying jobs. Additionally, high energy prices impose an additional, hidden tax on U.S. farmers by increasing the cost of fertilizer."
"Passing legislation to increase offshore drilling and exploration in the Gulf of Mexico is a good first step in increasing America's energy independence and reducing costs for farmers and American consumers. For the good of our country, I call upon the U.S. Senate to pass The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act."
