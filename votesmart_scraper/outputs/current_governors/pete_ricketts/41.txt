Gov. Ricketts Comments on LB447 Advancement
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: March 8, 2017
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following a vote by the Legislature to advance LB447, a bill by Senator Ernie Chambers to eliminate mandatory minimums for certain crimes.
"Removing mandatory minimums, even for drug felons, would soften Nebraska's protections for public safety. I urge the Legislature to reconsider its decision to advance LB447, and to maintain these protections supported by our law enforcement community."
