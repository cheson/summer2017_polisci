Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following the apprehension of Timothy Clausen, 52, one of two inmates who escaped Friday, June 10, 2016 from the Lincoln Correctional Center. The other escapee Armon Dixon, 37, was captured on Saturday in northeast Lincoln.
"Thanks to the collaboration of the Nebraska State Patrol, the U.S. Marshal's Service, Omaha Police Department, Lincoln Police Department, Douglas County Sheriff's Office, Lancaster County Sheriff's Office, University of Nebraska Police Department, the Metro Fugitive Task Force, and courageous citizens, both dangerous fugitive convicts have been successfully apprehended.
