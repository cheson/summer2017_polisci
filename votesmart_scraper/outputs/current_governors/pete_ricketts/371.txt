Ricketts: "Nelson Ad Not The Whole Story"
Points to Nelson's low ratings from tax groups
Omaha, NE - Pete Ricketts, Republican for U.S. Senate, said today that Senator Ben Nelson was not being completely honest with Nebraskans. In television ads paid for by the Democrat Party, Nelson is trying to run as a fiscal conservative - but he's not.
Nelson exploits the fact that he voted for President Bush's tax cuts in 2003. He fails to mention that he voted for the cuts only after he voted with liberal Democrats like Ted Kennedy and Hillary Clinton 23 times to reduce or delay the tax cuts. Nebraskans cannot count on Nelson to be an honest advocate for low taxes, limited government, and traditional values.
As a U.S. Senator, Nelson earned failing grades from national tax organizations. Americans for Tax Reform gave Nelson a 52% rating; the National Taxpayers Union gave Nelson a 41%. In fact, Nelson ranks dead last in the Nebraska delegation when it comes to supporting tax relief.
"It's the fundamental difference between Democrats and Republicans. Senate Democrats believe in higher taxes and bigger government and vow to pursue that agenda if they take control of the Senate," Ricketts said. "We need conservative change in the Senate, not a Democrat like Ben Nelson who has demonstrated that he will cast a partisan Democrat vote when it comes to raising taxes."
In a Senate race that could determine control of the U.S. Senate, Ricketts will support the party known for its commitment to cutting taxes. Ricketts is a lifelong Republican, who will work to make President Bush's tax cuts permanent, end the death tax, reduce the capital gains tax, and reform the tax system.
