Nelson Sides With Big Tobacco, One of the top 5 Senate recipients of tobacco money
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids' September 20, 2006 report listed Ben Nelson as one of the top 5 Senate recipients of tobacco industry funds currently running for re-election. Nelson and his Political Action Committee, NELPAC, have accepted over $30,000 in contributions from the tobacco industry.
U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler ruled that major cigarette companies are guilty of deceiving the public about the dangers of smoking and marketing to children, and a recent study by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that the tobacco industry significantly increased the levels of nicotine between 1998 and 2004.
"Given the recent court ruling and academic study, as well as the fact that over 20 percent of Nebraska high school students smoke, it would appear that this is another example of Ben Nelson's misplaced priorities. We need change in Washington," said Republican U.S. Senate Nominee Pete Ricketts.
