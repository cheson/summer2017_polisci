Ricketts Praises Senate for Passing Internet Gambling Ban, Applauds Nebraska House Delegation for its Leadership
Early yesterday morning, the United States Senate approved the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act as part of legislation to protect our nation's ports. The internet gambling ban requires the U.S. Treasury Department to implement regulations that prohibit the approval of any currency transaction for the purposes of betting or wagering. This effectively cuts off the use of any form of payment used by internet gamblers.
"I am pleased that the Senate followed the lead set by the Nebraska House Delegation and the House of Representatives on this important issue," Ricketts said. "Congressmen Osborne, Fortenberry and Terry were strong supporters of this ban from the beginning, and their early leadership helped propel the ban to passage in the House of Representatives in July.
"Internet gambling is more insidious than even casino gambling. It can be done from home at any time of day or night, increasing the chances of addiction and helping addicts hide their addiction from their families. Additionally, these internet gambling sites are located overseas, leaving our society with all of the social ills of gambling without even the tax revenues to combat them," Ricketts said.
