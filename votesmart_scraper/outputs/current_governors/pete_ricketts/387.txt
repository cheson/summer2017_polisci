We need an immigration policy that secures our borders and helps protect our nation from the threat of terrorism. Securing America's borders and enforcing immigration laws are two of the most basic obligations of the federal government. Over ten million illegal immigrants in the U. S. should be a concern to all of us. I do not support amnesty for illegal immigrants.
