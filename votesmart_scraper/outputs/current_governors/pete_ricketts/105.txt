Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following approval of repairs for the runway at Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue. Over the past several months, the Governor and Nebraska's congressional delegation have worked together through the Offutt Air Force Base Task Force to coordinate efforts to grow the base and provide ongoing oversight for runway repair.
"Offutt Air Force Base is one of our state's largest employers, and it is key to growing Nebraska," said Governor Ricketts. "This is a big win for the greater Omaha area and all of Nebraska. The Air Force's decision to approve funding for much-needed repairs to the runway will ensure that the base continues to help grow our state. I look forward to working with the task force to continue to expand missions at Offutt and proactively pursue new opportunities for the base."
Last year, Congressman Jeff Fortenberry founded the Offutt Air Force Base Task Force to conduct oversight of the runway replacement process. Governor Pete Ricketts, Congressman Adrian Smith, and Congressman Brad Ashford assisted Fortenberry in leading the task force.
