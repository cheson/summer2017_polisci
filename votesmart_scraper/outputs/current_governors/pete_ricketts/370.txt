Ricketts Supports Constitutional Amendment To Protect The American Flag
Issue would not come up under Democrat Senate
Omaha, NE - As the U.S. Senate prepares to vote on the Constitutional Amendment to protect the American Flag, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Pete Ricketts announced his solid support for the Amendment.
"The American Flag is not just a symbol," Ricketts said. "It is a sacred part of America. It is what American soldiers have fought and died for. It should be protected and preserved."
Pete Ricketts will support a Constitutional Amendment to protect the American Flag as a U.S. Senator, but is concerned that a Democrat-controlled Senate would not allow a vote on it.
"Many people would allow the American flag to be burned under the premise of protecting free speech," Ricketts said. "I believe in freedom of speech. But the American Flag holds a unique position for our nation - it unites us, and we value that. It must be protected."
