Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Oct. 28, 2016
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following a meeting of the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board. At today's meeting, the board revised revenue projections for the State of Nebraska downward for the current fiscal year, and set the forecast for the next biennium.
"Today's downward revision for this fiscal year is consistent with the trajectory set by the revenue gap in the first quarter of this fiscal year, and affirms the need to cut the budget. I will continue to work with state agencies to constrain spending and prepare budget cuts for the session that begins in January."
