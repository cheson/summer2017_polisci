Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and Chief Information Officer (CIO) Ed Toner announced over $5.3 million in savings from initial reforms in the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). Cost savings have been realized through a variety of initiatives that eliminate waste and centralize information technology services for a variety of state and local government agencies across Nebraska.
These initiatives will result in $5,321,050 in savings realized over the next 10 years. A chart providing a full breakdown of the cost savings is attached.
"In this first year of my administration, we have focused on running government more like a business," said Governor Ricketts. "Thanks to Ed's leadership, we are already successfully realizing savings for the taxpayers of Nebraska, and we will continue to look for new opportunities across state government to reduce waste and to cut bureaucratic red tape."
