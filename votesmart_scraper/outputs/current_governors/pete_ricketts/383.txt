Fiscal discipline would be one of my top priorities in the United States Senate. We must strengthen America's economic engine by creating and maintaining an environment where entrepreneurs and small businesses can succeed. Making tax cuts permanent, repealing the death tax and eliminating regulatory barriers is the best way to grow our economy. There will always be more good ideas than funding for those ideas. Leadership requires making tough decisions.
Our current national debt is over $8 trillion. As a businessman, I worked to balance budgets by watching the bottom line and keeping a lid on spending. I will use these same skills in the Senate and get into the details of cutting spending and help balance the budget. The best way to help reduce the national debt is to cut taxes and grow our economy.
