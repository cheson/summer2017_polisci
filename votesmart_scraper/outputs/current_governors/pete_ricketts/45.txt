Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement after signing LB22, a bill to enact cuts to the current Fiscal Year 2017 budget.
"I appreciate the Legislature's swift action on LB22. This bill is an important first step towards addressing the gap between current appropriations and revenues. There is still more work to do. I look forward to working with the Appropriations Committee as they consider my recommendations for the next two-year budget. We must put the taxpayer before special interests by balancing the budget without raising taxes."
