Nebraska's Constitutional Officers Comment on NSAA District Vote
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts

Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts, Lt. Governor Mike Foley, State Treasurer Don Stenberg, and Secretary of State John Gale issued a joint statement following a vote by leadership of the Nebraska School Activities Association (NSAA) - District 6 affirming that students participate in athletics according to their sex at birth.
"We commend the Nebraska School Activities Association - District 6 for their vote to determine NSAA eligibility on the basis of gender at birth. All persons deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and all students deserve fairness, safety, and privacy.
"In the coming week, the rest of the NSAA districts will consider and vote on participation policies for transgender high school students. These policies will determine if and how a biological male can participate as a female, and vice versa, for athletics. It will also establish the legal basis for related issues like locker and restroom use, and also plays into matters of religious liberty.
"For purposes of fairness and safety for all students, we encourage the remaining high school governing bodies to follow the example of NSAA - District 6 and adopt the current NSAA practice that students participate according to their sex at birth."
Additional NSAA districts votes on this issue are anticipated to take place next week.
