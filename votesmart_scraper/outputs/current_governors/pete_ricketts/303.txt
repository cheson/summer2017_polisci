Today, Governor Pete Ricketts commented on Nebraska's success with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling regarding Republican River water usage. The Court has ordered Nebraska to pay $5.5 million to Kansas, significantly less than the $80 million originally asked.
"Today is a good day for Nebraska," said Governor Pete Ricketts. "I am pleased to see that the court has made a reasonable decision. I look forward to working with the governors of Kansas and Colorado to move forward."
"This is a win for Nebraska's farmers and ranchers," said Acting Director Jim Schneider. "By lessening Nebraska's compliance burden, this ruling will in effect lessen Nebraska's need to regulate for compliance. Nebraska's water users should be very pleased."
Today's ruling upholds the Special Master's ruling from November 2013. The dispute centers on a 1943 compact allocating 49 percent of the river's water to Nebraska, 40 percent to Kansas and 11 percent to Colorado.
