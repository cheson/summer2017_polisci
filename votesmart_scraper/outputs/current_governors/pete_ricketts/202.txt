Gov. Ricketts' Statement on ConAgra's Announcement
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts

Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Gov. Pete Ricketts issued a statement following ConAgra's announcement that they would restructure their operations and move their world headquarters from Omaha to Chicago.
"During our conversations over the past several weeks, ConAgra's CEO Sean Connolly told me that any changes made in Nebraska would be a part of a larger restructuring of the company to improve their operations.
"While I regret ConAgra's decision, it is a reminder why we must continually look for new ways to ensure our tax rates and incentive programs remain competitive, and it is also why I have dedicated two trade missions to highlighting investment opportunities in our state.
"As ConAgra continues to plan for their future, we will continue to support the 1,200 ConAgra jobs that will remain in Omaha as their leadership works to turn the company around. The Governor's Office and the Nebraska Department of Labor stand ready to assist Nebraskans seeking reemployment due to ConAgra's restructuring."
