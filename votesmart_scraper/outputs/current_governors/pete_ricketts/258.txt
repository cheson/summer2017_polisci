Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued the following statement in observance of Memorial Day:
"This Memorial Day, Nebraskans across our state will pause to commemorate those who lost their lives in service to our country. The recent deaths of two Nebraskans who served selflessly and honorably makes this year's Memorial Day holiday especially poignant. Susanne and I encourage all Nebraskans to honor and remember the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives to protect our freedoms."
On Memorial Day, Governor Ricketts will attend the 55th Wing Chapel Memorial Day Ceremony at the Offutt Air Force Base Cemetery in Bellevue. He will also deliver remarks at a Memorial Day Ceremony in Memorial Park in Omaha.
