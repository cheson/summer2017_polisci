Nebraska's Population Hits 1.9 Million for the First Time
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Dec. 20, 2016
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Ricketts hailed the news that Nebraska's population grew by over 13,000. During the past year, Nebraska grew at a faster rate than neighboring states including Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Wyoming.
"This growth means more people than ever realize Nebraska is the best place in the world to live, work, and raise a family. Growing Nebraska also means that the state is on track to retain all three of our state's critically important congressional seats in the House of Representatives, which help ensure voices across Nebraska are heard in Washington, D.C. To continue this momentum, we must work together to lower taxes for working families, create a more effective state government, and build a better regulatory climate for job creators."
