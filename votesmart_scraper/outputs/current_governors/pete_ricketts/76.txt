Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Sept. 21, 2016
Location: Lincoln, KS

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following news that China has plans to resume imports of beef from the United States. China had previously banned importation of American beef in 2003.
"This is great news for Nebraska's farmers and ranchers. The reopening of the beef trade with China will have huge potential to help grow Nebraska and help Nebraska's farm and ranch families thrive in the years to come.
"This announcement is the product of tireless work from numerous partners. During my visit to China last year, I urged Chinese government officials to reopen the beef trade with the United States because of the mutually beneficial advantages it would present to both countries. I look forward to promoting Nebraska beef during my trade mission to China this fall."
