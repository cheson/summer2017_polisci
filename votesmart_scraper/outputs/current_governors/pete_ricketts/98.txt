Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts, the Nebraska Department of Labor (NDOL), and the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) announced Nebraska's non-farm job count averaged 1 million in 2015 for the first time ever. At a news conference this morning, the Governor and state agency directors were joined by business leaders to highlight the milestone, and lay out key principles and strategies for continued economic growth.
"Nebraska's diverse group of industries helped drive this historic employment level in our state," said Governor Pete Ricketts. "This didn't happen overnight and it came through a lot of hard work and leadership from many across the state. As we continue to work together to grow Nebraska, my administration is focused on supporting the efforts of job creators by lowering the tax burden, controlling spending, and making government more customer-friendly so we can get government out of the way."
At the news conference, Governor Ricketts noted that Nebraska had earned high marks for its business-friendly climate over the last year from respected organizations. These rankings include:
3rd Best State for Business (Forbes 2015)
7th America's Top States for Business (CNBC 2015)

On July 12, 2016, Governor Ricketts and DED will host the first annual Governor's Summit on Economic Development. The summit will focus on a study by SRI International of the state's existing economic development programs. Interested individuals can learn more about the upcoming summit here.
