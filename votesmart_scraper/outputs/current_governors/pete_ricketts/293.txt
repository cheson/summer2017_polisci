Gov. Ricketts Reacts to Gas Tax Hike Advancement
Press Release

Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts reacted to the Legislature's decision to advance LB610, a proposal that would increase Nebraska's gas tax.

"As I travel the state, Nebraskans tell me that they want to see tax relief, not tax increases. I am exceptionally disappointed to learn that members of the Legislature voted to advance a hike in Nebraska's gas tax this morning. Unfortunately, the Legislature has yet to debate meaningful tax relief this session. Increasing taxes on hardworking Nebraskans is the wrong direction. Our priority and focus should be meaningful property tax relief this year. I applaud the senators that did take a stand against increasing the gas tax and I hope that their colleagues will join them in voting against raising this tax during the next round of debate."
