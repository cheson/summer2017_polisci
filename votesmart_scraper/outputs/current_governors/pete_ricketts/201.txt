Today, Governor Pete Ricketts is traveling the state to highlight Manufacturing Day and to celebrate Nebraska's second largest industry. The statewide tour includes Nucor Steel in Norfolk, Sargent Pipe Company in Broken Bow, and Risk Industries in Kimball. The Nebraska State Chamber of Commerce and industry leaders are joining the Governor at each stop.
"As Nebraska's second largest industry, manufacturing provides almost 100,000 quality jobs to people all across our state," said Governor Pete Ricketts. "To Grow Nebraska, we must continue to grow manufacturing by making our tax system more competitive, connecting manufacturers with talent pipelines, cutting red tape, and recruiting additional operations to our state."
