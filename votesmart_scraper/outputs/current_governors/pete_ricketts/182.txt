Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and Speaker Galen Hadley announced that the Nebraska Department of Revenue is mailing over 700,000 tax relief notices to Nebraska property owners. The postcards highlight the property tax relief included in the Governor's budget and approved by the Legislature earlier this year.
During this year's legislative session, the Governor and the Unicameral worked together to deliver $408 million in property tax relief to Nebraska property owners through the Property Tax Credit Relief Fund over the next two years. The Property Tax Credit Relief Fund, also known as the Real Property Tax Relief Fund, was established in 2007 to provide direct property tax relief from the state to property owners.
"As I travel the state, property tax relief is the number one priority on the minds of Nebraskans," said Governor Ricketts. "This year, the Legislature and I worked together diligently to prioritize property tax relief. These tax relief notices are a sign of good progress. There is, however, more work to be done, and my administration will continue to prioritize property tax relief in the upcoming session."
