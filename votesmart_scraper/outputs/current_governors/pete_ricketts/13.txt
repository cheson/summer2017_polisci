Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: May 17, 2017
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following a recommendation by the Legislature's Appropriations Committee to override $32.7 million of the Governor's line-item vetoes.
"I urge the full Legislature to sustain these thoughtful and measured vetoes to protect Nebraska taxpayers. A vote to sustain the vetoes is a vote to put the state on firm financial footing. A vote to override the vetoes places the state on shaky ground."
