Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) CEO Courtney Phillips announced that DHHS will begin monthly publication of key performance metrics used to track improvements in how services are delivered through ACCESSNebraska.
These metrics include Customer Service Center call times, Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly called food stamps) payment accuracy rate, Medicaid eligibility accuracy, as well as the time it takes to process applications for Medicaid and SNAP. The metrics are public and will be updated monthly on the agency's website at www.accessnebraska.ne.gov.
"As I've said previously, one of the most important things we do in government is to take care of our most vulnerable citizens," said Governor Ricketts. "Accountability begins with transparency. These metrics will serve as an important tool for the public to track our performance and progress as we work to improve the services on which many Nebraskans rely."
"We recognize that citizens have faced challenges using ACCESSNebraska," said Courtney Phillips, CEO of the Department of Health and Human Services. "I've already spent time with some of the employees who do this work and I know they take this responsibility seriously. Their dedication and commitment to improvement is clear. These metrics will help demonstrate our commitment to transparency and allow the public to track our progress, which has already begun." Phillips began her appointment as CEO April 2.
