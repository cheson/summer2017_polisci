Gov. Ricketts Comments on Trans-Pacific Partnership Withdrawal
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Jan. 24, 2017
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following news that President Donald J. Trump had signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
"TPP would have helped grow Nebraska. The trade deal would have expanded markets for Nebraska's commodities, increasing our state's ag cash receipts by a projected $378 million a year. President Trump has pledged to take a new approach to trade negotiations through bilateral trade agreements. I urge him to take swift action in the first 100 days of his administration to substantially expand markets for ag exports."
