Nebraskans Hail Gov. Ricketts' Transportation Initiative as "Historic"
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: April 18, 2016
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts signed LB960, also known as the Transportation Innovation Act (TIA), at a signing ceremony where he was joined by numerous Nebraskans who helped build support for the initiative over the past several months. The TIA targets $450 million towards accelerated expressway construction, county bridge repairs, and investments in infrastructure projects which will help Grow Nebraska. This legislation was one of the Governor's top priorities for the 2016 legislative session, and was passed with overwhelming support from the Legislature.
The Transportation Innovation Act was developed by the Governor's Office in conjunction with the Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) and the Legislature's Transportation and Telecommunications Committee, which held hearings on potential infrastructure proposals during the interim last summer and fall.
"Across Nebraska, the Transportation Innovation Act will help to build the infrastructure that Nebraskans use to see their families, drive to work, and get to school every day," said Governor Ricketts. "Agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, our state's three largest industries, depend on a 21st-century infrastructure to grow and expand. Accelerating work on our expressway systems and investing in projects that help grow and expand businesses, will help kick-start economic growth in these areas.
"I appreciate the work and support of the numerous legislative leaders and Nebraskans who worked on this legislation from concept to final passage and enactment. These investments will fund key infrastructure priorities for Nebraska for years to come."
