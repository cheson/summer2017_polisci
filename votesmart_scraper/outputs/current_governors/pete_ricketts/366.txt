Ricketts Says Drought Assistance Funding a Good Start
Omaha, Neb. - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns yesterday announced $780 million in drought assistance for affected farmers and ranchers. This includes a new $50 million program for livestock producers affected by drought, directs $30 million in unused conservation funds towards drought aid, and accelerates approximately $700 million in counter-cyclical payments.
Pete Ricketts said "The Nebraska Congressional Delegation has been working hard to get emergency drought assistance for Nebraska and other afflicted states. I applaud their efforts and Secretary Johanns' leadership on this important issue."
"This federal assistance is a good start for what USDA should be doing to help farmers and ranchers. The delay in this funding calls attention to the need to include a strong disaster assistance title in the 2007 Farm Bill. Creating a comprehensive drought and disaster mitigation title will minimize the amount of time farmers and ranchers have to wait to receive assistance, and will reduce future threats to our rural areas and allow our farmers and ranchers to plan."
"Recent drought, fires and the hurricane season underscore the need for the federal government to begin budgeting for emergencies in a responsible manner instead of addressing each emergency on an ad-hoc basis. By budgeting for emergencies and natural disasters, which currently are excluded from the official federal budget, Congress would have a true sense of actual government spending. I will work to ensure that the federal government includes disaster budgeting in its annual spending blueprints."
