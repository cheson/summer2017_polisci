Eighty current and former state senators today endorsed Pete Ricketts for governor.
"I learned in business that you can't get much done if you don't have strong relationships with those you're working with," Ricketts said. "It's been a priority for me to create friendships and working relationships with legislators across the state. I look forward to working with the entire Legislature to bring about responsible reform and new growth in our state."
"Pete has the right background to move our state forward," said Sen. Dave Bloomfield of Hoskins. "He knows how to create long-term plans, make investments, and create jobs. He'll help Nebraska grow and reach its full potential."
"I'm excited about working with Pete," said Sen. Colby Coash of Lincoln. "He's already taken special steps to build relationships within the Legislature, and has demonstrated a commitment to open communication and collaboration with lawmakers."
"I am very pleased that Pete has made the time to build relationships with state senators," said Sen. Galen Hadley of Kearney. "He understands that good outcomes require collaborative leadership and partnerships. I look forward to working with him."
"I trust Pete to be a great leader for Nebraska," said Sen. Beau McCoy of Elkhorn. "He has the executive experience to achieve needed reforms within state government and help our state grow."
"Pete will be a great governor for all of Nebraska, rural and urban," said Sen. Ken Schilz of Ogallala. "He's a tireless worker, he understands Nebraska families and communities, and he'll dedicate himself to making state government work better for all Nebraskans."
