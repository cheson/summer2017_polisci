Pete understands that agriculture is the backbone of Nebraska's economy. With 95% of the world's population living outside our country's borders, Pete will seek to expand markets through trade missions for Nebraska's agriculture and manufacturing exports. He will work to grow value-added agriculture and fight to keep the tax burden low.
