Pete Ricketts releases plan to Strengthen Nebraska's Rural Economy
Omaha, NE - Pete Ricketts has released his plan to Strengthen Nebraska's Rural Economy. "Agriculture is not just farming. It's a way of life and the backbone of our state's economy. That is why we must work to preserve the agricultural way of life and build new opportunities to strengthen it. To do this we must focus on infrastructure and economic viability. The next farm bill must allocate more resources toward sustaining our Nebraska communities. We must seize the opportunity to reverse out-mitigation trends by building up small businesses and communities, renewable fuels, affordable and accessible rural healthcare, and rural education opportunities," Ricketts said.
Highlights of Pete's plan include:
 Risk Management Tools including Comprehensive Crop and Livestock Insurance and Agriculture Savings Accounts that allow farmers to save their own money tax free with federal matching funds.
 Enacting Meaningful Payment Limitations. Ten percent of farms receive over 70% of all farm payments. Limiting payments to $250,000 per year would produce federal savings of $1 billion over ten years that could be spent on further development of America's rural economy.
 Add a Drought and Disaster Title to the Farm Bill
 Keeping Young People in Rural America by providing substantial incentives to beginning farmers so more people can stay on the farm and in rural communities.
 Ending the Death Tax
 Increasing Rural Economic Development
 Improving Rural Healthcare Access
 Supporting Renewable Energy
 Building Rural Transportation Infrastructure
