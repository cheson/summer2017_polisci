Today, Governor Pete Ricketts reacted to the decision by senators to advance LB268, Senator Ernie Chambers' plan to repeal the death penalty in Nebraska.
"Today's vote for Senator Chambers' plan to repeal the death penalty is out of step with Nebraskans who tell me that they believe the death penalty remains an important tool for public safety," said Governor Ricketts. "If this legislation comes to my desk, I will veto it. I urge senators to reconsider their decision and to stand with law enforcement who need all the tools we can give them to protect public safety."
