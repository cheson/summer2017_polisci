Today, Governor Pete Ricketts signed the next biennial budget, claiming victory for Nebraska taxpayers. In his budget recommendation to the Legislature, the Governor sought a reduction in the growth of spending by nearly 50% and included $400 million for the Property Tax Credit Relief Fund. The Legislature met both recommendations. After signing the budget, the Governor made the following statement:
"This is a great day for my administration, the Unicameral, and most importantly Nebraska citizens. My top two priorities for this session were to cut the growth of government spending and to provide tax relief to Nebraska families," Gov. Ricketts said. "I want to congratulate lawmakers for working with my administration to make this a reality. We will provide Nebraska taxpayers with $408 million in property tax relief while cutting the rate of spending growth, and we are still funding essential state government services for the people of this state."
