Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) showcased the improved performance of ACCESSNebraska. These improvements follow the appointment of a new leadership team to lead DHHS and a commitment by the Governor's Office to move the public benefits system forward after hearing about the challenges it faced from Nebraskans across the state.
"One of our state's most important duties is to help our most vulnerable citizens," said Governor Ricketts. "Because of this, finding ways to make government customer friendly is one of the key focuses of my administration. Reforming ACCESSNebraska is a step in the right direction for Nebraskans who depend on the services that the system provides."
