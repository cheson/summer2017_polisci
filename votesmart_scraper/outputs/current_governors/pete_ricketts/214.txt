Location: Hampton, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts announced that Hamilton County has become the newest county in the state to become designated as a Livestock Friendly County (LFC) through a program administered by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA).
"The livestock industry in Nebraska generates more than half of the total on-farm receipts of our state's number one industry, agriculture," said Gov. Ricketts. "That's why is so important that counties like Hamilton demonstrate they want to promote the expansion of current livestock operations and establish new businesses in their area. It not only supports and grows the local economy, but it also Grows Nebraska as a whole."
