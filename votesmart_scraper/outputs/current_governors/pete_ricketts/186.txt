Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Dec. 7, 2015
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement regarding capital punishment:
"In November 2016, Nebraska voters will determine the future of capital punishment in our state at the ballot box. To give deference to the vote of the people, my administration will wait to carry out capital punishment sentences or make additional efforts to acquire drugs until the people of our state decide this issue.
"Over the last several weeks, I have stepped up conversations with the Attorney General and the Corrections Director regarding a comprehensive review of the capital punishment protocols used in other states. My administration will continue to review potential protocol changes."
