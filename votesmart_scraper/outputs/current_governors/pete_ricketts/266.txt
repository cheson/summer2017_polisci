Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following a vote by the Legislature to hike Nebraska's gas tax.
"The Legislature's decision to raise the gas tax hurts hardworking Nebraskans who can least afford a tax hike," said Governor Ricketts. "When I travel the state, Nebraskans tell me that they need tax relief, not tax increases. Our state already has the 13th highest property taxes, the 15th highest income taxes, and this tax hike makes our gas tax rate the 16th highest in the nation. This tax increase will not only hurt Nebraska's hardworking families, but it will only make it more difficult to grow Nebraska because of our state's burdensome tax climate."
Governor Ricketts also thanked the senators who voted to sustain his veto.
