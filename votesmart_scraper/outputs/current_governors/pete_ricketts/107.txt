Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and Nebraska State Patrol (NSP) Col. Brad Rice urged Nebraskans to remain vigilant and cautious as dangerous convict Timothy Clausen remains at large. Clausen, 52, is one of two inmates who escaped Friday, June 10, 2016 from the Lincoln Correctional Center. The other escapee Armon Dixon, 37, was captured over the weekend just after 2:00 pm, Saturday in northeast Lincoln.
"Protecting the safety of the people of Nebraska is our number one priority," said Governor Ricketts. "Thank you to the Nebraska State Patrol and all our federal and local law enforcement partners who assisted this weekend and continue to work to apprehend the remaining fugitive. We urge Nebraskans to remain vigilant and to report any information about the whereabouts of Timothy Clausen to law enforcement by calling 911."
Based on investigative leads, law enforcement officers from multiple jurisdictions continue to focus their search for Clausen in and around the Omaha area. Clausen is described as an African-American male, 5'8", 160 lbs. with brown hair and brown eyes. He does not have any distinguishing marks or tattoos and could be wearing his hair in cornrows or pulled back.
"We continue to ask the public to remain vigilant, and to be aware of their surroundings," NSP Col. Brad Rice. "We are asking anyone who believes they may have seen Timothy Clausen or has any information that could lead to his capture to call 911. Multiple agencies from multiple jurisdictions in coordination with the U.S. Marshal's Office continue to develop information and follow leads. Nebraska law enforcement are dedicating all resources to getting this dangerous fugitive back behind bars."
