By: Pete Ricketts
Date: March 31, 2015
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts launched a new website with a fresh look and new ways to connect with his office and state government.

Visitors to the website are greeted by a news feed featuring the Governor's latest press releases and columns along with social media feeds providing the latest updates from the Governor's Twitter and Facebook accounts.

Under the Constituent Services tab, users can write the governor, apply for appointment to a board and commission, or request a greeting from the Governor among other services offered through the website.

"This new website will help connect Nebraskans from Harrison to Humboldt with my office," said Governor Pete Ricketts. "Transparency and accessibility are key principles of my administration, and I know that these online services will be a tool to better serve the people of our state."

The Governor's new website features design and creative work from Nebraska Interactive, a subsidiary of NIC. The State of Nebraska and Nebraska Interactive work together in a public-private partnership to develop and host numerous state government online services and websites. These services are provided on a self-funded basis without using appropriated state budget funds.
