Veterans have fought and died so that we may enjoy the freedom and security we have today. It is important that we recognize these sacrifices by providing veterans quality healthcare.
I support the G.I. bill providing service men and women funding for college education.
Many of the soldiers fighting the War on Terrorism left private sector jobs to serve. I believe service members should be able to return to their previous jobs once their service is completed. We should honor our veterans by providing them with necessary benefits and recognize their sacrifice and service to our country.
