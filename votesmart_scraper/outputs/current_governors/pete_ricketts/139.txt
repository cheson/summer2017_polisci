Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and Senator Merv Riepe highlighted how the Direct Primary Care Agreement Act will expand access to healthcare.
"I applaud Senator Riepe for championing this legislation, which will expand access to healthcare in our state and make it easier for Nebraskans to establish a relationship with primary care doctors," said Governor Ricketts. "The Direct Primary Care Agreement Act provides Nebraskans with an innovative tool to navigate our healthcare system, which has become even more complex because of President Obama's failed healthcare law."
