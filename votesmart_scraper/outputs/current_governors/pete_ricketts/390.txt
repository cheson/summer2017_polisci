I am a product of our Nebraska public school system and I understand the importance of education to society, our economy and our standing in the world. Every child in America should have the opportunity to receive an excellent education. Our education system should allow academic and curriculum decisions to be made at the local level, actively engage parents in the learning process, and help ensure that schools remain free of drugs, alcohol and violence. We must measure student achievement to ensure our children are learning. Those measurements should be decided by our local school boards, our principals, teachers and parents. As the father of three young children, I know nothing is more important than the future of our children.
