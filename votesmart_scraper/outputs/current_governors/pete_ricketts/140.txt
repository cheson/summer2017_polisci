Statement

Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts announced the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will develop a Behavioral Health System of Care in response to the needs of children and youth who have a serious emotional disorder. He was joined by DHHS CEO Courtney Phillips, DHHS Behavioral Health Division Director Sheri Dawson, and Nebraska Children and Families Foundation CEO Mary Jo Pankoke.
"There is no question it can be confusing and oftentimes challenging for families to access behavioral health services for their children," said Governor Ricketts. "With the new System of Care, DHHS and its partners will deliver services in a more effective and customer-oriented manner. This new delivery method will eliminate the need for families to navigate multiple systems to find services to meet the needs of their children."
The Behavioral Health System of Care for Children and Youth model integrates services by connecting and coordinating the work of state child-serving agencies, non-profits, local government organizations, behavioral health care providers, families, and patient advocates. This new philosophy will transform Nebraska's behavioral health system, abandoning old approaches marked by fragmented service delivery and high rates of out-of-community placements.
"This is a proven model that has helped many states transform how they deliver services," said DHHS CEO Phillips. "It is providing meaningful benefits and measureable, positive outcomes for children, youth, and families."
