Today, Governor Ricketts and the Nebraska delegation met with executives from the Kewpie Corporation, whose subsidiary is Henningsen Foods, which has investments in Omaha, Norfolk, David City, and Ravenna. The Governor thanked them for their contributions and assured them that they would continue to have support from the State of Nebraska.
"Japan is Nebraska's largest foreign investor, and it is important that Nebraska continues to grow this relationship," said Gov. Ricketts. "This week's activities have allowed us to discuss how we can build on existing relationships, and to thank some of the numerous businesses who invest in our state."
