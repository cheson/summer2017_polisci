Gov. Ricketts: "Nebraska's Farmers and Ranchers Need Property Tax Relief Now"
Statement

Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Ricketts reacted to the Revenue Committee's decision not to advance a key property tax relief measure:
"I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Gloor and the Revenue Committee as they consider options available to the Unicameral to provide Nebraskans with property tax relief. Nebraska's farmers and ranchers need and deserve meaningful property tax relief because taxes on agricultural land have dramatically increased in recent years. This morning's decision by the Revenue Committee not to advance legislation to reduce ag land valuation from 75 percent to 65 percent for taxation purposes is disappointing because this measure is a key component of providing meaningful property tax relief this year. I urge the Revenue Committee to reconsider and move this proposal forward."
