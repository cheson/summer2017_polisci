Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Aug. 3, 2015
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following President Barack Obama's announcement of the final rule for his Clean Power Plan.
"All Nebraskans want clean air, and we have already taken steps in our state to expand access to cleaner and renewable sources of energy. I am concerned that the Clean Power Plan is yet another example of the EPA handing down burdensome regulation that will impose unnecessary costs on the family budgets of hardworking Nebraskans. My administration will be examining these impacts before making a decision about proceeding with any potential state plan for Nebraska."
