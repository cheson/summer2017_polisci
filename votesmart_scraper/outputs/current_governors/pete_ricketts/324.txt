Pete Ricketts, the GOP nominee for governor, announced today that his campaign has established county organizations, led by designated county chairs, in each of Nebraska's 93 counties.
"A priority of this campaign has been spending time with Nebraskans in each corner of our state," Ricketts said. "A priority of my administration will be working to bring us together as one, bridging the gap between urban and rural and east and west."
"This campaign won't be won on the airwaves; it'll be won in cafes, libraries, and town halls within communities from Harrison to Falls City. So far, we've traveled 51,000 miles. We've developed lasting relationships with people who care deeply about making the Good Life better and our communities stronger. I'm very pleased to have the help and support of committed individuals in every one of our 93 counties."
