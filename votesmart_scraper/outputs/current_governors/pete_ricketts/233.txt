Date: July 20, 2015
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts authorized Nebraska National Guard Adjutant General Major General Daryl Bohac to arm additional military personnel in the wake of last week's shooting that killed five U.S. military personnel in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Currently, military personnel are armed at some Nebraska installations. Today's action authorizes the Adjutant General to arm personnel where necessary at National Guard installations, including recruiting offices.
"Susanne and I send our condolences to the families who lost their loved ones in last week's tragic shooting in Tennessee. This authorization extends additional protections to our servicemen and women who need every resource we can provide them to defend themselves and our National Guard installations."
"As a part of our efforts to constantly evaluate our state's security measures, the Nebraska National Guard continues to look at what we might do differently, so that our state takes appropriate steps to protect our military members, their families, and the public."
