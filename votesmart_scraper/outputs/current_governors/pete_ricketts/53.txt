Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Jan. 24, 2017
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following news President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order regarding the Keystone XL pipeline route that runs through Nebraska.
"Keystone XL will create good-paying jobs for Nebraska workers and bring property tax relief to counties along the route. Today's decision represents years of extensive environmental reviews that confirm Keystone XL complies with federal safety and environmental standards. With the federal approval process complete, state regulators must now work through the process in Nebraska to conduct their own thorough consideration of the project."
