Press Release

Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts sent a letter to members of the Nebraska Legislature updating senators on the status of staffing reforms his administration and the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services (NDCS) are pursuing. The Governor's letter follows meetings held today with NDCS Director Scott Frakes, agency leadership, and corrections team members about ongoing challenges with inmate assaults and staff retention.
In the letter, Governor Ricketts indicates to senators that his administration had urged the union to support efforts to address staffing challenges:
"My conversations with staff members today reinforced what the recent culture study and legislative hearings have highlighted. Staffing continues to be a challenge for the agency. Most of the opportunities we have to address retention relate to pay, staff schedules, and connected issues, and are negotiated in the collective bargaining process. Staff at NDCS face unique challenges and dangers. We must address those in a manner that allows for maximum flexibility to identify solutions."
