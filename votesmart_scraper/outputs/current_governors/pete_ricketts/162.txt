Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts applauded a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) to halt the implementation of the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan.
"The decision by the Supreme Court to halt the implementation of the Clean Power Plan until a legal settlement is reached is important for Nebraska industry and ratepayers to prevent rate increases. I applaud Attorney General Doug Peterson's continued work to defend Nebraska against EPA overreach."
Last year, Nebraska joined several other states to sue the Obama Administration over the Clean Power Plan. Today's decision is a victory for the states who joined this suit.
