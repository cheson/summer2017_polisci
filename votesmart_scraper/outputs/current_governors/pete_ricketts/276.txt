Today, Governor Pete Ricketts returned LB89 and LB89A to the Legislature without his signature along with a letter outlining his objections.
"Clearly, the bill is well intentioned. The issues some proponents have described to me about the ADC funds have merit. However, this bill is unsustainable," said Governor Pete Ricketts. "LB89 creates an ongoing and increasing liability that exceeds the amount of federal block grant funds the state receives. The bill will exhaust the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Block Grant (TANF) reserve by 2020."
