Public Statements
Nelson Ineffective on Both Sides of the Aisle
Press Release

Yesterday, Senator Ben Nelson issued a press release citing his efforts to "push Senate leadership to extend expiring tax breaks before Congress adjourns at the end of the month." Nelson further stated that "we need to pass these tax extenders quickly to assure America's familiesÂ…that they can depend on these tax breaks."
The Senate voted to extend these tax cuts earlier this year as part of the so-called "Trifecta" bill, which also permanently repealed the estate tax and increased the minimum wage.
"I support these tax cuts and I voiced support for the "Trifecta' bill," Ricketts said. "Regrettably, that bill failed due to Democrat obstructionists demanding a filibuster-proof majority for passage."
Nelson's press release yesterday states that "without action, Nebraskans will not be able to take advantage of these important and popular tax cuts this year."
"If Nelson had the negotiating power he touts, he ought to have persuaded four more of his own Democrat colleagues to vote with him to increase the minimum wage, or persuaded his own party to allow the bill to pass on a simple majority."
"This demonstrates that Ben Nelson doesn't have any influence on either side of the aisle, which is why none of the 52 bills he's introduced have been signed into law."
