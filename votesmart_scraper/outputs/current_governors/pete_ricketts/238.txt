Press Release
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: July 8, 2015
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and First Lady Susanne Shore unveiled the logo and brand that will be used by a coalition of individuals planning events for Nebraska's sesquicentennial anniversary, which will be celebrated in 2017.
Creative inspiration for the design comes from the Nebraska State Capitol and other iconic Nebraska images such as the state flower, flag, and even nature. You will find a digital copy of the logo attached to this release. Key themes in the logo include:
* The use of maize recognizes our state's past and our reputation as the Cornhusker State
* The kernels symbolize the seeds of prosperity and agriculture, the backbone of our state
* The corn icon resembles an office building as a nod to the business community
* The logo is based on decorative elements used throughout the State Capitol
* The color is derived from the state flower, the goldenrod
"In less than two years, Nebraska will celebrate the 150th anniversary of our statehood," said Governor Pete Ricketts "This will be a great opportunity to highlight how much Nebraska has grown over the last one and one-half centuries. From the early days of our state when Native Americans roamed the plains and the pioneers broke the prairie sod to the farmers, ranchers, and entrepreneurs who continue to make our state the best place in the world to live, work, and raise a family, we have a rich heritage to celebrate."
"It is a privilege to be a part of planning for our state's 150th anniversary, and to create a way for Nebraskans to come together and celebrate," said First Lady Susanne Shore. "As we talked about how to brand the sesquicentennial celebration, the design team looked to key elements of our state's culture and heritage. The final logo truly encapsulates our state's spirit with its traditional look as well as its recognition of our agricultural legacy and our strong business culture."
