Gov. Ricketts Applauds President's Steps to End Clean Power Plan
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: March 29, 2017
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following news that President Donald J. Trump had signed an executive order mandating a review of the Clean Power Plan.
"Thank you to the President for keeping his word to cut red tape and take steps to roll back job-killing regulations. This federal regulation was completely unnecessary for our state because Nebraskans already successfully work to maintain clean air and clean water. Additionally, it would have resulted in power rate increases that would have burdened Nebraska family budgets and Main Street job creators."
