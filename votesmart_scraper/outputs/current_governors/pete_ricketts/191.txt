Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and Major General Daryl Bohac announced the first major restructuring of the Nebraska Army National Guard in 20 years. Nearly one in three Nebraska Army National Guard Soldiers will be affected by the changes which include an expansion of missions led by the Nebraska Army National Guard in Central Nebraska and the Panhandle.
"Today is the beginning of an exciting new era for the Nebraska Army National Guard as it undergoes its largest force restructuring in roughly 20 years," said Governor Ricketts. "These changes will dramatically increase military occupational specialty training opportunities in the western and central regions of our state. Congratulations to Major General Bohac and his entire team as they pursue these new missions."
