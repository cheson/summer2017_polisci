Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: June 26, 2015
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued the following statement after the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states.
"The U.S. Supreme Court has spoken and ruled state same-sex marriage bans to be unconstitutional. While 70 percent of Nebraskans approved our amendment to our state constitution that defined marriage as only between a man and a woman, the highest court in the land has ruled states cannot place limits on marriage between same-sex couples. We will follow the law and respect the ruling outlined by the court."
