Ricketts Statement on North Korea's Nuclear Tests
Omaha, Neb. - "North Korea's actions are deeply disturbing, especially so soon after their testing of long range ballistic missiles capable of hitting Japan and Hawaii. I am very concerned that North Korea could begin selling nuclear weapons to nations hostile to United States interests, and that it also could lead to a nuclear arms race in Asia. It is crucial that the United Nations Security Council take strong action to sanction North Korea while avoiding military conflict," said Republican U.S. Senate Nominee Pete Ricketts.
