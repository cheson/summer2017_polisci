Gov. Ricketts Reacts to Transportation Committee Vote
Press Release

Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts reacted to the Transportation Committee's decision to advance LB623, a measure that would give driver's licenses to individuals who entered the United States illegally.
"I am incredibly disappointed with the action of the Transportation Committee. The timing of this legislation could not be more unfortunate since the state has already won a lawsuit on this issue and is currently on the eve of trial on a second lawsuit. I remain strongly opposed to extending state benefits to individuals who have entered our country illegally, and remain opposed to this legislation."
