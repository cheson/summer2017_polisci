Retired Brigadier General Don Bacon, candidate for the United States Congress, announced today that he has received the endorsement of Governor Pete Ricketts in his bid to represent Nebraska in the Second District. Governor Ricketts released the following statement:
"Don Bacon is the political outsider that Nebraska needs in Washington to work to control spending, balance the budget, and provide tax relief," said Governor Ricketts. "Don's 29 years in the Air Force will bring valuable experience to Congress. If elected, he would have more years of military experience than any member of Congress, which would serve Nebraska well in advocating for Offutt Air Force Base. I know Don is a man of character, integrity, and conviction. I urge my fellow Republicans to vote for Don in the Republican Primary on May 10th and all Nebraskans in the 2nd Congressional District to support Don in November."
"I am extremely honored by the support of Governor Pete Ricketts", said Bacon. "I admire Governor Ricketts for the integrity with which he leads our state and we both share a very similar political philosophy of social and fiscal conservatism. I also appreciate him for his mentorship and guidance. As the next Congressman from Nebraska, I am committed to reigning in the bureaucracy, constraining spending, simplifying the tax code, and returning power to where it belongs -- our state and local governments. I look forward to working with Governor Ricketts on these issues and I am excited to have him as a member of the Bacon Team!"
