Ricketts Supports Marriage Protection Amendment
Ricketts: "Democrats will stop the Amendment"
Omaha, NE -- Pete Ricketts, Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, reiterated his support today for the Marriage Protection Amendment. Ricketts said he believes marriage is between one man and one woman, and expressed concern that the issue will be stopped by Senate Democrats.
"Marriage between a man and a woman is the foundation of our society. We should work to strengthen traditional marriage," Ricketts said. Nebraskans like Ricketts have already expressed their support for defining marriage as between a man and a woman, showcasing their Nebraska values.
Senate Democrats, led by liberal Senators like Ted Kennedy and Hillary Clinton, will work to stop the Marriage Amendment. The actions of the Democrats highlight the importance of keeping a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate. Nebraskans have the opportunity in 2006 to help Republicans maintain control of the United State Senate by casting their vote for Pete Ricketts.
Pete Ricketts is a conservative Republican and fourth-generation Nebraskan. He will bring his business experience and Nebraska values to the U.S. Senate to work for conservative change.
