Sixty-three county sheriffs across the state of Nebraska announced today their endorsement of Pete Ricketts' bid for governor.
"Over the course of this campaign, Pete Ricketts has made the time to meet with law enforcement leaders from across the state to talk about public safety and key issues facing local law enforcement. Many of us had never had that experience: a gubernatorial candidate who'd reached out to sit down with us and listened to our concerns and our priorities while on the campaign trail," said Douglas County Sheriff Tim Dunning.
"Pete will be tough on crime, make much-needed upgrades to law enforcement technology, and most importantly he has pledged to turn Nebraska's good time law into an earned time law to protect our citizens from violent criminals," Dunning said. "He is a man of integrity, and we know he will do what is right for the safety and welfare of all Nebraskans when he becomes governor."
"I am honored to have the support of county sheriffs from across the state," Ricketts said. "Public safety is a fundamental responsibility of government. I will work to ensure that our state and local law enforcement agencies have the tools and the support they need to meet the complex challenges of law enforcement."
