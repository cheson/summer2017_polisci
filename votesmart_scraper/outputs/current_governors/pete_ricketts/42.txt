Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Feb. 28, 2017
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following news that President Donald J. Trump had signed an executive order to begin the rollback of the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule.
"Thank you to President Trump for taking steps to end this rule which could cause irreparable harm to Nebraska's ag producers and small businesses. Rolling back WOTUS is key to reestablishing limits on the power of federal agencies, so we can protect families and businesses from unnecessary, job-killing regulations."
