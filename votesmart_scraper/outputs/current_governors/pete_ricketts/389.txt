U.S. energy use has increased by 33% in the last 30 years, while domestic energy production has increased only 12%. The high gas prices alone should make it clear it is time to deal with our energy problem. I want to ensure America's economic and energy security by boosting energy production here at home. America's economic stability in the future depends on a comprehensive national energy policy that reduces dependence on foreign oil.
Increased ethanol production and its use improves Nebraska's economy, helps to protect our environment, and serves as a contributor to decreasing dependence on foreign oil. Ethanol is a clean, renewable source of energy that has been great for Nebraska and the nation. I would work to extend the fuel tax credit on ethanol and support measures to expand the use of bio-diesel, including efforts to get a bio-diesel plant in Nebraska.
I support authorizing more access to traditional energy supplies within the United States -- including Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Reserve (ANWR), which contains enough estimated crude oil to replace approximately 50 years of oil imports from Saudi Arabia. ANWR's estimated 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas could also help replace current natural gas imports for the next ten years, while creating as many as 500,000 American jobs.
