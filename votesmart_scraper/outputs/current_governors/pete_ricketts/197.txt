Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Nov. 2, 2015
Location: Omaha, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement commenting on the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board's revised forecast for the current budget biennium year.
"Today's forecast showing a revenue decline of over $150 million for the biennium demonstrates the importance of the work the Legislature and I did together this last session to cut the growth of government to about 3.5%.
"As I have traveled the state, Nebraskans have told me that their family and small business budgets benefit from tax relief.
"I will continue to work with senators, tax experts, and stakeholders to prepare tax proposals for the upcoming session, and will continue to work with my cabinet and agencies to hold the line on state spending."
