Date: April 19, 2016
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts was joined by Revenue Committee Chairman Mike Gloor and Education Chairwoman Kate Sullivan at a ceremony to sign his property tax relief package into law. Property tax relief was the Governor's number one priority for the 2016 legislative session.
"Entering this session, I made property tax relief for hardworking Nebraska families my number one priority," said Governor Ricketts. "Everywhere I travel across Nebraska, I hear about the need for property tax relief, and these two bills substantially build on the tax relief the Legislature and I successfully delivered last year. It has been a pleasure to work with Chairman Gloor, Chairwoman Sullivan, their committees, and the Revenue Department over the past eight months on these bills."
