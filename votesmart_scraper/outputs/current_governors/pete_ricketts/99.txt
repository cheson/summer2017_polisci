Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: June 27, 2016
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following a 5-3 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States to strike down a Texas law which sought to protect women's health and the life of unborn children.
"Today, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a law that held abortion clinics to reasonable medical standards in an effort to protect women's health and unborn life. We cannot let this setback deter future efforts to defend life. As the Governor of a pro-life state, I will continue to work with lawmakers to look for new ways to ensure Nebraska's laws support a culture of life in our state that respects unborn life, protects our most vulnerable, and promotes a healthy respect for innocent life at all stages."
