Today, Gov. Ricketts announced that Nebraska has the lowest unemployment rate in the nation.

Nebraska's preliminary unemployment rate is the lowest in the country according to rankings released this morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nebraska's seasonally adjusted rate is 2.7 percent, 0.2 percentage points lower than second-ranked North Dakota.

"Today's announcement that Nebraska has the lowest unemployment rate in the nation is great news for our state. We must continue to think strategically about the future. Growing Nebraska for the next generation requires careful planning so that our children and grandchildren have the opportunities they need to live, work, and raise a family here in Nebraska for generations to come."

"This is an important milestone for our state that coincides with continued employment growth and strong workforce participation," said Commissioner of Labor John H. Albin. "We will continue to champion initiatives that make Nebraska a great state for both employers and workers."
