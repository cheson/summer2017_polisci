Gov. Ricketts Issues DAPA Guidance to State Agencies
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: June 20, 2017
Location: Lincoln, NE

Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement today following news that President Donald J. Trump's administration had rescinded the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Legal Permanent Residents (DAPA) program last week.
"Nebraska has always been a welcoming state. We are also a state that respects the rule of law," said Governor Ricketts. "Thank you to the President for following through on his pledge to repeal DAPA. Granting legal status to individuals who entered our country illegally is fundamentally unfair and unjust."
Late last week, the Governor issued a memo to state agencies providing guidance on complying with the President's decision.
"To ensure compliance with the U.S. Department's memorandum rescinding DAPA, no state entity should be using policies set out in DAPA as a basis for determining lawful presence."
