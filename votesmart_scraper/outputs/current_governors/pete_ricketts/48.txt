Gov. Ricketts Comments on Refugee Executive Order
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Jan. 30, 2017
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement on President Donald J. Trump's recent executive order pausing refugee resettlement from certain countries.
"Nebraska has a long tradition of welcoming refugees fleeing political and religious persecution including Yezidi, Vietnamese, Sudanese, and Burmese families among many others.
"For over a year, I urged President Obama to strengthen vetting of refugees, but he took no action. I strongly support President Trump's efforts to strengthen security screening in the refugee resettlement process. I urge the White House to quickly put new vetting processes in place, so we can continue to safely welcome refugees from all parts of the world.
"Right now, I encourage Nebraskans to seek out opportunities to support and serve refugee families who are already in our state by reaching out to one of our three Nebraska resettlement agencies."
