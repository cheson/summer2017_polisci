Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) announced new reforms to enhance the client experience for women and children in Nebraska. From paper to paperless, manual to automated, lag time to real-time, modern technology for DHHS' new Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Journey Program means efficient and client-centered service.
"WIC Journey is an example of how process improvement and the latest technology helps us put people in need first," said Governor Pete Ricketts. "WIC Journey is more efficient and user-friendly, which allows WIC staff to interact more with families. Thank you to the team in the Division of Public Health for their work to help Nebraskans build better lives."
The WIC Program provides healthy food along with nutrition counseling and breastfeeding support to Nebraska families in need. WIC Journey is a new system that helps administer the WIC Program across the state through 13 local WIC agencies that provide services at 106 clinics reaching more than 37,000 Nebraskans. It replaces an outdated computer system from 1997.
