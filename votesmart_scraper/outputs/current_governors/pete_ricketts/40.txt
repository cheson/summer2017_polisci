Gov. Ricketts Comments on LB44 Advancement
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: March 14, 2017
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following a vote by the Revenue Committee to advance LB44, a bill for the State of Nebraska to enforce online state sales tax.
"Passing a law at the state level to collect online sales tax has the potential to place Nebraska's budget on shaky ground. Similar state-level proposals have been found unconstitutional as recently as last week, and there are other cases pending in federal courts. Enforcement of online state sales tax is an issue that must be addressed, but it can only be handled properly by Congress at the federal level or a change in direction from the Supreme Court. Until then, the State of Nebraska will continue to work to bring online businesses into voluntary compliance."
