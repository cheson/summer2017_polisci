Gov. Ricketts Urges Senators to Vote Against LB947
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: April 13, 2016
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts sent a letter to the members of Nebraska's Unicameral Legislature urging them to vote against LB947, a bill which gives individuals who came to Nebraska illegally access to over 100 professional and commercial licenses.
"The proper process to address the granting of legal status is for the President to work with Congress to address our immigration laws," said Governor Ricketts in his letter. "By circumventing our current immigration process, LB947 undermines the rule of law and is unjust to all the immigrants, permanent residents, and naturalized citizens who legally followed the established process."
Additionally, the Governor pointed out that LB947 would extend professional and commercial licenses not only to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA youth, but also to other immigrants. In addition to DACA recipients, the legislation would also provide these licenses to pending asylum seekers as well as those with a pending or approved application for temporary protected status from Somalia, Syria, and Yemen among other countries.
