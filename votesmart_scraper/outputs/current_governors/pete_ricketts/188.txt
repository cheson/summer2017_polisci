Gov. Ricketts Proposes Transfer of Grand Island Nebraska Veterans' Home Property to the City of Grand Island
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Dec. 1, 2015
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts proposed the transfer of the property that is currently home to the Grand Island Nebraska Veterans' Home from the State of Nebraska to the City of Grand Island. The transfer is contingent on approval by the City of Grand Island. If approved, the transfer would occur in two phases and would be completed following the construction of the new Central Nebraska Veterans' Home, which will be located in Kearney.
Transferring the land from the State of Nebraska to the City of Grand Island honors the spirit of the original gift of the land which was transferred to the State of Nebraska by three farm families. On April 1, 1887, the Baker, Alter, and Glover families transferred parcels of land at the price of a dollar each for the purpose of constructing the veterans' home. Similarly, the State of Nebraska plans to transfer the property to the City of Grand Island, which hopes to redevelop the land.
"Today's announcement honors the spirit of the original transfer of land to the State of Nebraska and allows the City of Grand Island to redevelop the property," said Governor Ricketts. "Today's announcement is a win-win for the people of Grand Island and all Nebraskans."
