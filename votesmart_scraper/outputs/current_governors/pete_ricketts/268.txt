Today, Governor Pete Ricketts signed a state of emergency declaration to address the discovery of avian influenza in Nebraska's poultry sector. The Governor, in consultation with Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) Director Greg Ibach, issued the declaration in order to ensure the availability of resources for the state agencies who are working in Northeast Nebraska on the avian influenza discovery.
"The Nebraska Department of Agriculture is coordinating with several state agencies for a thorough, expeditious response," Gov. Ricketts said. "While not a human health threat, the discovery of avian influenza is a serious situation for our poultry sector, and I want to provide responders with access to all appropriate tools to address it."
The NDA announced yesterday the finding of a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N2 in a commercial layer flock in Dixon County. The flock of 1.7 million chickens is located within the central flyway where this strain of avian influenza has previously been identified.
The flock has been quarantined and, in accordance with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) protocol, will be depopulated. A perimeter has been established around the farm, and NDA staff will be visiting all locations within a 6.2 mile radius that may have poultry to coordinate additional testing.
"We have an NDA team in northeast Nebraska and already are receiving great support from federal, state and local partners," Ibach said. "This declaration gives us additional tools to effectively deal with this disease. We have a poultry sector valued at $1.1 billion, so obviously the impacts of avian influenza will be far-reaching."
