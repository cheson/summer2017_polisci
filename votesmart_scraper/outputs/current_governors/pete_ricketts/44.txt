Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following news that TransCanada had submitted a new application to the Public Service Commission (PSC) for approval of the route for the Keystone XL pipeline through Nebraska.
"I am pleased to see TransCanada has reapplied with the PSC. I have supported the Keystone XL pipeline as a safe way to ensure North American energy independence, and to bring additional jobs and property tax revenue to Nebraska.
