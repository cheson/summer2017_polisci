Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following Attorney General Doug Peterson's announcement that Nebraska would be joining a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency over President Obama's Clean Power Plan.
"As my administration began to review the Clean Power Plan rule, it became clear that this is yet another example of how the EPA continues to overstep the authority given to them by Congress. The Attorney General has my full support in joining this lawsuit against the EPA's plan on behalf of Nebraska."
