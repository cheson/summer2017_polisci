Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and the Department of Labor released a video highlighting opportunities in Nebraska for veterans seeking work.
"Connecting our state's veterans with good paying jobs is one of the ways we can support them as they return home," said Governor Ricketts. "Employers all across our great state are looking for veterans and military servicemen and women like you to fill their high skill, high wage, and high demand jobs.

"I know from personal experience how the Good Life that our state is blessed with would not be possible without the continued service of our veterans even after they have retired their military uniforms. As the Chief Operating Officer of the online brokerage firm Ameritrade, the gentleman running my new accounts department was a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel; the gentleman running my training was a retired Air Force Colonel; and the gentleman who ran my back office was a Marine Captain. That Marine Captain is now the Chief Operating Officer for the State of Nebraska."
