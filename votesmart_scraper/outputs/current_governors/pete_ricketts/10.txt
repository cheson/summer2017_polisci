To our active duty military and their families, our veterans and their families, and to the parents, wives, husbands, and children of the fallen -- thank you. We can never repay you for the sacrifices you have all made, but we can be forever vigilant and never forget the sacrifices our heroes have made for our state and our country."
"Over the holiday weekend and throughout the busy summer travel season, Susanne, the kids, and I encourage all Nebraskans to travel safely, to buckle up, and to never drink and drive."
