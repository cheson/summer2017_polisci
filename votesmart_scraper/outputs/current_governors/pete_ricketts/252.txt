Gov. Ricketts' 30-member Nebraska trade team is nearing the end of its meetings in the European Union. After beginning the mission in Italy, the delegation held strategic meetings in Belgium and Denmark focused on the bioscience industry.
In Brussels, the Governor met with executives from Ghent Port Company, TOTCO, Sygenta Brussels, and a consultant for Belgian Biodiesel Board to promote Nebraska's biofuels industry and build relations between firms in Europe and the U.S.
"Nebraska has a powerful resume to attract these types of companies. Now, we have to get out there and pound the pavement," Gov. Ricketts said. "The bioscience industry is growing very rapidly as technological advances make way for innovative products and uses. We want to be positioned for more growth in this area and let companies know Nebraska is open for business."
"Bioscience companies offer a tremendous opportunity for Nebraska agriculture by adding value to the products we are already producing," said Nebraska Agriculture Director Greg Ibach, who attended the meetings in Brussels. "We have had great success in working with top international companies in the area of biosciences, and we want to build on that momentum."
The Governor and delegates were briefed at the U.S. Embassy about potential business opportunities with Denmark, including best prospect areas for exports to Denmark and opportunities for Nebraska to attract more Danish investments.
The mission then traveled to Novozymes world headquarters outside of Copenhagen, where a company tour showcased the production of unique enzymes and microbial products used in the animal nutrition, agriculture, and biofuels industries.
