Location: Tokyo, Japan

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts addressed the Midwest U.S.-Japan Association (MWJA) conference in Tokyo. Gov. Ricketts is in Japan leading a Nebraska delegation to promote Nebraska business and our state's long history as an economic partner with Japan.
Later in the day, Gov. Ricketts announced a partnership agreement between Lincoln-based Geist Manufacturing and Meikyo Denki, a Japanese power distribution panel manufacturer. The agreement will expand Geist's product line distribution throughout Japan.
"Geist is a perfect example of a Nebraska business engaging in the global marketplace at a high level," said Gov. Ricketts. "With the support of our Nebraska Center in Japan, Geist and Meikyo Denki are forming the kind of relationship that leads to success in a competitive industry."
