This morning, Governor Pete Ricketts urged senators to listen to their constituents when considering how they vote during the final round of debate on a measure that would repeal the death penalty.
"This morning's debate on the death penalty is significant," said Governor Ricketts. "No one has traveled the state more than I have in the past 18 months, and everywhere I go there is overwhelming support for keeping the death penalty in Nebraska. Ahead of this morning's vote, I am reminding senators that a vote for cloture on LB268 is a vote to repeal the death penalty and to give our state's most heinous criminals more lenient sentences. This isn't rhetoric. This is reality."
