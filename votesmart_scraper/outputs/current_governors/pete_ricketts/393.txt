We must leverage the power of the consumer to lower the cost of health care. I support expanding and developing programs like the Health Savings Accounts that give Americans more freedom to choose the best medical coverage for their needs. I also support capping medical malpractice law suits so health care providers can do their jobs effectively and without fear of extreme liability. Additionally, we need to evaluate our Medicaid and Medicare programs to cut waste and fraud and ensure that these important programs are strong and solvent for our seniors and those in need.
