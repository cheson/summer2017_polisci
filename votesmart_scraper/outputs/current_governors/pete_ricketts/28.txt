Today, Governor Pete Ricketts signed two bills into law aimed at improving the quality of women's healthcare in Nebraska.
LB506 is a bill introduced by Senator Joni Albrecht of Thurston to adopt the "Compassion and Care for Medically Challenging Pregnancies Act." This legislation will provide essential information regarding perinatal hospice care to a pregnant woman diagnosed with a lethal fetal anomaly.
"Women and families dealing with pregnancy or infant loss deserve compassionate care and support," said Governor Ricketts. "Any parent going through the heartbreaking situation of being told that your child is not expected to live should receive information on the compassionate care available to them. Thank you to Senator Albrecht for sponsoring this bill, the courageous mothers who testified and each senator for their support. This pro-life, pro-woman, and pro-family legislation affirms that no matter how short, every human life has value and meaning."
Right now, many parents are given minimal options when given a serious medical diagnosis during the early stages of a pregnancy. Unfortunately, most women and their families are not aware of the compassionate care available to them through perinatal hospice services.
"Over the last few months I have had wonderful, eye-opening and emotional conversations with experts, medical professionals, and families," said Senator Joni Albrecht of Thurston. "The most tragic situation faced by mothers should be met with the most readily available information, compassion, and care. This small change will make a world of difference for families and that is what today is about."
Several pro-family organizations and advocates helped guide the bill through the legislative process.
