Free and fair trade is vital to the interests of Nebraska and our nation. About one out of every three acres of Nebraska crops goes to export markets, and Nebraska ranks in the top five states nationwide in exports of all agricultural products. Millions of American jobs -- in every sector -- depend on free and fair trade and international markets.
I support finding new markets for all of Nebraska's goods and services. America must begin seriously addressing our growing trade deficit by working to make U.S. businesses more competitive internationally.
