Today, Governor Pete Ricketts, numerous State Senators, and the Platte Institute for Economic Research unveiled a legislative package championed by advocates for occupational licensing reform. The proposed reforms would break down barriers and expand job opportunities for Nebraskans seeking a wide variety of occupational licenses ranging from barbers to massage therapists and school bus drivers to motor vehicles salespeople.
"Occupational licensing reform helps make state government more effective, efficient, and customer focused," said Governor Ricketts. "Working with my agencies, we were able to identify areas where Nebraska's licensing requirements were onerous or out-of-step with other states. Unnecessary licensing restrictions are a barrier to Nebraskans seeking careers in licensed professions, and especially to those who may be looking for a career change or upward mobility. Removing restrictions will grow job opportunities for Nebraska."
Nearly 25 percent of Nebraska's workforce hold one of about 200 occupational licenses. The reforms being introduced in the Nebraska Legislature this year would change licensure requirements for 20 occupations, including:
Audiologists
Cosmetologists/Barbers
Massage therapists
Motor vehicle salespeople
Nail technicians
Nurses
School bus drivers
Title examiners
