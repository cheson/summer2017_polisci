Earlier this week, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services (NDCS) announced the administration would deliver a proposal to the state employee union on NDCS employee compensation a month ahead of schedule. Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued the following statement after the union released details of the contract.
"This proposal includes raises that are up to four and a half times the raises in the last contract for our most critical Corrections personnel. It is a significant investment in our Corrections workforce, and a serious step towards addressing staffing and retention."
