"America is a land of great opportunity, and it is also a nation of laws. Illegal immigration is an affront to orderly society, and amnesty in any of its forms makes a mockery of our legal system.
"Illegal immigration places unfair burdens on our state and local governments and drives down wages for American workers. First, our borders must be secured. Second, employers who willfully seek and hire illegal laborers must face serious penalties for breaking the law. Third, government should not allow public benefits of any kind to illegal immigrants."
My immigration principles include:
*Opposing amnesty in any form for those here illegally
*Opposing taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants
*Supporting mandatory use of E-verify, a legal employment verification system, for all employers
*Opposing in-state tuition benefits for illegal immigrants
*Opposing the issuance of drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants
*Supporting long-term investments to fully secure the border
