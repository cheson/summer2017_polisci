Gov. Ricketts Comments on Medicaid Expansion Defeat
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: March 28, 2016
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following the Legislature's decision to bracket LB1032, which would have expanded Medicaid under Obamacare in Nebraska.
"For the fourth year in a row, the Legislature has wisely rejected expanding Medicaid under Obamacare here in Nebraska. This year's proposal would not only have preferenced able-bodied individuals over our most vulnerable citizens in our existing Medicaid program, but it also would have been unsustainable and would have exposed our state budget and Nebraska taxpayers to great risk. I commend senators for voting down LB1032."
