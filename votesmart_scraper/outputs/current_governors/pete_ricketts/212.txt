Date: Sept. 1, 2015
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts unveiled "How Nebraska Ranks," a new webpage that will track how Nebraska ranks in a variety of key categories. The webpage is part of the Governor's continued commitment to apply business principles to government by measuring performance, improving operational excellence, and building a customer-friendly culture.
The "How Nebraska Ranks" page features rankings in five key categories: jobs and economic development; education and workforce development; fiscal strength; public safety; and health and welfare. The page can be accessed at www.governor.nebraska.gov/statistics, and will be updated on a regular basis to reflect ongoing changes in the individual rankings.
""How Nebraska Ranks' is an online transparency tool that will allow Nebraska taxpayers to see how our state ranks nationally," said Governor Pete Ricketts. "These rankings show that Nebraska is on a firm financial foundation and that our citizens have a great work ethic. The rankings also confirm that we have more work to do to improve our tax climate so that our state can continue to be a great place to live, work, and raise a family."
