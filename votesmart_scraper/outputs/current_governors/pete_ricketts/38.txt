Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following news that the State Department had issued a Presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.
"The Presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline is a welcome step forward to securing improved energy infrastructure in Nebraska and nationally, while also creating jobs and ensuring our energy independence. The project will also benefit Nebraska by bringing an estimated additional $11.8 million in property tax revenue in the first year to 12 Nebraska counties.
