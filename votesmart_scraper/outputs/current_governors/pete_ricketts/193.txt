Gov. Ricketts Launches Online Environmental Quality Permitting
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: Nov. 12, 2015
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts and the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (NDEQ) announced the launch of online applications for two types of permits issued by the department.
Starting immediately, Nebraskans can apply for storm water permits online at http://deq.ne.gov by clicking on "Permits and Authorizations." A screenshot of the page is attached. Additionally in the coming weeks, the agency will launch an online application for the new general air construction permit, which it recently began to offer. With this new permit, businesses will no longer need to submit duplicative applications for similar projects. Applicants will be able to answer a few questions online to qualify for the permit if they fall within a specified range of environmental constraints.
"My administration is focused on finding ways to make state government more customer-friendly," said Governor Ricketts. "Nebraskans expect to be able to access government services and applications online. Moving the application process online for these permits saves valuable time for businesses and allows the agency to dramatically reduce turnaround time."
