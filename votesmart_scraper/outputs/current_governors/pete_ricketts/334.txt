Biofuels are a critical part of Nebraska's economy, adding income for farmers, creating jobs, and boosting energy independence.
My plan for growing agricultural opportunity in Nebraska calls for a renewed emphasis on value-added production. Ethanol tops the list, as it adds value to Nebraska corn and is converted to fuel and efficient livestock feed. As governor, it will be my goal to challenge Iowa to become the top ethanol producer in the nation. I support the Renewable Fuels Standard and oppose federal attempts to reduce it. I will also seek to expand new markets for ethanol, such as encouraging higher blend levels, locally and across the nation. Now essential to the rural economy, the future of biofuels holds great promise. I am excited to help the industry grow in the state.
