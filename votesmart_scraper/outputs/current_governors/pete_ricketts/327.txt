Ricketts Comments on Border Situation, Children in Nebraska
Press Release

Location: Omaha, NE

Nebraska Republican Gubernatorial Nominee Pete Ricketts today commented on the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border and news reports indicating 200 children who entered the country illegally have been sent to Nebraska.
"What we're seeing now are the real-life consequences of an unsecured border and unilateral presidential action that's motivated more by politics than sound policy," Ricketts said. "The federal government needs to work with the states immediately to ensure children's safety and safe return back home to their families."
Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman said Friday that federal officials have refused his request for information regarding the identity of the children and where they may have been placed.
