Gov. Ricketts Signs Budget Adjustments
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: March 31, 2016
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts announced he had signed the mid-biennium budget adjustments contained in LB956e and LB957e forwarded to him for consideration by the Legislature.
"While I have concerns regarding several adjustments made by the Legislature in this mid-biennium budget that expand non-critical services, replace lost federal funds, or attempt to advantage certain organizations in future budgets, I applaud the Legislature for meeting the 3.5 percent spending target I set," said Governor Ricketts. "To continue to provide additional tax relief and prepare for the future, we must control our spending today."
The Governor also thanked senators for working with him to address a $124 million revenue shortfall, and announced that he would target an even lower rate of budget growth than this biennium in next year's budget.
