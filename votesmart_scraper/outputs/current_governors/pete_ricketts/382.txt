Ricketts Voices Support Of Judge Samuel Alito
Omaha, NE - As the Senate Judiciary Committee began confirmation hearings for Judge Samuel Alito, Pete Ricketts expressed strong support for the judge. "I support conservative judicial nominees who understand it is their job to interpret the law, not create it," said Ricketts. Ricketts, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate, urged the Senate to have a fair hearing, and then give Judge Alito a straight up-or-down vote.
Ricketts has been touring Nebraska for the past several months, listening to Nebraskans and hearing their concerns. Ricketts said, "Nebraskans want a Supreme Court Judge who interprets and applies the law according to the constitution." Ricketts says Nebraskans support Judge Alito, and so does he.
