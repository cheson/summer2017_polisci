Today, Governor Ricketts and Senator Kathy Campbell agreed on a compromise to provide for an increase in the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) benefit this session. This agreement comes in response to the Governor's veto of LB89.
"I am pleased that we have reached a compromise that moves Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant funds into the hands of low income families, "said Governor Ricketts. "My administration is committed to helping the truly vulnerable in a sustainable way, while also connecting Nebraskans with the many good-paying jobs around our state to minimize the need for long-term dependence on public assistance."
Governor Ricketts appreciates Senator Campbell's willingness to work together to find the best solution on this issue for Nebraska's most vulnerable families. He also expressed thanks for senators who shared his fiscal concerns about LB89's lack of long-term fiscal sustainability.
"This is important news for Nebraska's children, of whom one in five are living in poverty," said Senator Kathy Campbell. "I am pleased that Governor Ricketts has been willing to sit down, discuss the issue, and reach a compromise. I am confident that we can make a difference for low-income families and children that will improve their opportunities."
Based on the agreement, no veto override attempt will be made. Details of the compromise will be announced soon.
