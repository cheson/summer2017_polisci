Pete Ricketts Announces Intention To Run For U.S. Senate
I am announcing today my intention to be a candidate for the U.S. Senate. I will be making a more formal announcement later this fall.
I am running for the U.S. Senate to improve our culture, protect our security and freedoms and work for a conservative reform agenda that will provide a better quality of life for Nebraskan families.
I am a fourth-generation Nebraskan whose roots go back to the farmland of rural Nebraska. I am a husband and a father of three wonderful children. As a businessman I've helped create jobs and grow a Nebraska company into an industry leader by constantly innovating and accepting challenges. As a businessman I have worked with Internet technologies to empower the individual in their quest to achieve economic opportunity and financial security.
These experiences I will bring to the Senate race. I am not a career politician - I won't vote like one and I will not act like one. I will have one responsibility - to work for the prosperity, safety and values of Nebraskans and our country. I believe public service is an opportunity to serve others and that public servants must make decisions based on policy and improving our culture and way of life, rather than political decisions aimed at winning the next election.
I believe we must protect our culture from those who seek pluralism as an answer to all ills and believe that there is no right, or wrong. I will work for a culture that protects and respects life from the unborn to the most aged. I believe we must preserve the sanctity of marriage as being between a man and a woman and ensure that our traditions of religious liberty and belief in God continue to be the guiding light of our great nation.
