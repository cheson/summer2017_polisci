This morning, Governor Pete Ricketts issued the following statement after the Nebraska Supreme Court announced their decision to uphold the state law used to route Keystone XL through Nebraska:
"Today's decision by the Nebraska Supreme Court clears the way for approval of the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. It has been demonstrated that it will be the safest pipeline ever built and that it will bring good-paying jobs and property tax revenue to Nebraska's counties. I urge Congress and President Obama to move swiftly to give final approval to this important project."
