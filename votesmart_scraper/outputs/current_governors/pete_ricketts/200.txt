Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following the announcement of the successful conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations.
"I am pleased the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations have come to a successful resolution. Initial reports indicate the agreement will result in tariffs being eliminated or significantly reduced for a large number of our most important agricultural products from Nebraska.
"On my recent trade mission to Japan, companies expressed optimism about increasing imports from Nebraska upon the successful passage of TPP. I look forward to reviewing agreement details and learning more about specific benefits to Nebraska. I am hopeful the final agreement will be acceptable, so that Congress can quickly ratify it."
