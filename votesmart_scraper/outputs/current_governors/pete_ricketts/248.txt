Press Release

Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Lt. Gov. Mike Foley, on behalf of Gov. Pete Ricketts, who is out of the country on a trade mission, submitted a formal request to the President for a major disaster declaration in the wake of severe storms across parts of Nebraska. Storm damage occurred from high winds, heavy rains, and tornadoes beginning on May 2 and continuing.
"These storms caused millions of dollars in damage to public infrastructure," said Lt. Gov. Foley. "Approval of this disaster request would significantly help communities in their recovery process."
According to the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, (NEMA) the most severe impacts have been to roads and bridges, including 15 that were destroyed.
The following counties have declared a state of emergency: Cass, Dundy, Gage, Jefferson, Lincoln, Lancaster, Morrill, Nuckolls, Otoe, Saline, Saunders, and Thayer.
The request also includes a hazard mitigation request for the entire state.
NEMA Assistant Director Bryan Tuma said, "Recovery will be a long-term process for these 12 counties because of the severity of the damage. NEMA will work closely with local governments to help speed up the recovery process. If the request is granted, other counties could be added to the disaster declaration, due to the continuing nature of this event. "
The request will be reviewed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's regional office in Kansas City before being forwarded to the White House for a decision by President Barack Obama.
