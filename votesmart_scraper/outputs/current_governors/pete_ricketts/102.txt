Gov. Ricketts Comments on the U.S. Supreme Court's Immigration Decision
Statement
By: Pete Ricketts
Date: June 23, 2016
Location: Lincoln, NE

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that blocked President Barack Obama's attempt to grant amnesty to individuals who entered the country illegally.
"The result of today's decision by the Supreme Court is an affirmation of what many Nebraskans believe about President Obama's immigration plan: it is unconstitutional, illegal, and fundamentally unfair. The President cannot unilaterally change the rules and grant amnesty to people who come to the United States outside the law. Doing so undermines the rule of law and separation of powers. As Governor, I will continue to advocate for an immigration system that welcomes freedom-loving people who follow the law and enter our country through our legal immigration system."
