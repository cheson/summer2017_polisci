Date: Sept. 22, 2015
Location: Beijing, China

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts concluded his inaugural trade mission to Asia after joining Japanese and American governors for the 47th Annual Midwest U.S.-Japan Association Conference in Tokyo, Japan and meetings with top leadership in Beijing, China.
"Japan is Nebraska's largest foreign investor, and it is important that Nebraska continues to grow this relationship," said Gov. Ricketts. "This week's activities have allowed us to discuss how we can build on existing relationships, and to thank some of the numerous businesses who invest in our state."
On Friday in Beijing, the Governor met with top officials from the ministries of Commerce, Agriculture, and Foreign Affairs as well as the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.
"International trade is vital to the state's economy," said Gov. Ricketts. "By encouraging more trade in both directions, we help grow Nebraska. I expressed to our Chinese partners our desire to see increased engagement between Nebraska and China. China is already an important partner for the state, and we want to build on that relationship."
