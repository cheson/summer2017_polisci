Gov. Ricketts Reveals Hiring Freeze Results
Press Release

Today, Governor Pete Ricketts revealed that a hiring freeze had cut the size of state government and reduced state personnel headcount. The hiring freeze was originally imposed in October 2016, and targeted elimination of non-essential state personnel.
"Within a matter of a few months, we have been able to reduce the size of state government by eliminating unnecessary positions," said Governor Ricketts. "During these tough budget times, my agencies are practicing the same fiscal responsibility Nebraskans do when their household income declines. Cutting back without raising taxes is the right thing to do for taxpayers."
The headcount in the Governor's agencies was 13,786 in October 2016, and had been reduced to 13,490 as of January 23, 2017. Overall to date, there are 296 fewer personnel working in the Governor's agencies.
"Headcount reductions were achieved largely through attrition," said Chief Human Resources Officer Jason Jackson. "Thank you to the numerous agency partners who have worked to demonstrate fiscal restraint while preserving service delivery. We will continue to work with state agencies to eliminate hiring for unnecessary positions to support the Governor's work with the Legislature to balance the budget."
The hiring freeze will remain in place for the foreseeable future. Select mission critical positions in state agencies, such as Corrections, have been exempted from the hiring freeze to protect key priorities such as protecting public safety and supporting service delivery.
