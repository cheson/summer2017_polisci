Ricketts Applauds President For Making Federal Spending More Transparent
Earlier this week, President Bush signed the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act into law. This bill will create a searchable database on the World Wide Web that will allow taxpayers to access information on government spending on non-classified contracts and grants above $25,000 to corporations, trade associations, and state and local governments.
Once this database is completed, Nebraskans will be able to type in the name of any company, trade association, or state and local government or non-profit and see the amount of money that institution received, the agency that granted it and other relevant information.
"I fully support this legislation and am grateful for the leadership of Senator Coburn in pushing for this database. I believe it is important for federal spending to be transparent. Nebraskans have a right to know where their money is spent," said Ricketts.
"By giving taxpayers access to this information, elected officials are more accountable for spending decisions. I am pleased that President Bush signed this bill into law.
"We must continue to reform the spending process. We must also provide the President a line-item veto to zero out wasteful spending that Congress approves. Additionally, we need to enact comprehensive federal budget reform," Ricketts continued.
Pete Ricketts released his Budget Reform Plan earlier this week.
