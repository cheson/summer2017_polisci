This afternoon, Governor Pete Ricketts issued a statement following the Legislature's vote to advance Senator Ernie Chambers' plan to repeal the death penalty.
"The Legislature's vote to advance Ernie Chambers' repeal of the death penalty puts the safety of the public and Nebraska families at risk," said Governor Ricketts. "The death penalty in Nebraska remains an appropriate tool in sentencing the most heinous criminals. My administration has taken steps to fix management issues that have previously hindered carrying out the death penalty. Today's vote by the Legislature is out of touch with Nebraska citizens that I talk to on this issue."
