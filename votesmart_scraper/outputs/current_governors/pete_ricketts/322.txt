Pete Ricketts today received the endorsement of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, the state's largest business organization. Receiving the endorsement at TSA Manufacturing in Omaha, Ricketts highlighted his plans to grow Nebraska's economy, specifically outlining his plan to promote manufacturing growth.
"Having helped grow a small Nebraska company into a large one, Pete has the kind of executive experience and fresh perspective needed in state government," said Barry Kennedy, president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce. "We look forward to working with him to promote policies that help Nebraska businesses grow and prosper."
"I am honored to have the endorsement of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce," Ricketts said. "In the years ahead, we have a tremendous opportunity to grow our state by growing businesses and better-paying jobs."
Noting that October is Manufacturing Month, Ricketts outlined his plans for growing manufacturing opportunities throughout the state.
"Nebraska's leading America's manufacturing renewal," Ricketts said. "We're already outpacing other Midwestern states in manufacturing activity. To fully realize our potential, and create more of the good-paying jobs manufacturers provide, we must accommodate new growth by executing a plan of prudent investment in education, infrastructure, energy, and research."
