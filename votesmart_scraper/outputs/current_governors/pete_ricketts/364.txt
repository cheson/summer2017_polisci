Ricketts Calls on Congress to Address Immigration Before Adjourning
Yesterday's report in the New York Times indicated that Congressional Republicans have abandoned efforts to adopt comprehensive immigration reform this year. However, reports in Roll Call, and CQ Daily stated that Congressional leaders will meet tomorrow to decide on the fate of immigration reform.
Said Ricketts, "I sincerely hope that Congressional leaders will realize the importance of addressing this issue now and will not put it off any longer. Not dealing with this issue should not be an option. Our borders must still be secured through leveraging technology and hiring more border enforcement personnel, and we still need a national plan to address the more than 10 million illegal immigrants residing in the United States.
"Addressing serious problems like this is why I am running for the Senate. I have detailed a plan for addressing border security and a verifiable temporary work program. My plan addresses the problems associated with the millions of illegal immigrants already here by strictly enforcing workforce labor laws, requiring employer community impact fees, and strengthening enforcement mechanisms."
"I call upon Congress to act responsibly and address this issue before adjourning for the year."
