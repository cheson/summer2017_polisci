The Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation's Political Action Committee today announced its support for Nebraska Republican Gubernatorial Nominee Pete Ricketts with its "Friend of Agriculture" endorsement.
"Pete has been successful in business because he understands when opportunities exist," said Steve Nelson, president of Nebraska Farm Bureau. "There is a world of opportunity to grow Nebraska's agriculture economy in a way that will keep younger generations coming back to the farm. That means creating a climate that encourages growth in our livestock farming sector and growth in biofuel businesses; and working to build markets for agriculture commodities. Pete Ricketts understands those opportunities and he'll move our state in the right direction in those areas."
"I am very pleased to have the support of the Nebraska Farm Bureau," Ricketts said. "Agriculture is the heart and soul of Nebraska and its continued success is crucial to our future. From achieving real property tax reform to increasing market opportunities and helping beginning farmers, I am eager to get to work on state policies that help promote new farm and ranch income and enhance rural development. There's no better way to move our entire state forward than by growing agricultural opportunities."
Founded in 1917, the Nebraska Farm Bureau is the largest farm and ranch organization in Nebraska. More than 56,000 families across Nebraska are Farm Bureau members. Last week, Ricketts received official support from the Nebraska Cattlemen Association, the state's largest livestock production organization.
