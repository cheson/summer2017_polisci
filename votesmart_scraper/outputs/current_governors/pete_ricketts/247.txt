Previously, Fassett operated Cheyenne-based Fassett Consulting, LLC, an engineering consulting firm that specialized in water rights, water resources engineering, and water policy matters.
From 1987-2000, Fassett served as the State Engineer and chief water resource official in the cabinet of the Governor of Wyoming for two administrations. As State Engineer, he served as the director of all policy, technical, and administrative responsibilities of the cabinet-level agency responsible for the appropriation, beneficial use, and general supervision and regulation of all waters in the state.

"I look forward to applying the knowledge gained from past experiences in this new capacity," said Jeff Fassett. "Nebraska shares some similarities to the State of Wyoming, and I look forward to building a strategy for the department and the State of Nebraska."
"Jeff's leadership will ensure that the department continues to manage our state's natural resources so that our state remains a great place for families to live, agribusinesses to grow, and tourism to thrive," said Governor Ricketts. "His broad skills will aid the department in setting a strategy that properly balances the many interests in our natural resources."
