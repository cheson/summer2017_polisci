The Senate recently passed legislation to bolster our Southern border by constructing a 700 mile fence and leveraging technology to stop the entry of illegal immigrants, drug smugglers, and terrorists.
"I applaud the Senate for taking this step to bolster our borders, and I would have voted for such legislation in the Senate. I believe securing our borders is the first step in addressing illegal immigration. However, now that Congress has begun to address the border issue, we still need a national plan to address the more than 10 million illegal immigrants residing in the United States," Ricketts said.
"I have released a plan for addressing illegal immigration that puts border security first in order to stop illegal immigrants, drug smuggler and terrorists from entering our country. My plan also contains steps to address the illegal immigrants already here and the impact illegal immigration has on our communities.

In an August interview with Nuestro Mundo, the newspaper asked Senator Nelson if he had a plan for what to do about the illegal immigrants already here. He answered Â‘No, I don't.' That is not an acceptable answer for our United States Senator. Ben Nelson has had seven years, beginning as a lobbyist for the meatpackers, to formulate a position on this issue. We need to address this problem in addition to bolstering our border security.
"I call on Ben Nelson to tell the people of Nebraska what he will do to address illegal immigration now that Congress has acted on border security. Nebraskans need to know what he will do about those already here. He has demonstrated no leadership about this and Nebraskans deserve better," Ricketts said.
