Peter Ricketts on Homeland Security
Republican Senate Challenger
Fully support strong national defense
I fully support our troops and a strong national defense. The government's foremost obligation is to protect our citizens and defend our homeland. The Armed Forces must be prepared to defend America by investing in a strong, efficient military on the cutting edge of technology.
Strong volunteer military requires taking care of our current service members and keeping our promise to their predecessors. We must ensure that our service members are provided with adequate pay, housing and other benefits
