Below is a statement from Gov. Matt Bevin on today's victory in the student privacy case after the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to drop its appeal of a nationwide injunction:
"Last year, the Obama Administration, in a massive and illegal federal overreach, issued a letter to schools nationwide that would have resulted in a violation of student privacy, forcing boys and girls to mix in the locker rooms and bathrooms of our schools.
"Our administration was glad to join with the state of Texas, and eleven other states, in a suit to protect local control of the right to privacy for our school children. Today, we can declare victory in the courts after the federal government rescinded this directive. Today's retraction is a victory for states' rights and the rights of parents to exercise control over their local schools through the election process."
