Issue Position
By: Jenean Hampton Matt Bevin
Date: Jan. 1, 2015
Location: Unknown

The Bevin-Hampton administration will aggressively fight against the EPA's ongoing war on the energy sector in Kentucky, particularly the relentless attacks on the coal industry. As Governor, Matt will exercise, to the fullest extent of the law, our state's constitutional rights and sovereignty. For example, he will refuse to enforce federal regulations that are in opposition to our own state interests.
