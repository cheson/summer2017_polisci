"We were proud to finally see this measure make its way through the process, and we appreciate all those in the legislature and Governor Bevin for fighting for the rights of the unborn."
"This day has been long awaited by many of us who are pro-life and who support pro-life causes," said Leader Hoover. "I'm extremely proud to have been a part of the effort to deliver to Governor Bevin his very first bill to be signed into law -- a bill that will save the lives of unborn children."
