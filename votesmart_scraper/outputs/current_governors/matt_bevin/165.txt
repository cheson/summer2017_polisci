Politicians often present us with the false choice between protecting our civil liberties and building a strong national defense. There is no reason we can't rigorously fight terrorism and other national security threats without violating the constitutional protections of our civil liberties. The news of the NSA's extensive wiretapping program is just the latest example that our government has gone too far.
Matt believes we have the right to defend our country and our allies when our security and freedom are being threatened, but we cannot sacrifice our constitutional principles in the process. To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, if we trample on our liberty in the name of security, we will have neither liberty nor security. Matt will fight to protect our constitutional freedoms, including rolling back the Patriot Act and limiting the government's ability to engage in unconstitutional surveillance of American citizens.
