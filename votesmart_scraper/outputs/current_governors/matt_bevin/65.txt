Gov. Matt Bevin announced today that Judge Reed O'Connor, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Texas, late yesterday issued a nationwide injunction prohibiting the Obama administration from enforcing its illegal bathroom directives against public schools in Kentucky and across the country.
"We are pleased the federal court has put a halt to the Obama administration's absurd proposals for bathroom and locker room policy in our public schools. The court's decision recognizes the danger of this governmental overreach and reaffirms the right of local control.
"Our administration will continue to defend the Tenth Amendment and fight to uphold the rights of communities to maintain local control over their schools. We will never stop working to ensure that such issues continue to be decided by Kentuckians, not by politicians and bureaucrats in Washington."
At the direction of Gov. Bevin, Kentucky joined in the 13-state coalition in the federal court lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas challenging the Obama administration's overreaching federal directive on public school bathroom policies.
The court prevented the federal government from forcing schools to follow the Obama administration's flawed, unlawful guidelines on transgender restrooms. The injunction is effective nationwide.
