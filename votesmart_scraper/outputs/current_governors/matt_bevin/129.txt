Today, Cabinet for Health and Family Services Secretary Vickie Yates Glisson presented new details on the Commonwealth of Kentucky's transition to the federal health exchange and revealed that the state's net cost to transition to the federal exchange will be approximately $240,000.
"It is time to set the record straight on kynect," said Governor Bevin. "My administration has repeatedly disputed the claim often made by proponents of kynect that it will cost the state $23 million to transition to the federal exchange. This is not true. In fact, we now know that the net IT costs for the transition are expected to be $240,000."
"The methodical approach by this administration is paying off," said Secretary Glisson. "By transitioning to the federal exchange, Kentucky will save $20 million a year that can be used for other pressing healthcare needs without compromising access to health insurance products."
On December 30, Governor Bevin notified the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that Kentucky would be closing down kynect and moving to Healthcare.gov in order to eliminate redundant spending and save much needed state resources. Last week Governor Bevin met with Secretary Burwell and they expressed their commitment to continue to partner on ways to strengthen healthcare for Kentucky residents.
