Matt believes we should limit the federal government's role in our education system, allowing states and local towns to make education decisions that best suit the unique needs of their communities. The federal government's one-size-fits-all, top-down policies rob states of their sovereignty and have failed our students.
Over the past several decades, the federal government has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into our education system with little constructive progress to show for it. It is a travesty that low-income children are trapped in failing public schools with no hope in sight. Government bureaucrats should not have the power to decide where our children go to school.
Matt is a passionate supporter of school choice, and will actively fight to inject our broken system with badly needed competition. He also believes we need to repeal No Child Left Behind and give states and towns more local control over their education systems.
Matt is also a strong supporter of alternative education models, including charter schools and home schooling. Matt and his wife, Glenna, homeschool their nine children.
