Gov. Matt Bevin announced today that the Commonwealth of Kentucky will be joining the lawsuit against the federal government over new guidelines on how schools should accommodate transgender students.
"The federal government has no authority to dictate local school districts' bathroom and locker room policies," said Gov. Bevin. "The Obama Administration's transgender policy "guidelines' are an absurd federal overreach into a local issue."
"Unfortunately, Attorney General Andy Beshear is unwilling to protect Kentucky's control over local issues. Therefore, my administration will do so by joining this lawsuit. We are committed to protecting the Tenth Amendment and fighting federal overreach into state and local issues."
