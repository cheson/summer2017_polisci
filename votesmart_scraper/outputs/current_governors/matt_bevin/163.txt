America has the strongest military in the world and we must keep it that way. But we cannot be reckless in how and where we use that strength. As a veteran, Matt personally appreciates how important this is. Before voting to send our soldiers to war, Matt will be guided by two key questions: Is it in our national interest and is it in keeping with our constitutional principles? Matt will oppose all engagements that do not meet these two fundamental criteria. Anything less is unfair to the soldiers who put their lives on the line and unfair to the taxpayers that pay the bills.
Matt will also fight to reform our broken foreign aid system that sends billions of taxpayer dollars to entities or countries that support terrorism and don't enhance our interests. Finally, Matt will fight against any foreign treaty, such as the New START and LOST treaties, that weaken our sovereignty and appease our enemies.
