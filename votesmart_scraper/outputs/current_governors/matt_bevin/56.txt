"Due to Attorney General Andy Beshear's politically motivated lawsuit, the former, illegally constituted, University of Louisville Board of Trustees has been encouraged to believe that it should meet this week.
"With 13 democrats, one republican and one independent, it is obvious to anyone that the former board doesn't even pretend to meet the requirements in KRS 164.821(5). Kentucky law clearly states that the University of Louisville Board of Trustees must have proportional representation of the two leading political parties in the Commonwealth. The old board didn't even come close to complying with the law.
"The public deserves to know: Does Attorney General Beshear agree that the old U of L Board was (and, if reconvened, would still be) illegally constituted? Does he believe this illegally constituted board has the authority to meet and conduct business on behalf of the university?
"A meeting of an illegally constituted board would only further tarnish the reputation of this outstanding university. It would clearly show that those who insist upon this course of action are not truly interested in the best interests of the University of Louisville.
"It is time for the Attorney General to stop playing self-serving, political games with the future of Kentucky students and allow the university to move forward with new leadership and a fresh start."
