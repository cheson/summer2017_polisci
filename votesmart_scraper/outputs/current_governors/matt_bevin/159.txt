A lot of politicians promise never to increase our taxes, but once they get to Washington, their promises fall flat. Matt has spent many years in the private sector creating jobs, and he knows that higher taxes mean fewer private sector jobs and more money for career politicians to spend. Matt has pledged to oppose all tax increases and supports passing legislation to make it harder for Congress to raise taxes on hardworking Americans.
Our tax system also needs to be reformed -- desperately. At over 60,000 pages, it is overly complex, inefficient and unfair. With its numerous pages of special-interest loopholes and thorny rules, the tax code is just a way for politicians and the IRS to reward their friends and punish their enemies. Matt supports scrapping the current tax code and instituting a flat tax that will encourage job creation and allow taxpayers to fill out their tax forms quickly and without expensive assistance.
Furthermore, Matt will passionately oppose the effort of special interests to institute a job-killing internet sales tax scheme that allows states to tax sales across state lines and violates the principle of "no taxation without representation." The burden this would place on small business would be crippling and is unacceptable.
