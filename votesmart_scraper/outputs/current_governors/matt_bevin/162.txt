Our country is blessed with an abundance of natural resources. Matt believes we can lower the cost of energy, decrease our dependence on foreign oil, and create badly needed jobs by exploring and developing these resources. At the same time, we must also defeat President Obama's War on Coal and his efforts to impose costly energy regulations on job creators across America.
Matt will be a vocal supporter of Kentucky's coal industry and will adamantly oppose efforts -- like the cap-and-trade tax -- to increase the cost of energy in this country. He will be a leading advocate against the EPA's burdensome regulations that are killing Kentucky jobs and he will fight to repeal ethanol and renewable fuels mandates that drive up the cost of energy. Matt will also work to reform our judicial review process that holds up coal production and nuclear power plants in frivolous lawsuits and bureaucratic red tape.
