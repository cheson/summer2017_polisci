Seeking to lead by example and give convicted felons a chance at meaningful employment, Governor Matt Bevin issued an executive order Wednesday that removes questions about criminal history from the initial application for state jobs in the executive branch.
The order -- known as the Fair Chance Employment Initiative -- means that applicants will not be required to check the box for criminal convictions on the initial state application.
"Ours is a nation of second chances, founded upon core principles that include mercy and redemption," said Gov. Bevin. "The simple act of removing this box will help to level the playing field for all applicants, and it is my sincere hope that many of the private employers in our state will consider doing the same thing."
Gov. Bevin stressed the importance of Kentucky leading the way in removing barriers for felons to become gainfully employed, which helps reduce recidivism and improve public safety.
Executive branch agencies may still inquire about criminal records before interviewing an applicant, and may consider criminal history when making hiring decisions. However, postponing that inquiry until after the initial application provides applicants with a better opportunity to explain their backgrounds.
"We want to make sure everyone gets fair consideration for the jobs that make our Commonwealth run," said Personnel Secretary Tom Stephens.
Conservative estimates from the National Employment Law Project indicate that nearly 70 million people in the United States have a criminal record of some type. Employment is a key factor in keeping people from reoffending, according to several national studies.
