Governor Matt Bevin, joined by bill sponsor Sen. Alvarado, Sen. Ray Jones, and Noah Greenhill and his family, today held a ceremonial signing of Senate Bill 193. The bill was originally signed into law on April 1.
Senate Bill 193, also known as "Noah's Law," extends health insurance coverage to include an amino acid-based formula nine-year-old Noah and others with similar illnesses need to stay healthy.
"There's a verse in scripture that says, "This is the day that the Lord has made, we will rejoice and be glad in it,'" said Governor Bevin. "There is much to rejoice in and be glad about today. This piece of legislation is significant --not just for Noah, but for so many children like him, to make sure access to the appropriate healthcare is available."
Noah, of Pike County, has a rare medical condition called Eosinophilic Esophagitis. This condition affects his esophagus, making it difficult for him to eat certain foods without the help of an amino-based formula. The formula costs more than $40 daily.
"We are pleased to see Kentucky join 14 other states to guarantee that children who suffer from gastrointestinal malabsorption disorders will receive the elemental nutritional formula they need to grow and thrive," said bill sponsor Senator Ralph Alvarado.
"I was pleased to join Noah and his parents, Eddie and Stephanie Greenhill, today when the governor signed Noah's Law," said Senate Democratic Floor Leader Ray S. Jones II. "Noah is a real fighter and he maintains a positive attitude. His enthusiasm helped us carry this legislation forward. I am happy for Noah and his family--and all the other families across the state that will see the positive impact of this important piece of legislation."
