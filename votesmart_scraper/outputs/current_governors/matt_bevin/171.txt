Obamacare isn't even fully implemented, and it is already a disaster. When fully implemented, it will raise the cost of healthcare, destroy jobs, and allow government to play an even larger role in our most personal decisions. We need to defund Obamacare immediately and repeal Obamacare as quickly as legislatively possible. Washington politicians say they oppose Obamacare, but they continue to vote for spending bills that fund it. This has to stop. Matt will not vote for any spending bills that fund Obamacare. None.
Matt believes we need to institute free-market reforms that will actually lower the cost of healthcare, increase choice, and allow patients to make health care decisions with their doctors -- not government bureaucrats. We should increase competition by allowing people to buy health insurance across state lines, implement commonsense tort reform, expand health savings accounts, and remove the discrimination in our tax code that prohibits individuals from buying health insurance with pre-tax dollars.
