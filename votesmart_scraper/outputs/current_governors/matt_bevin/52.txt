Today, Gov. Matt Bevin, Haas Automation and local leaders announced plans for an advanced computer numeric control (CNC) training facility at eKentucky Advanced Manufacturing Institute (eKAMI) in Paintsville. The facility is a critical component to workforce readiness and recruitment of unemployed coal miners.
"The opportunity we present today will positively impact the economy and people of Eastern Kentucky for generations to come," said Gov. Bevin. "In order for this region to prosper, it must have a highly trained workforce capable of competing in the 21st century. The key building blocks of growing jobs and strengthening Eastern Kentucky's economy are education and workforce development. If we truly believe this and work together, we will make it happen."
CNC machining is used across numerous manufacturing industries, including two of Kentucky's leading industries: aerospace and automotive. eKAMI currently provides opportunities for unemployed miners and will now give the same options to hundreds more through this new facility.
Haas Automation, the largest manufacturer of CNS equipment in the country, created this programming to address the workforce challenges of manufacturers. The program is a 16-week advanced course including 15 weeks of technical education and one week of soft skills training.
"We have the best workforce in the country," said Congressman Hal Rogers. "I frequently hear from local business owners about the strong work ethic and dedication of employees in southern and eastern Kentucky, and this program will add the necessary training to help support our growing industries."
