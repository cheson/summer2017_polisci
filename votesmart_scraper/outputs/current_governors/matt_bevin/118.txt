Today, Governor Bevin issued the following statement to encourage legislators to use the full legislative calendar in order to finalize a budget by the end of the week:
"We have until Friday, April 15th to finish the budgetary process. I'm calling on our House and Senate leaders to continue the good discussion that has been going on and extend the calendar to Friday to get the budget passed.
"I thank the General Assembly for the work that has been done. I thank our university presidents for signing a letter and agreeing to be part of the solution. I'm grateful to them for recognizing the financial needs of the state and wanting to be part of ensuring that we build a strong financial foundation.
"I'm confident that we can get this done. The taxpayers of Kentucky expect it of us. We should not have to come back for a special session. If we fail to pass a budget it will inflict pain and suffering on people in the state for reasons that don't need to happen."
