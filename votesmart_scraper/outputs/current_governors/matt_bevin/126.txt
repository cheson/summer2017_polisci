The Department for Local Government today encouraged Kentucky's coal communities to apply now for funds allocated through the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) Initiative to help their economic development efforts and workforce development. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) announced the availability of $65.8 million through POWER Initiative yesterday. ARC and EDA are planning an on-site training session in Kentucky to assist communities in best practices for using these funds.
"Despite supplying the very source of low-cost energy, our neighbors in these affected communities have suffered and endured needless economic disparity," said Commissioner of Department of Local Government Sandy Dunahoo. "We are heartened to know of another avenue available to help revitalize the region, and I encourage every capable community to apply and take part in the training available from our federal partners."
The POWER Initiative is a multi-agency effort aligning and targeting federal economic and workforce development resources to communities and workers that have been affected by job losses in coal mining, coal power plant operations, and coal-related supply chain industries due to the changing economics of America's energy production.
