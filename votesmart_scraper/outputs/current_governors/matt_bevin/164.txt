Our founding fathers envisioned a Congress, comprised of citizen legislators that would be accountable to the American people. Today, we have the opposite: Elite politicians in Washington who have lost touch with the people they are supposed to represent. Matt supports imposing term limits on senators and representatives to return political power to the American people -- where it belongs.
If elected to the U.S. Senate, Matt will not serve more than two terms.
