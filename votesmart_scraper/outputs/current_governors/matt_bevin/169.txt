Matt is a proud conceal carry gun owner and he believes the Second Amendment is the lynchpin of the Bill of Rights, as it was designed to protect all of the other Amendments. The right to bear arms is not just limited to ownership but includes the right to carry as well. Matt will fight to fully restore the Second Amendment by pushing for national right to carry legislation. He will also fight off any attempt by career politicians to dictate the types of guns and ammunition that Kentuckians choose to own.
