For years, Washington politicians used earmarks -- wasteful spending projects slipped into massive spending bills -- to reward their political friends and to sway their colleagues to vote for large, bloated spending bills. While Congress currently has a temporary ban on earmarks, that is not sufficient. Some congressional members have found loopholes in the ban, and many are counting the days until they can once again reward their friends with taxpayer dollars.
We have to do more. Matt will actively fight for a permanent ban on earmarks.
