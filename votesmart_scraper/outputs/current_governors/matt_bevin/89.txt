Gov. Matt Bevin today announced a reorganization of the University of Louisville's Board of Trustees, as established by the provisions of KRS 164.821. This reorganization is subject to the approval of the General Assembly in 2017.
"There have been a number of incidents in recent months and years related to the University of Louisville that have shed less than the best of light on the University and the Commonwealth as a whole," said Gov. Bevin. "The University's Board of Trustees, as it exists right now, is operationally dysfunctional. Its dysfunction has precluded it from being fiduciarily effective. Today we are going to start putting the University of Louisville house in order. A fresh start is the right thing to do and is in the best interest of the students, faculty and staff."
An interim Board of Trustees has been created by Executive Order to govern the University of Louisville as needed for the next two weeks until permanent appointments are made to the Board of Trustees.
Gov. Bevin has directed the Postsecondary Nomination Committee to hold a meeting as soon as practicable and submit 30 nominees for Board membership for the governor's consideration, pursuant to KRS 164.005, no later than 14 days after they meet.
The new permanent Board shall consist of 10 members appointed by the Governor, plus a member of the teaching faculty, a permanent staff member and a student member serving as president of the student body, for a total of 13 members.
