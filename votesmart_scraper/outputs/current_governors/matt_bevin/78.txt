In response to the flooding events which are impacting portions of western Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin declared a statewide emergency today, July 7, 2016, in order to provide local officials immediate access to state resources for public safety and assistance.
"As always, our primary concern is safety," said Gov. Bevin. "This declared state of emergency gives emergency management the resources they need to proactively respond to local needs. We thank all of the officials working hard to minimize the impact of this storm system. We urge all citizens to take the necessary precautions needed to stay safe."
The State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) and the Joint Information Center (JIC) remain activated to monitor the situation and coordinate the response for this weather event.
"We are experiencing severe weather impacts from a stagnant storm system that continues to generate significant rainfall, tornados and straight line winds, causing fluctuating power outages and damage to local roadways across the Commonwealth," said Michael Dossett, Director of Kentucky Emergency Management.
"Some areas of Western Kentucky have seen rainfall totals of more than 15 inches in a short period of time, creating hardships in the most severely impacted areas. This event is happening in conjunction with high temperatures across the Commonwealth, creating further concern for local first responders who are assisting displaced residents. We are reminding all citizens to be mindful of severe weather notifications through local, state and National Weather Service channels, being prepared to take immediate action if directed to do so."
