Today, Governor Matt Bevin and Health and Family Services Secretary Vickie Yates Glisson announced plans to develop a transformative Medicaid program for Kentucky. Governor Bevin has requested Mark D. Birdwhistell, a former Secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, to assemble a team of experts to assist in the drafting of a Medicaid waiver solution for the Commonwealth that addresses the financial unsustainability of the current Medicaid program.
"Mark Birdwhistell is one of the most knowledgeable individuals in the country on this issue. With his expertise, we are going to develop a viable solution that is tailored for Kentucky's needs," said Governor Bevin. "Our state is financially in trouble and cannot afford to continue down the current Medicaid path that we are on. We have an opportunity to develop a transformational program that improves health outcomes, encourages personal responsibility and does both in a fiscally sustainable manner. This is exactly what we intend to do."
