Our government doesn't have a revenue problem. It has a spending addiction. Sadly, this has been a bipartisan disease. Over the past decade, federal spending has ballooned at the hands of both Democrats and Republicans. This spending addiction has pushed our debt to nearly $17 trillion and our government to the precipice of a potential debt crisis.
It is clear we can't trust Congress to follow through on its promise to cut spending "next year" or "next month." It's time for taxpayers to hold our politicians accountable. That's why Matt supports passing a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution that will force Congress to balance the budget every year and to keep spending at or below historical spending levels.
Matt will also refuse to vote for a debt limit increase unless we make substantial spending cuts and reforms. This would include having a plan agreed upon by the President and the US Congress that balances the budget in 10 years or less.
