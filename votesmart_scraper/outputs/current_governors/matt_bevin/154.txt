As federal overreach in our education system has grown, positive outcomes have diminished. We need to end the monopoly that exists in Kentucky's school system by supporting school choice and school vouchers. It's time to stop Common Core and its "one size fits all" approach. Instead, let's empower local school boards, local principals and local teachers to make the decisions that are the best for their students, and most importantly, empower parents over bureaucrats.
