Our nation was founded on a bedrock of individual liberty, limited government, and constitutional principles. Bloated government is not unique to the federal level - we need to shrink the size of government at the state level in Kentucky through efforts that remove redundancy and waste in every department.
As Governor, Matt will dedicate one senior member of his staff whose sole job will be to find and eliminate waste and improve efficiencies in state government.
The Bevin-Hampton plan will cut the Governor's administrative staff at least 20%, by comparison to the current administration, by improving efficiency and accountability - just as Matt and Jenean have done in the private sector. This will be the model for every other department of state government to emulate.
