Attorney General Andy Beshear is trying to silence the voices of County Judge-Executives from all across Kentucky (Boone, Campbell, Kenton, Bell, Crittenden, Trigg, Garrard, Simpson, Warren and Jessamine counties) who have asked to file an amicus brief in the Supreme Court in support of Gov. Bevin. In an unusual move, the Attorney General has asked the court not to consider the Judge-Executives' brief in the case which could impact the ability of local executives across the state to manage their finances.
Judge Thomas Wingate of Franklin Circuit Court ruled against Beshear, holding that his position was "both an irresponsible one and an unsustainable one for a government to take." The Attorney General then appealed to the state Supreme Court. On Thursday, the Court will hear arguments in the case, but if the Attorney General is successful, the brief of local officials will not have a chance to be considered.
"Attorney General Andy Beshear is playing politics again and is trying to silence the voices of County Judge-Executives," said Communications Director Jessica Ditto. "He lost his lawsuit and is afraid to let the Supreme Court hear how his irresponsible position will negatively affect counties by not allowing county judge-executives the flexibility they need to manage their own finances.
"These elected officials have the right to support the Governor's efforts to safeguard the retirement accounts of county employees across the Commonwealth. The Attorney General should back off his attempt to deny this group of local officials the opportunity to voice their opinions in court."
