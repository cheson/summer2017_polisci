Yesterday, pursuant to the authority provided in KRS 48.620(1), Governor Bevin reduced current fiscal year public university allotments by 4.5%. The following is a statement from Governor Bevin:
"Our pension system is on the brink of insolvency. We have more than $35 billion in pension obligations.
"It takes leadership from all stewards of taxpayer dollars to keep our commitments to our teachers and state workers. I appreciate our university presidents who recognize the magnitude of this challenge and are willing to participate and contribute to the solution.
"Once we get our fiscal house in order, Kentucky will be in a much stronger position to make additional investments in higher education."
