As the budget process moves to conference negotiations between the House and Senate, Governor Bevin is optimistic that Kentuckians will get a fiscally responsible budget. The Administration applauds the Senate for last night's passage of a budget that restores the Governor's permanent fund which addresses the Commonwealth's long-term pension liabilities.
"We have an opportunity to truly change the course of the Commonwealth thanks to both the House and Senate finding ways to dedicate more money to our pension system than any previous budget." said Governor Bevin. "As the House and Senate negotiate the final budget bill, I encourage them to come to the table with open minds and focus on Kentucky's future. I will support the efforts to find common ground so that we can address our pension liabilities and invest in the areas that will create economic opportunity both now and for years to come."
