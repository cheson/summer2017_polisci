Repeating the mistakes of the past is not going to fix our broken immigration system. In 1986, Congress passed a comprehensive immigration bill, granting amnesty to 3 million illegal immigrants and promising to secure our borders. Instead, the legislation opened the floodgates to massive illegal immigration in this country. Clearly, amnesty is not the answer.
Matt knows, from his own family's experience, that we are a nation of immigrants and we should welcome those who want to work hard and live the American Dream, but we must do so in a manner consistent with respect for the rule of law and our tradition of legal fairness.
Matt is committed to prioritizing the fiscal, economic, and security interests of law-abiding Americans and taxpayers. He will work beyond the platitudes and demand that effective enforcement measures are implemented and the magnets that attract illegal immigrants are eliminated. An effective plan that stops the failed cycle of amnesty would include immediate enforcement of all the laws on the books, allowing states like Kentucky to enforce federal immigration laws without fear of reprisal from a rogue administration, and cutting off welfare benefits to those who come here illegally.
