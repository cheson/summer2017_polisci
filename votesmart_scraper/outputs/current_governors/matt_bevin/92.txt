Kentucky Communications Network Authority (KCNA) today announced the Commonwealth will enter into a strategic agreement with Cincinnati Bell to partner on broadband network construction in northern Kentucky.
Cincinnati Bell provides integrated telecommunications solutions -- including voice, data, high-speed Internet and video -- to consumers and business customers across Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky.
"Kentuckians will benefit from this agreement in two ways," said executive director Chris Moore. "Firstly, by partnering with Cincinnati Bell and leveraging existing infrastructure, project construction costs will be reduced by approximately $3,000,000. The agreement highlights our ongoing commitment to work with existing infrastructure companies to efficiently and economically improve broadband services in the Commonwealth."
In accordance with the performance standards required by the KentuckyWired project, Cincinnati Bell will install 166 miles of fiber optic cable in the following counties and communities: Kenton, Boone, Pendleton, Grant and Gallatin counties; and Falmouth, Williamstown, Newport, Covington, Florence, Erlanger, Highland Heights, Fort Mitchell, Fort Thomas and Warsaw.
The Commonwealth will have the exclusive right to use the fiber with no restrictions and will own the telecommunications equipment connected to the network, such as switches.
Cincinnati Bell will maintain and service the fiber throughout the term of the 30 year agreement
All cost incurred will be paid out of KentuckyWired project funds. No additional funds will be paid by the Commonwealth and no further appropriations are required.
