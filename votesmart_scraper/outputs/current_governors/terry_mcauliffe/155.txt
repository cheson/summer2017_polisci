The Commonwealth of Virginia closed fiscal year 2016, which ended on June 30, with positive general fund revenue growth over last year. This year's $18.0 billion in revenue collections set a new record for annual gross receipts, but fell short of the official budgetary forecast for the year. Preliminary figures indicate that the state concluded fiscal year 2016 with 1.7 percent growth in general fund revenue collections, excluding transfers, but faces an approximate $266.3 million shortfall from the official forecast. Total general fund revenues were forecast to increase 3.2 percent in fiscal year 2016. This represents a 1.5 percent forecast variance from the official budget estimate, with payroll withholding and sales tax receipts falling short of expectations. The final fiscal year 2016 tally, including transfers, will not be available until August 26th when it will be released to a Joint Legislative Money Committee meeting.
