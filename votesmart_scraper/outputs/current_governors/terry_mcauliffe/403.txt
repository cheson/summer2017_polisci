Governor McAuliffe announced today that the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have officially designated Lord Fairfax Community College (LFCC) as a National Center of Academic Excellence in CyberDefense. This designation recognizes schools that excel in training students to become leaders in cyber defense and establishes LFCC as one of the nation's academic trailblazers in the area of cybersecurity.
"This prestigious designation for LFCC is not only good news for the school, it is good news for the Commonwealth," Governor Terry McAuliffe said. "We need young people receiving training in high-tech, high-paying sectors like cybersecurity, and we need them receiving that training right here in Virginia. I'm proud of LFCC's hard work in earning this designation, and I look forward to the dividends it will pay as we work to build the New Virginia Economy."
