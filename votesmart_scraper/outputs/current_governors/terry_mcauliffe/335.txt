Governor McAuliffe joined Visa officials to launch the new Visa Cyber Fusion Center today in Ashburn. The Center is a secure facility that enables rapid cyber threat detection and centralized command and control for cyber operations. The launch of the Cyber Fusion Center, which was also attended by U.S. Sen. Mark Warner and Attorney General Mark Herring, adds to a growing list of significant cyber assets located in the Commonwealth.
"Our administration has been working hard to build a new Virginia economy and make the Commonwealth the leader in cybersecurity for this nation and around the globe," said Governor McAuliffe. "I am proud that the Commonwealth is a key partner with Visa in its efforts to provide world-class security and reliability for its customers. We are committed to creating a highly skilled cyber workforce to make sure that Visa and other companies can continue to grow here in the Commonwealth. Our budget includes funding for cybersecurity scholarships and apprenticeships, as well as support for colleges and universities seeking to establish Centers for Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity. These investments will enable us to keep Virginia out front in the cybersecurity sector."
