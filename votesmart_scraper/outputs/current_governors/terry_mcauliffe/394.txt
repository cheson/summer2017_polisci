Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today a strategic partnership with Complete College America, a national nonprofit, to increase on-time graduation rates, close attainment gaps and provide support for historically underrepresented students.
"This partnership will allow us to address the critical gaps in higher education that can stifle ambition and keep students from achieving their full potential," Governor McAuliffe said. "We must do our part to make sure that we are providing our young people with the resources they need to stay in school, earn in-demand skills and become successful members of the new Virginia economy."
