During the latest winter storm to affect the Commonwealth, the Virginia Emergency Operations Center, the Virginia Department of Transportation and other state agencies continue to assist Virginians by processing requests from local governments and matching them with the appropriate state agencies and utilities for response.
"This major winter storm has brought six to 18 inches of wet snow across Virginia, and the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, the Virginia Department of Transportation and many other agencies and private sector partners are doing great work to continue to respond and make sure people are safe" said Governor McAuliffe. "We expect this storm to continue to bring a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain throughout the evening, and ask we Virginians to keep themselves safe and assist our storm responders by refraining from any unnecessary travel. Many of our roads remain difficult to pass as snow and ice continue to fall, and refraining from traveling helps speed up road clearing operations."
While most roads are open, more than 950 are in moderate to severe condition, which means they are mostly or partially covered with snow and/or ice. People should call 511 or go to www.511Virginia.org before traveling.
