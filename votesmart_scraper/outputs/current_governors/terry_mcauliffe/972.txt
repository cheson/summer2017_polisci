Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe released his mainstream plan to support agriculture and forestry on Friday. Together, agriculture and forestry make up the largest industry in Virginia, contributing over $70 billion to the Commonwealth's economy.

"Supporting our agriculture and forestry industries is a major component of keeping Virginia's economy growing in the 21st Century," said McAuliffe. "These industries employ almost half a million Virginians, and feed and house families across the globe. As governor, I will encourage the growth of these industries by investing in infrastructure improvements across the Commonwealth, expanding access to export markets for these industries, and making sure we protect agriculture and forestry jobs for the next generation of Virginians."
