Press Release

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe this week signed Executive Directive 7 to leverage the use of shared data and data analytics among state agencies to improve services and outcomes, maximize the use of resources, and increase the return on investment of citizens' tax dollars in state government.
"Smarter use of data and data analytics will help state agencies be more efficient in administering programs, and it will enhance our stewardship of the public funds entrusted to the Commonwealth," Governor McAuliffe said. "It also will allow state government to more efficiently and effectively address issues of concern to our citizens, including public health, public safety and education."
The directive requires a review of all Commonwealth systems, practices, processes, policies, applicable laws and regulations governing the sharing of data across agencies and the creation of an inventory of state agencies' data analytics assets, capabilities, best practices and data-sharing activities. The secretaries and CIO also are to generate a common data-sharing terminology for use by state agencies.
"Solid data and analysis of that data is essential to making sound decisions that are in the best interest of the citizens of the Commonwealth," said Secretary of Technology Karen Jackson. "The actions in this directive will empower the Commonwealth to be more strategic in how we examine, leverage and protect data across agencies"
The full Executive Directive is below:
Executive Directive 7 (2016)
Leveraging the Use of Shared Data and Analytics
Importance of the Issue
In order to continue the Commonwealth's advancement toward a New Virginia Economy that draws on the Commonwealth's vast resources, it is important that state agencies have access to all information necessary to better provide services to our citizens. Increasing the use of shared data and analytics among Virginia agencies through a comprehensive and coordinated effort will improve the provision of services and outcomes, maximize the use of resources, and increase the return on investment of our citizens' tax dollars in their government;
Increasing data sharing, correlation, and analysis capacity will enable the state to achieve efficiencies in the administration of state programs and services, and allow state government to more efficiently and effectively address issues related to public health, public safety, education, and quality of life.
But just as important as improving the flow of information among government agencies is the respect that state agencies must show for individuals' privacy interests. State government shall continue to protect individual privacy, adhere to applicable state and federal regulations, and cybersecurity best practices during any activity involving the collection of sensitive information.
Commonwealth data collection and analysis activities shall focus on enhancing government transparency, streamlining business processes, increasing operational efficiency and effectiveness, and minimizing duplication and overlap of current and future systems development.
Accountability
Now therefore, I, Terence R. McAuliffe, by virtue of the power vested in me, do hereby direct the Secretaries of Technology and Finance and the Commonwealth's Chief Information Officer (CIO) to review all Commonwealth systems, practices, processes, policies, applicable laws and regulations governing the sharing of data across agencies and create an inventory of state agencies' data analytics assets, capabilities, best practices, and data sharing activities. As part of this effort, the Secretaries and the CIO shall generate a common data sharing lexicon and terminology to eliminate friction and confusion among state agencies.
The Secretaries and the CIO shall provide a report of their findings to me no later than October 15, 2016. The report shall specifically include the following:
A comprehensive review of all legal, privacy, and governance concerns as they relate to data sharing
Recommendations on how to make data generated by state agencies more accessible and usable by state government and the public as "open" data
Recommendations for data sharing governance, ethical use, and authority
Recommendations of key projects providing the highest likelihood of realizing value of data and analytics in new ways that will demonstrate cost savings and support the New Virginia Economy
All executive branch agencies shall cooperate with the Secretaries and CIO to complete the review process and provide any information requested.
Effective Date of the Executive Directive
This Executive Directive shall be effective upon its signing and shall remain in force and effect unless amended or rescinded by further executive order.
Given under my hand and under the Seal of the Commonwealth of Virginia, this 23rd day of May, 2016.
