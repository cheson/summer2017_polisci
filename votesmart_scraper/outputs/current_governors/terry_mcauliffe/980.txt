Virginia's veteran population is among the largest in the country, and it's growing every day as more and more of our brave military men and women return from our two wars.
The Veterans' Affairs (VA) system that is supposed to provide our veterans with healthcare is not getting the job done and it's up to Virginia to pick up the slack. Each year thousands of claims submitted to the VA go unanswered and thousands of veterans go without adequate mental and physical healthcare.
For their physical health, veterans need better access to services and a state government willing to fight for them with the VA. As Governor I will do everything in my power to provide bridge healthcare services while veterans wait for VA care and I will push for reforms at the federal level to improve this system.
Suicide has claimed the lives of more veterans than have been killed in action during our two wars -- this has to be treated like the crisis it is. Virginia needs to do aggressive outreach to our veterans who might be struggling with mental illness. Virginia needs to provide access to transition services and supportive housing for veterans struggling with homelessness, substance abuse, or mental illness. Finally, Virginia needs to properly fund crisis intervention training for more of Virginia's first responders, counseling, and facilities so that veterans and other Virginians in crisis can get the treatment they need.
