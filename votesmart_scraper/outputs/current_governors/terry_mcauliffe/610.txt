Governor McAuliffe released the following statement today on the retirement Radford University President Penelope Kyle:
"President Kyle has had a remarkable career in public service as well as the private sector. As the sixth president of Radford University and the first woman to serve in that post, she has had a tangible impact on the campus and its students. The Covington Center for Visual and Performing Arts and the new College of Business and Economics are just two of the improvements implemented during her presidency. And she's worked equally hard to build up the university's academic programs. I truly admire the fact that while she was undertaking such an ambitious building program she also pursued important environmental initiatives that have rightly attracted praise for Radford's green campus. I thank President Kyle for her outstanding service and wish her the very best in the next chapter of her career."
