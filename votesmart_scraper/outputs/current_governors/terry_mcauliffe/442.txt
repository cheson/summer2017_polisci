Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality is issuing the first Permit By Rule for an 80 megawatt solar facility that will be constructed in northern Accomack County. This project will more than quadruple the amount of solar energy currently installed in the Commonwealth.
"The partnership between Community Energy and Amazon Web Services, which will result in the largest solar facility in the mid-Atlantic, is indicative of the types of opportunities that my Administration is working toward through our commitment to build a new Virginia economy," said Governor McAuliffe. "The solar energy industry holds tremendous potential for economic growth in Virginia in the coming years, and I look forward to bringing more projects like this to the Commonwealth."
