Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that the nonprofit Virginia Community Capital (VCC) has received a $2,643,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Treasury's Community Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund to support its community development efforts in the Commonwealth. That grant includes a $1,000,000 Healthy Food Financing Initiative award, design to help make investments in healthy food projects serving low-income communities.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "We are delighted Virginia Community Capital (VCC) has received this $2,643,000 award to drive economic development throughout Virginia communities, and that so much of that funding will go toward healthy food access. One of the key components to building a new Virginia economy is ensuring that no Virginia child or family goes hungry. By bridging this nutritional divide, we can enhance the lives of many Virginians while also growing our local agricultural economies."
