Governor Terry McAuliffe today launched the 2015 Virtual Datathon Challenge, a competition that will bring together teams of innovators from across the Commonwealth to create new applications that improve government.
"We can't have an innovative new Virginia economy without an innovative government," said Governor McAuliffe. "That's why last year my administration launched Virginia's first ever open data portal, and why last September we brought together state agencies to build brand new apps from scratch. This year, I'm challenging innovators across Virginia to use our state data in creative ways that will encourage collaboration and transparency within our government, enhance the services we provide our citizens, and build on our state's reputation for innovative, efficient and customer-oriented government."
Virginia Secretary of Technology Karen Jackson continued, "This Virtual Challenge will give all Virginians the opportunity to use data and technology to improve their government and how it serves their communities. Apps are changing lives; we are seeing a movement where longstanding challenges are being solved by technology solutions developed by a growing population of civic coders. We want Virginia to lead the way."
The Virtual Challenge winner will advance to the final round of competition at the statewide competition where they will compete for the Governor's Cup.
