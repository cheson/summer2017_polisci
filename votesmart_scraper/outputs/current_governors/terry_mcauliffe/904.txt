Governor Terry McAuliffe and the Board of Education announced today that 212 schools and four school divisions earned 2014 Virginia Index of Performance (VIP) awards for advanced learning and achievement. The VIP incentive program recognizes schools and divisions that exceed minimum state and federal accountability standards and achieve excellence goals established by the governor and the board.
"I am pleased to congratulate Virginia's teachers, principals, superintendents and other educators whose commitment to innovation and excellence have made the Commonwealth's schools leaders among our economic competitors," McAuliffe said. "The educators and support staff in these award-winning schools -- and in all of our public schools -- have dedicated their careers to building brighter futures for our young people and providing pathways for success in a 21st Century economy. I look forward to visiting as many of these schools as possible and celebrating their accomplishments."
