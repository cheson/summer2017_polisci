Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia will receive more than $3.1 million in first-ever federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through the Federal Housing Trust Fund. Nearly $174 million was allocated through the national Housing Trust Fund to provide a new affordable housing production program that will complement existing federal, state and local efforts to increase and preserve the supply of safe affordable housing for extremely low-income households and families experiencing homelessness. The funding is targeted to work in tandem with current Housing Trust Funds.
