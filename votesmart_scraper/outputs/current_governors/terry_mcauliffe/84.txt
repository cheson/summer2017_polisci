Statement

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today following the conclusion of the 2016 elections:
"I congratulate President-Elect Donald Trump on his victory and I look forward to working with him, both as the Governor of Virginia and the Chairman of the National Governors Association, to create jobs, rebuild our country's infrastructure and to honor the promise made last night to unite and strengthen our nation.
"Hillary Clinton based her campaign on a vision for a country of greater equality and opportunity for every single American. She proved over and over again, as she has through a lifetime of public service, that no one is tougher, more passionate or more devoted to the American people than she is. I am so proud of her, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and their entire team for the history-making campaign they ran.
"I congratulate all of the candidates who won election here in Virginia, including my friend Levar Stoney, who appears to be headed for an impressive victory in Richmond's mayoral race. Levar is an inspirational young leader in our Commonwealth and I am certain that Richmond families will benefit from the energy and the vision that he will bring to the Mayor's office.
"Finally, I want to thank the millions of Americans who voted and proved yet again that ours is the greatest democracy in the world. This was a difficult election, but the much harder work of building the country and economy our families deserve remains. The sooner we unite and move forward together, the more we can achieve for the Americans who entrusted us to lead."
