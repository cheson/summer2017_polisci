In July, Governor McAuliffe signed Executive Order 44 and appointed a diverse, 27-member Commission on Parole Review to examine the 20-year-old policy that eliminated discretionary parole for persons convicted of felonies in Virginia. The Commission was co-chaired by former Attorney General Mark Earley, Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Brian Moran, and Secretary of the Commonwealth Levar Stoney.
"I am pleased with the work of the Commission and the thoughtful approach they brought to a number of key concerns with respect to Virginia's parole policy and our justice system as a whole," Governor McAuliffe said. "I look forward to working with our partners in the Virginia General Assembly to support these initiatives that will enhance public safety and move our criminal justice system forward."
