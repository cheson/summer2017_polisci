Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Dec. 10, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Pilot Malt House Virginia, LLC (dba Pilot Malt House) will locate its second artisan craft malting operation in Loudoun County. The company will invest nearly $1 million to construct and operate the facility and create seven new jobs. In addition, Pilot Malt House will purchase more than 2 million pounds of Virginia-grown barley, wheat and rye over the next three years. The Commonwealth secured the project during the 2015 Craft Brewers Convention, where Virginia had a significant presence, in Portland, Oregon, this past April.
Speaking about the announcement, Governor McAuliffe stated, "This is a significant win for the Commonwealth as it fills a need for current and future craft brewers and builds on my administration's efforts to make Virginia the East Coast leader in the fast-growing craft beer industry. The attraction of Pilot Malt House to Loudoun County represents another step in strengthening Virginia's agricultural economy and building the infrastructure for our booming craft beverage industry. This project, with its capital investment, new jobs being created, and commitment to sourcing locally, represents another economic win for this region. My administration is committed to fully using our diverse agriculture industry, one of the Commonwealth's greatest assets, to help build the new Virginia economy."
