Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced two federal grants that will improve services, supports and information availability for early intervention and education of children with disabilities.

"Securing these federal grants is a big step forward for the private and public institutions in Virginia that work to provide care and assistance to those with disabilities, and I commend the Virginia Board for People with Disabilities for their hard work on this issue. We will continue to ensure all children, adults, and their families in Virginia have the resources they need to achieve their dreams and realize their full potential."
