Governor McAuliffe issued the following statement regarding Virginia having forfeited $250 million since January 1 by refusing federal funds to provide healthcare coverage to up to 400,000 Virginians:
"Today's announcement is the latest evidence that Virginia cannot afford to let partisan politics prevent us from closing the coverage gap. Accepting federal funds to expand healthcare coverage will not only provide insurance to hundreds of thousands of hard-working Virginians, it will generate $1 billion in economic growth in our state. It is time for members of both parties to come together in a bipartisan way to bring Virginia's taxpayer dollars back to the Commonwealth, strengthen our economy, and keep our communities healthy."
