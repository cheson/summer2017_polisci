Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that his budget includes funds for 2 percent pay increases for state employees, college faculty, teachers, sheriff's deputies and other public workers. This is the first time since 2008 that a governor's introduced budget has included dollars for state worker pay increases.
"Our state employees, professors, teachers and deputies are working hard to help build a new Virginia economy, and we are pleased to recognize their contributions with a well-deserved pay increase that will benefit thousands of Virginia families and their communities. My budget includes substantial investments in Virginia's key resources, and our public servants are truly among our most valuable assets," said Governor McAuliffe on WRVA's "Ask the Governor" radio show.
