"As we gather with friends and family to celebrate 238 years of independence, let us honor the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in order to defend our freedom. Their courageous acts remind us that we cannot take for granted the great risks that our servicemen and women have taken throughout the years to defend the ideals upon which this nation was built. On this holiday we also take time to salute the men and women still fighting today at home and abroad. Virginia is home to so many active duty military, veterans, and their families, and we must honor the sacrifices that are made each and every day to protect our Commonwealth and our nation."
