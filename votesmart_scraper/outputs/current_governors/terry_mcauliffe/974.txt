Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe released the following statement Tuesday:
"While we can't force this group to take down the flag flying over I-95, we can join together as a community to express our displeasure and commitment to fighting for justice and tolerance. This is not representative of the values that we as a Commonwealth hold dear. So I encourage everyone to take a moment and fly an American flag to show the world the true spirit of Virginia."
