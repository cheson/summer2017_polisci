I strongly believe that women should be able to make their own healthcare decisions without interference from Washington or Richmond.
Divisive efforts by politicians to interfere with decisions better made by women and their doctors are bad for Virginia families and bad for business. We can't put up walls or send the signal that Virginia is moving backwards on important issues like women's health.
