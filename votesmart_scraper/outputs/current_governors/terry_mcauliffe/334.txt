Virginia is making strides with its Resource Management Plan program, an innovative approach to meeting Chesapeake Bay cleanup goals. The initiative encourages farmers to increase their use of agricultural conservation practices while crediting them for practices already in place.
Since the program's launch in July 2014, 278 resource management plans have been developed for farms in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. This far surpasses the goal of 40 that was set for the program's first year.
"Resource management plans are critical to Virginia's strategy to protect and restore the health of rivers, streams and the Chesapeake Bay -- and build a new Virginia economy in the process," Governor McAuliffe said. "A major factor in this program's success has been the support of both the agricultural and conservation communities."
