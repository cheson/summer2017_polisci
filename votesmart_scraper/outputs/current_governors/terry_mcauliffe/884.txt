Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today in response to the General Assembly's actions on the state budget:
"This evening's actions demonstrated how deeply committed Republicans in the General Assembly are to denying 400,000 Virginians access to life saving health care. Instead of moving forward on a plan to close the coverage gap, the Senate of Virginia moved our Commonwealth backward by violating the terms of the bipartisan agreement they reached in last year's budget.
"Virginians deserve better than representatives who put narrow ideology ahead of what is best for our families, economy and budget.
"When this budget reaches my desk I will evaluate it carefully and take the actions that I deem necessary, but this fight is far from over. This is the right thing to do for Virginia, and I will not rest until we get it done."
