Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced new exports of Virginia seafood to Canada as a result of his recent trade and tourism mission to the country. The trade deals represent significant new revenue streams for Rappahannock River Oyster Company (Rappahannock) into the important Canadian market, the second largest export market for Virginia's agricultural and forestry industries, which include seafood and aquaculture products. Today's announcement is the fourth significant development this week in Virginia's oyster industry, the largest on the East Coast.
"These new deals are another step toward reaching my goal of building a new Virginia economy by working with Virginia businesses, foreign purchasers, and government leaders from around the world to find new trade opportunities and making Virginia the East Coast capital for agricultural and forestry product exports," said Governor McAuliffe, speaking about the new seafood exports forged on his trip to Canada. "Growing exports to Canada, which has been a longtime top trade partner with Virginia, and elsewhere, provides more revenue and job creation opportunities for Virginia's producers and agribusinesses."
