Governor Terry McAuliffe today kicked off the Governor's Forum on Bio and Big Data/Analytics, calling for business, academic and regional partnerships that will position the Commonwealth as a global leader in the high-growth bioscience sector.
The Forum was a featured part of the THRiVE 2015 conference, which attracted 350 bioscience leaders from across the state and beyond -- including representatives from major businesses, universities, research organizations, investors, entrepreneurs, policy makers, and scientific and professional services firms.
Hosted by Virginia Bio, the statewide nonprofit trade association representing the life sciences industry in the Commonwealth of Virginia, THRiVE 2015 showcased cutting-edge bioscience work now being done in Virginia. In addition, the event helped identify needs and reveal tremendous opportunities ahead with the goal of moving Virginia on a path to become a global leader in the field that is remaking the health care market.
"Virginia is poised to fully capture the tremendous opportunity that discovery in bioscience offers for both human health and economic growth," Governor McAuliffe said. "We recognize that there is an opportunity for our region to become a global leader in bio and big data and analytics. We just need to catalyze the connections that will make it happen. As we look ahead, we must realize that we can no longer be so reliant on the federal government. That is why I spend every single day focused on building a new Virginia economy that is more diversified, more resilient, and less reliant on federal spending. Bioscience -- and especially the convergence of bioscience with our IT strengths -- has got to be one of the pillars of our new Virginia economy."
