Location: Washington, DC

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced major projects to improve transportation on one of the most heavily traveled corridors in the country -- I-95 and I-395 in Northern Virginia. Improvements are planned for both ends of the 95 Express Lanes to ease the traffic bottleneck in Stafford County in the southern end and to extend the express lanes to the DC line in the northern end.
"These are significant transportation improvements that will move more people and commerce through an interstate corridor, and a critical jobs corridor," said Governor McAuliffe. "In working with our private sector partner Transurban and local governments, we will fix the bottleneck on the southern end in Stafford County, and travelers will have the choice of taking an express trip from south of Garrisonville Road all the way up to the DC line. This represents a true multi-modal solution offering commuters a reliable trip so they can reach their destination faster in one the most congested regions of the country."
