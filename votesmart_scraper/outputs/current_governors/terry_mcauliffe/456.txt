Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today on his intention to reappoint Justice Jane Marum Roush to the Virginia Supreme Court as her term expires:
"Today, I reached out to Speaker Howell and Majority Leader Norment to explain my office's response to their letter regarding the special session that I ordered to be convened on August 17, 2015, to address redistricting. My office also delivered an official letter of response outlining our legal rationale on this matter. Republican leaders assert that the General Assembly remains in session. I have considered their views, but have respectfully concluded that the General Assembly is not in session. Accordingly, as Governor, I retain power to make appointments to fill critical positions throughout state government in order to fulfill my ultimate responsibility "to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' (Constitution of Virginia, Art. V, Section 7)
