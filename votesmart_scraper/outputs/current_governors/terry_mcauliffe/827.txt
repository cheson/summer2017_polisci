Governor McAuliffe Launches Inaugural Commonwealth Datathon
Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Aug. 21, 2014
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today launched the first ever Commonwealth Datathon Challenge, a competition pitting teams from Virginia agencies against one another as they create new applications that streamline government, better serve citizens, and jumpstart business opportunities. From August 21st to 22nd, agency teams will assemble at the Patrick Henry Building in Richmond to build apps from scratch that make use of Commonwealth data that is publicly available through Data.Virginia.gov.
Speaking on the first of its kind event, Governor McAuliffe said: "Now, more than ever, it is critical that we work together to build a new Virginia economy. And we can't have an innovative economy without an innovative government. That's why I'm starting right here with my own administration. For the next 48 hours, I'm challenging our agencies to think outside the box and push both the technology we use and their own creativity to the limits. Getting all these folks in a room together and asking them to build something new will encourage better collaboration within our government, foster a culture of inventiveness, and prove that Virginia is the number one place for fresh ideas and entrepreneurial spirit."
