Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced $2 million in funding for six housing rehabilitation programs covering the Central, Eastern Shore, Piedmont, Shenandoah Valley, and Tidewater regions of the Commonwealth. The funds will provide zero-percent deferred loans for rehabilitation of 51 to 63 owner-occupied modest homes in targeted areas of rural Virginia. This new initiative will complement the existing Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) Indoor Plumbing Program's efforts in rural Virginia by providing rehabilitation to homeowners in need of repairs beyond septic or sewer systems.
