At a press conference today in Richmond, Governor Terry McAuliffe announced a bipartisan compromise that will allow Virginia to proceed with the design and construction of two new centers in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads that will offer quality health care to veterans.
"No Virginian who fights for our country should have to go without the quality care they have earned," said Governor McAuliffe. "These amendments will free up the funds necessary to build veterans care centers in Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia so that we can get our brave men and women the care they need now, instead of waiting years for federal funding. Quality health care is an essential element of a productive life, and in a new Virginia economy no veteran will go without it."
