Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement on the coal ash spill in North Carolina and its potential impact on Virginia:
"I am closely monitoring the situation involving the coal ash spill in North Carolina and the potential impact on Virginia. I have directed the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, and the Virginia Department of Health to continue to evaluate the quality and safety of the Dan River's water supply. I spoke with Governor McCrory this afternoon, who told me that he and his team are working diligently to contain the spill and mitigate its effects, and I also spoke with Mayor Saunders of Danville and Mayor Owens of South Boston. I assured the Governor and the Mayors that Virginia is ready to provide any assistance that may be necessary to protect the quality of the water supply in the areas in both states that could be affected by the spill. At this time the water supply remains safe for human consumption, and we will continue to monitor the situation as it progresses."
