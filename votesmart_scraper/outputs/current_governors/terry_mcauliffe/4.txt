Governor McAuliffe Statement on President Trump's New Restrictions on Cuba
Statement

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement regarding President Trump's announcement that new restrictions will be placed on travel and business with Cuba: "Much like the President's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, today's announcement with respect to Cuba is a worrying example of this administration weakening our nation's position as a leader on the world stage. This decision will cost American citizens and businesses the opportunity to explore Cuba and the economic opportunities it presents today and into the future, and it will impair our ability to engage with the Cuban government on the important issues of human rights and greater openness to democratic institutions. I hope the President will reconsider and begin seeking ways to enhance our nation's position as a global leader instead of hampering it."
