Governor McAuliffe announced four Virginia's Community Colleges will soon be working together to elevate early childhood education in the Commonwealth thanks to a $1 million personal gift from Ben and Betty Davenport. The funding will establish the Davenport Early Childhood Development Institute, which will partner with four of Virginia's Community Colleges: Danville, Patrick Henry, Virginia Western, and New River. Governor McAuliffe announced the gift during the gala celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Virginia Community College System, hosted by the Virginia Foundation for Community College Education, in Richmond.
"It is imperative that our education system prepare children for the opportunities of tomorrow by giving them the tools for educational success as early in life as possible," said Governor McAuliffe, speaking at the gala. "I sincerely thank the Davenport family for the generosity that will make the institute possible, and I commend the Virginia Community College System for their innovation and their individualized attention to students across the Commonwealth."
The Institute's purpose is to create a talented workforce in Southern and Southwestern Virginia to ensure access to high-quality training and education for individuals working in childcare centers or family childcare homes, and increasing access to high quality childcare options for all working parents. Programming will include training, a network of professional development opportunities, coaching, and a Fellows Program, which will provide select students with financial incentives, service opportunities and leadership experiences.
