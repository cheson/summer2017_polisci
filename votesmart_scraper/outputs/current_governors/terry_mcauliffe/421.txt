Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Xpress Natural Gas (XNG) will invest $7.8 million to establish a natural gas supply operation in the Appomattox Center for Business and Commerce in Appomattox County. Virginia successfully competed against Pennsylvania for the project, which will create 50 new jobs.
Speaking about today's announcement from an event in Appomattox, Governor McAuliffe said, "This tremendous project is a win-win, providing 50 valuable jobs in a community that needs them and offering an affordable natural gas supply that can help attract other companies to the Commonwealth. Access to cost-effective energy sources is essential to Virginia's future growth and economic prosperity. We welcome XNG to Virginia's corporate roster and look forward to the economic benefits that will stem from today's significant announcement. Projects like these help us in our efforts to diversify and build a new Virginia economy."
