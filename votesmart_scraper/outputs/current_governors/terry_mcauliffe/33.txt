Statement

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser released the following statement following the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority's vote to increase compensation for contract workers at National and Washington Dulles Airports:
"We applaud MWAA for voting to increase wages for contracted workers at Reagan National and Dulles International Airports. Just as low wages for some can affect the entire region, so can higher wages. When workers make a sustainable living, they are better able to support their families and they can better support our economies through local spending. In addition, by increasing wages for over 4,500 employees, MWAA will help reduce turnover rates and ensure that our airports are doing more to retain experienced employees who are familiar with critical airport safety procedures. Today's vote will ensure that MWAA can fulfill its mission of operating safe, sustainable airports for the entire region."
