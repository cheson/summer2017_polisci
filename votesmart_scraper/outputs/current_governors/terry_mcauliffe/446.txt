Governor Terry McAuliffe today awarded nearly $5.3 million in state year-round and extended school year grants to support the development and implementation of year-round instructional programs in 54 schools in 10 school divisions.
The Extended School Year Grant Program was created by in 2013 by the General Assembly in response to a 2012 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) report on the effectiveness of year-round school programs in raising student achievement.
"The success of teachers, students and leadership at A.P. Hill Elementary in Petersburg adds to the evidence that extended-year programs can make a difference in narrowing and eradicating achievement gaps," Governor McAuliffe said. "Innovative approaches are essential to preparing all of our students to succeed in the new Virginia economy we are building."
