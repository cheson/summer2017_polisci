Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement following the final approval of a $1.9 billion Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan to support the completion of the Metrorail to Dulles project in Northern Virginia:
"The U.S. Department of Transportation's approval of this TIFIA loan represents an enormous economic boost for Northern Virginia and the entire Commonwealth. This loan will contribute to the successful completion of Phase 2 of the Rail to Dulles project and help the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority meet its goal of keeping toll rates on the Dulles Toll Road steady for Virginia commuters.
"I was honored to work with the Department of Transportation and our bipartisan congressional delegation to bring this important financing to Virginia. The approval of this loan, the largest in U.S. history, is an enormous step toward fully completing this project so that we can begin realizing the benefits that Metrorail to Dulles will bring to Virginia's commuters and our economy."
