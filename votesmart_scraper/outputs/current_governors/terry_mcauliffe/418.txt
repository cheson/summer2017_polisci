Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Oct. 20, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor McAuliffe announced today that Virginia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate decreased 0.2 percentage point in September to 4.3 percent, the third consecutive monthly decline.
Virginia had the lowest seasonally adjusted unemployment rate among the Southeast states and was tied with Wisconsin for the third best rate among the states east of the Mississippi.
"I am proud of the progress we are making creating new economic opportunities for families across the Commonwealth," said Governor McAuliffe. "These new jobs numbers are a sign of genuine economic growth all over Virginia -- but sequestration and congressional dysfunction still threaten our Commonwealth. As we prepare for another legislative session, my team and I are committed to continuing our progress by investing in education, health care, transportation and other essential elements of a new Virginia economy."
