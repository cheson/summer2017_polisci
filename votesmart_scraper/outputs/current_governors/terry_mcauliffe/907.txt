Governor McAuliffe Statement at the Conclusion of Reconvened Session
Statement

Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today following the General Assembly's 2014 reconvened session, in which they considered his vetoes and amendments to legislation passed this year:
"Today the General Assembly moved the legislative session forward by acting on the vetoes and amendments that I made to the bills they passed earlier this year. I was glad to see the Senate of Virginia uphold each of my 4 vetoes, and the entire General Assembly accept a majority of the amendments that I submitted to legislation.
"I am disappointed that my amendments on bills with a fiscal impact were rejected. Without a budget, I felt it was the fiscally responsible course of action to take. Due to the General Assembly's failure to pass a budget, each of these bills represents an unfunded commitment of taxpayer dollars. Over the next thirty days, I will carefully evaluate each of these bills, particularly if the legislative budget stalemate persists.
"I want to thank the legislators for returning and honoring their commitment to Virginians by acting on the vetoes and amendments I proposed. I hope that they will continue to fulfill their responsibility to Virginia families by passing a state budget that closes the healthcare coverage gap as soon as possible."
