Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced the recipients of fiscal year 2016 farmland preservation grants. Six localities have been awarded almost $2 million from the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) Office of Farmland Preservation. Localities must use the grant monies to permanently preserve working farmland within their boundaries through local Purchase of Development Rights (PDR) programs. PDR programs compensate landowners who work with localities to permanently preserve their land by voluntarily securing a perpetual conservation easement.
