Governor McAuliffe released the following statement today after Republican legislators blocked his budget amendment empowering him to pursue planning for Medicaid expansion on October 1st, 2017:
"I am disappointed that Republicans in the General Assembly continue to put politics before the health of the people of Virginia. In light of President Trump's failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Commonwealth has no excuses left to hold out on Medicaid expansion. By refusing to expand the program, we've forfeited $10.4 billion and we will continue to forego $6.6 million every day we do not take action.
