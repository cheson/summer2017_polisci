Governor McAuliffe Declares State of Emergency in Response to the Winter Storm
Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Jan. 21, 2016
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency at 8 a.m. today, an action that authorizes state agencies to assist local governments in responding to a major winter storm that is expected to impact the Commonwealth through Sunday.
In declaring a state of emergency, the governor authorizes state agencies to identify and position resources for quick response anywhere they are needed in Virginia. This action does not apply to individuals or private businesses.
Governor McAuliffe urges Virginians to prepare for this major winter storm, which could dump up to two feet of snow in central and northern regions. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph, sleet and freezing rain could result in downed trees, power outages and blocked roads.
"Keeping Virginians safe in the event of severe weather is our top concern -- that is why Virginia began preparing for severe winter weather yesterday by ordering more than 500 vehicles out to pretreat roads in Northern Virginia," said Governor McAuliffe. "All Virginians should take the threat of this storm seriously and take necessary precautions now to ensure they are prepared for travel disruptions and possible power outages during a cold weather period."
"VDOT is prepared with crews, equipment and materials to treat roads in advance of the storm and will work throughout the storm to plow roads," said Transportation Secretary Aubrey Layne. "Driving conditions during the storm are expected to be hazardous and motorists are urged to stay off the roads until the storm passes."
