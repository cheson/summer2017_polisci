Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today issued a statement on the biennial budget proposals announced by both chambers of the General Assembly:
"I want to thank the leaders in both chambers who worked hard on the budget proposals released today. When I released my budget late last year, I urged the General Assembly to work with me on a spending plan that is balanced, conservative and strategic about the investments we need to build a new Virginia economy. I am pleased that these proposals include historic funding for Virginia's education system and build on the well-deserved pay raise for our hard working state employees that I included in my introduced budget. My staff and I will review these proposals in detail over the coming days, but I am optimistic that we will reach a bipartisan consensus that will expand on the great success we are having growing and diversifying Virginia's economy."
