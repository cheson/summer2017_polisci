Governor McAuliffe visited First Landing State Park on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia Beach to sign Executive Order 19, convening the Governor's Climate Change and Resiliency Update Commission.
The bipartisan Commission is made up of leaders from around the state including local elected officials, members of the General Assembly, business leaders, environmental advocates, faith leaders, and industry representatives.
"We need to prepare Virginia's coastal communities to deal with the growing threat of climate change, which is why I've re-convened the Climate Commission for the first time in four years," stated Governor McAuliffe. "Virginia has the opportunity not only to be a leader in finding creative ways to mitigate climate change in the future but also to adapt to the effects of climate change that we have already begun to see here in the Commonwealth. I have asked Secretary of Natural Resources Molly Ward and Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran to co-chair the Commission, which will focus on protecting Virginia's citizens, our environment, and our industries in every region of Virginia."
This Commission will evaluate the recommendations made by then-Governor Kaine's Climate Commission, determine what actions were taken on those recommendations, and issue an updated final report. The Executive Order gives the Commission one year to complete its work.
