Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) crews are conducting anti-icing operations on major roadways across the state in preparation for a significant snow storm that is expected to impact the Commonwealth beginning tomorrow afternoon.
"VDOT is in a constant state of preparation and response mode this winter to clear roadways and keep traffic and commerce moving as safely as possible," said Governor McAuliffe. "Crews will be out in force through the duration of the storm to treat and plow roads. Motorists are urged to avoid driving during the snow storm because of slick road conditions."
The storm is expected to impact all of Virginia from tomorrow afternoon through Thursday morning, with up to a foot of snow in many areas of the state. Some freezing rain and sleet may be possible in the western Hampton Roads, eastern Fredericksburg and eastern Richmond regions.
More than 12,300 pieces of equipment, including trucks and plows will be deployed. VDOT is also prepared to remove trees, branches and other debris that may fall on roadways.
