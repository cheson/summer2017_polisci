Pursuant to Article V, Section 6, of the Constitution of Virginia, I veto House Bill 1234, which permits school security officers to carry firearms under certain conditions.
There are important distinctions between school security officers and school resource officers, specifically involving the type of training they receive that would prepare them to carry and use firearms. School resource officers are employees of a local law enforcement agency who are detailed to local schools and are permitted to carry firearms in the course of their duties. These officers receive significant and ongoing training. School security officers, on the other hand, are civilian employees of a school division who do not receive training regarding firearms or the appropriate use of force with juveniles. Allowing additional firearms in schools without appropriate training would create an environment that is less, rather than more, secure.
