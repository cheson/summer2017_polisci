Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement after the General Assembly agreed to his amendment strengthening ethics reform legislation by adding a $100 annual aggregate cap on gifts:
"I am pleased that the General Assembly has accepted my top ethics reform priority: a $100 annual aggregate cap on gifts that public officials can receive from people seeking influence with the state. This victory for transparency and accountability will strengthen the legislation passed this year significantly. It will also send Virginians a message that their leaders recognize the need to restore their trust in government.
"Increasing transparency and accountability in government is an essential part of my administration's efforts to build a new Virginia economy. I look forward to signing this legislation, and to continue working with the General Assembly in the years to come to build on the progress we made this year."
