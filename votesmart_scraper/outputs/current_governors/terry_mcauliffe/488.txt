Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that student scores on the Standards of Learning (SOL) tests have improved significantly since last year. Statewide, students posted five-point overall gains in reading and mathematics while increasing by two points each in writing, science and history.
Following the passage of SOL reform legislation, the 2014-2015 school year was the first in which elementary and middle school students were allowed to retake a test if they fell short of passing by just a few points. On average, the performance of these students following a retake increased pass rates by about four points on each test.
"I am so proud of the dedication shown by teachers, students, and the administrative staff of these schools in pursuing academic success." Governor McAuliffe said. "The legislation that we proposed and that I signed into law not only gives students a second chance, but more importantly, gives them the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the material. By joining bipartisan legislation with the hard work of local school divisions, we are well on the way to preparing all of our students to succeed in the new Virginia economy."
Statewide, 79 percent of students passed the mathematics test for their grade level or course, compared with 74 percent during 2013-2014. In reading, 79 percent of students passed the test for their grade level, an increase of five points over 2013-2014. Achievement increased on four of the five SOL science tests and was up by two points overall.
