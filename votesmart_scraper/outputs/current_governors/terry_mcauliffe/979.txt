I am an outdoorsman and will always work to protect our air, water, and land resources. We owe it to future generations of Virginians to ensure they have the same opportunity we do to enjoy and benefit from Virginia's natural resources and beauty.
As Governor, I will work with citizens, environmental organizations, business leaders, and government agencies to preserve open space like state parks, state forests, wildlife management areas, natural preserves and Civil War battlefields. I will also work to bring everyone to the table to meet our obligations to clean up our rivers and the Chesapeake Bay.
