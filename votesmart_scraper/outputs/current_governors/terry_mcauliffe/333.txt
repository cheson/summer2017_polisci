Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that Mercy Street will premiere on January 17, 2016 at 10:00pm on PBS stations nationwide, immediately following Downton Abbey on MASTERPIECE. The PBS drama was filmed in Petersburg and Richmond, and is set in Alexandria during the Civil War. The series features Josh Radnor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Gary Cole, Peter Gerety and Norbert Leo Butz, among other stars.
"Our partnership with PBS on Mercy Street is not only a win for the film industry in Virginia, but also for tourism," said Governor McAuliffe. "Travelers will come to visit Alexandria, where the historical events on which the series is based took place, and they will also come to see the sites in Petersburg and Richmond, where the series was filmed. Fans will have an exciting and dynamic itinerary when they come to Virginia--from the storied streets of Alexandria to the battlegrounds and historically significant attractions in Richmond and Petersburg."
