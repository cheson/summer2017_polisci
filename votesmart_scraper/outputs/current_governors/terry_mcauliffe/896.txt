Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: May 9, 2014
Location: Lynchburg, VA

Today, Governor Terry McAuliffe announced the creation of the Commonwealth's Railroad Safety and Security Taskforce. The Governor's announcement follows the April 30th derailment of a CSX freight train carrying crude oil shipped from the Midwest to Yorktown. The accident occurred in downtown Lynchburg adjacent to the James River.
"The train derailment that occurred on April 30 raises important public safety and health concerns," said Governor Terry McAuliffe. "While fortunately no one was hurt, it is critical that we determine the cause of this accident to help better protect Virginia's families. The Railroad Safety and Security Taskforce will help ensure that the Commonwealth is a national leader in preventing, preparing for, and responding to these types of events."
Earlier this week, Governor McAuliffe sent a letter to Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx highlighting his support to strengthen federal rules regarding the safety of rail cars carrying crude oil, as well as improved communication between the rail companies, first responders, and community officials.
The Governor's new taskforce will include state agencies officials and subject matter experts. Members of the taskforce will be responsible for making recommendations--and taking action--to enhance Virginia's capability to protect lives, property, and the environment along our many rail lines.
