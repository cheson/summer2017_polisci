Today, Governor Terry McAuliffe announced 14 Virginia Land Conservation Foundation (VLCF) grants totaling $2.25 million. The grants will help add 2,000 acres to Virginia's conserved lands.
VLCF grants are used by private land trusts, local governments, and state agencies to protect and acquire special lands in the following categories: farmlands and forestry, historic areas, natural areas, and open spaces and parks. The grants require a minimum of a 50 percent match and many grant awardees provide more than that. The projects approved represent more than $13 million in public and private money going to land conservation across the state. As a result, the VLCF program leverages approximately four times the amount of funding than it awards in grants.
"The VLCF board has selected a great mix of grant awardees with projects that will protect wildlife habitat, green space, public recreation opportunities and more. Ensuring the Commonwealth's natural beauty is crucial to building the new Virginia economy," Governor McAuliffe said. "I'm extremely proud that the Commonwealth can assist with the funding of these critical projects."
