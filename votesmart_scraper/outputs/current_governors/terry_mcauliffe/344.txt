Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that Shawnee Canning Company, a family-owned fruit processor, will invest nearly $500,000 to expand its operation in Frederick County. The company will rehabilitate its cannery, built in 1947, and double production capacity on-site by adding a new filling line for its fruit products. With this expansion, Shawnee Canning Company will create five new jobs and commit to purchase 80 percent -- or over 300,000 pounds -- of its fruit from Virginia over the next three years.
