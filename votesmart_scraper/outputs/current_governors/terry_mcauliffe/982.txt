Virginia is a great place for business, but one of the things holding us back from the top is an infrastructure system that can feel outdated and inefficient. In Hampton Roads, commuters are stuck in traffic for 43 hours per year, with a total economic cost of $700 million annually. In Northern Virginia, it's 67 hours and over $1 billion. And roads and bridges that need repair are a pressing problem all over the Commonwealth.
In February, Governor McDonnell and both parties in the legislature came together to pass a plan to fund transportation that will finally begin to address gridlock. It wasn't perfect, and there are plenty of things I disagree with, but inaction on transportation was no longer an option.
While Democrats and Republicans coming together for a mainstream compromise was a step forward, there is more I will do as Governor to improve our transportation system
First and foremost, I will provide more leadership as Governor on transportation planning. Rather than a laundry list approach that leaves us with dozens of projects competing for time and attention, I will lay out clear priorities.
By focusing on projects that best serve the economic travel needs of our citizens and businesses -- along with key safety improvements -- we will ensure that those rail, road, and bridge projects that absolutely must get done do get done.
Second, we need to incentivize regional planning and implementation of smart growth planning. Some of our transportation issues aren't the result of bad roads or transit systems; they're the result of improper or poorly planned development. My administration will work with localities to ensure that we're supporting and planning for future Virginians, not creating new stumbling blocks for them.
