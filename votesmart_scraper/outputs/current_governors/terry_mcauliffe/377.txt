Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that the Fiscal Year 2017-18 budget he will introduce on December 17th will invest $50 million to attract more customers and airlines to do business at Dulles International Airport. The funding will increase Dulles' competitiveness by reducing the cost per customer for airlines flying in and out of the airport.
"Dulles Airport is one of Virginia's premier economic assets, and this critical investment will make it even stronger," said Governor McAuliffe. "This funding will help support 45,000 direct and indirect jobs related to the United Hub at Dulles and encourage other carriers to provide enhanced air travel offerings. By reducing costs to carriers at Dulles we can bring more air travel business to the region and take another step forward in our efforts to build a new Virginia economy."
