CHUCK TODD:
Of course, another challenge for secretary Clinton, after more than two decades on the political scene, she has a record, which requires massaging sometimes to get in line with today's Democratic Party. In fact, this week, she made it clear she has, quote, "evolved" on same-sex marriage.
She no longer views it as a state issue and is urging the Supreme Court to rule it as a constitutional right. She also clarified her position on driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants. She now supports state policies to issue them.
She hedged on a third issue, though, trade. We'll talk about that and more now. Because I'm joined by the democratic governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe. He served, of course, as co-chair of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, an unabashed supporter of Secretary Clinton. Governor McAuliffe, welcome back to Meet the Press, I believe your first time as governor.
TERRY MCAULIFFE:
Yes.
CHUCK TODD:
Let me start with this issue of the past versus the future. You saw sort of the greatest hits. And this was very successful for Bill Clinton, running against Bob Dole, running against George H. W. Bush. And now Hillary Clinton's on the other side of this. How do you look fresh, when you have a name from the past?
TERRY MCAULIFFE:
Well, first of all, I think it comes down to the issues. What voters want is someone who's going to lay out an agenda of how you move the country forward. You see a lot of Republican candidates spending all of their time attacking Hillary. That's great. Let them do it.
From my perspective, every second they're not talking about how we move this great nation forward is great for Hillary Clinton. Let her lay out her positive agenda. It's what I did when I ran for governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 2013, he had an historic win.
We broke a 38-year trend. We talked about issues. We talked about how you move the economy forward. How do we make Virginia open and welcoming? And today, you look at a Virginia, today, that's a year in office. Our economy is booming, lowest unemployment rate in many years, $6.5 billion investment, double any governor of Virginia history. We have brought people together in a bipartisan way around ideas. And that's what Hillary can do to this country. And that's what she will do.
CHUCK TODD:
If she's going to be President of the United States, she's going to have to carry the state of Virginia. And because I'm curious, Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, he was on the show last week and talked about the reason he wasn't ready to endorse her is because he wants to see a more progressive vision for her, which some people would say is to the left. Can that play in Virginia?
TERRY MCAULIFFE:
If you look at the agenda that I ran on, I think I was the first statewide candidate in the south. I ran on marriage equality when I ran for governor. I told women I would be a brick wall to protect their rights. And I have done that as governor to make Virginia open and welcoming.
What I have tried to do is get Virginia in line with 90% of the Fortune 500 companies. I'm all about creating economic activity. And those candidates that lay out an agenda, and I'm not talking about jobs. I'm talking about careers, building the future.
And when I talk about the education system, don't talk to me about a degree. Talk to me about a skillset. All these issues that Hillary has championed on pre-K, reform in education, reform in our transportation system, we've done that in Virginia. So her message fits perfectly on where we need to go in Virginia.
CHUCK TODD:
You say, her message, but we actually don't know what her message is. Let me just go here with trade here a minute. You wrote in your book, What a Party, that NAFTA was among President Clinton's greatest accomplishments. And she was a champion of NAFTA.
She was a champion of some of these trade agreements, including one that's being debated now. It's called the TPP. It's one having to do with Asian countries. She was a big champion of it as Secretary. And now, she's trying to sort of walk a line here. Because many in the base of the Democratic Party don't trust anybody to negotiate a trade agreement, let alone a Democratic president or a Republican one.
TERRY MCAULIFFE:
And of course, the devil is in the details. And that's what we have to see in the trade agreement.
CHUCK TODD:
But you're a free trader. You probably want to see this TPP thing go.
TERRY MCAULIFFE:
I want to see a trade deal that opens up markets to America, that creates jobs for Americans, makes sure we're protecting their wages and benefits. That's what I want. And I can tell you, in Virginia, I just announced, we're up 14% on our agriculture exports, $3.35 billion. I travel the globe. I was one of the most-traveled governors last year. I went to China twice, Korea, Japan, Europe. We have brought back so much business from around the globe. So I have all--
Which means you can't carry the state of Virginia, if you're portrayed as a protectionist, can you?
TERRY MCAULIFFE:
Nobody wants to be a protectionist. I think I speak for everyone. We want a trade deal that makes markets open. Nobody can compete with us, Chuck, nobody in America. But we've got to get fair rules. We've got to be on the same playing field as everybody else.
Let me tell you, you give us the same rules, there is not a country in the globe that can compete with America. And I'll tell you this, Virginia, our economy, is roaring. Nobody can compete in Virginia: low taxes, business-friendly environment, great educational institutions, lot of military assets, largest naval base in the world, deepest port in the east coast. We have it all.
You give me a level playing field, nobody can beat us. That's Hillary's message. How do you build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday? How do you help families? How do you provide pre-K, so that every child has access to early childhood? How do you make sure everybody has access to healthcare? A healthy, educated workforce, that is what our foundation of our nation is built on.
CHUCK TODD:
But as you know, presidential campaigns sometimes are about personal connections, are about honest and trustworthiness and things like that. A poll in Virginia, a poll, by the way, that has a good approval rating for you, a majority of Virginians who approve of you, but another majority of Virginians did not think Hillary Clinton was honest and trustworthy. What does she have to do to close that gap?
TERRY MCAULIFFE:
Well, talk to the voters. That's why, actually, you know, I'm one of the few to actually talk about the roll out. I thought it was spectacular, having been involved in the '08 campaign.
CHUCK TODD:
You didn't think it was too scripted?
TERRY MCAULIFFE:
She got in the van. She drove out. She actually sat with, which is what I did when I ran for governor. I visited every community college, first candidate as governor in Virginia. She went to a community college. She took notes. You learn. I mean, that's what the best part about running for office is, Chuck.
You get to travel and meet folks. I went into firehouses. I spent an hour in a coal mine, talking to coal miners. Your policies evolve, because you're talking to folks whose lives are impacted every single day. And she went out. There's time for the big rallies and all of that. I thought it was great. I want her to continue to do that, meet with the voters, talk to them. Because they've got the answers. They are living financial distress every day.
CHUCK TODD:
It's funny you should bring up financial distress. You had a fascinating quote in your book, that you quote Hillary Clinton. And you talk about this. "They have bankrupted us totally." This is Hillary Clinton. This is you quoting her in your book.
"They have bankrupted us totally. We own nothing. We didn't own a car. We didn't own a house. Here we were, 50 years old, and we owned nothing, nothing. All the money we had, which we had brought into the White House, was gone. I haven't had any money for eight years. So it was really horrible."
And this was why, you know, you helped them out, and you got a bridge loan for the house. And I understand as a personal friend. But a lot of people will see something like that and say, "You know what? They didn't have nothing. They had huge earning power. They had access. They had nothing, compared to a lot of rich friends." Is this something she's got to fix, if she's going to connect with everyday Americans?
TERRY MCAULIFFE:
I don't want to spend too much time going back to the late '90s and 2000. But I was with them. I was a personal friend. I've been friends with them since 1980. I cannot tell you the distress in that family at that time with all the issues and all the legal fees, banks refusing to even give them a mortgage.
So listen, people go through tough financial times. You remember, I mean, Hillary's mother, she was abandoned. So that's why Hillary's always been a fighter that a child needs someone to be out there and to be a guardian for them. She came up in a middle-class family.
You look at her background. And you can look at her today, obviously, you know, years later. But her growing up from middle-class roots. As I say, her own mother was abandoned. You never forget that, Chuck. That's why Hillary is out every single day talking to voters about, "How can I make your life better?"
Let the Republicans spend all their time attacking her. That's fine. You need a positive agenda of how you move folks forward. As I say, you mentioned that I have nice approval ratings in Virginia. Why? I do exactly what I said I'd do. People are sick and tired of the dysfunction with politicians not doing what they say they're going to do. We're doing what we said we would do. And you know what? Our economy's moving forward, and people are happy.
CHUCK TODD:
Well, I will check back in with you on that as this campaign wears on. Governor McAuliffe, good to see you.
TERRY MCAULIFFE:
Thank you.
