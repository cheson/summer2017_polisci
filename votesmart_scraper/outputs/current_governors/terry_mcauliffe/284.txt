Press Release

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today signed into law measures that establish a workforce training program targeted to increase specific industry certifications and occupational licenses that meet the needs of businesses in each region of the state.
With the new laws, Virginia becomes the first state in the nation to establish a pay-for-performance workforce training program.
Governor McAuliffe also announced that the final two-year state budget contains $20 million in new resources for workforce, including $12.5 million for credential incentives, $6 million for equipment needed by career and technical training programs, and $1.5 million for a veterans' portal to strengthen outreach to this key population.
Speaking at the bill signing, Governor McAuliffe said, "With this new law, we continue the process of transforming our workforce development system from a costly, redundant and ineffective web of programs to the efficient and streamlined skills training engine we need to build a new Virginia economy. I am proud to stand with the bipartisan group of leaders who worked together to make this important bill a law, and I look forward to building on the enormous progress we have made on this issue over the past two years."
Senate Bill 576 and House Bill 66 create the New Economy Workforce Credential Grant Fund and Program. The fund will provide grants covering two-thirds of the tuition for students who are enrolled in a workforce training program designed to fill in-demand jobs in their home region. As an incentive program, the state will pay a third of the costs when students complete the program and make the final payment when they receive a certificate or license. Students will be responsible for the remaining share of the cost.
