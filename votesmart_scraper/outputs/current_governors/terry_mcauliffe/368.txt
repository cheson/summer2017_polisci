Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced a package of budget proposals that will provide nearly $13 million in services for veterans, including education and workforce programs, and improved access to health and financial supports. The initiatives are all designed to strengthen Virginia's position as the most veteran friendly state in the nation.

"The investments my budget will make in health care, workforce training and other key services will not only benefit veterans, it will also ensure that our Commonwealth benefits from the unique skills and training they bring to our efforts to build a new Virginia economy."
