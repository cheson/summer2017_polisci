Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced more than $503,000 in grant funding for fifteen agriculture-related projects. The grant funding will promote and enhance the competitiveness of Virginia's specialty crops and create more economic development opportunities across the Commonwealth. The project awards resulted from a competitive grant process established by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) for United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service Specialty Crop Block Grant funds.
"Like any industry, agriculture depends on quality research and data to remain competitive in a 21st Century economy," said Governor McAuliffe. "These grants represent more than a half-million dollar investment in Virginia's economy that will boost economic development and create jobs in our agriculture sector, furthering our work to build a new Virginia economy. I congratulate these organizations and educational institutions for pursuing innovative research that will help enhance marketing opportunities and food safety for growers across the Commonwealth."
