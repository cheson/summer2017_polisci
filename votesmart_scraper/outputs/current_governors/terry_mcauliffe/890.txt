"As we celebrate Memorial Day with our friends and family, let us honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect this nation and those who continue to risk their lives each and every day to keep our Commonwealth and our country safe.
It is because of those brave men and women that the ideals upon which our forefathers built this nation still ring true: the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As Virginians, we must continue to honor and uphold those ideals by supporting and thanking our servicemen and women, public safety officials, veterans and their families here in the Commonwealth for all they sacrifice."
