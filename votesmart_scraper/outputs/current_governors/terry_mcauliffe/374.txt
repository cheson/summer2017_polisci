Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Dec. 9, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced the launch of a free business-to-business (B2B) collaboration feature for eVA, Virginia's award winning electronic procurement system. eVA's new B2B Connect makes it easier for businesses to find partners and establish relationships when competing for government contracts.
"Increasing small business participation in government contracting is critical to establishing a new Virginia economy. As federal dollars continue to disappear, it is our small businesses that we will rely on more than ever to keep Virginia's economy strong," said Governor Terry McAuliffe. "Any time we can remove hurdles for our existing businesses to grow and thrive, we're putting the Commonwealth in a better position to compete on a national and global scale."
