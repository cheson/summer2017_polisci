Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: March 17, 2016
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Norfolk Southern Corporation is investing $8.2 million to expand its corporate headquarters in the City of Norfolk to accommodate 165 new employees. The expansion and new jobs are the result of the consolidation of the company's corporate offices in Norfolk and Atlanta and the closure of its Roanoke office building.
Employees in Norfolk Southern's industrial products, coal marketing, sourcing, tax, treasury, and audit and compliance departments relocated from Roanoke to Norfolk, bringing regional employment to 1,050.
Roanoke remains the headquarters for Norfolk Southern's Pocahontas Division, and the company operates a local switching yard and locomotive and car maintenance facilities there. More than 1,350 NS employees are based in the city.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "Norfolk Southern is a vital corporate partner and economic engine for the Commonwealth, and retaining the company's strong presence in Virginia is a top priority. We are pleased that Norfolk Southern will invest in its corporate headquarters in the City of Norfolk and maintain its locomotive facilities in Roanoke. We are confident that the company, a key customer of the Port of Virginia, benefits from our excellent business environment, and we remain ready to facilitate its continued success here in Virginia any way we can."
