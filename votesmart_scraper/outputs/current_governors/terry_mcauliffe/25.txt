Governor McAuliffe Statement on Congressional Republicans' Health Care Bill
Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: May 4, 2017
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement in response to the health care legislation that is expected to be voted on today in the U.S. House of Representatives:
"Once again, congressional Republicans are threatening the health of Virginia families by rushing to dismantle the Affordable Care Act -- a bill that has helped 400,000 Virginians get health insurance. The legislation that they intend to pass today would endanger people with pre-existing conditions, cut essential health benefits, and weaken states' ability to keep our residents healthy and economically competitive. Without a non-partisan analysis of the human and financial impacts by the Congressional Budget Office, the GOP leadership is irresponsibly putting this bill to a vote.
"This bill would also decimate Medicaid coverage for low-income Virginians, roughly one million of whom rely on the program to access basic healthcare. By slashing more than $800 billion from this critical lifeline, Republicans are gutting a successful program that has helped countless seniors, children, and people with disabilities live healthy and productive lives.
"The ACA could be made stronger -- and Congress should focus on those efforts. Instead, today they are poised to pass a bill that would strip millions of Americans access to health care in order to finance a tax cut for billionaires. On behalf of the people of Virginia, I urge Congress to identify smart, targeted reforms that improve our healthcare system and reduce costs, without leaving behind the very people they are meant to help."
