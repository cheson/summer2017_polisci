Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that he will lead a historic marketing and collaboration mission mission to Cuba from January 3-6, 2016. The Governor will be accompanied by First Lady Dorothy McAuliffe, Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry Todd Haymore, Secretary of Health and Human Resources William Hazel, Secretary of Technology Karen Jackson and representatives from Virginia Commonwealth University, the Port of Virginia, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, and the Virginia Museum of Fine Art.
The McAuliffe administration, working in collaboration with the Cuban Embassy and other officials in Havana, has arranged meetings with prospective customers and partners for ten Virginia companies and institutions participating in the mission. Company participants include representatives from Smithfield Foods, Perdue Agribusiness, T. Parker Host, Mountain Lumber Company, Virginia Natural Beef, Forever Oceans, and Onduline North America.
Speaking about the mission, Governor McAuliffe stated, "Virginia has been a leader in the development of relations with Cuba since federal law allowed for the export of foods and agricultural commodities to the country. As relations between our nations continue to normalize, this mission will further enhance Virginia's position by expanding current agricultural export business, achieving new agricultural exports, and opening the doors to future collaboration into additional sectors that are key to our efforts to build a new Virginia economy."
