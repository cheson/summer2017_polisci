Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) received an additional $55.5 million in federal funds that was originally allocated to other states. Since they did not have projects ready to go to use the funding, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) reallocated the money to Virginia and other states that have projects in the pipeline ready for work to begin.
The bonus money will fund work to re-pave 400 lane miles of roadways across the state and improve 17 interstate bridges.
"Virginia aggressively pursues federal dollars for transportation, maximizing all resources available, which leaves us in an excellent position to get more funding," said Governor McAuliffe. "By carefully investing federal tax dollars to deliver road and bridge improvements and having projects ready to go, we have put our Commonwealth in a position to benefit from additional funds that would have gone to other states. My administration is committed to spending every single transportation dollar to ease congestion and help build a new Virginia economy."
