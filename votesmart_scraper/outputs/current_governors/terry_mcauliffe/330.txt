Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that Virginia's new data-driven prioritization process scored nearly 300 transportation projects proposed by localities and regional planning bodies across the state. The scoring is a key part of a new law, known as House Bill 2, developed on a bipartisan basis with House Speaker William Howell and Delegate Chris Stolle to invest limited tax dollars in the right transportation projects. Transportation Secretary Aubrey Layne also released a list of recommended projects to be funded based on the results of the scores, which will be reviewed and considered by the Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB) over the next five months.
