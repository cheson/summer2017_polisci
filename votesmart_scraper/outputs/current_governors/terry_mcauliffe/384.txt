Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia has been awarded nearly $3 million in federal funding to help ease difficulties older adults and people with disabilities may face when they seek support services from state agencies, health care systems and community organizations.
The Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services won two grants from the Administration on Community Living to expand Virginia's No Wrong Door system and further streamline access to long-term services that allow individuals to remain in the community.
"This grant money will help the No Wrong Door program connect Virginians to services faster, help them understand their options for support and assistance, provide successful transitions for those returning home after a hospital stay, and allow service providers to better understand what's happening in the individuals' lives between doctor visits," said Governor McAuliffe. "We welcome these federal funds because they help us to improve access to and quality of health care services for Virginians, while making the system more efficient for our taxpayers."
