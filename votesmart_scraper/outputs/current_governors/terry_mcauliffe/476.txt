Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia has been awarded $5.4 million in federal Community Planning Assistance Funds from the Department of Defense Office of Economic Adjustment.

Additionally, the grant will provide funding to expand entrepreneurship opportunities for defense-related employees and businesses, and to support displaced defense contractors seek other employment opportunities.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "Virginia has taken the lead in identifying businesses potentially impacted by the recent defense reductions and worked with state, community, and business leaders to develop meaningful programs to address the issues. In order to build a new Virginia economy, we must create an environment where businesses can thrive even in the face of federal cuts. With these funds, Virginia will provide direct support to companies as they transition to alternative markets."
