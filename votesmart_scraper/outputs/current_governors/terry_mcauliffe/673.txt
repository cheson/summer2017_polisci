Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today on the U.S. Interior Department's Mid-Atlantic Offshore Plan:
"Today's announcement by the U.S. Department of the Interior is a positive step toward responsible offshore energy development that will create jobs and economic activity, while helping our Commonwealth diversify its energy resources. If we proceed in a smart and safe way, we can unlock gas, oil, and wind assets offshore while protecting our environment and Virginia's close relationship with the Department of Defense and other key stakeholders. I will continue to work with the Obama administration on this important issue to move our energy economy forward."
