Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Schaffner MTC Transformers, a developer and manufacturer of standard and custom components and high-performance transformers, will invest $3.1 million to expand its operation in the Town of Wytheville in Wythe County. Virginia successfully competed against Ohio for the project, which is expected to create in the coming years 79 new jobs paying above the average prevailing wage in the region.
Speaking about today's announcement at an event in Wytheville, Governor McAuliffe said, "Helping advanced manufacturing companies like Schaffner MTC Transformers expand and create jobs in communities that need them is a key component of my administration's efforts to build a new Virginia economy.
