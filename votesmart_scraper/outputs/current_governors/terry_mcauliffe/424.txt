Governor McAuliffe announced today that September general fund revenue increased 9.7% from September a year ago with payroll withholding and individual nonwithholding contributing to the increase. September completes the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 and is a significant month for revenue collections. Estimated payments from individuals, corporations, and insurance companies are all due in September, along with regular monthly collections in withholding, sales taxes, and other sources.
On a fiscal year-to-date basis, total revenue collections rose 2.4 percent, well ahead of the annual forecast of a 0.1 percent decline. Speaking to the increase, Governor McAuliffe said, "The Virginia economy continues to improve as we have stepped up our efforts on the economic development front over the last year. While I remain cautious about the challenges and risks associated with federal activity in Virginia, it is nice to see positive results from our hard work to attract new businesses to the Commonwealth and to diversify the Virginia economy."
