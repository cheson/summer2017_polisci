Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Nov. 24, 2015
Location: Muscat, Oman

Governor Terry McAuliffe visited Oman this weekend during his trade and marketing mission to India and the Middle East to celebrate the lifting of the country's ban on poultry imports from Virginia and many other states. The announcement followed several months of discussions between the Governor's office and the Embassy of Oman, including Oman's Ambassador to the United States, Her Excellency Hunaina Sultan Al-Mughairy, and culminated in meetings Sunday between Governor McAuliffe and Oman's Ministers of Commerce & Industry and Agricultural Affairs & Fish Resources.
"This is another great win in the international market for Virginia's agriculture industry," said Governor McAuliffe. "As we begin to place a strategic focus on the Middle East, I am pleased to open access once again for our poultry producers to a growing export destination. I want to thank Ambassador Al-Mughairy and the government of Oman for working with us and our federal partners at the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) to end the country's ban on poultry from Virginia. It's steps like these that will keep Virginia agricultural producers competitive in the world market and lead Virginia to become the East Coast capital for agricultural and forestry exports."
