Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today after the White House and congressional negotiators announced a bipartisan budget agreement:
"I am pleased by reports of a bipartisan budget deal that would provide a two-year relief from the potentially crippling effects of a long continuing resolution and the sequestration-level cuts that would do great damage to Virginia's economy. President Obama deserves credit for standing his ground and insisting on reasonable investments in defense and domestic priorities that will make our nation safer, stronger and more prosperous. This deal will also provide relief for American seniors and those with disabilities who simply cannot afford to pay the exorbitant premium hikes or benefit cuts that were scheduled to take effect.
"I am eager to see this deal pass so that we can work confidently on building a new Virginia economy free from uncertainty that congressional dysfunction has created for the entire country. This is a positive step forward, and we can only hope that it is the beginning of a new chapter of bipartisan cooperation in Washington that enhances our efforts to create jobs and economic growth rather than hampers them.
