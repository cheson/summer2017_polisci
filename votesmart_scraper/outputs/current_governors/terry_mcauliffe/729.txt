Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Black Hops Farm, LLC will initially convert 15 acres of former pasture land into a hopsyard and build a new processing facility, thus becoming the largest hopsyard in Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic's first commercial-scale hops production and processing facility. The new Black Hops Farm facility will revolutionize the hops industry in Virginia, allowing hops growers to harvest and process efficiently their hops for market. The new processing capacity will enable existing Virginia producers to move assuredly in expanding their production and will encourage new producers to enter the market by removing key barriers to the profitable production and marketing of local hops. In addition to supporting current and prospective hops producers, the facility will benefit Virginia's craft brewery industry as a whole by increasing the amount of hops produced in the state, as well as their quality and their ability to be used by a greater number of brewers.
