Governor McAuliffe released the following statement on the Silver Line project's declaration of substantial completion:
"This morning I spoke with MWAA President and CEO Jack Potter, who informed me that his organization views Phase 1 of the Silver Line as "substantially complete' and is working with WMATA to move the project closer to passenger readiness. After receiving a thorough briefing from Jack and his team earlier this week, I am confident that this project is moving forward in a safe and fiscally responsible way. Going forward, I plan to continue to work with the officials responsible for the Silver Line to see that it is completed quickly and safely so that Virginia commuters and our economy can begin receiving the benefit of this important project for our Commonwealth."
