Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today the award of a $35,000 planning grant from the Governor's Agriculture and Forestry Industries Development (AFID) Fund to the Virginia Oyster Trail project by the Northern Neck Planning District Commission (PDC) and partner communities throughout the Middle Peninsula and Eastern Shore. The AFID planning grant program encourages local governments to promote agriculture and forestry and incorporate the needs of these industries into their strategic economic development plans.
"Identifying and supporting initiatives that strengthen agriculture while promoting tourism build on these crucial sectors of our economy, and pave the way for future innovative collaborations," said Governor McAuliffe. "Programs like the Virginia Oyster Trail will continue to diversify the economy in these regions and attract visitors and jobs to these communities. Supporting Virginia's diverse agricultural sectors is a key part of my plan to build the new Virginia economy."
