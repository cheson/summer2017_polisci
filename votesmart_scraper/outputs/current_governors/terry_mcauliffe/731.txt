Today, Governor Terry McAuliffe signed an executive order establishing the Commonwealth Council on Bridging the Nutritional Divide, which will be chaired by First Lady Dorothy McAuliffe.
"A critical component in building a new Virginia economy is ensuring that no Virginia child or family goes hungry," said Governor McAuliffe. "By using the assets unique to Virginia, we can bridge this nutritional divide, put more Virginians on pathways to success, and at the same time grow our local agriculture economies. I look forward to the great work the Council will do to benefit our communities and all Virginia children and families. "
"With the formation of this council, we are making clear our belief that, in order to cultivate and sustain economic success, all Virginians must have access to nutritious foods that will enable them to learn, grow, and thrive," said First Lady Dorothy McAuliffe. "With the formation of this Council we're saying enough with the tightrope, now we start building a bridge."
The Commonwealth Council on Bridging the Nutritional Divide will work to help solve childhood hunger in the Commonwealth, promote Virginia's agriculture economy, and support local programs related to community nutrition, food access, and health strategies.
The Council will include representatives from both the McAuliffe administration and the private sector. This public-private partnership will be tasked with finding innovative ways to ensure that Virginia pursues new opportunities, as well as every federal dollar and program currently available that promotes healthy living, nutrition, and our local food programs.
