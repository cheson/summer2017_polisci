Governor McAuliffe Statement on Latest Setback in WMATA Executive Director Search
Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Nov. 2, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement in response to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's (WMATA) announcement that a leading candidate for the organization's long-vacant Executive Director position is no longer under consideration:
"I am outraged by the latest setback in a process that would be comical if the need for new leadership at Metro were not so great. Identifying and hiring a qualified General Manager is the WMATA Board's chief responsibility and the first step that must be taken in order to oversee the safety and operational changes that are essential to Metro's long-term sustainability. The leaks and petty political sniping that have come to define the work of this board are harming the Metro system and the economy of the region it serves. The time has long passed for the Board of Directors to bring this process to a close, or for the governments that comprise the system to find board members who will."
