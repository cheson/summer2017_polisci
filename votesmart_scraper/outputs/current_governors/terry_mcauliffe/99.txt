Governor Terry McAuliffe announced his actions to balance Virginia's Fiscal Year 2016-2017 budgets in response to a revenue shortfall. The Governor's plan reduces spending while protecting core priorities like education, public safety and health care.
"The budget actions we are taking today respond to the Commonwealth's revenue shortfall without making program cuts to core priorities that are essential to our efforts to build a new Virginia economy," said Governor McAuliffe, speaking at the announcement today. "There will be no program cuts to public education, Medicaid for our families most in need, nor our core public safety services. We did not kick our budget problems to local governments by reducing payments to cities, counties or towns. These are obviously difficult decisions to make and there may be more to come, but I am confident that the progress and investments we are making today will put Virginia on course for strong growth well into the future."
