Governor Terry McAuliffe issued the following statement on the passing of Civil Rights Leader Julian Bond:
"Julian Bond helped to move all Americans forward, creating a more welcoming nation for all people, regardless of their race, religion or whom they love. In countless Civil Rights marches, he was at the front, taking the lead in the pursuit of progress. When this country threatened to retreat into violence and hardened prejudice, he was the courageous voice calling us back to the principles of equality and respect for all men and women. Julian Bond showed us what a life of purpose means and what it can accomplish. When we vote, when we speak out against injustice, when we pursue an education for ourselves and our children, we honor his name."
