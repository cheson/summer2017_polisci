Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today following confirmation that University of Virginia student Hannah Graham's remains were found outside of Charlottesville earlier this month:
"Words cannot express Dorothy's and my sorrow over the news of Hannah Graham's passing, or the sympathy that we feel for her family, friends and all of the Virginians who have kept them in their thoughts and prayers. I want to thank the sheriff's deputies, police officers, emergency personnel, and volunteers who searched day after day in the hope of finding Hannah. Our hearts are broken by today's news, but that will not diminish our resolve to get justice for Hannah and her family."
