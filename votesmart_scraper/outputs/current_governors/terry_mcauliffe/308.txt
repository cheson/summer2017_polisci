Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Emser Tile, the leading designer, marketer and producer of the world's finest tile and natural stone, will invest $16.25 million to establish an East Coast distribution operation in CenterPoint Intermodal Center in the City of Suffolk.

This new distribution location in the City of Suffolk will allow strategic access to customers and unrivaled logistics efficiency through the Port of Virginia.The Commonwealth's distribution base remains strong and continues to grow, and we are proud to add Emser Tile to the roster as we diversify and build a new Virginia economy."
The Virginia Economic Development Partnership worked with the City of Suffolk and the Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance to secure the project for Virginia. Governor McAuliffe approved a $250,000 grant from the Commonwealth's Opportunity Fund to assist Suffolk with the project. The company will receive benefits from the Port of Virginia Economic and Infrastructure Development Zone Grant Program, and funding and services to support the company's employee training activities will be provided through the Virginia Jobs Investment Program.
