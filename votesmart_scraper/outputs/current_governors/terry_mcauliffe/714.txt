Location: Roanoke, WV

Governor Terry McAuliffe today presented 10 farmers with 2014 Virginia Grand Basin Clean Water Farm Awards for implementing practices to protect water quality. The governor also recognized the first Virginians to implement an agricultural resource management plan under a newly created program.
The presentations took place in Roanoke at the annual meeting of the Virginia Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts.
"I applaud these farmers and farm owners for doing what's right for their businesses and what's right for our natural resources," Governor McAuliffe said. "They have chosen to take important steps toward protecting water quality across the Commonwealth. Winners of the Virginia Grand Basin Clean Water Farm Award stand out because of their exemplary implementation of conservation practices that, in many cases, also improve their financial bottom line. They truly are role models for producers across the state."
The Clean Water Farm Award recognizes farm owners and operators who have adopted and implemented innovative conservation tools, technologies and practices that reduce the amount of runoff pollution entering local waters. Each recipient was nominated for the award by their local Soil and Water Conservation District. Top winners are selected from each of Virginia's 10 major river drainage basins.
"Only with the continued hard work and commitment of our agricultural producers will we be able to meet our water quality goals for all of Virginia, including the Chesapeake Bay" said Secretary of Natural Resources Molly Ward. "These farmers show that water quality protection and profitable and sustainable farming go hand in hand and I applaud their accomplishments."
