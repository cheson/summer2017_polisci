Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia has been awarded more than $50 million in federal Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funds from the Justice Department's Office for Victims of Crime (OVC). This year's award is more than four times the amount the state received in 2014. Funds will support and improve services for crime victims.
"April marked the 20th anniversary of the Virginia's Victims' Bill of Rights. We have made great progress over the years, but there is a great deal yet to do," said Governor McAuliffe. "VOCA funds, in tandem with state support, have played a key role in our efforts, and this increase will give us a great opportunity to expand services for crime victims."
