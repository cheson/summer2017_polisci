Kicking off a campaign swing through Virginia with Terry McAuliffe, former President Bill Clinton urged voters in Dale City today to "come together" and show up at the polls Nov. 5.
"I believe Terry will be a great governor of Virginia," Clinton told a cheering crowd of supporters on Sunday afternoon, but he cautioned that voters shouldn't be too complacent about the other side despite the favorable polls.
