Governor Terry McAuliffe was honored this week by The Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress with the prestigious Publius Award. The award is presented to individuals who demonstrate pragmatism and bipartisanship in public service.
"It's a great honor to receive this recognition," said Governor McAuliffe. "With partisan battles stifling progress in Washington, D.C., it's vitally important that Virginia leaders work together to make life better for the people we serve. I am so proud of our accomplishments this year and the affirmative steps we have taken in collaboration with members of both parties to build a new Virginia economy. I hope the solid bipartisan foundation now in place will enable us to set aside ideological differences and continue to find common cause on behalf of our constituents."
McAuliffe was recognized for his tireless service and leadership in diversifying Virginia's economy in response to federal spending cuts while restoring trust in leadership through ethics reforms. He has worked with the Republican-led state legislature to implement major economic development policies.
Michigan Governor Rick Snyder was also recognized with the Publius Award this week. He and Governor McAuliffe are the first sitting Governors to receive the Publius Award. They work closely together as leaders of the Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee of the National Governors Association.
