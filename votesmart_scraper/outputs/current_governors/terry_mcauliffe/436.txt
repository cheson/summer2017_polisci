Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today the promising results of a collaborative public-private initiative to explore the safeguards needed to protect Virginia's citizens and public safety agencies from cyber security attacks targeting automobiles. Introduced in May, this is one of the first spin-off activities of the Virginia Cyber Security Commission and Virginia Cyber Security Partnership. The presentation is one of several taking place Wednesday and Thursday during the "Commonwealth of Virginia Cyber Security -- Unmanned Systems Technology Showcase" in Chesterfield County.
"I applaud our hardworking partners on this important, collaborative cyber security initiative," Governor McAuliffe said. "This invaluable research is essential for the Commonwealth to advance its objectives to safeguard our drivers, their vehicles and, especially, our public safety professionals. The data and protocols derived from this project are some of the first of their kind in the nation, and will be instrumental in facilitating a more universal discussion about how to preserve the security of vehicles."
