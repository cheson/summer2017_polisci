Governor McAuliffe announced today that May revenue collections increased 6.4 percent from a year ago. On a fiscal year-to-date basis, total revenue collections rose 1.9 percent, behind the annual forecast of 3.2 percent growth.
Governor McAuliffe stated "Although collections were positive for the month, payroll withholding and sales tax collections continue to underperform estimates, underscoring the need to continue creating new, high-paying jobs across the Commonwealth. As we near the end of the fiscal year, my team is working to mitigate any potential revenue shortfall by asking state agencies to conserve discretionary funds and implement budget strategies to save money in June for use in the next biennial budget. If we work together, we can offset a potential shortfall while protecting the investments we need to build a new Virginia economy."
