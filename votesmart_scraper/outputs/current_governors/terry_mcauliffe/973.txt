Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuilffe released the following statement regarding Ken Cuccinelli's refusal to condemn his Tea Party allies forcing a government shutdown in an effort to further their ideological agenda:

"Today my opponent confirmed that he is more concerned with appeasing his extreme Tea Party allies than protecting the economic well-being of Virginia. His refusal to stand up to the radical Republicans in Congress who, in their zeal to push an ideological agenda, forced a government shutdown, reinforced the fact that he is more closely aligned with the extreme faction of his party than mainstream Virginians.
"What Virginia and our nation need now are strong leaders who will work together to find a bipartisan solution to get our government back up and running, and mitigate the effects that a shutdown will have on Virginia's economic growth and middle class families across the Commonwealth."
