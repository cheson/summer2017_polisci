Governor Terry McAuliffe today congratulated nine Virginia counties that received top rankings in the 2014 Digital Counties Survey.
"These counties were recognized from among hundreds of counties that participated in the survey for successfully using technology for citizen engagement, policy, data and operations," said Governor McAuliffe. "Technology presents significant opportunities for producing more efficient and effective services to citizens. It strengthens the Commonwealth and improves our prospects for economic development. I commend these local governments for their use of technology and congratulate them on this well-deserved recognition."
In the "Up to 150,000 population category," Roanoke County received first-place honors for "projects around geographic information systems (GIS), radio and governance.
