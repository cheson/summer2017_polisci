Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that Virginia has received a $300,000 competitive grant from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to implement the Governor's energy efficiency goals, including lowering energy consumption in the Commonwealth by ten percent in 2020. The Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy (DMME) will receive the grant.
