Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that nearly 421,900 Virginians have signed up for health insurance through the federal marketplace, exceeding expectations that enrollment would reach 400,000 this year in the Commonwealth.
That number reflects total enrollment through the end of the most recent open enrollment period on January 31. The federal marketplace was created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to provide more Americans with health coverage options.
