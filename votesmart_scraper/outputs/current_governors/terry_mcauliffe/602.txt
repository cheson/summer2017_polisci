Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced $2.1 million in Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) awards for eight projects in the Appalachian Region, which encompasses 25 counties and eight independent cities in Southwest Virginia.
Speaking at today's announcement at an event in Lexington, Governor McAuliffe said, "Virginia's Appalachian Region is poised for growth. By funding projects that support job creation, asset-based growth, workforce development, infrastructure and entrepreneurism, we are helping build the new Virginia economy in this region and the Commonwealth as a whole."
Established in 1965, the general goal of the ARC program is to assist the region in achieving economic progress on par with the nation's overall prosperity. ARC grants are broadly aimed at funding projects that support the goal of building a strong and sustainable asset-based economy. They help bring jobs and prosperity to Appalachian communities while preserving their character.
"The ARC program supports a region of Virginia that has the natural, cultural, artisan and heritage assets that make it a treasured part of the Commonwealth," said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones. "These projects will assist in the transformation of the communities in the Appalachian region, making them even greater places to live, work and play."
