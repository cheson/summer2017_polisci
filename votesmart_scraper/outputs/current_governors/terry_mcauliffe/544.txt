Following several months of meetings and input from local and regional governments, the Commonwealth Transportation (CTB) today approved a new scoring process for transportation projects. Once projects are scored, the CTB will have the best information possible to select the right projects for funding.
"The scoring process is about investing tax dollars in the projects that will generate the greatest return on investment for Virginians in terms of easing congestion and stimulating economic growth," said Governor Terry McAuliffe. "I was proud to work with Speaker Howell and the General Assembly to pass the legislation that established this scoring process so that we can make transportation planning decisions based on sound data, not on the political whims that have defined our process for too long. This new process will improve our transportation decision-making so that we can invest in the infrastructure we need to build a new Virginia economy."
"The law known as House Bill 2 (HB2) will improve transparency and accountability because the public will know how projects scored and the decisions behind the CTB's project selections," added Transportation Secretary Aubrey Layne. "The Commonwealth developed the scoring process in collaboration with localities across the state so their particular needs are addressed."
Since the beginning of the year, the state held numerous meetings, involving more than 200 representatives from local and regional governments to integrate their input, including more than 300 written comments, into the scoring process. The CTB also held public hearings in each of the nine construction districts that included opportunities for residents to learn and comment on the scoring process.
