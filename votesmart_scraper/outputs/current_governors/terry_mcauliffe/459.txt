Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia has received $578,500 in grant funding from the U.S. Small Business Administration's State Trade and Export Promotion (STEP) Grant Program. The STEP grant is designed to increase the number of small businesses that are exporting and to raise the value of exports for those small businesses that are currently exporting.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "International trade is a key part of my plan to create private sector jobs and build a new Virginia economy that is less reliant on the federal government. By providing resources and services to increase international trade, we help Virginia businesses find new customers around the world and, in turn, create new jobs for Virginians. We are pleased to continue this effective partnership with our federal partners to provide assistance to even more of Virginia's small businesses."
