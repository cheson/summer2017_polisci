Statement

Location: Richmond, VA

Today, Governor McAuliffe announced that the City of Newport News and a contractor for the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility have agreed on principles to transfer property needed for a major expansion of the lab. Last week in Washington, the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) announced its recommendation for construction of a billion dollar Electron Ion Collider. Jefferson Lab is one of two sites vying for the new U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility.
"I applaud Newport News and the lab's contractor for working out this important agreement. I was glad that my administration could play a role in helping broker an important step toward landing such a big new investment and science facility for the Commonwealth of Virginia," said Governor McAuliffe.
