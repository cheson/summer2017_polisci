Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced $2.7 million in new federal Local Emergency Management Performance Grants (LEMPG) to help localities plan and respond to emergencies in their areas. The Virginia Department of Emergency Management will administer funds, which are from the fiscal year 2016 Emergency Management Performance Grant program. Virginia receives these funds each year from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
"These grants will help enable our emergency planning and first responder agencies to acquire the tools, equipment, and other resources necessary to protect our citizens and keep Virginia safe," said Governor McAuliffe. "From severe weather to terrorism, Virginia responders are expected to prepare for a wide range of events that could threaten lives or property anywhere in our Commonwealth. Funds like these will help the Commonwealth continue to collaborate with local and federal emergency management agencies and organizations to be as ready as possible to keep families and communities safe when the next unexpected event occurs."
"This funding will improve Virginia's emergency preparedness and make the Commonwealth more resilient to emergencies or disasters," said Brian Moran, Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security. "The LEMPG program plays an important role in supporting the building, sustainment, and delivery of emergency management capabilities."
