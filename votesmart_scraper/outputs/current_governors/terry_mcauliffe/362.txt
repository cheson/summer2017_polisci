Today Governor McAuliffe and the Virginia Council on Women announced the 5th annual STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Essay Contest for high school junior and senior girls.
The Council will award five $5,000 scholarships to female junior or senior high school students who will be pursuing a STEM career at an institution of higher education. One scholarship will be awarded in each of five geographic regions across the state. Additional scholarships may be awarded at the discretion of the Council.
The STEM Essay Contest was launched in 2012 with 170 young ladies from across the Commonwealth submitting essays focusing on the student's vision for a future STEM education or career. The Council raised $10,000 and made three scholarship awards.
Last year, the Council received 381 essay submissions and thanks to the generosity of sponsors, distributed $33,000 in scholarships to five girls.
Speaking about the contest, Governor Terry McAuliffe said, "Encouraging all of our students to learn and succeed in high demand STEM fields is critical to Virginia's ability to compete in the 21st Century economy. I am pleased that the Virginia Council on Women and the Science Museum of Virginia are offering this contest yet again, and expanding their efforts to encourage Virginia's young women to lead the future in these key areas. Innovative ideas like the STEM Essay Contest help open our students to new learning experiences and strengthen Virginia's ability to prepare our children for future success."
