Governor McAuliffe Statement on Redistricting Ruling
Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe issued the following statement in response to today's federal court ruling.
"The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has made it clear for the third time that the Commonwealth's gerrymandered maps are unacceptable and must be redrawn.
"I expected this result. It is obvious that existing congressional maps are an unconstitutional tactic to deny Virginia voters, and particularly African-American voters, a full voice in choosing their leaders. That is why I called a special session for later this month and why, on July 28, I issued a letter inviting lawmakers to join me at the state Capitol to work together on new maps based on the principles of equal representation, compact and contiguous districts, and the integrity of communities of interest.
