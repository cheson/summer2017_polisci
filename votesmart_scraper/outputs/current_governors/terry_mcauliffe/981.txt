During the negotiations over the state budget this year, Governor McDonnell and both parties in the legislature found a compromise on the issue of Medicaid expansion in Virginia. It will provide Virginia some flexibility and also make it possible for Virginia to accept federal funds to expand Medicaid.
According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the federal government is offering Virginia $21 billion in funding over seven years to expand our Medicaid program. If we don't accept the money, it will simply flow to other states. I believe that Virginia taxpayer money should stay in Virginia.
