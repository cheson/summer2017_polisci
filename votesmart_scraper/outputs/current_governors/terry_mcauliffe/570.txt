Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced the formation of the Governor's Executive Committee on Energy Efficiency. The Executive Committee is comprised of public and private sector stakeholders that will develop strategies and recommendations to achieve the goal of a ten percent reduction in retail electricity consumption in the Commonwealth by 2020. This goal was originally recommended in the 2007 Virginia Energy Plan by then Governor Tim Kaine, and Governor McAuliffe has accelerated the timeline of achieving this goal by two years to 2020.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "The energy sector is a key strategic growth area as we work to build a new Virginia economy, and improving energy efficiency is one of the real opportunities. I have put together this talented group of people to help ensure that we meet our goal in an accelerated time frame."
The Executive Committee will be overseen by Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones and will be staffed by the Energy Division of the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy.
"Businesses grow and prosper when they are maximizing the efficient use of their resources," said Secretary Jones. "This committee will provide guidance and recommend tools to help businesses increase efficient use of energy while reducing their energy costs. Energy efficiency is good for business, good for the environment and good for the economy."
