Virginia Prisoners To Be Eligible For College Credit Classes
Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: March 17, 2016
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that Virginia will become the only state in the nation to offer state prisoners college credit for five career and technical education courses recommended by the American Council on Education's College Credit Recommendation Service (ACE CREDITÂ®).
ACE CREDIT recommendations enable learners to submit an ACE transcript for completed courses to higher education institutions for evaluation as potential transfer credit in a degree program, much as they would from a traditional institution of higher learning. Decisions about acceptance of credit are made by individual colleges and universities.
