With the first 72 days in office, we have worked together with our Republican friends in the legislature, to find common ground on many issues, including SOL reform, transforming our mental health system, restructuring workforce development, prioritizing transportation projects and growing our economy. I just want to highlight some of these accomplishments.
Few issues came up more often in my campaign for Governor than the Standards of Learning (SOL) program. We know that the SOLs are not meeting the needs of our students, parents or teachers.
Therefore, SOL reform was a main priority for my administration this General Assembly Session. With the introduction of SOL reform bills by Delegates Tag Greason and Rob Krupicka, and Senator John Miller and others, we were able to work in concert with legislators, parents and education experts to begin making progress on the important work of reforming our standardized testing system.
