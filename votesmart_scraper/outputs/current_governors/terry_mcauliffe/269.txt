Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: March 15, 2016
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today after the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced that the Atlantic Coast will not be included in the next five-year oil and gas leasing program:
"Today's announcement is an opportunity to work with the Department of Defense to address the concerns they have raised, and to ensure that any offshore energy exploration is coupled with a revenue sharing agreement that benefits our Commonwealth. This announcement should also serve as motivation to expand and diversify Virginia's energy economy in every sector, with a particular focus on renewables. By bringing public and private sector partners together Virginia can become a global leader in clean energy technologies and create the next generation of energy jobs along the way."
