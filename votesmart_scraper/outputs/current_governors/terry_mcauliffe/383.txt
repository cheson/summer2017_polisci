Location: Mumbai, India

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced new export sales of Virginia apples by Crown Orchard Company to a major Indian importer during his trade and marketing mission to the Middle East and India. The deal is a significant development that strengthens Virginia's partnership with one of the world's largest economies and population bases.
Speaking about the new export deal, Governor McAuliffe said, "I am pleased to announce this new sale of Crown's 2015 apple crop into the highly competitive Indian produce market. The primary goal of my mission to the Middle East and India is to pursue trade opportunities and new investments for the Commonwealth, and this is exactly the type of result I want to achieve for our Virginia companies. After opening the Indian apple market for Virginia producers last year, it was important that we continue that momentum and push hard to expand those sales. Export deals like this one play a vital role in generating additional revenue and jobs for the Commonwealth and are critical to my work to build a new Virginia economy."
