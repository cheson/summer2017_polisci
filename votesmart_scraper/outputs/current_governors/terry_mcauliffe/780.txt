Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement in response to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia's decision declaring Virginia's congressional map unconstitutional:
"Today's ruling demonstrates the need to get partisan politics out of how Virginia draws its legislative boundaries.
"The court's order to redraw our congressional map is an opportunity to emerge with a map that reflects the best interests of Virginia families, not the political interests of the people drawing the lines.
"I hope my friends in the General Assembly will join me in taking this opportunity to draw districts that are more compact, contiguous, and reflective of the shared interests that unite many of our communities."
