Today, Governor McAuliffe, Secretary of Technology Karen Jackson, and Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones hosted a statewide, virtual town hall on Technology-based Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the University of Virginia. The video conference connected seven sites around the Commonwealth, allowing the Governor and his team to gather input from a diverse group of entrepreneurs, academia, and other stakeholders on topics related to building the New Virginia Economy.
The Governor and the Secretaries used this opportunity to hear from entrepreneurs and innovators on strategies the Commonwealth could employ to strengthen Virginia's ability to attract and produce entrepreneurs and make Virginia a more attractive location for transformational research and innovation.
"Making our Commonwealth the world's best home to innovators and entrepreneurs is at the heart of building a new Virginia economy," said Governor McAuliffe. "I was thrilled today to interact with so many Virginians who will be at the center of our efforts to create new jobs and grow our economy. I look forward to continuing this discussion and working with our innovators to put Virginia entrepreneurs, communities and families in the best position to succeed."
The major discussion points include the need to fund early-stage and proof-of-concept research; the need to connect innovators, startup companies and research teams with high-caliber entrepreneurial talent and the recognition of a statewide culture of entrepreneurship.
