Governor McAuliffe Vetoes Legislation Restricting Access to Health Care

Pursuant to Article V, Section 6, of the Constitution of Virginia, I veto House Bill 1090, which would prohibit the Virginia Department of Health from entering into contracts or providing funds to any entity that performs or maintains/operates a facility performing non-federally qualified abortions.
This bill, aimed at Planned Parenthood, would harm tens of thousands of Virginians who rely on the health care services and programs provided by Planned Parenthood health centers by denying them access to affordable care. The fact is that Virginians, and particularly low-income Virginians, need more access to health care, not less.
If Virginia takes federal dollars, then Virginia must abide by federal rules. As a stipulation of accepting federal family planning funding under Title X, Virginia must be fair in selecting which entities receive it.
Virginia cannot add this limitation set forth in House Bill 1090 without violating the Supremacy Clause. Similar laws enacted in North Carolina and Texas were struck down by federal courts for this exact reason.
If we are going to build a new, more vibrant Virginia economy, we need to be opening up doors to quality, affordable health care, not closing them. I have promised to stand in the way of any and all attempts to interfere with a woman's right to make her own health care decisions.
Accordingly, I veto this bill.
Sincerely,
Terence R. McAuliffe
