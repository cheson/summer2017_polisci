Governor McAuliffe Announces Decrease in Virginia Unemployment Rate
Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Nov. 20, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor McAuliffe announced today that Virginia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate decreased 0.1 percentage point in October to 4.2 percent, the fourth consecutive monthly decline.
At 4.2 percent, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is at its lowest level since August 2008 when it was also 4.2 percent. Virginia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remains below the national rate, which fell 0.1 percentage point in October to 5.0 percent.
October was the 19th consecutive month of year-over-year employment growth in the Commonwealth.
Speaking from India where he is on an international trade mission, Governor McAuliffe said, "Virginia's continued job growth is a clear indicator that our efforts to build a new Virginia economy are paying off. These new jobs numbers are encouraging, but the looming threats of sequestration and congressional dysfunction mean we cannot afford to let up one bit. The budget and legislative agenda I will put forward for the upcoming session will be devoted entirely to laying the foundation for continued economic growth now and for generations to come. I look forward to working across the aisle to continue our progress creating jobs and improving Virginians' lives."
