Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today the launch of VirginiaSAVES, the Commonwealth's first Green Community Program. VirginiaSAVES is a loan program created to lower financing costs for energy efficiency, renewable energy generation and alternative fuel projects. This low-cost financing tool will be available to local government, institutional and commercial and industrial entities in the Commonwealth. VirginiaSAVES will be funded through $20 million in federally-allocated Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs).
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "Providing the public and private sectors with the tools they need to reduce energy consumption and save on energy costs is critical for building a new Virginia economy. VirginiaSAVES encourages investments that will save money, improve energy security, reduce Virginia's dependence on federal spending and attract new jobs and advanced energy industries."
