Statement

Date: Oct. 19, 2016
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor McAuliffe today announced the permit for a new solar farm under development by Correctional Solar LLC, a subsidiary of Virginia Solar. The facility will be built in New Kent County and will generate enough electricity to cleanly power around 3,400 homes, averaged annually over its planned 35-year lifespan.
"Solar energy is a central part of the comprehensive energy approach Virginia needs to keep costs low for businesses, families and taxpayers as we build a new Virginia economy," said Governor McAuliffe. "The new solar facility in New Kent County is a significant step toward diversifying the region's energy mix and demonstrates that Virginia is an ideal location for a thriving solar industry. We will continue to invest in energy infrastructure and support innovative approaches to bring low-cost, renewable energy to all corners of the Commonwealth."
According to the application, the solar farm will offset 43,632,264 pounds of climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the project will help prevent the release of 32,736 pounds of nitrogen oxide and 51,442 pounds of sulfur oxides, both of which can cause acid rain.
