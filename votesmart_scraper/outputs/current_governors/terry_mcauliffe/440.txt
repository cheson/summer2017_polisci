Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Sept. 29, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that sales of Virginia wine continued their pattern of growth during fiscal year 2015 and reached another record level, increasing by almost two percent from fiscal year 2014. Virginia wineries sold more than 524,000 cases of wine, or over 6.5 million bottles, in fiscal year 2015 versus a little more than 515,000 the previous year (revised figure from final 2014 fiscal year data). Sales of Virginia wine have increased by 26 percent since fiscal year 2010.
"I'm pleased to see continued sales growth for our wines and ciders in Virginia, which means more jobs and revenue across the Commonwealth, especially in our rural areas where most of our wineries and cideries are located," said Governor McAuliffe. "This growth is especially heartening as Virginia wineries are increasing vineyard plantings to meet increased demand for our wines. In addition, Virginia's burgeoning cider industry, along with its very impressive sales growth, is a new shining star in our diverse agricultural economy. Indeed, both craft beverage sectors, along with craft beer and distilled spirits industries, are playing an important role in my administration's work with the private sector to build a new Virginia economy"
