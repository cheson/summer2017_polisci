Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia has received a $4.3 million federal grant from the U.S. Department of Education to help nearly 500 Virginians with disabilities gain new skills and credentials to seek employment in competitive, high-demand, high-quality occupations. The five-year grant will allow the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services (DARS) and the Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired (DBVI) to develop and implement a demonstration project to enhance Virginia's existing regional career pathways systems to serve individuals with disabilities, including young adults and veterans.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "This grant will advance DARS and DBVI's mission to train more Virginians with disabilities to succeed in jobs in industry sectors that are key for building a new Virginia economy. I am proud of the way our agencies are using industry-recognized credentials, employability skills training and assistive technology to empower a workforce to do in-demand jobs for their clients."
