Governor Terry McAuliffe today released the Report of the Commission on Military Installations & Defense Activities. The Commission was established to identify, review and recommend actions that the Commonwealth could take in support of our military installations, their surrounding localities and defense-related activities. The Report is being released as the Commonwealth prepares itself for the latest round of Defense budget reductions.
"We are fortunate to have in Virginia one of the largest concentrations of military and defense activities, facilities, personnel and families in the country," said Governor McAuliffe. "Given the significant economic impact that our military installations and defense activities have on our Commonwealth, and in view of the recently announced proposed Department of Defense budget cuts and potential 2017 Base Realignment and Closure activity, it has never been more vital for us to work hand in hand with our Defense and military partners to ensure the continued vitality of these assets."
