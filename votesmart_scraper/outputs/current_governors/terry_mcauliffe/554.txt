Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: June 3, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe and Results for America today hosted a summit on workforce development to continue our efforts to better prepare Virginia's job seekers with credentials that count in the workplace. Results for America also named Governor McAuliffe a Moneyball for Government All-Star -- the first at the state level.
Speaking about today's event at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College in Richmond, Governor McAuliffe said, "Improving our workforce development system is the most important thing we can do to build a new Virginia economy. Building a business-driven system that better prepares Virginians to do the jobs that are available today and create the jobs of tomorrow is one of my top priorities. We have made good progress over the past 17 months, but there is more work to do to make Virginia a national leader in how we train the workforce of the future."
