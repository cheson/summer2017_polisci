Statement

Today Governor Terry McAuliffe announced a significant increase in the number of Virginia schools earning accreditation in 2015. The increase is the first since 2010 when the state Board of Education took the first in a series of actions to set higher benchmarks for schools, while introducing more challenging academic standards and assessments for students.
"Offering every Virginia student a world class education in a public school is at the very foundation of our efforts to build a new Virginia economy," said Governor McAuliffe. "This year's strong progress is a reflection of the dedicated work of educators, parents and communities and a clear sign that the reforms we have put into place are working. Strategies like allowing expedited Standards of Learning (SOL) retakes are helping more students and schools reach for success by measuring student achievement without pinning their futures on just one high stakes test. I look forward to working with the General Assembly this year to build on this momentum by enhancing our investment in K-12 education and further reforming the SOL's."
