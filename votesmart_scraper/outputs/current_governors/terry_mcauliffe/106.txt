Governor Terry McAuliffe today commissioned Virginia's first community solar project at the BARC Electric facility in Rockbridge, Virginia. BARC Electric has developed the first community solar project for the benefit of the member-owners who reside in Rockbridge, Bath, Highland, Augusta and Alleghany counties.
"Virginia's short- and long-term energy security depends on the investments we make today in energy technology and infrastructure," said Governor McAuliffe, speaking at today's announcement. "BARC's community solar project is an excellent model for stabilizing and reducing energy costs, while delivering clean solar power to large segments of households on the grid. We will continue to invest in energy infrastructure and support innovative approaches to bring low-cost, renewable energy to all corners of the Commonwealth."
