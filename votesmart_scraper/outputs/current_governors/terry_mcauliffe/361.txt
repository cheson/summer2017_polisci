Date: Dec. 17, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today $420,000 in Virginia Community Business Launch (CBL) grants for the towns of Pulaski, Vinton, Marion and Strasburg, as well as the cities of Lynchburg, Petersburg and Martinsville. CBL is designed to assist communities in taking a systems approach to defining and pursuing an asset-based small business development strategy.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "Through the Community Business Launch program, we are helping our communities develop a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem where community-based businesses will continue to grow and thrive. In order to grow, diversify and build a new Virginia economy, we must focus on small business development in communities across the Commonwealth."
The CBL program starts with a community's unique vision for its future and then uses a local business competition to find and foster the entrepreneurs that connect with that vision. CBL provides the tools to effectively prepare multiple entrepreneurs to operate successful businesses in a downtown or neighborhood commercial district and allow them to compete for funding to launch their new endeavor.
