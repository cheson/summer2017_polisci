Governor McAuliffe announced today that Virginia's employment level reached 3,848,000 in November, the highest in the Commonwealth's history. Virginia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was unchanged in November at 4.2 percent, after declining the previous four months. Moreover, initial unemployment claims are at their lowest level in 41 years.
Virginia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remains below the national rate, which was unchanged in November at 5.0 percent.
November was the 20th consecutive month of year-over-year employment growth in the Commonwealth.
Once again, in November, Virginia had the lowest seasonally adjusted unemployment rate among the Southeast states and third-best rate among states east of the Mississippi.
The average weekly wage for private employers was $940.75 in November, which is 3.4 percent above a year ago.
"These latest economic milestones are a clear sign that our efforts to build a new Virginia economy are paying off," said Governor McAuliffe. "I am particularly pleased that our record employment is accompanied by an increase in the average weekly wage for Virginia workers. This is undeniably good news for Virginia, but we cannot afford to let up now. My administration is eager to continue our momentum both by bringing new jobs and investments here in the short term and by making smart investments and policy choices that will lay a foundation for economic growth for decades to come."
