Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia's Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS) has been awarded a $982,400 federal grant from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to help establish Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) across the state. CCBHCs are a component of Virginia's long-term strategy to reform the state's behavioral health system.
"Our administration has prioritized improving delivery of care for mental health and substance abuse, two areas where our community services boards work on the front lines," said Governor McAuliffe. "This project will further that goal, giving Virginians easier and more consistent access to the services they need."
