Good Morning. Thank you for being with me here today.
Today, I am here to announce my actions on the budget for fiscal year 2015. After much deliberation, discussions and hard decisions, I am presenting today the approved budget savings plan.
Before I begin, I want to discuss the process, which is almost as important as the outcome.
When I came into office in January, I promised to work together with the General Assembly to find common ground on issues of importance to all citizens of the Commonwealth. From SOL reform to transportation prioritization to job creation, we came together to make Virginia a better place to live, work and prosper.
