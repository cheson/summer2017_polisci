Statement

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement after President Obama's announcement regarding executive action on firearms:
"The measures announced by the President today are designed to protect all citizens from gun violence by fully enforcing existing laws and taking reasonable steps to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals. The families across our Commonwealth and our nation who have lost loved ones to gun violence make a compelling case for action, and Americans are clearly demanding that their leaders take responsibility to ensure that all businesses involved in the sale of firearms conduct appropriate background checks. It would be a violation of the public trust to ignore their pleas for meaningful protections. If these measures prevent a single family from going through the agony that so many Virginians have experienced, they will be worthwhile."
