Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that he will lead an 11-day trade and marketing mission to the Middle East and India from November 13-24. The Governor will be accompanied by First Lady Dorothy McAuliffe, Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones, Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry Todd Haymore and representatives of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the Port of Virginia. The delegation will visit the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), Dubai, India, Oman, and Kuwait.
"International marketing missions are a critical component of Virginia's aggressive and pro-active approach to economic development. They provide the best opportunity to personally convince corporate leaders to invest in Virginia and bring jobs back for our citizens," said Governor McAuliffe. "International trade also plays a vital role in my strategy to build a new Virginia economy and mitigate the impact of federal defense cuts. Our goal is to help existing Virginia businesses succeed in the global arena, and trade missions are a key component to reaching new markets, expanding existing ones, and building customers and revenue streams around the world while sharing Virginia's pro-business story."
