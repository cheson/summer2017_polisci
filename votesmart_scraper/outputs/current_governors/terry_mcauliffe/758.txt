State and local emergency responders on site during tonight's attempted launch of Orbital Sciences Corp's Anteres rocket and Cygnus cargo spacecraft at Pad 0A of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility quickly jumped into action to contain the fire and secure the scene following the accident. No injuries have been reported and all personnel from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport and NASA's Wallops Flight Facility have been accounted for.
"Virginia state and local emergency responders are playing a vital role in the wake of this evening's failed launch on Wallops Island," said Governor McAuliffe. "Going forward, Virginia transportation, safety and environmental quality officials are ready to assist NASA and Orbital in assessing the impact of this evening's accident and mitigating any environmental or public safety concerns."
Responders included Wallops Island, Accomack County and towns of Chincoteague and Assateague fire departments, and Accomack Sheriff's Department as well as state assistance from State Police and the Departments of Transportation and Emergency Management. The Department of Environmental Quality will assess whether there are any pollution concerns.
NASA has encouraged members of the public to avoid contact with any debris that may have landed in their area and report it immediately to NASA's Incident Response Team at 757-824-1295.
