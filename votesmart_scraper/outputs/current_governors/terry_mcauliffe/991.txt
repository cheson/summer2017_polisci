McAuliffe Praises Interior Department Announcement on Offshore Wind Energy
Today, gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe released the following statement on the Department of the Interior's action to finalize the rules for renewable energy production on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).
"I was thrilled to see President Obama and Secretary Salazar clear the way for renewable energy development along the Atlantic coast. Wind power off Virginia's coast has the potential to power of millions of homes and generate thousands of new jobs. I look forward to working with the Obama Administration to make Virginia a leader in off-shore wind technology."
McAuliffe has pledged to build at least one wind farm off the coast of Virginia by the end of his term as Governor.
The Department of the Interior's framework establishes a program to grant leases, easements, and rights-of-way for orderly, safe, and environmentally responsible construction of off-shore wind farms on the OCS.
