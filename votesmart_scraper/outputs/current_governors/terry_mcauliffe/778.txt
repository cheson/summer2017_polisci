Governor Terry McAuliffe today awarded more than $1.6 million in state extended school year grants to support the development and implementation of year-round instructional programs in 29 schools in 13 school divisions.
The Extended School Year Grant Program was created by the 2013 General Assembly in response to an October 2012 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) report on the effectiveness of year-round school programs in raising student achievement, especially among historically under-performing student subgroups.
