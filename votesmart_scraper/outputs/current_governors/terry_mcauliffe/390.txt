Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Microsoft Corp. will invest $402.4 million to expand its data center site in Mecklenburg County and increase capacity to serve its growing customer base.

Microsoft's original project in 2010 involved an investment of up to $499 million and 50 new jobs. In 2011 the company invested an additional $150 million to expand the site, and in 2013 announced a $348 million expansion. In June 2014 Microsoft invested another $346.7 million, creating 90 new jobs.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "Microsoft Corp. is a valued corporate partner that continues to heavily invest in Virginia. The company's fourth expansion project represents more than $1.74 billion in total capital investment since 2010, bringing more than 200 jobs to citizens in Southern Virginia. Microsoft's tremendous growth trajectory is a testament to the Commonwealth's superior infrastructure and the success of our burgeoning data center industry, playing a key role in our efforts to build a new Virginia economy."
