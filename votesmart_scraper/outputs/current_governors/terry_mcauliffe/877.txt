Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced more than $8.5 million in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding for 13 projects in Virginia.
"The Community Development Block Grant program is a long-standing program that provides necessary resources to our localities to improve their communities," said Governor McAuliffe. "From sewer projects to downtown revitalization and housing rehabilitation, these projects are improving the lives of Virginians across the Commonwealth."
Since 1982, the federally-funded CDBG program has been administered by the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), and Virginia receives approximately $17 million annually for this grant program. CDBG grants are awarded through a competitive process. Most projects benefit low- and moderate-income persons, and many projects are targeted for the prevention or elimination of slums and blighting conditions.
Five of the projects are noted as multi-year funding projects. Multi-year funding projects are those that will receive a contract allocating a portion of the funds this year, and after achieving specific performance targets, the project will then be eligible for additional funding. One additional project is receiving a letter of intent, indication the project is worthy of funding but lacks key components necessary for the project to be immediately implemented. This allows the locality to address the missing key component by spring 2015.
"This competitive program allows Virginia to address major community issues and utilize available resources to make our communities great places to live, work and do business," said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones.
