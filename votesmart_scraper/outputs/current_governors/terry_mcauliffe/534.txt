Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that marriage is a fundamental right that the Constitution grants to same-sex couples:
"Today's opinion represents a profound moment in the history of our nation and our Commonwealth. The justices have acknowledged that marriage is a fundamental right and any effort to interfere with that right is a violation of equal protection. I believe Virginia must be open and welcoming to everyone, and there is no room in our Commonwealth for putting up walls that separate individuals from that right based on whom they love. This decision is a victory for equality and a reminder that building a new Virginia economy requires us to make our Commonwealth a place where everyone can live, work and raise a family without facing discrimination."
