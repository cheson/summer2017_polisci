Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today the 50th anniversary of the Virginia Jobs Investment Program (VJIP). Created in 1965 as part of the Industrial Training division of the Virginia Community College System, the program provides consultative services and funding to companies creating new jobs or experiencing technological change. As a business development incentive supporting economic development, VJIP reduces the human resource development costs of new and expanding companies. VJIP is state-funded, demonstrating Virginia's commitment to enhancing job opportunities for its citizens.
A tracking system was established in 1997, and it is estimated that VJIP has supported more than 2,500 projects, over 365,600 jobs and $29 billion in capital investment since that time.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "A pipeline of skilled workers is critical to the economic health of our Commonwealth, and that is why workforce development is one of my pillars of creating a new Virginia economy. For five decades, the Virginia Jobs Investment Program has continuously improved the professional delivery of services that positively impact our businesses' most important resource--their labor pool. We are confident that VJIP, along with its higher education and workforce system partners, will continue to play an integral role in connecting growing businesses with Virginia's talent for the next five decades to come."
