Virginia Receives Federal Grant to Support Key Unemployment Insurance Initiatives
Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Sept. 28, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that the U. S. Department of Labor (DOL) has awarded nearly a million dollars in federal grant money to Virginia to support initiatives within the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program in two key areas. The Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) will administer the grants to further strengthen information technology systems and reduce the misclassification of employees as independent contractors.
Speaking about the announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "I am pleased that Virginia was recognized and awarded these funds to strengthen the security of our unemployment insurance program, and to make it more responsive to the needs of Virginia's workers and employers in this new Virginia economy. I am particularly pleased that this grant will help Virginia combat worker misclassification, which is a regrettably pervasive practice in our economy that undermines businesses that follow the law, deprives the Commonwealth of millions of dollars in tax revenues, and prevents workers from receiving legal protections and benefits."
