Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today in response to the conflicting rulings of two federal courts on the Affordable Care Act:
"Today's conflicting court rulings on health care tax credits should not discourage Virginia families from seeking affordable health insurance through the federal marketplace. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond affirmed the validity of those incentives, and Virginians can be confident that low-cost health insurance will be available to those who participate in this fall's open enrollment and meet eligibility criteria.
"I am disappointed in the decision by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. I hope that an appeal to the full court will provide clarity and reassurance to all Americans, regardless of where they live, that they and their families will have access to preventive care and protection from burdensome medical bills.
"During the first open enrollment, 216,000 Virginians purchased insurance through the federal insurance exchange. I believe many more will participate during this fall's enrollment, having learned from neighbors, co-workers and family members that they, too, can have affordable health insurance. Expanding access to affordable health care is a key component of building a stronger Virginia economy, and I will continue to work toward that goal.
