Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Colonna's Shipyard, Inc., a full-service ship repair facility and home of America's largest marine travel lift, will invest over $30 million to expand its operation in the City of Norfolk, creating 51 new jobs. The company will add a larger dry dock for working on today's largest ships, and also dredge and improve the channel and bulkhead. Colonna's Shipyard is located in the historic Berkley section of Norfolk and is the oldest continuous family-owned and operated private shipyard in the United States.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "This major investment by one of Virginia's oldest businesses will expand capacity and improve the maritime infrastructure in Hampton Roads--a significant win for Norfolk and for the Commonwealth. Colonna's expansion to grow and diversify is an important project in the marine industry and is another step forward in our efforts to build a new Virginia economy."
