Location: Roanoke, VA

First Lady Dorothy McAuliffe and representatives from No Kid Hungry joined children at the Roanoke Main Library today to celebrate the local Feed and Read program and the Library of Virginia's statewide support for the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP).
"In Virginia, only 13 percent of children who receive a free or reduced-price lunch during the school year receive summer meals," said Mrs. McAuliffe. "We can do better to ensure that kids have healthy meals every day of the year, and libraries are an important part of the solution."
