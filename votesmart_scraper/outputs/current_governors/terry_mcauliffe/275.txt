Today Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed House Bill 264, which would prohibit local governments from requiring that its contractors have a wage floor or other benefit above what is required by state or federal law.
March 11, 2016
Pursuant to Article V, Section 6, of the Constitution of Virginia, I veto House Bill 264, which would prohibit a local government from requiring that its contractors have a wage floor or other benefit above what is required by state or federal law.
In recent years, several local governments have required contractors to pay certain wage levels in contracts with localities. These initiatives have provided access to qualified, high-skilled workers and contractors and successfully addressed significant cost of living and workforce disparities in these localities.
The ability of other local governments to make this choice should be supported, not limited. Decisions regarding municipal contracts should be made by local leaders who fully understand local needs, and the profile of the available workforce, not by members of the General Assembly.
Accordingly, I veto this bill.
Sincerely,
Terence R. McAuliffe
