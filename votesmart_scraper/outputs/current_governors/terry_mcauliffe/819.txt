Press Release

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe and Chairman of the National Foundation for Governors' Fitness Councils Jake Steinfeld announced today the three winning schools that will each receive a state-of-the-art Live PositivelyTM Fitness Center as part of the National Champion Schools campaign. This multi-million dollar physical fitness campaign has named Chesterfield Academy in Norfolk, Fairfield Middle School in Henrico and Huntington Middle School in Newport News as the winning schools for demonstrating new and innovative ways for promoting student physical activity and wellness. This fall, the new fitness centers will be dedicated at ribbon cuttings ceremonies.
"As governor, my top priority is to build a new Virginia economy, where every Virginia child has the opportunity to succeed. Promoting healthy lifestyles and providing our schools and students with the resources they need to achieve positive health goals is critical towards building this new Virginia economy and strengthening our communities," said Governor McAuliffe. "Dorothy and I want to thank Jake Steinfeld for partnering with Virginia as part of the National Champion Schools campaign and for providing three Virginia schools with new fitness centers."
"Childhood obesity is not a democrat or republican issue, it's a children's issue and Governor McAuliffe has stepped up big time to help combat this growing problem, said Jake "Body by Jake" Steinfeld.
"We are thrilled to award these three Virginia schools with new fitness centers because they have demonstrated a passion for fitness and in living healthy a lifestyle. I know that academics and fitness go hand in hand and when you provide the schools with the tools, students will excel beyond their wildest dreams. Not only will these students be healthier, but they'll also have increased confidence, improved self-esteem and will achieve greater academic success."
The National Foundation's goal is to build a nation of the fittest, healthiest kids in the world. Physical activity and exercise are shown to help prevent and treat more than 40 chronic diseases, enhance individual health and quality of life and reduce health care costs. In schools, studies show that physical activity improves academic achievement, increases confidence and self-esteem, reduces discipline problems, cuts absenteeism and fosters better interpersonal relationships.
The National Foundation for Governors' Fitness Councils program plans to bring its challenge to all 50 states in the coming years. An attractive and unique feature of this campaign is that the Live Positively Fitness Centers are fully funded through public/private partnerships with companies like Coca-Cola and AOL and does not rely on taxpayer dollars or state funding. Live Positively is part of Coca-Cola's commitment to bring people together to make a positive difference, which includes supporting physical activity programs.
