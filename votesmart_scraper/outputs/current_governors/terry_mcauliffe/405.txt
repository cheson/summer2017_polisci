Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia, in partnership with Maryland, was selected for a U.S. Department of Agriculture grant totaling nearly $5 million to install ethanol refueling infrastructure in Virginia. The states will work with private sector stakeholders to add at least 41 additional ethanol refueling stations and nearly 200 more pumps. The Virginia-Maryland collaboration was the only multi-state proposal selected for award. The $5 million in federal funds is being matched by $3 million from private sector partners.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "This project will bring greater regional access to competitively priced, clean, and home-grown renewable fuel. Increasing deployment of diverse fueling infrastructure gives more Virginians access to a broader range of fuel options, helping power our efforts to build a new Virginia economy. I am excited about partnering with our neighbors from Maryland to develop this important infrastructure."
