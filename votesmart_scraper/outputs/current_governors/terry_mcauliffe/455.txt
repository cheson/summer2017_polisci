Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that the Commonwealth has awarded $6 million in School Security Equipment Grants to help ensure the safety of Virginia's schools.
The grants will apply to 519 schools and other educational facilities in 100 school divisions. The $6 million will go toward paying for video monitoring systems, metal detectors, classroom locks, electronic-access controls, visitor-identification systems and other security upgrades.
"These grants represent a crucial investment in safeguarding Virginia's young people and the educators, administrators and support staff dedicated to preparing them for the future," Governor McAuliffe said.
