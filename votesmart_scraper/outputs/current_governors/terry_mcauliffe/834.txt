Governor McAuliffe Announces 2nd Year of VEDP Going Global Defense Initiative
Press Release

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) has received grant funding for a second year of its Going Global Defense Initiative (GGDI). The purpose of this international program is to mitigate the negative impact of defense spending cuts on Virginia's economy. With 5,000 defense companies in Virginia facing U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) announced spending reductions of more than $300 billion in the next five-plus years, Virginia stands to lose many high-paying jobs. VEDP's GGDI is the Commonwealth's only program that replaces DOD revenue streams for Virginia's defense companies, which, in turn, preserves jobs and replaces declining state tax revenues. In its initial 10 months, VEDP's GGDI enrolled 160 defense companies, of which 100 travelled to an international market in pursuit of new business. Seventy-three companies project an average increase in their international sales of 130%. Limited resources prevented VEDP from enrolling more companies.
