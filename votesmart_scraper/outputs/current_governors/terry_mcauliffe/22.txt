Press Release

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that Virginia has received a $9.76 million federal grant to help fight the opioid epidemic. The one-year grant comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It will support prevention, treatment and recovery efforts in 18 Virginia communities. The grant will be administered by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS).
"We have seen the horrible toll that opioids have taken on our communities," said Governor McAuliffe. "Virginia's Medicaid program has done an excellent job of expanding the types of services it covers, but without Medicaid expansion, many individuals who could benefit from treatment are unable to afford it. These grant funds will help pay for the necessary medications as well as counseling and other support services that individuals need to successfully recover."
