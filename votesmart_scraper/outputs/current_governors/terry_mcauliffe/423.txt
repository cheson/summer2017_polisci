Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today signed an executive order directing actions to keep guns out of dangerous hands by better enforcing existing Virginia law. The Governor signed the executive order at a press conference alongside U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, Attorney General Mark Herring and members of the law enforcement and gun safety advocacy community.
"The actions directed in this executive order will help our Commonwealth better enforce Virginia laws designed to keep guns away from people who would use them for harm," said Governor McAuliffe. "The task force I have convened will take tangible steps to bring more successful prosecutions of gun crimes, and the other steps outlined in the order will aid in our efforts to keep families safe from gun violence. We must continue to work to overcome political resistance to commonsense gun safety legislation, but in the mean time I am committed to using every power of my office to prevent senseless killings."
