Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today following a vote by the House Appropriations Committee to "pass by indefinitely" his introduced budget, which closes the health care coverage gap and invests in Virginia state employees, teachers, sheriffs, first responders and a host of other core priorities:
"I am disappointed that House Republicans voted today to continue Washington-style gridlock instead of accepting a budget that includes a responsible proposal to bring billions of federal dollars back to Virginia to close the health care coverage gap and invest in core priorities like education and mental health.
"The budget I proposed offers a real opportunity for compromise by allowing a two-year pilot for Medicaid expansion and using the $225 million in savings we will incur over the biennium to support a 2% pay raise for state employees and teachers, provide Line of Duty funding for first responders and their families, and invest in the Virginia Retirement System. Unfortunately, these priorities took a backseat to political ideology today, as did the 400,000 Virginians who would benefit from expanded health care. As this special session moves forward, I remain eager to work with Republicans and Democrats to end this standoff by passing a budget that funds our priorities and closes the health care coverage gap."
