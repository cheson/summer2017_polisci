Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia's nonfarm payroll employment increased by 13,400 jobs in September, up 81,100 jobs compared to last September.

The September nonfarm payroll employment increase is the fourth consecutive monthly increase and a new record high for nonfarm employment in Virginia.
Virginia's over-the-year employment growth was 2.1 percent in September, again surpassing the national growth rate, which was 1.7 percent. Over-the-year employment growth in the Commonwealth of Virginia has been positive for the past 30 months.
"Today's announcement is an important indicator in our efforts to build the new Virginia economy," said Governor McAuliffe. "With a new record high nonfarm employment, we know there are more jobs available here in the Commonwealth. Our continued growth is encouraging, but I remain committed now more than ever to making strategic investments and policy decisions that enhance our workforce system and strengthen key infrastructure to create more jobs for the citizens of the Commonwealth."
Virginia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was up 0.1 percentage point in September to 4.0 percent and remains 0.2 percentage points below last September. Virginia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate continues below the national rate, which was up 0.1 percentage point in September to 5.0 percent.
Virginia tied with Arkansas for the lowest seasonally adjusted unemployment rate among the Southeast states. Virginia had the fourth best rate among the states east of the Mississippi. Virginia has the eleventh lowest unemployment rate in the nation along with Arkansas and Minnesota.
