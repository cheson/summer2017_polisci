Today Governor Terry McAuliffe signed an Executive Order continuing the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program, a network of Virginia state agencies and local governments designed to protect the natural and economic assets located within Virginia's coastal regions.
"From protecting the wildlife and fisheries of the Chesapeake Bay to meeting the threat of sea level rise, Virginia has a responsibility to protect our coastal areas and the vital natural and economic resources they offer," said Governor McAuliffe. "The Coastal Zone Management Program is a critical framework for our Commonwealth's stewardship of these important assets, and I intend to give it the full support of my administration."
U.S. Representative Robert Wittman continued, "For over 25 years Virginia's Coastal Zone Management Program has helped coordinate the Commonwealth's efforts to protect and restore coastal communities and natural resources. Virginia's Chesapeake Bay, wetlands, and beaches are national treasures; these efforts to enhance coastal communities and ecosystems benefit us all."
