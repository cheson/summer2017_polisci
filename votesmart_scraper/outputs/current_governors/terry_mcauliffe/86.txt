Press Release

Date: Oct. 28, 2016
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that the Southern Virginia Higher Education Center (SVHEC) will be entering into a partnership with Siemens, a global technology company, to establish the only noncredit Level 3 Mechatronics training program in the world. The field of mechatronics combines mechanical, electrical, computer, and software and control engineering to design and manufacture products.
Until now, Siemens Level 3 certification has only been available at two universities in the United States and three worldwide: Middle Tennessee State University and California University of Pennsylvania, as well as Yeungnam University College in South Korea. The new SVHEC-Siemens partnership will now make this training and certification available as a noncredit option offered in a compressed timeframe.
"Noncredit workforce credentials are an essential part of building the new Virginia economy and preparing our students to be competitive members of the 21st century workforce," Governor McAuliffe said. "We want our students to earn in-demand certifications and use those skills to help Virginia attract businesses, resources, and new investment. This innovative Level 3 Certification exemplifies SVHEC's dedication to its students, the community, and the region, and I commend the partnership with Siemens to make this possible."
