Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that Virginia death, marriage and divorce certificates are now available at all DMV customer service centers and DMV 2 Go mobile customer service centers, as an expansion of the partnership between the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH)'s Division of Vital Records.
In the partnership's first phase, birth certificates became available at DMV customer service centers in March 2014. Since then, DMV has issued more than 180,000 birth certificates, and the partnership was recognized with a Governor's Technology Award presented at the annual Commonwealth of Virginia Innovative Technology Symposium in Richmond last year.
