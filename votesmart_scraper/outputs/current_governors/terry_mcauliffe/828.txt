Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to grant a stay that will delay same-sex marriages in Virginia until the court decides whether or not it will hear the case:
"Today's decision is a temporary delay to the inevitable conclusion that Virginians who love each other should have the opportunity to marry regardless of their sexual orientation. Building a new Virginia economy means creating an environment that is open and welcoming to all, where world-class innovators and entrepreneurs can locate without fear of discrimination. That is why my first act as Governor banned discrimination in the state workplace based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and why I support marriage equality in Virginia as a key ingredient of that economy of the future.
"I applaud Attorney General Mark Herring for his continued efforts to see this case concluded as quickly as possible, and I hope the Supreme Court takes immediate action to uphold the 4th Circuit's decision so that Virginia can finally take this next important step in our history. In the meantime, my administration will make the necessary preparations so that we are ready to implement this decision if the ruling is upheld."
