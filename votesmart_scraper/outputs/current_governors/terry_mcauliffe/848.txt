Today, Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry Todd Haymore unveiled the Southern Virginia Wine Region road signs, part of a continuing Virginia wine region sign program aimed at attracting more visitors to Virginia wineries. The unveiling was the first event of Governor Terry McAuliffe's two-day cabinet visit to Southern Virginia. The signs announce to travelers on selected primary and secondary roads that they have entered a particular Virginia American Viticultural Area (AVA) or wine region. Now in its second phase, the program has located almost 40 signs in thirteen Virginia AVAs and wine regions.
