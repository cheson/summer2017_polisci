Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today an ambitious budget package for Virginia's public schools, which combined with higher education announcements yesterday includes over a $1 billion investment in K-12 and higher education.
The Governor's robust two-year budget proposal aims to prepare all students to succeed in the new Virginia Economy by providing them with much-needed resources and innovative supports.
Speaking today at Mark Twain Middle School, Governor McAuliffe said, "I have heard from parents, students and teachers all over the Commonwealth that we have been asking our schools to do more and more with less and less. But with thoughtful, bold ideas like the ones I am proposing, we will get back on the right track and ensure that we are laying the foundations for the New Virginia Economy. This historic proposal represents the largest new investment in public education in over a decade, and the largest total investment in the history of the Commonwealth. I believe that if we want to have a world-class economy, we need a world-class education system, and this is where it starts."
