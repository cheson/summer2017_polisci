Governor Terry McAuliffe signed Executive Order Number 8 today, which launches a new framework for the Commonwealth's cyber security efforts called "Cyber Virginia," and establishes the Virginia Cyber Security Commission to bring public and private sector experts together to make recommendations on how to make Virginia the national leader in cyber security.
"Capitalizing on the advantages that Virginia has in the cyber security industry is one of my highest priorities," said Governor McAuliffe. "This Executive Order will lay the groundwork for my administration's efforts to make this Commonwealth the world's leader in cyber security and the enormous economic opportunities that accompany growing that industry. And as the first step in our Cyber Virginia push, the Virginia Cyber Security Commission will be a key asset in plotting the way forward to grow this key industry, keep Virginia's cyber assets safe and create new, good jobs here in the Commonwealth."
