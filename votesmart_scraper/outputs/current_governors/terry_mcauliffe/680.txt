Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that companies participating in the Commonwealth's Virginia Values Veterans (V3) Program have now pledged to hire a total of 10,000 Virginia veterans into jobs throughout the state. This milestone comes a day after Governor McAuliffe highlighted the V3 Program in his first State of the Commonwealth address to a joint session of the General Assembly.
Governor McAuliffe said, "This milestone of 10,000 jobs pledged for Virginia's veterans is a testament to our V3 companies who have recognized that hiring veterans is good for their business, it's good for the veteran, and it's good for the Commonwealth."
