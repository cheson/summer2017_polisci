Governor McAuliffe announced today a permit for a new solar facility to be built by Firestone Solar LLC, a subsidiary of Virginia Solar. Once complete, the 19.8-megawatt project will be the first utility-scale solar generator of its kind in Buckingham County.
"This project is a significant step towards meeting Virginia's renewable energy goals and is a harbinger of good things to come," said Governor Terry McAuliffe. "Solar energy is an essential part of our efforts to diversify our energy mix and build a new Virginia economy. Virginia has a host of other commercial-size solar projects in the pipeline, and I look forward to continuing our work to make our Commonwealth a global leader in the renewable energy sector."
