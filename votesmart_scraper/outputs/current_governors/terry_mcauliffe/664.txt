Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement on the General Assembly's proposed amendments to the FY2015-2016 budget:
"I want to thank members of the General Assembly for their work on these amendments to the budget I proposed in December. My team and I will review them carefully over the coming days.
"I am encouraged to see both chambers agree with my priorities, including funding care for the seriously mentally ill, avoiding cuts to K-12 and further cuts higher education, funding the First Lady's school breakfast initiative and using increased revenues to offer state employees and teachers a much-needed raise. I look forward to working with the legislature to finalize the budget we need to build a new Virginia economy."
