Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today after the U.S. General Services Administration announced that Springfield, Virginia is on the final list of three possible locations for the new Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters:
"Virginia's inclusion on the final list of prospective sites for the new FBI headquarters is unquestionably positive news for our Commonwealth and economy. There is no doubt that the Springfield location offers the FBI and its employees the best combination of location, access to mass transit and local amenities. I look forward to continuing to work with Virginia's congressional delegation to convince decision makers within the FBI that Virginia is the location for this headquarters and the thousands of jobs that come with it."
