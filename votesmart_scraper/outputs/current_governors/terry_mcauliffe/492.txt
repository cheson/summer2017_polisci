New, Combined Sales Tax Holiday Is August 7-9
Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Aug. 5, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

The annual back-to-school sales tax holiday returns in early August. Along with school supplies, clothing and footwear, shoppers can now buy emergency preparedness items and certain energy-efficient products that were previously tax-exempt only during their own respective tax holidays.
Virginia's existing three tax holidays -- back to school in August, hurricane and emergency preparedness in May, and Energy Star and WaterSense in October -- were combined into a single event by the 2015 General Assembly. The new combined sales tax holiday this year is Friday, Aug. 7, through Sunday, Aug. 9.
During the holiday, shoppers won't be charged state and local sales tax on a variety of items. The tax-exempt products have various price limits, but there is no restriction on how many exempt items consumers can purchase.
"I encourage Virginians to take advantage of this tax-free weekend," said Governor Terry McAuliffe. "This is a great opportunity for families as they get ready to send their children back to school, stock up on basic emergency supplies, or simply want to save money now and for years to come by replacing electricity- and water-hogging appliances with energy-efficient models. The holiday is also a great chance to boost Virginia businesses." - See more at: http://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=12299#sthash.Td1Syz0l.dpuf
