Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: June 7, 2016
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor McAuliffe announced today that the U.S. Department of Labor has awarded a $200,000 Apprenticeship USA State Accelerator Grant to Virginia to expand apprenticeships. The funding constitutes the first phase of $90 million in new federal grants, which aim to double the number of apprenticeships in the country by 2019.
The new federal investment aspires to accelerate apprenticeships by increasing outreach to employers to start new apprenticeship programs, engaging industry and other partners to expand apprenticeships in non-traditional industry sectors, such as Cybersecurity and Information Technology, and increasing the number and percentage of women and minorities participating in apprenticeships. The grant program also intends to integrate apprenticeships into education and workforce development systems, such as high school career and technical education, community colleges and Virginia's One Stop Career Centers.
