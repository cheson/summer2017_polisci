Governor McAuliffe signed Executive Order #12 yesterday, which continues the Governor's Task Force on Improving Mental Health Services and Crisis Response.
Speaking about the Executive Order, Governor McAuliffe stated, "I am glad to sign Executive Order 12, which ensures that Virginia leaders continue to focus on access to mental health services and improvements in Virginia's mental health system as we work to build better communities and grow the Commonwealth's economy. I am encouraged at the progress we made legislatively this year on reforming our mental health system, but there is still significant work to be done to prevent future tragedies from occurring and to make sure our mental health system works for all Virginians.
"I want to thank Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam for agreeing to chair the Task Force along with Secretary of Health and Human Resources Bill Hazel and Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran who will co-chair. I also thank all of the Virginia leaders who are working tirelessly to improve our Commonwealth's mental health system and the outcomes it delivers for the Virginians we all serve."
