Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that ELDOR Corporation, an international group leader in the automotive business, will invest about $75 million to establish its first U.S. production plant in Botetourt County.

The company's key manufactured products include ignition systems, engine control units, braking systems actuators, and power/electronics management systems for hybrid and electric vehicles. The Governor met with the company founder at their headquarters in Italy during his June 2015 European Marketing Mission, following an initial meeting at the 2015 SelectUSA Investment Summit in Washington, D.C.
Speaking at today's announcement at an event in Botetourt, Governor McAuliffe said, "This tremendous project is a significant win for the Commonwealth and for Botetourt County. The decision by an international company of ELDOR Corporation's caliber to choose Virginia for its first U.S. production plant is a strong testament to our business environment, workforce and strategic location. Both the advanced manufacturing and automotive sectors are booming in the Commonwealth, and ELDOR will be a great asset to the growing industry cluster in the Roanoke Valley. This is the type of project we are working to attract, bringing hundreds of good-paying manufacturing jobs that help us to diversify and build a new Virginia economy."
