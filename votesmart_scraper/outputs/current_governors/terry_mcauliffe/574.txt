Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement praising Attorney General Mark Herring's advisory opinion that the law does not require the Virginia Board of Health to apply politically-motivated regulations to existing women's health clinics:
"I applaud Attorney General Mark Herring for making the right decision both on the law and on what is best for Virginia families. These regulations were designed not to keep Virginia women safe, but to limit their constitutional right to make their own decisions. I have pledged to prevent any further political effort to limit women's access to health care, and I am committed to ensuring that Virginia is in the business of expanding access to safe and affordable care, not limiting it.
