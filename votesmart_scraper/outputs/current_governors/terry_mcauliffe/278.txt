Press Release

Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today vetoed House Bill 145, which would prohibit a state agency from requiring a bidder, contractor or subcontractor from performing services at rates based on prevailing wages and benefits. The Governor's full statement is below:
March 11, 2016
Pursuant to Article V, Section 6, of the Constitution of Virginia, I veto House Bill 145, which prohibits a state agency from requiring a bidder, contractor, or subcontractor from performing services at rates based on prevailing wages and benefits.
Virginia does not have a statewide prevailing wage law. Accordingly, this bill would have no impact on state funded procurement projects. Additionally, any project funded in whole or in part by federal dollars must adhere to the Davis-Bacon Act, including its federal prevailing wage provisions.
Projects and employers who adhere to prevailing wage standards improve the lives of working families, local economies, and their communities. This legislation attempts to lower wages and impedes future labor agreements. Virginia's efforts should be focused on increasing wages, which will improve the lives of our families and aid our efforts to build a new Virginia economy, rather than placing artificial restrictions on their future growth.
Accordingly, I veto this bill.
Sincerely,

Terence R. McAuliffe
