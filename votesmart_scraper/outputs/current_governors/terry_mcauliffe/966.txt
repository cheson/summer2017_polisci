Governor-elect Terry McAuliffe released the following statement following Governor Bob McDonnell's release of his fiscal year 2015-2016 Virginia budget:
"I congratulate Governor McDonnell for continuing his record of sound financial leadership with this biennial budget. I would also like to thank the Governor for the unprecedented information and cooperation he and his team have offered me with respect to this budget and the entire transition process.
"There are many items in this proposed budget that will make Virginia a better place to work, live and do business. Reforming Virginia's mental health system must be a critical priority of this budget, as well as strengthening the Virginia Retirement System and continuing to invest in higher education.
"My policy team and I are already closely examining this budget and looking forward to finding common ground with leaders from both parties to pass a final product that grows our economy and uses every taxpayer dollar to make Virginians' lives better."
