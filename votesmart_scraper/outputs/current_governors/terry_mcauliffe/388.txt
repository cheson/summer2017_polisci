Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Nov. 16, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today the award of three planning grants from the Governor's Agriculture and Forestry Industries Development (AFID) Fund. The Commonwealth awarded a total of $56,000 to projects in the LENOWISCO Planning District Commission (PDC), City of Roanoke, and Nelson County to support the growth of agricultural and forestry industries in the Commonwealth. The AFID planning grant program encourages local governments to promote agriculture and forestry and incorporate the needs of these industries into their strategic economic development plans.
"Today's announcement is an excellent example of the important role that our diverse agricultural industry can and will play in building the new Virginia economy. These AFID planning grants across the state are leveraging multiple aspects of economic development in Virginia -- agriculture, tourism, community development, and food access, among others. I am pleased to see so many localities across the Commonwealth taking advantage of this program to support the local and regional efforts paving the way for future economic success."
