Governor McAuliffe announced today that beginning this month, Virginia high-school students and their families will be able to receive hands-on assistance as they prepare to attend one of Virginia's colleges or universities.
The 1-2-3 Go! initiative, spearheaded by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), includes three distinct components as three steps to college: Educational Credit Management Corporation (ECMC) College Nights events, Virginia College Application Week and the Super FAFSA Project. These three services provide students with critical assistance from counselors, advisers and experts on how to prepare, apply and ultimately pay for their higher education.
"Now more than ever, it is essential that our students have the resources they need and the support they deserve in order to successfully transition into higher education," said Governor McAuliffe. "With the 1-2-3 Go! initiative, the Commonwealth is making the tools and resources available to help thousands of young Virginians pursue the dream of a college education."
The 1-2-3 Go! initiative is expected to provide support and resources to over 12,000 students and family members at more than 80 high schools across the Commonwealth.
