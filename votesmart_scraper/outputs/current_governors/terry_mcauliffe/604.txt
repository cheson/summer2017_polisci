Governor McAuliffe released the following statement in support of Virginia joining 14 states and the District of Columbia in filing an Amicus Brief in support of President Obama's immigration actions.
"I commend Attorney General Herring for joining 14 states and the District of Columbia in filing an amicus brief in support of President Obama's immigration actions which allow undocumented workers who are living, working, and paying taxes in the United States to lawfully stay in this country. As the brief notes, these actions will have positive benefits to the Virginia economy and communities across the Commonwealth.
"My top priority as Governor is to build a new Virginia economy that enables us to attract the best and brightest entrepreneurs to this great state. These actions will help ensure that top international talent who have come to the United States are encouraged to stay here and pursue their careers, which in turn will strengthen our economy and our Commonwealth's future. It is my hope that the courts uphold the President's Executive Action and that Congress works together to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the near future."
