Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that more than $4.8 million in federal funds will be awarded to multiple local government agencies to enhance emergency preparedness throughout Virginia. The funds, administered by the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, are from the fiscal year 2014 State Homeland Security Grant program.
"These critical funds, provided by our partners at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, will be used immediately to help emergency planners and first responder agencies throughout Virginia get tools, equipment and other resources they need to keep Virginia communities safe," said Governor McAuliffe. "With this grant, Virginia joins federal and local governments in working together proactively to ensure that our residents are better protected and able to recover more quickly from possible terrorist attacks, major disasters and other emergencies."
To allot the funds, the Office of the Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security invited project proposals from local government agenciesto be submitted in ten categories of special emphasis and priority for Virginia. A total of 187 project proposals valued at more than $23 million were received in these categories:
-Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE)
-Communications
-Community Preparedness
-Critical Infrastructure
-Training and exercises in Incident Command System (ICS), National Incident Management System (NIMS)
-Information Sharing (Fusion Centers)
-Law Enforcement
-Mass Care
-Planning
-Public Messaging & Crisis Communication
The submitted projects were evaluated and scored against five criteria by approximately 50 peer reviewers. These individuals from across the state represented multiple professional groups, state agencies and local government officials with emergency expertise. Peer reviewers evaluated projects that were outside of their own region. Among the scoring criteria were the necessity of the project, how the project addresses risk, project management and the sustainment of the investment.
