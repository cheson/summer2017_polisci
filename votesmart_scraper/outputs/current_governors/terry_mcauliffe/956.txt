Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today in response to the news that Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen are in receipt of federal indictments:
"I am obviously troubled by the charges that federal prosecutors have made against Governor McDonnell and his wife Maureen and the message that this period in our history sends about how government in this Commonwealth is run.
"As this case progresses, it is my sincerest hope that justice will be served and that Virginians get the answers to which they are entitled. As Governor, I will remain focused on leading this Commonwealth in a way that restores Virginians' trust in government and honors their expectation of transparency and accountability.
"I want to thank the many federal and state public safety officials who have worked on this case for their tireless and impartial efforts. Dorothy's and my thoughts and prayers are with the entire McDonnell family. This is a sad day for Virginia, but I remain optimistic that we can work together to reform our system in order to prevent episodes like this from occurring ever again."
