Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe released the following statement urging Congress to avoid a government shutdown.
"Unwillingness in Washington to work together and find bipartisan solutions brought us the sequester and now is on the verge of shutting down the federal government, which would have a chilling effect on Virginia's economy," said McAuliffe. "We can't allow our economy to be held hostage over an extreme Tea Party agenda and partisan fighting. It's time Washington starts embracing mainstream compromise."
