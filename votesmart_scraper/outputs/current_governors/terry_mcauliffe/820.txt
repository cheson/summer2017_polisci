The National Governor's Association (NGA) announced last week that Virginia has been selected to receive a $170,000 grant and will also be one of 14 states to participate in an 18 month national policy academy aimed at better aligning education and workforce training to economic development priorities.
The NGA grant proposal was jointly submitted by the Governor's Office and the Virginia Community College System. Grant activities will focus on increasing the Commonwealth's attainment levels of STEM-H (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, and Health) credentials, including industry certifications, apprenticeship credentials and degrees,most needed by Virginia's current and emerging businesses and industries. This announcement by the NGA comes just a week after Governor Terry McAuliffe signed an executive order establishing his "New Virginia Economy" workforce initiative, a robust plan which calls for 50,000 new STEM-H credentials earned by the end of his administration.
