Rush Limbaugh
At a time when we desperately need to come together as a nation, Rush Limbaugh's gone out of his way to sabotage our President - announcing publicly that he wants Barack Obama to fail.
This kind of rhetoric does nothing but pollute our political process. That's why after Rush reiterated his remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference this weekend, I called on Bob McDonnell to condemn them. But so far, Bob's refused to say anything that might offend the GOP's ringleader.
Now we need your help to apply some public pressure in order to make it happen.
Bob ought to use the leverage at his disposal and help the raise the level of debate. He seems to think he's got some pull with national Republicans. Just last week he bragged to the Washington Post that, "'Everybody who cares about the Republican Party nationally or everybody who wants to run for president in 2012 will be in Virginia' this year."
I know that we can turn things around and create the jobs of the future. But doing so will require making a clean break with this kind of hateful rhetoric.
When Rush started wishing that our President would fail, he stopped participating in an open debate about the right course of action. Instead, he was feeding a political culture that isn't about results-it's about who wins and who loses.
But this isn't the Super Bowl we're talking about. It's our economy. It's our families. It's our country. It's our future.
Even as Bob McDonnell's staked out positions that put ideology above the best interests of the Commonwealth, he's repeatedly talked about the need to work together constructively to find solutions. If those sentiments are anything but hot air, then now is the time to prove it.
