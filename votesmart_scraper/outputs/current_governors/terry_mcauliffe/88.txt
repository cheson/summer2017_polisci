Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today after the Virginia Board of Health voted 11-4 on regulatory changes that remove onerous restrictions on Virginia's women's health clinics that could have forced the closure of many providers:
"This afternoon's vote signals a victory and the end of a protracted regulatory fight over the future of women's health in Virginia. I want to thank the Virginia Board of Health for working to repeal onerous regulations designed solely to reduce or outright remove access to essential reproductive health services for women across the Commonwealth.
"This vote demonstrates to the rest of the United States and the world that Virginia is a community where people can live, find employment, and start a family without politicians interfering with decisions that should be made by women and their doctors. When I ran for office I promised to be a brick wall for the women of Virginia against any attempts to infringe on their reproductive rights. I'm happy to say that my administration has and will continue to keep that promise."
