Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today the first two winners of the Pop Up Marion Community Business Launch (CBL) program. Wolfe's BBQ Fresh Market and Headspace Brewing Company will receive a $20,000 grant each to open their businesses in Marion. Administered by the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development, CBL is designed to assist communities in taking a systems approach to defining and pursuing an asset-based small business development strategy. The program starts with a community's unique vision for its future and then uses a local business competition to find and foster the entrepreneurs who connect with that vision.
