Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: July 8, 2016
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today released the following statement in the wake of tragic and violent events in several U.S. cities this week:
"Dorothy and I are heartbroken by the hateful act of violence last night in Dallas that resulted in the deaths and injuries of brave men and women who were protecting others as they exercised their right to protest peacefully in a free society. We continue to pray for the families and communities in Louisiana and Minnesota who are mourning today in the wake of recent tragedies. This is not a time for divisive and incendiary rhetoric -- it is a time for thoughtful and courageous action to reduce violence, build trust and respect between law enforcement and the communities they serve, and make these events as rare as they are tragic."
