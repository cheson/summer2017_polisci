Governor Terry McAuliffe celebrated the grand opening of the completed Virginia Capital Trail today during a ceremonial ribbon cutting in Richmond. The $75 million trail connects over fifty miles of shared use pathways for cyclists and pedestrians from Richmond to Jamestown.
"The Virginia Capital Trail offers Virginians and visitors unrivaled non-motorized access to one of the commonwealth's most historic and beautiful corridors," said Governor McAuliffe. "It brings a valuable potential source of economic development to the region, increases cyclist and motorist safety, heightens awareness for preserving the area's history and adds unique recreational opportunities."
