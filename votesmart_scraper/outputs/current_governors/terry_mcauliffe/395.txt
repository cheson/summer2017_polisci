Virginia's oyster harvest surged another 24 percent last year, sailing past 650,000 bushels, the most in almost three decades, Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today.
"Virginia is the oyster capital of the East Coast,'' said Governor McAuliffe. "We have seen yet another year of remarkable growth in our oyster industry. Our oysters are delicious, harvested sustainably, and provide good jobs for hard-working Virginia watermen. When it comes to oysters, Virginia is all in."
