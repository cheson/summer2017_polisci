"The Virginia wine industry just completed its most successful year and Governor McAuliffe has made a commitment to build on that success in 2014 and beyond," said Todd Haymore, Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry. "The Virginia Wine Summit is a important event in the Governor's efforts as we bring together a wide variety of wine industry opinion leaders to talk about Virginia as an emerging and internationally recognized wine region."
Governor McAuliffe is making the continued growth and success of the Virginia wine industry a priority in his administration. In addition to hosting the Virginia Wine Summit, the McAuliffe administration serves and promotes Virginia wines at the Executive Mansion and throughout Virginia, on domestic business recruitment visits, and on international trade and marketing missions around the world, including the recently completed mission to China and the United Kingdom.
The past few years have been an exciting time for Virginia wines. With a record-breaking number of cases sold and export sales reaching an all-time high in 2013, Virginia is establishing a solid record for the types of high quality wine the East Coast can produce. The climate and soil of Virginia places its wines stylistically between the West Coast wine region and European neighbors to the East. Wines tend to be fruit forward like West Coast wines, but also embody higher acidity and balance, similar to European wines.
Virginia Wine Summit attendees will enjoy a lunch celebrating the food and wine of Virginia, courtesy of Chef Jeremiah Langhorne, formerly of McCrady's in Charleston, South Carolina, now gearing up to open his own highly anticipated restaurant in Washington, D.C., as well as panel discussions throughout the day. Panel topics include:
"Somm Might Say," where a distinguished group of sommeliers will participate in an interactive discussion and showdown of wine and food pairings;
"True to Our Roots, Virginia Terroir" will examine how Virginia terroir is defining the state's wines followed by a presentation of wines by leading vintners;
"The Art of the Blend," a blind tasting comparison of Virginia Bordeaux and Meritage style blends against others from around the world;
"Meet Virginia Whites," an intimate tasting of compelling Virginia white wines where the winemakers themselves will discuss the story behind each selection and how they embody Virginia;
"Dark Horses," a tasting of eclectic varieties produced in Virginia today such as Petit Manseng, Tannat, and Albari√±o;
"It's All Relative," a discussion and blind tasting to discover what defines a wine's value, quality, and worth;
"How Sweet It Is," a tasting of Virginia dessert wines paired with cheeses from the region.
The Virginia Wine Summit will be held on October 21 at The Jefferson Hotel in Richmond. Tickets to the day-long event, priced at $199, are open to the public and include entry to the post-summit reception, where guests can end the day with a selection of sparkling Virginia wines.
