Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today following the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality's submission of comments in response to the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan:
"I agree with the Clean Power Plan's goal of reducing carbon emissions in order to combat the threat of global warming, and I intend to continue Virginia's position as a leader on this important issue. There is no question that our Commonwealth can play a leading role in energy conservation and efficiency and expand renewable generation so that we can cut carbon and create jobs along the way.
"As with any regulatory process of this scope and complexity, Virginia has submitted comments to the EPA with the intent of improving the Clean Power Plan by making it more equitable and better recognizing the progress that states like ours have already made in reducing carbon. I look forward to working with Virginia's business community, our environmental partners and the EPA to reduce carbon emissions, fight global warming and open a new chapter of economic growth for our Commonwealth."
