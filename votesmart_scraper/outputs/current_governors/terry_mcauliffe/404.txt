Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced $500,000 in grants through the Virginia Telecommunication Planning Initiative (VATPI) for Albemarle, Augusta, Culpeper, New Kent, Bland and Pulaski counties and the town of Altavista. Two joint grants were also awarded to two regional projects including one for Bath and Highland counties and another for Alleghany, Botetourt and Craig counties, the city of Covington and the town of Clifton Forge. The VATPI program provides funding for communities to develop a comprehensive community-based telecommunications plan.
"Access to high-quality Internet connectivity is one of the most critical tools for communities to grow, diversify and build a new Virginia economy," said Governor McAuliffe. "Providing adequate telecommunications in a community is essential for preparing our students and workforce, attracting businesses, improving medical services and providing a better quality of life for all Virginians."
