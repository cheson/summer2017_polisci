Today, at the direction of Governor Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia Department of Social Services released a bulletin informing local social services divisions that adoption between same-sex spouses is now legal across the Commonwealth.
"Now that same-sex marriage in Virginia is officially legal, we owe it to all Virginians to ensure that every couple is treated equally under all of our laws, no matter whom they love," said Governor McAuliffe. "This historic decision opened the door to marriage equality, and now it is my sincerest hope that it will also open more doors for Virginia children who need loving families.
"By formally recognizing that same-sex couples can now legally adopt, we are more fully complying with the ruling in this important case, and sending the message once again that Virginia is open and welcoming to everyone."
Virginia law states that a "married couple or an unmarried individual shall be eligible to receive placement of a child for purposes of adoption."
