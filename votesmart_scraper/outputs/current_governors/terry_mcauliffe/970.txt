Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe issued the following statement after the US House and Senate passed a bipartisan plan to re-open the government and avoid default:
"Today's action is a long overdue end to an unnecessary episode that harmed Virginia's economy. While mainstream Democrats and Republicans opposed the government shutdown, a few members of the Tea Party closed the US Government, took us to the brink of a catastrophic default, and inflected serious harm on thousands of Virginia families.
"During this process, it has been extremely disappointing to see my opponent embrace the architect of the government shutdown, the Tea Party Senator Ted Cruz. Tonight, Mr. Cuccinelli again refused to stand up for Virginia's economy and support passage of this urgently needed compromise. In fact, he said he was "disappointed' in the bipartisan progress being made.
"The most important question for Virginia voters in this election is: Who will bring together both parties in Richmond to focus on the economy. During this shutdown, I've made clear that I'll never let ideology get in the way of bipartisan solutions while my opponent has repeatedly sided with the Tea Party.
"As governor, I'll always work with both parties to put Virginia jobs first."
