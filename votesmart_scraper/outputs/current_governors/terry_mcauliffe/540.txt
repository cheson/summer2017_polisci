Governor McAuliffe announced today two changes to the restoration of rights process, representing the latest steps in pursuit of his priority to ensure all Virginians have the opportunity to exercise their voting and civil rights.
Under the new reform, outstanding court costs and fees will no longer prohibit an individual from having his or her rights restored.
"We have forced these men and women to battle a complicated and bewildering tangle of red tape to reach the voting booth, and too often we still turn them away," said Governor McAuliffe. "These men and women will still be required to pay their costs and fees, but their court debts will no longer serve as a financial barrier to voting, just as poll taxes did for so many years in Virginia."
