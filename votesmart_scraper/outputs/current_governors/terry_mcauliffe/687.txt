Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced $200,000 in funding for five collaborative efforts in Virginia through the Building Collaborative Communities (BCC) program. The program promotes regional economic collaboration in economically-distressed areas to stimulate job creation, economic development and provide a significant return on state investment.
"The Building Collaborative Communities program facilitates successful regional partnerships that generate prosperity across our Commonwealth," said Governor McAuliffe. "Regional collaboration is critical as we work to build a new Virginia economy, and we continue to see the impact it has in bringing businesses and jobs to communities throughout the Commonwealth."
