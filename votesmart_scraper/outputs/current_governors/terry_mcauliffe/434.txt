Governor McAuliffe announced today that Virginia is one of only three states in the country to receive a grant of more than $700,000 from the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to support its efforts to improve public safety by strengthening and reforming the reentry system and services for court-involved youth in Virginia.
"This grant will further my administration's efforts to transform our juvenile justice system so that young people who make mistakes can reenter society ready to live productive and healthy lives," said Governor McAuliffe. "This is a significant step forward for the safety of our Commonwealth and the communities to which the young people in our juvenile justice system will return."
