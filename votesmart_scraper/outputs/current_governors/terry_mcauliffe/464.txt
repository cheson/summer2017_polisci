Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today construction has started on the first of three segments to widen Interstate 64. The first segment is a $122 million project that will add a lane and shoulder in each direction for 5.6 miles between Jefferson Avenue and Yorktown Road. About 100,000 vehicles travel this section every day.
"As we break ground on the first segment of an expanded I-64, we are on our way to reducing congestion and delays, improving traffic safety, and providing better access for emergency evacuation on I-64 in the Hampton Roads region," said Governor McAuliffe. "This important project is also a critical step forward in our efforts to build the transportation system businesses and families need to thrive in a new Virginia economy. This project is a perfect example of making decisions at the local and regional level so that transportation funds get spent in a way that truly makes peoples' lives better."
