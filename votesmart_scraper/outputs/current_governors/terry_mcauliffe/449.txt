First Lady of Virginia, Dorothy McAuliffe, was in Bristol today to announce that eight southwest Virginia school divisions will participate in an innovative project designed to help end childhood hunger in the Commonwealth. The 3-6-5 Project to End Childhood Hunger is funded by an $8.8 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and will support parallel childhood hunger initiatives in Richmond City.
Schools in Buchanan Co., Bristol City, Galax City, Grayson Co., Lee Co., Scott Co., Smyth Co., and Tazewell Co., will take part in the project by implementing a suite of programs to ensure every child has access to three nutritious meals a day, 365 days a year. The Virginia grant was among $27 million in awards announced by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a speech at the 2015 National Anti-Hunger Policy Conference.
