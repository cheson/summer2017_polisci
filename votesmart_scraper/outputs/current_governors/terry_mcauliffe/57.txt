Location: Richmond, VA

Governor McAuliffe today announced the permit for a new solar facility to be built in Sussex County. The project, under development by Sappony Solar, will use traditional photovoltaic solar modules to produce 20 megawatts (MW) of renewably generated electricity, enough to power an estimated 3,500 homes.
"Solar energy is a central part of the comprehensive energy approach Virginia needs to bring low-cost, renewable energy to all corners of the Commonwealth," said Governor Terry McAuliffe. "The new Sappony facility will allow thousands of Virginians to sustainably power their homes and businesses. This announcement marks an important milestone in our effort to grow the Commonwealth's solar sector and keep costs low for businesses, families and taxpayers as we build a new Virginia economy."
