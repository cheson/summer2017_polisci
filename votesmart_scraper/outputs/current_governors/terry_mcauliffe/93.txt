Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced ten agriculture-related projects in Virginia have been awarded $393,999 in grant funding from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The grant will promote and enhance the competitiveness of Virginia's specialty crops and create more economic development opportunities across the Commonwealth. The project awards resulted from a competitive grant process established by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) for the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service Specialty Crop Block Grant funds.
"As one of Virginia's largest industries, agriculture depends on quality research and data to remain competitive in the 21st century economy," said Governor McAuliffe. "These USDA grants will ensure Virginia farmers continue to yield some of the best crops on the market, with 40 percent of the funding directed toward research in various aspects of food safety and quality. I congratulate these organizations and educational institutions for pursuing innovative research that will help enhance marketing opportunities and food safety for growers across the Commonwealth."
The Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 authorizes the USDA to provide funds to the states to promote specialty crops, including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits and nursery crops. When considering grants for the USDA Specialty Crop Program, VDACS gave priority to projects that included the following activities:
Assisting farmers transitioning into specialty, high-value agricultural initiatives that address the eligible specialty crops;
Increasing net farm income through high-value or value-added enterprises;
Finding new ways to market or add value to specialty agricultural products; and/or
Developing pilot and demonstration programs in specialty agriculture that have the potential for transferability within rural Virginia.
