Governor McAuliffe released the following statement today in response to FTA's safety management inspection of WMATA, the triennial review of the Tri-State Oversight Committee (TOC) and related reports.
"My transportation team and I have received and are reviewing the reports and findings issued by the Federal Transit Administration on June 17, 2015 as a result of its recent audit of the Tri-State Oversight Committee and its Safety Management Inspection of the Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority (WMATA).
"These findings reinforce the need to make the safety of the thousands of our citizens who ride on Metrorail each day the top priority for WMATA and the governments and organizations that comprise it. We are united with our Maryland and District of Columbia counterparts in our resolve to work with WMATA to implement the FTA recommendations and to ensure that the Tri-State Oversight Committee fulfills all of its safety oversight responsibilities. Further, we remain committed to selecting a strong leader to serve as WMATA's General Manager who understands the complexities of such a robust transit system and will prioritize safety improvements and properly address operational concerns."
