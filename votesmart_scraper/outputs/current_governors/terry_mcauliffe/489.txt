Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today the Go Global with Coal & Energy Technology (GGCET) program, a collaboration of the Governor's Office, the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority (VCEDA) and the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) as a result of the Governor's 2014 Energy Plan.
Speaking about today's announcement at an event in Bluefield, Virginia, Governor McAuliffe said, "Finding innovative ways to help grow and expand existing Virginia businesses is a key component of my Administration's efforts to build a new Virginia economy. As part of my Energy Plan, I laid out a vision for developing a robust outreach program that facilitated access to international markets for coal supply chain companies based in Southwest Virginia. GGCET gives these businesses in the Coalfield region an opportunity to export their expertise and products, helping them prosper and create jobs."
