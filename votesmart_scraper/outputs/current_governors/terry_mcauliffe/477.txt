Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia has received $1.8 million in grant funding for a third year of its Going Global Defense Initiative (GGDI), administered by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP). The GGDI was created to mitigate the negative impact of defense spending cuts on Virginia's economy.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "As federal budget cuts and sequestration continue to hamper Virginia's economy, the Going Global Defense Initiative is a vital tool to help Virginia's defense companies offset the loss of defense revenue. The GGDI, which is the first program of its kind in the U.S., helps Virginia defense companies diversify their revenue streams by identifying new business in international markets. This successful program is another example of Virginia's innovative approach to strengthening its economy."
