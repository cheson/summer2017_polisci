Press Release

Date: Jan. 5, 2016
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that in early 2016, Southside Virginia Community College (SVCC) will begin offering a new Power Line Worker Training Program designed to address the projected critical shortage of skilled electric utility line workers in Virginia. This program, which will involve 11 weeks of intensive classroom and hands-on training, will prepare its graduates for employment as apprentice line workers at electric utilities. SVCC's new program was one of five successful entries in the first Governor's Competition for Talent Solutions, announced in the fall of 2015. The Power Line Worker Training Program will benefit from a $200,000 matching incentive grant from the Commonwealth intended to provide new workforce training options and develop Virginia's economy.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "Talent Solutions grants and the new Power Line Worker Program exemplify the Commonwealth's commitment to building a demand-driven workforce system. We're excited about the innovative solutions generated by these grants, and we look forward to working together with our community colleges and the private sector to train a new generation of highly skilled workers who will help us build a new Virginia economy."
