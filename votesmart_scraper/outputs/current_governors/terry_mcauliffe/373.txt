Statement

Date: Dec. 9, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that Virginia is one of four states to win the opportunity to stand up a new Air Force Cyber Operations Squadron, and the Virginia Air National Guard will establish the unit at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia. All 50 states competed for the four slots announced today.
"Virginia's selection as one of four states to stand up a new Air Force cyber unit is the result of a great team effort between state government, our congressional delegation, National Guard Bureau, the Virginia National Guard, and Joint Base Langley-Eustis," said Governor McAuliffe. "Virginia emerged as a front-runner due to its existing facilities, strong defense industrial base with a cyber focus, and academic institutions to sustain recruiting and retention. It is also a testament to the outstanding reputation of the Virginia National Guard for excellent performance and dedication to mission accomplishment. This announcement is yet another success in our efforts to enhance our Commonwealth's reputation as a leader in cyber security, which is a key element of our efforts to build a new Virginia economy."
