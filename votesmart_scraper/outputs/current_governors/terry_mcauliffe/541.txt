Governor McAuliffe today announced the launch of a 100-day challenge to kick off the Commonwealth's Housing and Supportive Services (HSS) initiative to increase integrated, independent housing options for people with an intellectual or developmental disability in the Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and Richmond regions.
"Virginia is committed to providing more housing options for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities who desire to live in a home of their own," said Governor McAuliffe. "The Commonwealth is making a purposeful shift away from using institutional settings, and helping individuals and their guardians choose where to live, how to live and with whom to live."
With the help of HSS, teams from the three regions involved in the challenge are working to develop a set of goals that they can reach within the 100 days of the challenge.
"The implementation of the Olmstead Community Integration Plan, which is a priority of the state's housing policy, seeks to expand community living options for people with disabilities, which is at the heart of this initiative," said Secretary of Health and Human Resources Bill Hazel. "The planning and implementation efforts of these regional teams will provide an increasing number of community-based independent and integrated housing opportunities to these individuals."
"Our talent is our most important asset, and we owe that talent the infrastructure necessary for them to be their best," said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones. "High-quality, affordable housing in our communities is essential for those residents with intellectual and physical disabilities to live and thrive."
At the conclusion of the 100-day challenge in October, all the teams will meet again to share their accomplishments and plan the next steps with state leaders and other community teams to keep this initiative moving forward.
