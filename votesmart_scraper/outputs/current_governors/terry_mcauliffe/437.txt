Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe has declared a state of emergency throughout the Commonwealth today to empower public safety officials to respond to Tuesday's flooding events in communities across Virginia and to prepare for more extreme weather throughout the rest of the week.
"I cannot stress enough the imperative for Virginians to focus on the rainstorms that are headed our way tomorrow and Friday, well before Hurricane Joaquin could potentially impact Virginia," said Governor McAuliffe. "The forecast of up to 10 inches of rain in areas across Virginia could result in floods, power outages and a serious threat to life and property. As we continue to track the path of Hurricane Joaquin, I have instructed the Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security to make every preparation for a major event Thursday and Friday."
