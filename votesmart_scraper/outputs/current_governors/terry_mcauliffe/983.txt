Education is the single most important thing our kids need to build successful lives. Whether they're going to invent a product, start a business, or get the job of their dreams, it all starts with the basic skills and confidence that only a good education can provide, and right now we're not doing enough.
Total funding per student is down even as we've got more and more students entering our system. Only 87% of our kids are graduating high school on time.
As Governor, I will support our kids and our schools. We're going to take the best ideas from around the country and give teachers and administrators the resources and freedom they need to make Virginia a global leader in education.
