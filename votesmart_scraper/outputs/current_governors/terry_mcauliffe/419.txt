Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced five new Virginia Enterprise Zone (VEZ) designations for Tazewell County, the cities of Lynchburg and Hampton, and two joint zones for city of Martinsville and Henry County, as well as Mecklenburg and Brunswick counties. The Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development administers the VEZ program, which supports job creation and private investment by providing state and local incentives such as the Job Creation Grant (JCG) and the Real Property Investment Grant (RPIG) to qualified businesses and investors in enterprise zones.
Speaking at today's announcement at an event in Lynchburg, Governor McAuliffe said, "The Enterprise Zone program is an important tool that will help in our efforts to build a new Virginia economy. By providing both local and state incentives, we are creating a pro-business climate that not only attracts new businesses, but also helps our existing businesses grow."
