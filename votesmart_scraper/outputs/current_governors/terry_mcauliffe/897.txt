Thank you Secretary Lane for the kind introduction. Before I begin, I would like to recognize Aubrey for his outstanding work as my Secretary of Transportation. He is doing a great job for Hampton Roads and the entire Commonwealth making sure we have a transportation infrastructure that eases congestion, stimulates economic growth and improves Virginians' quality of life.
I would also of course like to thank the Virginia Maritime Association for the invitation to come and speak tonight.
I am honored to address the membership of the oldest maritime trade association in the nation. We have had a strong and vibrant port since 1920 and the VMA has played a critical role in building the port and our maritime assets into what they are today.
