Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: April 28, 2016
Location: London, UK

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced the successful completion of a Virginia wine promotion conducted in partnership with Berry Bros. & Rudd, the oldest wine merchant company in the United Kingdom (U.K.), resulting in new exports of Virginia wine to a critical international wine market.
During the month of March, Berry Bros. featured a special case of Virginia wine for sale on its website and offered all purchasers of the case the chance to win a four day, five night tour of Virginia wine country, sponsored and organized by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), the Virginia Wine Board Marketing Office (VWBMO), and the Virginia Tourism Corporation (VTC). The cases sold out in less than three weeks. The wines were exported by Reston-based New Horizon Wines and featured selections from Breaux Vineyards and Boxwood Winery in Loudoun County and Veritas Winery of Nelson County, all of whom New Horizon has represented in the U.K. for several years.
