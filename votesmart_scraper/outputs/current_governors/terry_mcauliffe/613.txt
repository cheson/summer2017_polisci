Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today after signing the Fiscal Year 2015-2016 Budget Bill as it passed the General Assembly, without adding any amendments or line-item vetoes:
"Today I was proud to sign a budget bill that provides a strong foundation for our future -- a foundation built on collaboration and a shared commitment to building a new Virginia economy.
"This budget closes our revenue shortfall responsibly, avoids cuts to core programs like education, and invests in key priorities that are essential to economic growth. It also includes my top priorities of increasing funding for economic development; offering health care services to more Virginians who need them; giving Virginia state employees a much-needed raise; funding the First Lady's school breakfast initiative; and supporting efforts to end homelessness across the Commonwealth.
"This final budget is a product of genuine bipartisan compromise. I want to thank Chairmen Walter Stosch, Chuck Colgan and Chris Jones for working with my team and me to pass this bill.
"Our constituents expect us to demonstrate the fiscal discipline necessary to balance our budget and manage state services in the most cost-efficient manner possible.
"And they expect us to reach across the aisle and work together to reach that goal.
"We have done that this year, and I was proud to join my partners in that effort today as I signed this budget bill."
