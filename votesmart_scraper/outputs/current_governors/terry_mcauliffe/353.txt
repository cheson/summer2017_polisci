Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced that offenders in Virginia's prisons can now stay in touch with loved ones by way of some of the lowest phone call rates in the country.
The Virginia Department of Corrections has worked with its offender phone service provider, Global Tel*Link (GTL), to lower phone rates drastically over the last five years. Offenders will now pay about $0.04 per minute.
"Recognizing how important family support is to offenders as they serve their time and prepare to reenter the community, Virginia has been leading the charge to bring affordable phone service to incarcerated offenders," said Governor McAuliffe. "This is a significant milestone in the Commonwealth's reentry efforts."
In 2010, the average cost of a phone call from a Virginia facility was $4.06; by October 2015, the average had fallen to $1.48. With the new rates, an average call will cost $0.69.These rates took effect on December 1, 2015.
