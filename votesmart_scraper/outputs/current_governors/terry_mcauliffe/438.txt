Commonwealth Responding to Flooding, Preparing for More Extreme Weather
Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Sept. 30, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Heavy rain caused flooding in parts of southwest Virginia and impacted 138 roads across the Commonwealth yesterday. Widespread flooding and expected rain from several weather systems, including the potential landfall of Hurricane Joaquin through the weekend could cause additional impacts statewide and hamper travel. Governor McAuliffe urges Virginians to prepare for hurricane-like impacts with these approaching storms as state personnel prepare to take emergency action, as necessary, to protect life and property.
"My team and I are closely monitoring the impacts of flooding around the Commonwealth and the potential for more extreme weather this week," said Governor McAuliffe. "We urge all Virginians to stay tuned to your local forecast and make a plan to stay safe in the event of flooding or other dangerous conditions. Don't drive through high water. When roads are flooded, turn around and drive to a safe location. It may save your life."
