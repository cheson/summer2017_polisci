Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today following the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's release of its final Clean Power Plan rule, which seeks to combat climate change by curbing carbon emissions from existing power plants:
"I applaud the Obama Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for focusing on the important issue of curtailing carbon emissions. Based on an initial review, it appears that EPA made positive changes to address concerns my administration and I expressed repeatedly about ensuring equity and flexibility for Virginia in developing this final rule. As we conduct a detailed analysis, I look forward to working with stakeholders to accomplish the objectives of reducing carbon emissions, creating the next generation of clean energy jobs and building the new Virginia economy."
