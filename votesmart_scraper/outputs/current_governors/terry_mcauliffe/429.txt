Governor Terry McAuliffe kicked of the 2015 Commonwealth of Virginia campaign (CVC) for state employee workplace giving and announced an ambitious goal to raise $4.1 million for charitable causes. The 2015 goal is 5 percent higher than the $3.9 million donated by state employees during the 2014 campaign, which was an 8 percent increase over the $3.6 million raised the year before
"State employees came through with a remarkable effort last year and demonstrated the tremendous power that people working together for good can have," said Governor McAuliffe. "The 2014 campaign was the first time in four years that our state workforce exceeded the previous year's total, and I am confident that our state employees will respond generously to the needs of their communities once again this year."
