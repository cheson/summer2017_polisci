Governor McAuliffe Statement on Board of Health Vote to Amend Anti-Women's Health Regulations
Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Sept. 17, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement today after the Virginia Board of Health voted to amend regulations that were previously designed to force the closure of women's health facilities across the Commonwealth:
"Today's vote is an enormous step forward in the fight to get extreme politics out of decisions that should be between women and their doctors. When I took office I promised to be a brick wall to protect women's health care access and to roll back these onerous regulations that were designed explicitly to prevent Virginia women from accessing health care.
"This Commonwealth should be a leader in bringing people together and building a new Virginia economy -- not in partisan crusades against women's rights.
"I applaud the Board of Health for ending this disturbing chapter in our history and for heeding the advice of experts, medical professionals and Virginia women about the best way to provide safe access to health care."
