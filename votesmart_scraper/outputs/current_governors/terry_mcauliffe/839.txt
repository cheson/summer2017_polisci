Governor McAuliffe announced today the launch of Virginia's new employment app, VAWorks. Now, wherever Virginians may be in the Commonwealth, they can have thousands of jobs at their fingertips.
"Job seekers in Virginia now have a more convenient way to find employment," stated Governor McAuliffe. "The VAWorks app is an advanced workforce development tool that matches employers with qualified candidates."
Available on iPhone and Android, Virginia's new app provides job seekers with free access to jobs. Using a mobile device, users can search for jobs by occupation, location, or keyword. They can also share their job search activity and information via email or social media. "This mobile app gives today's job seekers an easier way to access thousands of job from more than 16,000 sources, including military, government and federal jobs while on-the-go," Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice A. Jones said.
The VAWorks app is one of many job seeker services available through the Virginia Employment Commission (VEC). App users now have the option to receive notifications from the VEC when new job openings are available, filter their results by occupation and expand job listings to review details and locations. For more information about the VEC or the new mobile app, please contact Joyce Fogg, VEC Director of Communications, at (804) 786-7592 or Joyce.Fogg@vec.virginia.gov.
