Governor McAuliffe Announces Opening of Indian Market for Virginia Apple Exports
Press Release
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Dec. 12, 2014
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced new export sales of Virginia apples to India, a significant market opening in one of the world's largest economies and population bases. Specifically, this year Virginia has exported just over $1.6 million in apples to India as of September, up from zero in late 2011 when Virginia opened its representative trade office in India.
Speaking about the new exports to India, Governor McAuliffe said, "I am pleased to announce the opening of this new market for Virginia's high-quality apples, a direct result of our increased focus on international marketing efforts on behalf of the Commonwealth's agricultural and forestry industries. Introducing Virginia products to emerging and important markets such as India, which has the world's second largest population, is critical as we work with our private sector partners to build a new Virginia economy. Indeed, exports help generate revenue, jobs, and other economic opportunities right here in Virginia. We welcome these new exports and look forward to even greater apple sales to India this year and in 2015."
