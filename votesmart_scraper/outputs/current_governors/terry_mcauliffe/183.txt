Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement congratulating Virginia Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones on his selection as the Chief Executive Officer of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, an organization that works with low-income communities to create new opportunities for businesses and residents to thrive:
"Secretary Jones took on one of the toughest jobs in my Cabinet, and he has served our citizens well in the face of significant challenges from federal budget cuts and the threat of sequestration. He has been a strong partner as we worked together to build a new Virginia economy that is diverse and capable of withstanding future fiscal and political headwinds, and I will miss his thoughtful and strategic approach to economic development and workforce policy.
