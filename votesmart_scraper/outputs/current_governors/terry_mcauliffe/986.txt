It is absolutely unacceptable that veterans' unemployment is higher than that of the general public nationally. We need to do more as a state to ensure that career training like interview skills and resume assistance is available to our veterans.
We also need to do a lot more to ensure that veterans who have already been trained to work in technical, medical, engineering, or other industries during their time in the military are able to transition those skills to the private sector. We need to work with the military to determine what credentials and certifications we can award for competition of military training and service. These highly skilled veterans have often already been trained to do jobs in the healthcare, engineering, and other professions, and we should make their transition to the workforce as easy as possible.
