Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that the Governor's Office, in partnership with the Virginia Employment Commission (VEC), will be offering the Commonwealth's first competitive grants designed to help close the skills gap in key industry sectors of critical importance to the Virginia economy and reward and encourage employer-led talent development solutions. These state grants will be matched by private funds and used to provide job training and develop vital workplace skills for prospective and existing employees.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "I am pleased to launch this grant program as part of my ongoing efforts to prepare Virginia's workforce to do the jobs of today and create the jobs of tomorrow. Creating and sustaining a world-class workforce is critical for building a new Virginia economy, and it will take commitment and investment from both the public and private sectors to achieve this goal. This grant competition is designed to encourage these partnerships."
"Businesses seeking to expand or locate in Virginia look first and foremost at the quality of our talent," said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones. "They want to know the workforce is ready to perform exceptionally on the jobs they need to be done. This competition is another strategy we are using to distinguish the Commonwealth's workforce, giving Virginia a competitive advantage."
"The VEC is committed to working with our partners to look beyond traditional solutions to today's workforce challenges," said Commissioner Ellen Marie Hess. "These grants will serve to set the groundwork for future public-private partnerships in the Commonwealth."
