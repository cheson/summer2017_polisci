Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe released the following statement urging passage of the Senate compromise to keep the country from defaulting and ending the Tea Party-induced government shutdown:
"I strongly urge Democrats and Republicans in Congress to put aside any ideological battles and do what is right for the people they are supposed to represent by passing this bipartisan compromise. With Virginia's economic health, and the health of the entire global economy at risk, the stakes couldn't be higher. Enough damage has already been done by Ken Cuccinelli's Tea Party allies who have shut down the government and threatened to throw the world into economic turmoil in an attempt to advance their extreme ideological agenda."
