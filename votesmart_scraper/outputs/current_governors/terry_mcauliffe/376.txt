Governor McAuliffe Announces Lifting of Kuwait Ban on Virginia Poultry Products
Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Dec. 8, 2015
Location: Richmond, VA

Governor Terry McAuliffe, who recently completed an eleven-day trade and marketing mission to India and several Middle Eastern countries, announced today that Kuwait has lifted its ban on poultry imports from Virginia. The announcement followed several rounds of discussions regarding the ban amongst the Governor's office, the Embassy of Kuwait to United States in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, other federal representatives, and senior Kuwait government officials. Kuwait's ban on all U.S. poultry shipments was put in place earlier this year in response to high pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in several Western and Midwestern states.
"Today's announcement marks another victory for Virginia agriculture in the global marketplace," said Governor McAuliffe. "As we work to grow Virginia's agricultural and forestry exports and build a new Virginia economy, I am committed to advocating directly with senior government officials here and abroad to open or re-open markets for our products. I want to thank the Kuwait Embassy to the U.S., the U.S. Embassy to Kuwait, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Agriculture Services' staff, and many others for their efforts to have the ban lifted. I'm hopeful that Kuwait's action will allow Virginia's poultry exporters to quickly take advantage of the opportunity for more sales into a growing export region."
