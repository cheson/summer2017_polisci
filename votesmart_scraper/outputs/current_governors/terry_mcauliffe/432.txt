Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today that the movie version of the popular novel "Big Stone Gap" will open in theaters on Friday, October 9. The film was shot entirely on location in Virginia. Celebrated Virginia author Adriana Trigiani returned to her hometown of Big Stone Gap to direct the film for which she wrote the original screenplay. The all-star cast is led by Ashley Judd and features Patrick Wilson, Whoopi Goldberg, John Benjamin Hickey, Jane Krakowski, Anthony LaPaglia and Jenna Elfman. Patrick Wilson is a Virginia native who returned to his Big Stone Gap roots to make the movie.
Speaking about today's announcement, Governor McAuliffe said, "I have seen Adriana Trigiani's inspiring tribute to her early life in Southwest Virginia, and I cannot think of a better example of why our film industry is such an essential part of our efforts to build a new Virginia economy. From showcasing our Commonwealth's tremendous natural and cultural assets, to creating jobs and economic activity throughout its production, Big Stone Gap is a uniquely Virginian success that I hope people across the state come out and support."
