Governor Terry McAuliffe issued the following statement upon the conclusion of the special session on redistricting:
"State Senators today adjourned sine die in recognition that legislators are impossibly deadlocked and have no chance of approving legitimate congressional maps capable of passing constitutional muster. This brings to a close the special session I called to resolve this issue politically. While several maps were filed by Democratic legislators and the NAACP, Republican leaders offered nothing for Virginians to consider. The opportunity for a legislative remedy has ended.
"Therefore, it is appropriate that the Court now take action and provide relief to the citizens of the Commonwealth in the form of a new map based on the principles of equal representation, protection of minority voting rights, compact and contiguous districts, and the integrity of communities of interest.
"It is clear, given the Court ruling, that the only means to achieve that goal is to take a comprehensive approach that starts from the beginning and erases the taint of racial and partisan politics that poisons the old unconstitutional map."
