Location: Richmond, VA

Today Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed House Bill 587, which would hamper the authority of Virginia local governments to make their own decisions about monuments or war memorials within their jurisdictions.
The Governor also directed Secretary of Natural Resources Molly Ward, the former Mayor of Hampton, to form a work group with the Department of Historic Resources to begin a dialogue and study best practices about how to balance the preservation of history with the legitimate concerns many Virginians have about certain types of monuments and memorials.
