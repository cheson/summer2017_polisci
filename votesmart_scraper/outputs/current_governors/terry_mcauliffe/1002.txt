Issue Position: Growing Our Economy
A Total Ban on Predatory Lending
Payday lenders prey on the most vulnerable in our state. It is time to end their practices that devastate communities and wreak havoc on our financial system. As Governor, Terry will establish a total ban on payday lending that siphons off the hard-earned wages of too many working Virginians. The efforts in the 2008 and 2009 sessions by the General Assembly are steps in the right direction, and as Governor, Terry will continue this progress by banning all types of predatory lending, like open-end loans and car-title loans.
