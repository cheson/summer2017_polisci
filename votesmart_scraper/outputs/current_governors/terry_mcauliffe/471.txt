Governor Terry McAuliffe today recognized Virginia businesses for their ongoing commitment to creating employment opportunities for Virginia's veterans. The 350 businesses certified under the state's Virginia Values Veterans (V3) Program have hired over 11,000 veterans.
Governor McAuliffe presented 15 awards to individuals and announced significant veteran hiring milestones made by V3-certified companies. Since 2010, over 80,000 veterans have been added to Virginia's labor force -- more than all other states combined.
"The V3 program is a true example of what we can achieve when the public and private sectors work together for the good of our Commonwealth," said Governor McAuliffe. "I am so proud to announce that we met my goal of hiring 11,000 veterans through the V3 program 900 days ahead of schedule, and that today we are raising the bar to hire 20,000 before the end of my term. It is an honor to work with these companies to leverage the unique training and talents of our veterans so that they can lead happy and productive lives in a new Virginia economy."
