With one year remaining in Virginia's official commemoration of the Sesquicentennial of the American Civil War, Governor Terry McAuliffe announced today 13 grant awards to organizations working to preserve historic battlefields for the enjoyment of Virginians for years to come.
The grants originate from the Civil War Sites Preservation Fund, established by the General Assembly as a permanent fund in 2010. Funds for this year's grants, totaling $1,173,225 will be awarded by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, which determines the awards based on a rigorous evaluation process. This year's awards will assist in protecting more than 277 total acres associated with battles at Brandy Station, Glendale, North Anna, Rappahannock Station (I and II), Ream's Station, Second Manassas, Second and Third Winchester, The Breakthrough, Trevilian Station, and White Oak Road.
