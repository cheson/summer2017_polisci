I created the Cyber Commission to analyze how we can better prepare for the 21st century economy through a stronger focus on the fast-growing cybersecurity sector. Per its guidance, I will invest in an innovative cyber range and provide funding so that more of our higher education institutions can become designated as Centers for Academic Excellence.
