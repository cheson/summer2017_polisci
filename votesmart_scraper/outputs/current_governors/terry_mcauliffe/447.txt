Governor McAuliffe Announces New Agricultural Product Exports to Canada
Statement
By: Terry McAuliffe
Date: Sept. 24, 2015
Location: Toronto, Ontario

Governor Terry McAuliffe today announced new export sales for Virginia agricultural and food products into Canada on the closing day of a two-day trade and tourism mission.
Over the last several months, international marketing staff at the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) and Virginia's Toronto-based agricultural trade representative, Argyle Communications, worked with several Virginia specialty food producers to achieve new international sales from the Commonwealth. The trade deals represent new revenue streams for the exporting companies into the important Canadian market, the second largest export market for Virginia agricultural and forestry products.
"Speaking about the new agricultural exports as he finishes the mission to Canada, Governor McAuliffe said, "One of my top economic development priorities in building a new Virginia economy is to work with Virginia businesses, foreign purchasers, and government leaders from around the world to find new trade opportunities and make Virginia the East Coast capital for agricultural and forestry product exports. Today's announcement is another step in reaching those goals. I'm pleased to see these new deals to Canada, which has long been a top customer of Virginia products and a place we have placed a strong emphasis on given its close proximity and easy shipping routes. Growing exports here and elsewhere provide more revenue and job creation opportunities for Virginia's producers and agribusinesses."
