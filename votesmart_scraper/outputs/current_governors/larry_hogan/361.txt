Eastern Shore farmers and watermen will join together in support of Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan on Sept. 28, at Sailwinds Park in Cambridge.
The event will be from 1 to 5 p.m. and will include local produce and steamed crabs harvested by area farmers and watermen.
"I am honored by the overwhelming support I have received from Maryland's farmers and watermen and I look forward to connecting with them about the issues that have affected their industries over the last eight years,"Hogan said. "It's obvious that Anthony Brown and the current administration have declared a war on rural Maryland, making it extremely difficult for our two most historic industries to grow and be successful in our state. In the Hogan-Rutherford administration, the agriculture and seafood industries will always have a seat at the table as we work to come up with common sense solutions that don't threaten these pillars of our economy."
