Lt. Gov. Brown Doubles Down on Costly Purple Line
Press Release

Today, the increasingly invisible Lt. Governor missed a press conference with more popular local leaders who doubled down on his plans to spend $2.4 billion on a transportation project that has increased over 100% in costs before construction has even begun.
"The O'Malley-Brown economy has failed Maryland's struggling families. Over 200,000 Marylanders remain out of work, we have over 8,600 fewer businesses, and Maryland's economy had zero growth last year. Further, this administration raised spending by $10 billion, more than 46 other states," Hogan charged. "We simply cannot afford this project right now."
"The Purple Line's projected cost has already more than doubled, and continues to rise dramatically. According to the Federal Transit Administration, the project continues to grow by about a half a million dollars every day. The cost to individual taxpayers comes to about $850 for every income tax return filed by Maryland residents -- a hit that many simply cannot afford to take after 40 consecutive that hit working- and middle-class families the hardest," Hogan said.
