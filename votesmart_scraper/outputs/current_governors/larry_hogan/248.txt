Governor Larry Hogan Signs Rain Tax Repeal And Military Retiree Tax Relief Legislation
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: May 12, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today signed two bills that will bring tax relief to hardworking Marylanders -- the rain tax repeal and military retire income tax exemption legislation. The bills were signed into law during the first half of today's bill signing ceremony, held this morning between 9:00 AM and 10:30 AM.
"Charging Marylanders for the rain that falls on the roof of their homes made the rain tax the most universally detested tax throughout the state and I am pleased to finally declare an end to it," said Governor Hogan. "We are also making sure our veterans will be taxed less. Signing this bill is not only the right thing to do for our men and women in uniform, but it will also encourage more people to live and retire in our state. It's a small token of the respect and appreciation we have for their service and sacrifice."
