Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: May 11, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today announced that the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has approved his request for a physical disaster declaration for the City of Baltimore due to civil unrest in late April and early May. This declaration will allow affected businesses, homeowners, and renters to apply for low-interest loans to repair damages that occurred due to this violence.
"Many businesses, homeowners, and residents were tragically affected by the violence and destruction that occurred in Baltimore City last week," said Governor Hogan. "The loans offered by the SBA are an important tool for helping businesses rebuild and return to being a vital part of Baltimore's community and economy."
State officials from the Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) joined Baltimore City and SBA staff last week to assess damages in order to apply for this program.
"This approval will allow recovery efforts that have been underway for more than a week to continue," said Lt. Governor Boyd Rutherford. "I encourage all affected business owners to determine if they qualify for these loans."
"I want to thank Governor Hogan and the SBA for quickly authorizing the disaster loan program as the state continues to support Baltimore City with various programs to help residents recover and heal," said MEMA Executive Director Clay Stamp.
