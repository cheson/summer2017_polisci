Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan stopped Monday, Sept. 8, at E.S. Hubbert & Son hardware while campaigning on the Eastern Shore.
Hogan said the family-owned business is "what our whole campaign is all about."
Maryland needs to be more friendly for businesses large and small, Hogan said, something he said the O'Malley-Brown administration has failed to do here. "They're driving business and taxpayers out of the state," he said.
"Our state is way off track and heading in the wrong direction," Hogan said, vowing to fix the problem if elected. He said that during the past eight years of the O'Malley-Brown administration, Maryland has lost 8,000 small businesses, accounting for a loss of more than 100,000 jobs.
Hogan also spoke of what state government has done on the Eastern Shore. "People here are frustrated," he said. "There is a large disconnect between Annapolis and the Eastern Shore," something else he would remedy if elected, he said.
Hogan is a small businessman, owner of the Hogan Companies real estate firm in Prince George's County. He began his day on the Shore Monday speaking in Ocean City at a forum of the Maryland Association of Realtors.
His father, Larry Hogan Sr., represented Maryland's 5th District in U.S. Congress from 1969 to 1975, when he made an unsuccessful bid for the Maryland governor's seat.
In 1992, Hogan made an unsuccessful bid for the 5th congressional district seat, according to online sources, and in 2011 he began the nonpartisan group, Change Maryland.
