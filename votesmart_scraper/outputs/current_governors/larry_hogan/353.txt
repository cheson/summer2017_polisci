Hogan's Daughter Speaks Out Against Brown's Lies in Latest TV Ad
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.

Location: Annapolis, MD

Larry Hogan's daughter, Jaymi Sterling, speaks out against the false smear campaign Anthony Brown is running against her father in a campaign ad released today. In the ad, she rebukes recent false claims from the Brown campaign and reinforces Hogan's support for women's rights.
"I could not be more proud of my daughters Jaymi, Julie and Kim. They are three strong, independent women who have been successful in all of their endeavors. When Jaymi saw the outright lies my opponent is saying about me, she wanted to set the record straight once and for all," said Hogan. "It's unfortunate that my opponent is so desperate, so unwilling to talk about the real issues, and so unable to defend his own 8-year record that he feels he has to stoop to these outrageous, false attacks in an effort to cling to his power."
Hogan's daughter said, "The fact that Anthony Brown is trying to frighten women into not voting for my dad is disgraceful. This represents exactly why women, and all Marylanders, are tired of politics and politicians as usual. Marylanders deserve a honest, forthright conversation on the issues that people care about, and leadership that has a plan to turn our economy around. I believe that leadership is what we will get from my dad, Larry Hogan."
