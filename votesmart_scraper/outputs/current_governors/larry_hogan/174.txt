Governor Larry Hogan Joins Officials for Sagamore Spirit Groundbreaking
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 29, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today joined local elected leaders, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, and executives from Sagamore Spirit, a new Baltimore-based whiskey company, to break ground on the company's 5-acre whiskey distillery in Port Covington. The distillery will be one of the first projects in the larger Port Covington redevelopment.
"Sagamore Spirit and the entire Port Covington development project serves as an outstanding example of the economic development potential for Baltimore when companies invest in the city's future," Governor Hogan said. "Our administration is wholly focused on creating the right conditions to grow the private sector, get people back to work, and turn Maryland's economy around. Sagamore will be an important partner in those efforts."
