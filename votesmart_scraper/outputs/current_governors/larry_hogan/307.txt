Governor Hogan Introduces Supplemental Budget And New Legislation To Fund Transportation
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Feb. 4, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan has introduced a supplemental budget for FY2016 that will increase the portion of highway user revenue distributed to local governments by $25 million to $194.3 million, the highest level of funding since FY2009. The action reflects the Hogan administration's commitment to fund transportation priorities while supporting the efforts of counties and municipalities to maintain critical infrastructure.
Separately, the Hogan administration has introduced new legislation that seeks to increase the portion of highway user revenue distributed to local governments over the next eight years. Under the Governor's proposal, the portion of highway user revenue distributed to local governments would rise by 2.8 percent a year, reaching 30 percent in FY2024.
"Over the last several years, local governments across the state have had to bear the brunt of deep cuts in highway user revenue," said Governor Hogan. "Although we were faced with a dire fiscal situation and the extremely difficult challenge of delivering structural balance to our state budget, I have remained committed to restoring the money that was raided from our Transportation Trust Fund."
Increasing the revenue distributed to local governments to 30% by FY2024 will allow the state to maintain its transportation infrastructure and provide relief to local governments that have struggled with declining revenue sources over the past several years.
