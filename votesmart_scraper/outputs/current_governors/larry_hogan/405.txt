Coding problems that led to coverage and billing troubles for thousands of consumers using Connecticut's online insurance marketplace will be fixed in Maryland's version of the technology, officials said today.
Maryland officials had been preparing to use the technology underlying the Connecticut exchange after ditching their own glitch-prone software. They still expect the new Maryland Health Benefit Exchange website to be operating smoothly in November, when the next round of consumers will be allowed to buy health coverage.

Meanwhile, Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan questioned Tuesday whether exchange officials were really making progress developing the site and asked why Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown wasn't present at either the legislative hearing or the board meeting, since he served as the state's point man on health care reform.
"Anthony Brown is pegging his promotion to governor on the notion that he's learned from his mistakes on the rollout of the health exchange," said Hogan, who supports a move to the federal exchange and private marketplaces.
Jerid Kurtz, Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown's communications director, wrote in a statement: "Even though over 372,000 Marylanders have received health care coverage from the Affordable Care Act, Larry Hogan and his Tea Party backers are rooting against Marylanders receiving preventative care like mammograms."
