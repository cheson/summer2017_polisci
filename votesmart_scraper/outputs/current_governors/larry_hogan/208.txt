Today, Governor Larry Hogan was named chair of the National Governors Association (NGA) Economic Development and Commerce Committee by NGA Chair Utah Governor Gary Herbert and NGA Vice Chair Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.

Bringing jobs and businesses to Maryland is our top priority," said Governor Hogan. "I look forward to chairing the NGA Economic Development and Commerce Committee and working with my fellow governors to ensure that federal policies are in line with local priorities and are helping states do the important work of creating jobs and promoting economic growth."
The Economic Development and Commerce Committee handles issues dealing with transportation infrastructure, telecommunications, international trade promotion, financial services regulation, science and technology development, and affordable housing. Members of the committee ensure that the governors' views are represented in the shaping of federal policy.
