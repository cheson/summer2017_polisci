Lt. Gov. Brown's "Efficiency Plan" Calls for Eliminating State Employees

Despite eight years of record tax increases and spending as Lt. Governor, Anthony Brown claims he will cut waste from the state budget as governor--but his estimate of anticipated savings would require massive eliminations of state employment positions.
In Brown's "Government Efficiency Plan," he cites cost-saving measures by Connecticut as a roadmap for Maryland to reduce wasteful spending. That plan would call for cost savings from eliminating state employees; the bulk of Connecticut's plan is based on this measure.
"The treatment of state employees under Anthony Brown has been disgraceful," said Larry Hogan. "Mandatory furloughs and a lack of cost of living pay increases, combined with 40 consecutive tax hikes has made it nearly impossible for many state employees to survive. Meanwhile, the Lt. Governor and his boss Martin O'Malley were just given yet another raise thanks to the inaction of the state legislature."
