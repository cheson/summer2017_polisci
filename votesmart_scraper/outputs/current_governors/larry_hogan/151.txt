Press Release

Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake today announced a multi-year, multi-hundred-million dollar initiative to address blight in Baltimore, declaring that the joint city-state partnership will bring significant resources to demolish thousands of vacant buildings and replace them with green space and a stronger foundation for redevelopment and reinvestment in the city.
The governor and the mayor kicked off Project C.O.R.E, or Creating Opportunities for Renewal and Enterprise, in West Baltimore's Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood, where the entire 1000 block of N. Stricker Street is slated for demolition.
"Fixing what is broken in Baltimore requires that we address the sea of abandoned, dilapidated buildings infecting entire neighborhoods," said Governor Hogan. "Together, we will transform these neighborhoods from centers for crime and drugs, to places our city, and our entire state, can be proud of. Working with the private sector to invest in projects like affordable housing, retail, and other new businesses will help ensure that Baltimore becomes a better place to live, work, and retire."
