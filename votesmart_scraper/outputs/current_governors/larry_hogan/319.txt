Hogan Campaign Releases Two Ads, "Heather," and "Kandie"
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 22, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

The Hogan campaign released two ads today featuring supporters discussing why they are voting for Larry Hogan for governor. Their messages focus on Anthony Brown's economic record, which has made it more difficult for families to live in Maryland.
"The economic policies of the current administration hurt working and middle-class families the most," said Larry Hogan. "These ads outline what average Marylanders across the state feel and what they tell me every day on the campaign trail. Whether I'm in Allegany, Montgomery, or Worcester, Marylanders tell me they are struggling to make ends meet and feel as though this administration has completely ignored their problems and are actually making their problems worse."
The first ad, "Heather," features Heather Crowder of Annapolis. She tells the camera, "It's becoming harder and harder to raise a family here. I don't think it's believable when Anthony Brown says he's not going to raise taxes again. It's what he knows, it's what they do; when they need money, they raise taxes."
The second ad, "Kandie," features K Kandie Leach of Mt Washington. She tells the camera, "What makes things crazy is when you keep voting in the same party and there is no change, actually they call that insanity. I have never voted for anyone in the Republican Party in the past. I am voting for Larry Hogan."
