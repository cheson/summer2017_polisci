"I'm estimating that we would have to raise the state property tax by 67 percent to pay for the debt payments we owe over the next five years The bill has to be paid The chickens are coming home to roost," State Comptroller Peter Franchot said yesterday during an interview on WMAL's "Drive at Five."
Gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan responded to this news by saying, "Even the thought of raising property taxes 67 percent is unconscionable. This administration has raised taxes on hard working Marylanders and their families 40 consecutive times, taking over $10 billion out of our economy. Maryland does not have a revenue problem -- it has a spending problem. In the Hogan-Rutherford administration, we are going to get spending under control and restore a responsible, realistic budget so that we can roll back as many taxes as possible and get our economy going again. A vote for Anthony Brown is a vote for a continuation of the same failed policies that have gotten us to this point. Maryland simply cannot afford another four years like the last eight."
