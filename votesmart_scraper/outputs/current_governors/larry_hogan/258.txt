Governor Larry Hogan and Maryland officials continue to coordinate the state's response to civil unrest in Baltimore City. Maryland agencies are working together at the State Emergency Operations Center, which has been fully activated at the Maryland Emergency Management Agency since this past weekend's demonstrations, in order to provide support to Baltimore City and manage state actions.
"Over the past few days, we have visited affected areas and held meetings with community leaders to reassure citizens of the State's commitment to restoring peace to Charm City," said Governor Hogan. "We will continue to work with our partners in the city to ensure the safety of our citizens."
