Maryland continues to bleed jobs due to the failed economic policies of the O'Malley-Brown administration, Larry Hogan said today, after the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released new unemployment numbers. This latest report showed yet another increase in unemployment in the state.
"This is bad news for our state and exactly why I am running for governor," Hogan said. "The failed policies of Anthony Brown and Martin O'Malley over the last eight years have crushed Maryland job creators, and have made it more difficult for average Marylanders to support themselves and their families. As governor, my number-one priority will be to attract and retain as many job creators in Maryland as we possibly can. I'll work across party lines to rein in reckless spending, roll back O'Malley and Brown's 40 straight job-killing tax hikes, and restore integrity to Annapolis."
According to the latest report, more than half of the states either saw an improvement in their jobs numbers or saw no change, but Maryland wasn't one of them. Maryland's unemployment rate went up to 6.4% over the last month--up from 6.1% in July. When O'Malley-Brown took office in January 2007, the unemployment rate was a mere 3.6%. Unemployment has risen over 75% over the last eight years, and now, about 200,000 Marylanders are out of work--a number that Hogan calls "simply unacceptable."
The 6.4% jobless rate masks even more severe unemployment in many regions. Five years after the Great Recession ended for most of the nation, in western Maryland, the lower Eastern Shore and in Baltimore City, the unemployment rate is well above 10 percent. Among African-Americans, the jobless rate is twice than that of whites. "Maryland simply cannot keep moving backwards," Hogan said. "While Anthony Brown wants to talk about everything except the economy, 10,234 more Marylanders joined the unemployment line last month. Our campaign is the only one talking about the need for jobs and turning around the economy in Maryland."
