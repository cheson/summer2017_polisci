Public Statements
RGA Chair Christie to Headline Fundraiser for Larry Hogan
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Sept. 2, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

Chairman of the Republican Governor's Association, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, will headline a fundraiser for Maryland gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan on Wednesday, September 17, 2014 in Bethesda, Md.
Maryland's next governor Larry Hogan said, "Governor Christie and the RGA recognize that we are in a position to win this year, and that our effort has dramatically changed the dynamic of this race. The failed policies of Anthony Brown have crushed struggling families and small businesses. People everywhere are realizing that we have a real opportunity to win this race and bring real change to Maryland."
Governor Christie is the first national figure to help raise money for the Hogan campaign. It marks a turning point in the race as national observers have begun to pay more attention following recent polls that show the race tightening. A recent poll by a respected national pollster shows Hogan just three points behind Brown and within the margin of error -- a statistical dead heat.
Last week, campaign finance reports filed with the Maryland State Board of Elections show Hogan with a better than 3 to 1 money advantage heading into the final 60 days of the campaign.
