Yesterday, at a gubernatorial forum on disabilities at the National Federation of the Blind in Baltimore, Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown trumpeted his rollout of Maryland's botched health care exchange: "I've had the opportunity to lead the effort to expand access to affordable, quality health care to almost half-a-million Marylanders."
Larry Hogan responded, "Meanwhile, here in the real world, of which Anthony Brown knows no part, Marylanders saw their premiums rise by up to 30 percent and learned they couldn't keep their doctors. So much for access and affordability."
"As you know, I've led the effort on the Affordable Care Act that's gotten a lot of attention over the last few months," a smirking Anthony Brown continued in his speech.
Anthony Brown's health care boondoggle actually got zero attention in the first debate on Oct. 7--not a single question was asked on the topic.
"The waste of $288 million of taxpayer dollars is nothing to smirk about, Lt. Gov. Brown," said Hogan. "Think of all we could have done with that money--especially for the disabled community here in our state."
