WJZ, Baltimore Sun Ignore $288 Million Anthony Brown Healthcare Boondoggle in First Gubernatorial Debate
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 7, 2014
Location: Baltimore, MD

Today's first gubernatorial debate of the 2014 general election included no questions about Anthony Brown's role in the state's botched rollout of the failed Maryland Health Benefit Exchange which will ultimately cost taxpayers $288 million - the exchange was the primary responsibility of Democratic candidate Anthony Brown. It has been plagued with problems since its October 1, 2013 rollout, including immediately crashing upon launch and causing tens of thousands of Marylanders to live without healthcare coverage for an indeterminate period of time.
Gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan said, "It is absolutely shameful that today's moderators gave Lt. Governor Brown a free pass on his role in the failed rollout of the exchange. Maryland's rollout was a national embarrassment and Brown continues to duck all responsibility for his role in its implementation. WJZ collected questions for days from Marylanders for this debate; I find it very unlikely that not a single Marylander had a question about the worst boondoggle in state history."
Although Brown was not made to answer for his role in the health care exchange rollout, Larry Hogan was pressed on every issue from the Brown campaign's negative, false attack ads.
The debate will air tonight at 7 pm on WJZ and will be simulcast on Maryland Public Television.
