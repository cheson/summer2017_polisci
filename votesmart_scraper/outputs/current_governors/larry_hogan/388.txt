Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Aug. 13, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

Gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan issued the following statement on today's Maryland Fraternal Order of Police endorsement decision.
"I am truly grateful that of all the local FOP's - 33 of the 47 lodges - voted to support our campaign to change Maryland through lower taxes, tolls and fees on workers and retirees, and restoring integrity and balance to Annapolis.
Maryland's workers, parents and retirees deserve a governor who'll put their interests ahead of partisan politics and Annapolis' entrenched elites.
Boyd and I are eager to represent Maryland's men and women in public safety and partner with them to make our state a more safe and secure place to live, work and retire."
Though Brown secured the overall endorsement, the Anne Arundel business man garnered the support of 70 percent of the local lodges -- 33 of the state's 47 lodges.
