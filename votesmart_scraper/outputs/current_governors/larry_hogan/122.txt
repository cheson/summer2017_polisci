Statement from Governor Larry Hogan on Passage of Budget in House
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: March 23, 2016
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today released the following statement in response to the passage of the FY 2017 budget in the Maryland House of Delegates:
"In January, our administration introduced a budget that highlighted key priorities for Maryland, including a second year of historic education funding and substantial investment in our neglected transportation system. For the first time in years, the budget also delivered 100 percent of the aid that local jurisdictions had anticipated.
"Today, I would like to thank House Speaker Busch, Chairman McIntosh, and the members of the House for their hard work in passing this budget. Maryland's budget process works best when the executive and legislative branches act in a bipartisan fashion toward a common goal. Although we have concerns about the actions taken to reduce the Rainy Day Fund, I remain committed to working with the House and Senate leadership to build upon the progress we have made in the last year.
"With the operating budget now passed in both chambers, I urge the legislature to continue to ensure that the state operates within its means and remain focused on meaningful dialogue about mandate and tax relief for all Marylanders."
