Governor Larry Hogan and Maryland officials continue to coordinate the state's response to violent civil unrest that has occurred in Baltimore City over the last couple of days. Maryland agencies are working together at the State Emergency Operations Center, which has been fully activated at the Maryland Emergency Management Agency since this past weekend's demonstrations, in order to provide support to Baltimore City and manage state actions.
"We are working around the clock to ensure Baltimore City remains at peace, as it has throughout the day," said Governor Hogan. "The presence of the National Guard, Maryland State Police, and other law enforcement officials will continue in the days to come to ensure order is fully restored for the citizens of Baltimore."
