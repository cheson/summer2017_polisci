Governor Larry Hogan today announced the appointment of Elizabeth Hughes as Maryland's State Historic Preservation Officer and confirmed her appointment by the Board of Trustees as the director of the Maryland Historical Trust (the Trust). Hughes has served as deputy director of the Trust since October 2002 and has been acting director for the past 10 months. The Trust, a division of the Maryland Department of Planning, serves as Maryland's State Historic Preservation Office and provides direct assistance to a broad base of local, state, and federal stakeholders in the identification, protection, and enhancement of heritage resources. The Trust administers a variety of historic preservation grant, loan, and tax credit programs including the Sustainable Communities Tax Credit, which leverages private investment in the rehabilitation of both commercial and residential historic properties.
"I congratulate Elizabeth Hughes and I am confident that she will serve the people of Maryland extremely well promoting and preserving state historic assets," said Governor Hogan. "She is a dedicated public servant with years of experience in Maryland and on the national level."
"I am pleased Governor Hogan appointed Elizabeth Hughes to serve as our State Historic Preservation Officer, while also confirming her appointment as director of the Trust," said Secretary of Planning David R. Craig. "She is a recognized leader in the historical preservation community and we are fortunate to have her."
