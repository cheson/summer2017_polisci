Hogan Campaign Releases Newest Statewide Ad, "Working for Maryland"
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 9, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

The Hogan for Governor campaign released its latest statewide advertisement, "Working for Maryland," today which will air in the DC and Baltimore media markets.
The commercial reiterates many of Hogan's main campaign themes, but remains positive, a stark contrast to the negative, false attack ads being pumped out by the Brown campaign. In the ad, Hogan reiterates that he is not a professional politician, but a lifelong Marylander and small businessman. In addition, Hogan points to his priorities that would benefit average Marylanders and their families, including eliminating wasteful government spending, rolling back as many of the 40 O'Malley-Brown tax increases as possible, creating jobs, and restoring the state's economy. In the ad, Hogan tells an enthusiastic crowd, "It's about time the politicians started listening to the rest of us."
TRANSCRIPT:
"I'm not a professional politician. I'm just a small businessman, and a lifelong Marylander who loves this state.
But Maryland under Anthony Brown has had zero economic growth, and our state economy ranks 49th out of 50 states. That's simply unacceptable.
We're going to cut wasteful spending, roll back as many of these 40 tax increases as we can.
Has Anthony Brown earned a promotion?
It's about time the politicians starting listening to the rest of us.
My priorities are jobs, struggling Maryland families, and restoring our economy."
