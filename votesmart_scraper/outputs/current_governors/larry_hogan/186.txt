Governor Larry Hogan and Comptroller Peter Franchot Deliver $200 Million in Tax Refunds
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Sept. 28, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan and Comptroller Peter Franchot today urged eligible Maryland residents who filed and paid income taxes to another state between 2011 and 2014 to apply for a tax refund against the county portion of their Maryland state income taxes. Refunds are now taking place following a recent Supreme Court ruling related to local income taxes.
"For years I have said that Maryland citizens were being overtaxed and overcharged, and now an estimated 55,000 taxpayers are eligible for substantial income tax refunds," Governor Hogan said. "The Supreme Court's decision earlier this year allows us to provide another $200 million in tax relief, which will immediately go back into the pockets of Maryland taxpayers, and back into our state economy."
"For the thousands of Maryland taxpayers impacted by the Wynne decision, the Comptroller's Office is working diligently to get your money back to you, where it belongs," Comptroller Franchot said. "We have dedicated an enormous amount of resources, technology, and staff to getting refunds out the door as quickly as possible. To date, my office has processed more than 4,000 claims, returning more than $53 million to Marylanders."
