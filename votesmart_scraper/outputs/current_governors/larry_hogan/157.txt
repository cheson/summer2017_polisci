Governor Larry Hogan Announces Review of Barriers to Re-Entry
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Dec. 16, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today announced a multi-agency initiative, led by the Governor's Office of Crime Control & Prevention, to conduct an extensive review of the legal and regulatory barriers that individuals with a criminal record face when re-entering the community after time in prison.
In addition to criminal penalties that may be imposed at sentencing, there are many legal and regulatory penalties, sanctions, and restrictions--commonly known as collateral consequences--that are distinct from the direct consequences imposed as part of the court's judgment at sentencing. For example, those with a criminal record may lose their professional or occupational licenses. They may have difficulty getting a job, starting a business, accessing public services and programs such as student loans and housing, or volunteering in the community. While these consequences are often discussed within the context of re-entry from incarceration, they can also affect those who serve no prison time.
"These consequences have a lasting impact, making it more difficult for ex-offenders to re-enter society, find a job, and fully engage in the community," said Governor Hogan. "We took an important step to expand employment opportunities with the Second Chance Act, but there are continued obstacles to re-entry that demand a thorough review."
