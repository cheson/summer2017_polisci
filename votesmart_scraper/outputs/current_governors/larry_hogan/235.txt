Governor Hogan Announces "Maryland Unites: Day of Service
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: June 1, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Hogan today announced "Maryland Unites: Day of Service," an initiative for state employees to offer their time and talents to benefit our citizens through community service. This opportunity stems in part from the outpouring of kindness and good will from Maryland citizens following acts of destruction in Baltimore City last month.
"In the past few weeks, I have witnessed incredible acts of kindness and volunteerism from members of a community who truly care for one another," said Governor Hogan. "Maryland Unites: Day of Service is about continuing that spirit of giving back and sharing it with Baltimore City and our local communities."
As part of the day of service, state employees will receive four hours of paid leave to participate in an accredited 501 (c)(3) of their choice. In addition, Governor Hogan's Executive Cabinet will coordinate a volunteer event for employees at their respective agencies. Agency employees who would like to take part in the Day of Service effort will have the option to participate in the agency event or a volunteer activity of their choice.
