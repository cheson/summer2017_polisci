Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 22, 2015
Location: Baltimore, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today announced $135 million in targeted investments to transform and improve transit throughout the Baltimore metropolitan area. The multi-phase plan will create an interconnected transit system, known as BaltimoreLink, and includes redesigning the entire local and express bus systems throughout Baltimore and adding 12 new high-frequency, color-coded bus routes that improve connections to jobs and other transit modes.
"This comprehensive plan signifies the state's long-term commitment to the future of Baltimore City by providing a more reliable and timely transit experience, and better connections to jobs," said Governor Hogan. "For years, Maryland's largest and most important city had an antiquated and broken transit system, but with this vision, the people of Baltimore and surrounding jurisdictions will finally be able to travel conveniently, efficiently and affordably from where they live to where they work."
