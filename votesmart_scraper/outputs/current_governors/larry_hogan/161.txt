Governor Larry Hogan, along with state and local elected officials, today announced a new 30-year contract between the Maryland Department of Transportation's Maryland Port Administration and the Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore's top roll on/roll off customer, global shipping and logistics giant Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics (WWL). Roll on/roll off cargo includes everything from cars to heavy farm and construction machinery such as harvesters, combines, excavators, and dump trucks. The new partnership guarantees that WWL will continue serving the Port of Baltimore through 2045.
"Our entire administration is committed to making Maryland more business friendly, and today we add WWL to our state's growing list of business success stories," said Governor Hogan. "This new contract, tying WWL's success to that of the Port of Baltimore for the next three decades, will support nearly 1,000 jobs here in Maryland and is a ringing endorsement of the strength and importance of this partnership."
