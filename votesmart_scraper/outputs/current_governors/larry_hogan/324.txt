Maryland Reporter Decries State Health Exchange's "Historical Record of Obfuscation"
Press Release

In the latest news surrounding the secrecy and lack of transparency that plague the O'Malley-Brown administration, the Maryland Reporter today highlighted how the documents released to the public regarding Lt. Gov. Brown's failed health exchange "were so thoroughly incomplete and heavily redacted that auditors could not perform an audit according to professional standards."
"The exchange should not be allowed to hide its own culpability behind a claim of executive privilege. Richard Nixon tried that," the article says.
Larry Hogan today issued the following statement in response to the story: "Today's report underscores what every Marylander knows to be true, but what Lt. Gov. Brown won't admit: As the leader of the rollout of the dysfunctional health exchange, he has an obligation to the Maryland people to come clean on what exactly went wrong and why $288 million of taxpayer funds were wasted. Our state leaders cannot invoke "executive privilege' and just sweep the loss of $288 million of wasted taxpayer funds under the rug."
Just last month, Larry Hogan held a press conference on the alleged backdoor dealings surrounding the rollout of the health exchange, and called for a state investigation. The state exchange is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Inspector General, and subpoenas have been issued into possible fraud, and the waste and abuse of federal taxpayer dollars. Hogan officially requested that the Offices of the Attorney General, State Prosecutor, and U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland conduct an investigation into whether the O'Malley-Brown administration evaded Maryland law by awarding massive "emergency" no-bid contracts to companies to "repair" the failed exchange. These same firms had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic Governors Association. Of particular concern is whether these suspicious donations to the DGA have been funneled to and are now funding ads being run to promote Lt. Governor Brown's gubernatorial campaign.
