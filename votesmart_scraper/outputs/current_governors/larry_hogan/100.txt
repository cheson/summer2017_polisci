RainKing Software, Inc., a leader in IT sales intelligence, is moving from its current headquarters on Rockledge Drive in Bethesda to a new, larger space on Old Georgetown Road. As part of the relocation and expansion, RainKing is planning to add more than 60 new sales, research, engineering and client success positions as it continues to successfully grow its market share within the sales intelligence solutions industry.
"Since RainKing's inception, Maryland has been our home, and we are excited at the prospect of continuing the growth and success of the company in downtown Bethesda," said CEO John Stanfill. "Bethesda is the perfect place for us to launch the next era of RainKing. The lively urban setting, complete with direct access to the metro and hundreds of eateries, will allow us to attract and retain the region's best and brightest sales professionals. "
RainKing provides rich, up-to-date sales intelligence on more than 50,000 mid- to large-size organizations and over 700,000 IT leaders and decision-makers across the globe. Its SaaS-based solution allows customers to identify their best prospects and empowers sales teams to effectively target the key decision makers. RainKing's research team also uncovers more than 1,500 new, actionable spending triggers -- called InsideScoopsÂ™ -- which are published to customers every business day. The company works with established players in the tech space, like HP, Dell and IBM, as well as high-growth companies like Tableau, FireEye, and Splunk.
"Creating jobs and helping companies reach the next level of growth is a key goal of our administration," said Governor Hogan. "RainKing is one of a number of high-tech companies that have chosen to grow and expand in Maryland this year -- a testament to our well-qualified workforce and growing business environment. We wish them even more success in the years to come."
"We are proud to support RainKing's expansion in Maryland," said Maryland Department of Commerce Secretary Mike Gill. "Maryland Commerce, working in lock step with our local partners in Montgomery County, is committed to help growing companies like RainKing and ensuring they continue to call Maryland home."
"Montgomery County is pleased to support the relocation and expansion of RainKing's cutting-edge information and software work," said Montgomery County Executive Ike Leggett. "The future is here and companies such as RainKing are an important part of that future."
To assist with the expansion, the Maryland Department of Commerce has approved a $200,000 conditional loan through the Maryland Economic Development Assistance Authority and Fund (MEDAAF). The company is also eligible for a number of state and local tax credits. Additionally, Montgomery County has approved a $100,000 grant convertible to a loan from the county's Economic Development Fund.
