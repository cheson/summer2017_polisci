Issue Position: Jobs, the Middle Class, and Restoring Maryland's Economy
Issue Position
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Jan. 1, 2014
Location: Unknown

Despite all of our natural advantages -- a deep port, highly educated workforce, proximity to large urban areas -- Maryland's economy ranks 44th out of 50 states and our unemployment rate is up 100%. Maryland's families deserve better!
Job one will be to get the government off our backs and out of our pockets so we can grow the private sector, put people back to work and turn our economy around.
We are the only state in the nation that taxes the rain. When Hogan is governor, we'll repeal the rain tax. That's one change you can count on.
