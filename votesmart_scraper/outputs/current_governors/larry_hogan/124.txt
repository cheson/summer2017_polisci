Statement from Governor Larry Hogan on Unanimous Passage of Budget in Senate
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: March 17, 2016
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today released the following statement in response to the unanimous passage of the FY 2017 budget in the Maryland Senate:
"I would like to thank Senate President Mike Miller, Chairman Kasemeyer, and the members of the Senate for their hard work and unanimous vote on this budget. Working in a bipartisan fashion to give our great state a sound fiscal foundation is a shared responsibility, and today's vote shows both leadership and partnership toward a common goal.
"The fiscally responsible budget we introduced in January provides historic education funding for the second year in a row, significant investments in Maryland's neglected transportation system, and delivers 100 percent of the aid that local jurisdictions had anticipated.
"Together, we have made substantial progress, but there is much more work to be done and actions taken by the Senate to reduce the Rainy Day Fund, fence off budget dollars, and reduce Highway User Revenues are certainly matters of concern. In order to keep moving forward, and to build upon the progress of the past year, we must continue to focus on our long-term finances, live within our means, and strive for the much-needed mandate and tax relief our citizens expect and deserve."
