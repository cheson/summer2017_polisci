Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today announced that $2 million in grant funding will be distributed among 11 arts and cultural organizations, including $467,000 to the Maryland Science Center in Baltimore and $790,000 to the Maryland State Arts Council, reversing a mid-year funding reduction imposed during the final days of the prior administration.
"The First Lady and I are huge proponents of the arts, and I am excited that we have been able to restore this grant money," said Governor Hogan. "My administration is committed to providing full funding for the arts in a fiscally responsible manner."
The 11 organizations to receive the funding are the Maryland Science Center, the Maryland Historical Society, Center Stage, Arts Every Day and Arena Players in Baltimore City; Sotterley Plantation in St. Mary's County; Doleman Black Heritage Museum in Washington County; Prince George's African American Museum in Prince George's County; along with these statewide organizations: the Maryland State Arts Council, Young Audiences of Maryland, and the Maryland Humanities Council.
Much of the funding will be further disbursed by the Maryland State Arts Council to more than 150 arts organizations and programs throughout the state, as well as to the designated county arts councils in all 23 counties and Baltimore City.
