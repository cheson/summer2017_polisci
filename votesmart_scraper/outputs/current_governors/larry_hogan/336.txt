Brown to Raise Our Gas Tax -- Again
Press Release

Location: Annapolis, MD

On January 1, 2015, Marylanders will pay an additional 3.5 cents or more per gallon for gas and diesel as a result of Anthony Brown's largest-ever motor fuel tax hike which includes automatic increases twice a year for years to come.
"Once again, career politician Lt. Gov. Brown proves to Maryland's struggling families that he will say and do anything to get elected. Even before he is sworn in, Brown will break his promise to hardworking Marylanders by increasing the gas tax," charged Hogan. "Gas prices continue to remain high and Marylanders feel real pain every time we fill up at the pump. We can't afford another tax increase, but Lt. Gov. Brown will turn his back on the rest of us and increase them anyway."
AAA-Mid Atlantic says Maryland is ranked 25th in the nation for the highest state motor fuel tax rate on gasoline purchases. By the time all of Brown's gas tax increases go into effect, Maryland will have one of the highest motor fuel taxes in the country.
