The Hogan administration today strengthened the State of Maryland's business ties with South Korea at a signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the State and Gyeonggi Province, South Korea's most populous province and the country's major economic center.
On behalf of Governor Larry Hogan, Lieutenant Governor Boyd Rutherford signed the MOU, along with the governor of Gyeonggi Province, Nam Kyung-pil, at the Maryland State House. The MOU fosters economic and cultural development for both Maryland and Gyeonggi, as the two parties agree to work together to maximize business opportunities; strengthen cooperation in the research and development sector; advance enterprises, including startups; create jobs; and generate new economic opportunities in both regions.
"I had the pleasure of meeting with Governor Nam during our trade mission to Asia, when we discussed our regions' potential for cooperation and partnership," said Governor Hogan. "Today's agreement solidifies this partnership, and is another key step forward in strengthening Maryland's business and cultural ties with South Korea."
