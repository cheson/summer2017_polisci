Governor Larry Hogan today hosted an exercise for top administration officials at the Maryland Emergency Management Agency in Reisterstown. The discussion and drill, which focused on a blizzard scenario, boosted state agencies' ability to collaborate on a variety of issues that can arise during winter storms and related emergencies.
"Maryland is susceptible to a wide range of natural hazards, including winter storms, hurricanes, and flooding," said Governor Hogan. "I have directed my administration to work together before the first snowstorm this season to ensure that state government can effectively respond to a storm or any emergency this winter."
