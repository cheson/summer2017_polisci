Issue Position: Make it Easier for Maryland Families and Job Creators to Stay Here
Issue Position

Every decision Larry Hogan makes as governor will be put to a simple test -- Will this law or action make it easier for families and small businesses to stay in Maryland and will it make more families and businesses want to come to Maryland?
If something comes across Hogan's desk as governor that doesn't pass this test, he'll veto it.
