Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Sept. 28, 2014
Location: Cambridge, MD

The Hogan for Governor campaign hosted over 1,500 farmers, watermen, and their families at a "Harvesters for Hogan" rally at Sailwinds Park in Cambridge on Sunday. The event featured chicken, crabs, and produce from local farmers and watermen. The rally came on the heels of the endorsement of Larry Hogan by the Maryland Farm Bureau.
Larry Hogan said, "We are incredibly overwhelmed and thrilled by the support we saw here in Dorchester County today. For the last eight years, there has been a war on rural Maryland and our farmers and watermen by the O'Malley-Brown administration. In the Hogan-Rutherford administration, we are going to bring farmers and watermen to the table and come up with comprehensive, common-sense solutions to our state's problems without threatening our two most historic and important industries."
