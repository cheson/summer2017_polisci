Governor Larry Hogan and First Lady Yumi Hogan today welcomed the members of garden clubs from 11 Maryland counties and Baltimore City to participate in a Christmas tree decorating event at the State House.

"I want to thank all of the participating garden clubs for putting their time, talents, and creativity into helping to deck the halls of the State House."
