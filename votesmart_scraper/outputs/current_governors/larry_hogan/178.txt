Hogan Administration Announces New Lead-Testing Plan for Children
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 26, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

The Hogan administration today announced the new Lead Testing Targeting Plan for Childhood Lead, which calls for all Maryland children to be tested at ages 1 and 2, no matter where they live. Previously, only children living in so-called "at risk" ZIP codes or who were enrolled in Medicaid had to be tested.
"We have made great progress in reducing lead exposure in Maryland over the past 20 years," Governor Hogan said. "However, we need to test all children, not just a handful, in order to put an end to childhood lead poisoning in Maryland once and for all."
