After two terms of record tax increases and spending as Lieutenant Governor, Anthony Brown now says he has a plan to cut waste from the state budget--but his estimate of anticipated savings would involve hiking community college tuition.
Brown, in his "Government Efficiency Plan," uses Florida's savings plan as a roadmap for cost savings in Maryland.
The Lt. Governor's plan includes hiking community college tuition for students. "Anthony Brown is a typical tax-and-spend career politician who has attempted to balance his bloated, wasteful budget at the expense of struggling families," said Hogan. "Is it any surprise that his plan would cut necessary programs for college students?"
Including hikes in tuition for community college students who take too many credit hours, the Florida plan, which Brown uses as a roadmap for his "savings plan" also reduces scholarships and financial aid for college students.
Hogan added, "Anthony Brown has had eight years to implement his "government efficiency plan,' and this is what he comes up with? Hardworking Maryland taxpayers have been wondering why he's remained quiet about the details of his so-called savings plan. Now we have an answer: His destructive cuts would hurt the most vulnerable in our state. College students have already had to bear the burden of the increasing cost of college and regressive tax increases, including an increase in the sales tax which affects the price of everything from school supplies to textbooks, as well as the gas tax, and a variety of increased fees. The Lt. Governor has made it more difficult for these bright young students to get ahead at every turn."
