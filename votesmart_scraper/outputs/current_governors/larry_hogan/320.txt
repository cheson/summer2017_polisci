Larry Hogan Returns to Wicomico and Talbot Counties Today to Talk Economy; Eastern Shore Has Lost Jobs and Businesses Faster Than the Rest of the State
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 22, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

Gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan will return to the Eastern Shore today as part of a statewide Change Maryland Bus Tour. It will be his 18th visit to the Shore during the general election season.
"Overtaxed and underappreciated, Eastern Shore residents have been especially hard hit over the last eight years by the failed economic policies of Martin O'Malley and Anthony Brown," said Hogan. "Whether it's struggling family farmers or watermen who have paid the price for Annapolis' reckless policies, as governor I'll guarantee that these hardworking Marylanders have a seat at the table in all policy decisions that may impact them."
The Anne Arundel County small business owner continued, "As governor, I'll work in a bipartisan manner to reign in reckless government spending and begin rolling back the O'Malley-Brown administration's 40 straight job-killing tax hikes so Eastern Shore families and employers can keep more of their hard-earned money."
Hogan will campaign in Salisbury (Wicomico County) and Easton (Talbot County) to talk to voters and business leaders about his plan for economic renewal on the Shore and throughout the state. The trip follows an event he held with 1,500 watermen and farmers in Cambridge last month, and includes visits to shipyard and naval architecture firm Chesapeake Shipbuilding Corporation in Wicomico County, as well as a meeting with several dozen small businesses to discuss how to make the Shore more business-friendly.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, parts of the Eastern Shore have unemployment rates that are 50 percent higher than Maryland's average. Somerset County has the second-highest unemployment rate in the state and Wicomico County has the fourth-highest. Seven of the nine counties on the Eastern Shore have an unemployment rate higher than the national rate.
"Maryland's increasingly burdensome regulations have made it more difficult for businesses to thrive on the Shore," Hogan added. According to federal statistics, between 2007 and 2011, the Eastern Shore lost 11 percent of its business establishments, a considerably higher share than the state as a whole.
