Phony political spin, questionable donations, cronyism, and backroom deals pervade the current culture in Annapolis. We need more transparency in our government, more truthfulness and tougher ethics and disclosure laws that will begin to clean up the mess in Annapolis and restore integrity to our state capital.
On day one, Hogan will get to work on cleaning up the mess in Annapolis and bring integrity to our state capital.
