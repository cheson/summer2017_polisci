Hogan Emerges as Clear Winner in First Debate
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 7, 2014
Location: Baltimore, MD

Larry Hogan emerged as the clear winner against Lt. Governor Anthony Brown as the pair faced off in the first general election debate this morning, taped at WJZ studios in Baltimore, which will air this evening at 7 pm. Throughout the debate, Lt. Governor Brown agreed with Hogan that the current administration hasn't done enough to improve Maryland's economy.
"I encourage everyone to tune in tonight to watch this first conversation on how to change Maryland. The Lt. Governor and I have a very real differences on how to put people back to work and improve our economy," said Hogan. "This year, the people of Maryland have a real, clear choice for a change -- more spending and higher taxes from Lt. Governor Brown or common sense solutions to our state's serious economic problems."
"Anthony Brown and the current administration's misguided economic policies have destroyed our economy and crushed hardworking Marylanders and their families. Poll after poll shows that Marylanders are focused on the economy, jobs, and taxes. That has been my entire focus for the last three years. If you are happy with the way things have been going with the economy in Maryland over the last eight years, you should probably vote for my opponent. But if you're ready to move in a new direction, with a renewed focus on restoring our economy and rolling back as many of these 40 consecutive taxes as possible, then I ask you to join me to make a real difference to bring about change."
