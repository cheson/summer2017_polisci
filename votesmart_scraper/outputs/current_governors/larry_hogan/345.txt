Hogan Releases Latest Ad, "Deserve Better;" Says Brown's Negative Campaign Has Backfired; Race is About the Economy
Press Release

Location: Annapolis, MD

The Hogan for Governor campaign released another advertisement today, in which he makes the claim that the people of Maryland "deserve better" than the failed policies of Anthony Brown and the current administration. The new ad comes on the heels of a recent poll from Gonzales that shows the governor's race is neck and neck, within just four points.
Larry Hogan said, "Anthony Brown's negative campaign has completely backfired. Our strategy of hitting the streets and meeting as many voters as possible has closed the gap. Brown is unable and unwilling to defend his record, so he has resorted to scare tactics. The good news for us, is that Marylanders are too smart for these desperate tactics, and our bipartisan, economic message is resonating with voters of all walks of life."
TRANSCRIPT:
"I think my opponent is unable and unwilling to defend his record, which is why he is defaming and slandering me with these outrageous, false ads. I am the only candidate in this race that favors over-the-counter birth control, paid for by insurance. With respect to women's rights, nothing would change with me as governor. We've lost businesses, jobs, and families at an alarming rate because of the O'Malley-Brown policies, and that's what this race is really about. The people of Maryland deserve better, and really, that's why I'm running for governor."
