As the campaign for governor heats up, the candidates are vying for every vote, and now it appears both Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown and Larry Hogan are focusing on women.
Political reporter Pat Warren asked the candidates about women's voter influence.
As you've probably noticed, it's issues that appeal to women that are dominating campaign ads right now.
A campaign confrontation centers on women's rights in Maryland.
"Hogan opposes a woman's right to choose. He wants to ban abortions even in cases of rape and incest," a Brown ad says
"Let me tell you about my dad, Larry Hogan. He's the only candidate who favors over-the-counter birth control covered by insurance," a Hogan ad says..
Hogan's answer to the Brown ad hit the air Friday, featuring one of his three daughters.
"My wife and my three daughters have really been hurt by the lies and these terrible attacks from my opponent," Hogan said.
The reproductive rights issue is one of several directed to women voters.
