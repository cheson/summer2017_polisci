Date: Nov. 3, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today joined Maryland State Police Superintendent Colonel William Pallozzi to officially reopen the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack.
In reopening the barrack, Governor Hogan fulfilled a promise made during the 2015 legislative session, and reaffirmed the administration's commitment to making sure that the Maryland State Police remains among the most effective, trusted, and respected police force in the United States. Earlier this year, Governor Hogan also budgeted for the State Police to hire 100 new troopers, 50 of whom are currently in training.
"Our administration is committed to making sure Maryland's Finest have all the resources they need to continue their excellent service," Governor Larry Hogan said. "Reopening Barrack "J' is a step in the right direction, and will allow our police to better serve the citizens of Annapolis and the state at-large."
