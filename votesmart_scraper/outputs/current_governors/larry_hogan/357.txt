Today, the Hogan for Governor campaign announced that the Maryland Fire Chiefs Association has unanimously endorsed Annapolis small businessman Larry Hogan for governor. The Maryland Fire Chiefs Association is a nonpartisan organization made up of both career and volunteer firefighters and represents the interests of firefighters in every jurisdiction of the state; it comprises more than 1,400 member companies.
Hogan said, "I am truly honored to receive the endorsement of the Maryland Fire Chiefs Association--a heroic group of men and women who put their lives on the line to protect the citizens of our great state each and every day. I look forward to working closely with them in the years ahead to make Maryland a safer place to live."
"When we are called, we do not ask if someone is rich or poor, old or young, or what neighborhood they are from; we just respond to the situation using our training and talents, trying to leave the situation better than we found it," said Chief Paul H. Sterling, Jr., Corresponding Secretary of the MFCA. "We are very proud to endorse Larry Hogan for governor, as he possesses the same can-do attitude."
Sterling added, "Governor Larry Hogan will bring life experiences, vision, and passion to our state, and will make sure our government is responsive to the needs of the people. Larry is the candidate who will be the voice of our citizens. We know Larry will advocate passionately for the values, programs, and policies that will make a stronger middle class in Maryland. He is ready to respond, and we know he will fight tirelessly to protect the citizens of our state."
