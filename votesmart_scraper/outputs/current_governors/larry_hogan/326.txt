The Hogan-Rutherford Campaign today issued the following statement on Bechtel's announcement that they would be moving 1,100 positions from Frederick, Md. to Reston, Va:
According to gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan, "We are saddened to learn that another 1,100 well-paying jobs will be leaving Maryland for Virginia. Though Bechtel is one of those "largest, wealthiest" corporations that Anthony Brown demonizes, the loss of these valued jobs will ripple through Frederick as dozens of small businesses -- restaurants, repair shops, suppliers, cleaners, and delivery firms -- will suffer and with them, the local community's tax revenue," said Hogan.
Anthony Brown, whose administration has raised taxes forty straight times on struggling Maryland families and employers, has criticized tax incentives for "a small group of the largest, wealthiest corporations who need the help the least." Yet according to news reports, the O'Malley-Brown administration gave Bechtel -- a private multinational conglomerate with 53,000 employees -- more than $9 million in grants to keep its 1,100 employees in Frederick.
Hogan continued, "Instead of the O'Malley-Brown Administration's tax breaks to only a select number of politically powerful corporations, we'll get reckless spending under control so we can roll back the taxes that disproportionately hit struggling families and small businesses."
Quoted in Frederick News Post, Frederick County Commissioners President Blaine Young said in part, "The move reflects the difficulty of doing business in Maryland, Young said, with higher taxes and regulations than Virginia."
