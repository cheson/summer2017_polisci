Governor Larry Hogan today praised the Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore and all its employees for moving more cargo from the public marine terminals than in any other time in its history, demonstrating the strength of this economic engine for Maryland. The Port moved more than 9.7 million tons of general cargo and more than 808,000 20-foot containers in Fiscal Year 2015 and continues to set additional major benchmarks. The new record marks include:
Most General Cargo Tons in a Fiscal Year--9,742,050 tons. General cargo includes containers, autos, roll on/roll off (farm and construction machinery), forest products, and break bulk cargo.
Most General Cargo Tons in the first six months of a calendar year--4,881,105 tons.
Most TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit) containers in a single month--79,644 units set in June 2015.
Most TEU containers in a 12-month period--808,500 units in the 12-month period ending in June 2015.
"This administration is committed to changing Maryland for the better and ensuring our state is open for business and nowhere is that more true than at the Port of Baltimore," Governor Larry Hogan said. "Our Port continues to prove why it is one of the top-producing ports in the nation and one of Maryland's leading economic engines. In my first six months as governor, the Port of Baltimore has thrived, moving 4.88 million tons of general cargo to and from our state's shores -- the most in any other first six months in history."
Recently the Port of Baltimore was named as the top U.S. port for container berth productivity by a leading industry media company. The Seagirt Marine Terminal, the Port of Baltimore's primary container facility, includes 11 cranes, four of which are Super Post-Panamax capable of handling the biggest ships in the world.
The Port of Baltimore's public marine terminals had a record year in 2014 and overall the Port saw 29.5 million tons of international cargo cross its docks at a value of nearly $53 billion. Baltimore is ranked as the top port among all U.S. ports for handling autos and light trucks, farm and construction machinery, imported forest products, imported sugar, and imported aluminum. Overall, Baltimore is ranked ninth for the total dollar value of cargo and 13th for cargo tonnage for all U.S. ports.
Business at the Port of Baltimore generates about 14,630 direct jobs, while about 108,000 jobs in Maryland are linked to port activities. The Port is responsible for $3 billion in personal wages and salary and more than $300 million in state and local tax revenues.
