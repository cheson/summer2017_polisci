Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today joined with Frederick County and City officials and executives from AstraZeneca at a ribbon cutting ceremony for a $200 million expansion of the company's biologics manufacturing center in Frederick. Just recently, McCormick & Company, Inc., announced their plan to keep its headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland.
"I am excited to participate in this groundbreaking, and to see an important company like AstraZeneca, whose work makes a meaningful difference to patients across the nation, expand its footprint here in our state," said Governor Hogan. "Companies like AstraZeneca and McCormick are shining examples of where our state is headed with respect to job creation and economic development."
Announced in late 2014, the project is expected to create 300 new jobs and increase production capacity to support AstraZeneca's maturing pipeline. Additionally, the expansion will position the company to keep pace with a growing demand for the development and use of biologics, which currently represent nearly 50 percent of AstraZeneca's overall pipeline.
Expected to be complete in mid-2017, the expansion will add approximately 40,000 additional square feet of manufacturing, laboratory and administrative space to the existing building.
The Frederick site is AstraZeneca's largest biologics manufacturing facility within the company's global network and portfolio of assets, and a worldwide industry leader in cell culture manufacturing. The site currently produces a pediatric medication, as well as other investigational biologic products.
