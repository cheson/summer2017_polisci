Campaigning at the Maryland State Firemen's Association parade here, Larry Hogan slammed today's decision by the US Patent and Trademark Office to cancel several of the Washington Redskins' trademarks. The GOP gubernatorial frontrunner is a native of Landover in Prince George's County, home to the 82-year-old National Football League franchise.
According to Hogan, "Whether you're a fan of the Redskins, the Ravens, or God forbid, the Cowboys; today's unprecedented action by the US Patent and Trademark Office should offend anyone concerned about Constitutional limits on government power and free speech. This matter should be decided upon by the Redskins and their fans without the politically-motivated interference of pandering state and federal politicians," Hogan said.
