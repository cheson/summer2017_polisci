Governor Larry Hogan Applauds $27.8 Million Grant for SCMaglev in Maryland
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Nov. 7, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

The U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded $27.8 million in Federal Railroad Administration funds to support ongoing efforts by the private sector to bring Superconducting Magnetic Levitation (SCMaglev) trains to the Northeast region. The Baltimore-Washington corridor was one of three corridors in the United States eligible to apply for these funds for Maglev projects. The Maryland application for the federal grant was submitted in April with the understanding that the Japanese government will be a source of significant financial backing for the project, along with private-sector support from Baltimore-Washington Rapid Rail LLC.
"The ability to travel between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. in only 15 minutes will be absolutely transformative, not just for these two cities, but for our entire state," Governor Larry Hogan said. "This grant will go a long way in helping us determine our next steps in this transportation and economic development opportunity."
