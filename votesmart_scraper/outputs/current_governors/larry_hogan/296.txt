Press Release

Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today submitted 331 appointment nominations, known as "Green Bag" appointments, to the Maryland State Senate.
The governor's appointments secretary, James Fielder, presented Senate President Mike Miller with the names of nominees, which include representatives from all 23 counties and Baltimore City. The 331 names submitted represent one of the highest totals in recent history for these types of appointees and demonstrates the outpouring of bipartisan support the governor and the administration have received from the citizens of Maryland.
"The names submitted today represent our administration's commitment to the people of Maryland to provide the responsive, competent, and well-qualified state government they deserve and expect," said Governor Hogan. "I am proud that they are reflective of the diverse nature of our state, and I look forward to seeing the great work that these outstanding men and women will accomplish over the next few years. Over 10 percent of today's nominations will fill roles on boards and commissions focused on economic development across the state."
Reflecting the administration's commitment to making Maryland a more business-friendly state, the governor made 10 nominations to the Maryland Economic Development Commission. These include established and respected leaders of the business community such as Anirban Basu, James Brady, and Aristides Melissaratos.
Governor Hogan also made a number of key nominations to the University System of Maryland Board of Regents -- nominations that will help to strengthen the state's already strong and growing public higher education system.
"The governor and I are incredibly proud of the selections we have made to fill key leadership positions throughout the state," said Appointments Secretary Jim Fielder. "These individuals come from all parts of Maryland and from diverse ethnic and professional backgrounds. We are confident that these men and women will all work hard to change Maryland for the better."
This year's Green Bag includes appointment nominations for over 90 different boards and commissions. A sampling of the nominations include:
* Anirban Basu, Baltimore County -- Maryland Economic Development Commission
* Hon. Barry Glassman, Harford County -- Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO) Board of Directors
* Michael L. Higgs, Jr., Montgomery County -- Public Service Commission
* Claire M. Fraser, Ph.D. -- Howard County, Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) Board of Directors
* Matthew Lee, Montgomery County -- Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) Board of Directors
* Mary Shank Creek, Washington County -- Agricultural and Resource-Based Industry Development Corporation (MARBIDCO)
Board of Directors of Maryland
* Robert R. Neall, Anne Arundel County -- University System of Maryland Board of Regents
* Theo Ngongang, Baltimore City -- Critical Area Commission for the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays
* Carolyn Cummins, Worcester County -- Critical Area Commission for the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays
Dating back to 17th-century England, the term "Green Bag" refers to the green satchel that is used once every year to bring the gubernatorial nominations to the Senate. It is a longstanding tradition for a member of the governor's staff to deliver the bag once a year to the Maryland State Senate.
