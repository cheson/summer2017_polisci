Lt. Governor Boyd Rutherford and Deputy Chief of Mission Hiroyasu Izumi of the Japanese Embassy today signed a driver's license reciprocity agreement between Maryland and Japan. The signed memorandum of cooperation allows Japanese citizens living in Maryland to obtain a license without having to take the driving or written licensing exams if they are already licensed to drive in Japan. It gives the same option to Maryland residents living in Japan.
"This agreement is another symbol of our strong relationship with Japan," said Lt. Governor Boyd Rutherford. "The reciprocity agreement is fair and equitable and provides benefits to both of our economies by streamlining the process for obtaining a license and encouraging trade between our countries."
