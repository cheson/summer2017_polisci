Hundreds turned out in Crisfield on Wednesday to pick crabs, eat clams, drink beer and to rub elbows at the 38th annual J. Millard Tawes Crab and Clam Bake.
At this Maryland summertime institution, the food is served up with a huge heaping of politicians.
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan had a tent of his own. He spent the day shaking hands. Hogan says Tawes is always a good party, but the backdrop to the event is a county that's struggling -- one that doesn't always get the political attention it needs.
"It's kind of at the end of the road. This is a very depressed county, Somerset County," Hogan said. "They really are in trouble. These folks really need our help. We've got to find some ways to bring some jobs and industry here."
This is likely Hogan territory; the Eastern Shore skews strongly Republican. Hogan's Democratic opponent, Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown was not at the festival. His campaign staff said he'd planned to attend, but was held up at a funeral.
At the end of the day, Gracie Schmidt was cutting off armbands at the exit. She came here from Texas 25 years ago and she says she's been a volunteer every year since.
"Everybody has a good time. And if they don't, it's their own fault. And if they don't get enough food, shame on them," Schmidt said.
When all was said and done, Schmidt said guests ate almost 200 bushels of crabs and 57,000 clams. Not a bad time, she says, even with all the politicians.
