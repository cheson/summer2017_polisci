The current administration has imposed over 40 tax hikes that we don't need, don't want, and can't afford. Their policies have driven small businesses and taxpayers out of our state at an alarming rate and, as a result, we have hemorrhaged jobs. Worse, the programs they do try to implement -- like the Maryland Health Exchange -- end up hurting the very people they are intended to help.
