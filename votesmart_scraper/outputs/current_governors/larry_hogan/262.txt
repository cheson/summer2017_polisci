Location: Reisterstown, MD

Governor Larry Hogan and Maryland officials continue to coordinate the state's response to violent civil unrest that has occurred in Baltimore City over the past day, and has included over 200 arrests and at least 19 structure fires. Maryland agencies are working together at the State Emergency Operations Center, which has been fully activated at the Maryland Emergency Management Agency since this past weekend's demonstrations, in order to provide support to Baltimore City and manage state actions.
"As the state aggressively takes action to restore peace and order in Baltimore City, I want the citizens of Maryland to know that the state is fully engaged on all levels" said Governor Larry Hogan. "National Guardsmen, Maryland State Troopers, and supplies have been sent to areas within the city and we will continue to provide resources as needed."
