Statement From Governor Larry Hogan On Saturday Protests
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: May 2, 2015
Location: Baltimore, MD

Governor Larry Hogan released the following statement in response to planned protests today in Baltimore:
"In advance of the many planned protests today, I am once again strongly urging all citizens of Baltimore, and those from outside our city and state, to remain peaceful and nonviolent. Since the violence of Monday, we have experienced four days and nights of relative calm and respect, and that must continue going forward. The right to demonstrate is a fundamental part of our society, but damaging property or putting innocent bystanders in danger will not be tolerated.
"Over the past week, I have witnessed countless acts of compassion and leadership by the residents of Baltimore, many working to keep the peace and repair our neighborhoods. I have also witnessed the selfless dedication of the National Guard, State Police, as well as first responders from Baltimore and the surrounding states and counties, who are willing to put themselves in harm's way to keep the peace -- something for which all Marylanders should be ever thankful."
