Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan says the state of Maryland should not house some of the thousands of children coming into the U.S. illegally from Central America.
Hogan says the state needs to respond to this "humanitarian crisis" by providing for their immediate needs of food, and clothing and medical care, but then Hogan says these children have to be deported.
"I want to reunite them back with their parents in their home countries," Hogan told the C-4 Show today.
"I think it is absolutely ridiculous to take these children and to be busing them thousands of miles from their point of entry, to try to house them in Maryland, when we can't house our own kids, and we have a broken health care system."
On Monday, Governor O'Malley asked clergy leaders to help create a network of foster families to help house these children, provide them with access to health care, and to provide them with other assistance as they wait to be reunited with relatives, or wait to be sent home.
The governor's plan is seeking to house up to 2,000 children. Already more than 2,000 have come to Maryland this year, and are staying with either foster families or relatives.
Catholic Charities is seeking a federal grant to house about 50 children in St. Vincent Villa in Timonium.
