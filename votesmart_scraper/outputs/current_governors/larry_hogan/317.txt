WBAL: "Comptroller Peter Franchot Calls for Accountability with Health Exchange Spending"
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.

Location: Annapolis, MD

The latest WBAL-TV investigation into rampant mismanagement and waste of tax dollars by the Anthony Brown Health Exchange found that "nearly $1 million was spent to set up an emergency call center in January, but the state exchange required almost nothing to justify the money that was paid."
According to gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan "This is just the latest example of the Anthony Brown Health Exchange's lack of transparency, incompetent management and horrendous waste of our tax dollars. This should infuriate every Marylander - regardless of party affiliation - whose taxes were hiked by Anthony Brown only to be wasted due to shear incompetence," said Larry Hogan. "Not only did Maryland taxpayers foot the bill for a failed website, money spent on an emergency call center to help Marylanders who couldn't access the broken site was just as carelessly spent."
Hogan has called for the Maryland Attorney General, the State Prosecutor and the US Attorney to investigate whether the O'Malley-Brown Administration awarded contracts to vendors in return for political donations.
