Governor Larry Hogan and Maryland officials continue to coordinate the state's response to violent civil unrest that has occurred in Baltimore City over the past day.

"We are working around the clock to ensure Baltimore City remains at peace, as it has throughout the day," said Governor Hogan. "The presence of the National Guard, Maryland State Police, and other law enforcement officials will continue in the days to come to ensure order is fully restored for the citizens of Baltimore."
