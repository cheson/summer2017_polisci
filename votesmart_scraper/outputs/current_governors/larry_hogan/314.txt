Public Statements
Hogan-Rutherford Endorsed by the Maryland Retired Veterans Task Force
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 31, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

The Hogan-Rutherford ticket picked up the endorsement of the Maryland Retired Veterans Task Force (MRVTF) today. MRVTF endorsed the ticket because of Hogan and Rutherford's strong support of the veteran community.
"Boyd and I are incredibly grateful for the endorsement of the Maryland Retired Veterans Task Force," said Larry Hogan. "And while in Annapolis we plan to do everything we can to support our veterans and their families, and keep them in Maryland."
"Lt. Gov. Brown, although a veteran himself, has not been supportive of the veterans community in any substantive way over the past 8 years that he has worked for Governor O'Malley," said Harvey Kaplan, Ph.D, a retired Colonel of the U.S. Army Corp and spokesman for the MRVTF. "Brown's record proves that he has failed in his efforts to perform the special tasks assigned to him by the governor. His work managing the program to enhance health insurance for Marylanders was a total failure -- as evidenced by his disastrous and wasteful handling of the conversion to a new online enrollment system. He has not provided any meaningful support to his fellow veterans and has never testified in their favor on any important bill affecting most of the half million veterans living in our state."
"Larry Hogan has been a supporter of all of the veterans of Maryland for many years, and will continue to serve all of our citizens, including our veterans, as Maryland's next governor," Kaplan said. "Larry Hogan is a successful businessman, former Maryland Cabinet Secretary, and long-time citizen activist. He has the skills we need."
