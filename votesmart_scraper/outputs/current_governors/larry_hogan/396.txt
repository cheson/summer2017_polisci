Beretta U.S.A. announced yesterday that it will be packing its bags and moving from Prince George's County, Md. to Tennessee by the end of 2015. Larry Hogan said Maryland's most restrictive gun control law yet, passed last year, was the "last straw" in a long line of offenses that motivated the firearm manufacturer to move.
"We're losing businesses, jobs, and tax payers at an alarming rate," the Republican Maryland Gubernatorial Candidate told WMAL Mornings on the Mall on Wednesday. "Sadly, Beretta is the latest casualty."
Visiting the Beretta factory and meeting with company leadership a few weeks ago, Hogan said he learned "shocking" information.
"They said, "You are the first person, the first candidate for governor to ever visit our factory.' And they're one of the largest employers in southern Maryland. They said the current administration wouldn't even return their phone calls."
Forty consecutive tax hikes and heavy regulations already made for a stifling business environment for the company who came to the United States from Italy in 1977. When the Maryland General Assembly passed a gun law last year that could potentially interfere with Beretta's manufacturing, it was the "icing on the cake," Hogan said.
According to Hogan, Gov. Martin O'Malley stated he doesn't care if the 500-year-old company and its hundreds of employees leave the state, and Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate Anthony Brown said he is "glad" to see them go.
