Hogan: $405 Million Revenue Shortfall "Utterly Devastating;" Reflects Overtaxed Maryland Families and Businesses Struggling to Make Ends Meet
Press Release

Date: Sept. 24, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

In the latest devastating critique of the O'Malley-Brown administration's economic policies, the Board of Revenue Estimates this afternoon reported that tax revenues will wildly miss the administration's projections. In fact, personal income, corporate income and sales tax revenues are on track to fall more than $405 million short over the next year.
According to Larry Hogan, "Today's report is utterly devastating and confirms what we have been saying, that Martin O'Malley and Anthony Brown have taxed and spent our economy into the ground. Overtaxed Marylanders are earning less, small business profits are disappearing and people have less to spend on goods and services."
Hogan said, "As governor, I'll put partisan politics aside and work across the aisle to undo the damage of the past eight years. We'll work together to reign in reckless spending and waste so we can roll back as many of the O'Malley and Brown's 40 straight tax hikes as possible. It's time for Annapolis to live within its means so people can keep more of their hard earned money.
Anthony Brown's solution to his failed economy is more of the same -- higher taxes on already struggling families and billions in new government spending without any plan to pay for it.
In a press release accompanying today's Board of Revenue Estimates report, Franchot said, "Wages and salaries are essentially stagnant. Local, independent businesses are struggling to meet payroll, cover their costs and turn a profit. Working families have cut back their spending because they just don't have the money, they're scared of losing their jobs, or, in many cases, both."
