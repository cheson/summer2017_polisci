Hogan Campaign Debuts Latest TV Ad, "Weak Leadership;" Slams Anthony Brown for Health Exchange Failure
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Sept. 12, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

The Hogan for Governor campaign released its latest ad of the 2014 election season today, hammering Lt. Governor Anthony Brown for his "weak leadership" of the failed rollout of the Maryland Health Connection website. The site crashed on its first day last fall and after spending tens of millions to repair the site, state officials ultimately decided to abandon it altogether and replace it with the technology from Connecticut's exchange.
The health exchange was one of Brown's only responsibilities as Lt. Governor. While the ad puts the cost of the exchange at $169.7 million, Maryland expects to spend a whopping $250 million on the exchange by the end of 2015. The exchange is under federal investigation by the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and subpoenas have been issued to determine if there was fraud in the system that cost taxpayers millions.
Larry Hogan said, "The ad is very clear: Anthony Brown is just not ready to be Governor. If the Lt. Governor had spent half the time actually leading the health exchange effort as he did running around the state bragging about how he was in charge and how Maryland would be a model for the nation, this might not have been such a catastrophic embarrassment. Now, tens of thousands of Marylanders have been dropped from their coverage, and are unable to gain coverage. These aren't just numbers -- they are children, mothers, fathers, diabetics, cancer patients, and more who don't have access to the health care they need."
The 30-second ad will begin airing today in the Baltimore market on broadcast TV.
