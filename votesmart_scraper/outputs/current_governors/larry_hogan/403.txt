The last time a Republican won a gubernatorial election in Maryland -- in 2002 -- GOP nominee Robert Ehrlich carried an estimated 55 percent of the state's independent voters on his way to winning by an overall statewide margin of 52-48 percent.
But in Montgomery County, where then -- as now -- there were twice as many independent voters as in any of the state's other major jurisdictions, Ehrlich couldn't break through the 40 percent vote barrier. He garnered just 39 percent in losing to his 2002 Democratic opponent, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, and his vote share in the county only shrank in two subsequent statewide losses to Democrat Martin O'Malley.
Does the first Republican gubernatorial candidate since 1998 not named Ehrlich think he can break the 40 percent hurdle in the state's most populous jurisdiction this year?
"I do," replied Larry Hogan, who served as the appointments secretary in Ehrlich's cabinet. "I hope we're going to be in the 40s."'
"We've spent quite a bit of time in Montgomery County, and we hope to spend a lot more time here. It's really critical for us to do better than the average Republican usually does here," Hogan said in an interview this past weekend during a stop in the county,
It will be a tall order -- not simply because of the county's overwhelmingly Democratic registration edge.
