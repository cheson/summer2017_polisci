Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan told residents of a retirement community Tuesday night that he wants to eliminate all state income taxes on pensions before the end of his administration.
Hogan unveiled the proposal in response to a question from a resident, one of about 500 people who attended a gubernatorial forum at Charlestown in Baltimore County, where the GOP nominee and Democratic rival Anthony G. Brown spoke.
Both men struck familiar themes for most of the evening until Hogan told the seniors that after he cut spending and got the economy under control, his priority would be to slash the taxes they pay. His promise earned him the loudest applause of the night for either candidate.
Asked about the proposal after the event, Hogan acknowledged that he did not know how much it would cost the state treasury but insisted it could be done.
"We don't have a revenue problem in Annapolis. We have a spending problem we need to control," he said. Hogan said the elimination of taxes on pensions and other retirement income -- even for affluent seniors -- should probably be a higher priority than cutting taxes for middle-class working families because of a need to stop what he called an "exodus" of seniors from Maryland.
Brown, asked about Hogan's promise after the forum, noted that the Republican had expanded on a proposal he made to the Fraternal Order of Police convention to eliminate taxes on pensions of law enforcement officers.
