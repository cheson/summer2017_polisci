State of the State Address

Speaker Busch, President Miller, members of the General Assembly, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.
It is an honor, and I am truly humbled, for the opportunity to appear before this 435th General Assembly -- as Maryland's new governor -- to report on the state of our state.
Marylanders are among the nation's hardest working and most educated people. We have universities and schools that are among the best in the nation.
No state can match the beauty of the Chesapeake Bay, our beaches and farms, or the mountains of Western Maryland, the Port of Baltimore, or the historic charm of every corner of our state.
But while our assets are many, and our people are strong and hopeful, their state is simply not as strong as it could be -- or as it should be.
We have a lot to do, to get Maryland back on track and working again.
The challenges we face are great.
High taxes, over-regulation, and an anti-business attitude are clearly the cause of our economic problems. Our economy is floundering, and too many Marylanders have been struggling, just to get by.
40 consecutive tax hikes have taken an additional $10 billion out of the pockets of struggling Maryland families and small businesses. We've lost more than 8,000 businesses, and Maryland's unemployment nearly doubled.
