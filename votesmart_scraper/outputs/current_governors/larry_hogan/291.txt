Bringing FBI Headquarters To Prince George's County A Key Goal
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: March 23, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Hogan today met with all 10 members of Maryland's delegation to the U.S. Congress to discuss the state's federal priorities, and to develop strategies to ensure the administration and delegation are jointly focused and working as a team to do what is best for the state.
A main emphasis of the meeting was the relocation of FBI headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Prince George's County--a move that would bring an estimated 11,500 jobs to Maryland. Currently, the largest proportion of the FBI's workforce resides in Maryland.
Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker joined the governor and the delegation after the meeting, highlighting that officials are united at the federal, state, and local levels in making sure the FBI headquarters relocates to Prince George's County. Strategic assets like Joint Base Andrews and the National Security Agency, as well as access to mass transit, make Prince George's County an ideal location.
Other key topics discussed included business and economic development, infrastructure, labor, licensing and regulation, housing and community development, the Maryland National Guard, and transportation.
"I'm so pleased the entire Maryland congressional delegation could join with us today," said Governor Hogan. "Supporting essential state programs and infrastructure is something we all agree on and can work together to achieve. If there is one issue on which we are speaking in a unified voice, it is the relocation of the FBI headquarters to Prince George's County. This is something we all want to see happen for the good of our state."
Both the administration and the members of the delegation pledged to remain in regular contact and to work together to make lasting improvements to the state.
