Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: April 28, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today announced that his administration is launching a new Web page, "Maryland Unites," as a way to provide information and encourage the public to lend a helping hand to the Baltimore community in the aftermath of this week's rioting and looting.
The Web page is a resource for citizens to do three important things in support of Baltimore City:
1) Obtain up-to-date information from law enforcement officials and pertinent state agencies;
2) Donate to charitable organizations assisting community members who are in need; and
3) Volunteer to assist in clean-up and other efforts.
"We have received an outpouring of support from Marylanders and people all around the country who want to help get our beloved Baltimore back on its feet in the wake of the violence and destruction," said Governor Hogan. "This Web page is a one-stop shop for citizens to help, and I encourage everyone to do what they can to assist Charm City at this difficult time."
