Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today attended the Washington Redskins home opener against the Miami Dolphins, along with four children from the Cool Kids Campaign, who are also battling cancer. The Cool Kids Campaign is a non-profit organization devoted to improving the quality of life for children with cancer and their families. At the game, Governor Hogan appeared with his four friends, Andrew (5), Jack (6), Benjamin (8), and Emily (13), in the end zone to recognize September as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.
"Since my diagnosis, I have met countless individuals who, just like me, are fighting cancer, and their strength and positivity has inspired me beyond words," said Governor Hogan. "Some of the strongest people I have ever met are the children who approach their cancer diagnosis and treatment with unimaginable faith and bravery. Today is a very special day, and I am honored to have the opportunity to raise awareness with these extraordinary kids who are fighting battles much more difficult than my own."
