Hogan Reiterates Earlier Calls for Several Forums with Brown; Brown-Ulman Debate "Proposal" Ignores Western, Eastern and Southern MD
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: July 4, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

Commenting on the Brown-Ulman campaign's "debate proposal" released late this afternoon before the long Independence Day weekend, the Hogan-Rutherford campaign said:
"To date, we have only received one invitation for a gubernatorial forum, the September 12, Maryland Municipal League event in Annapolis. Larry Hogan accepted the invitation to this forum without qualifications or conditions on the day it was received; as it was not listed in the Brown-Ulman proposal, we will assume the Lt. Governor will not be participating in this important event with local leaders."
"We agree that there should be several debates, but missing from the Brown-Ulman proposal is any meaningful consideration for the people of Western, Southern and Eastern Maryland. And while will agree to Lt. Governor debates outside of the Washington -- Baltimore corridor, we are reiterating our call for town hall style debates with the Lt. Governor and Larry Hogan in Delmarva, south of St. Charles and west of Hagerstown. These areas have been largely ignored by Annapolis and have unemployment rates nearly double that of other regions. The people of these regions deserve to directly question and hear from the two candidates for governor."
