Reminder: Governor Hogan's Statewide Toll Rollback Takes Effect Wednesday, July 1, 2015
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: June 30, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Tomorrow, tolls for bridges, tunnels and roadways across the state of Maryland will be lowered for the first time in nearly 50 years as part of Governor Larry Hogan's statewide Toll-Tax Rollback Plan. On May 7, Governor Hogan delivered on his promise to roll back Maryland's high toll rates and put money back into the pockets of hard-working Maryland families and businesses. From the Bay, Hatem and Nice bridges to the Harbor Crossings, the JFK Highway, the Intercounty Connector (ICC), and the new I-95 Express Toll Lanes (ETL), Governor Hogan's toll rollback, which takes effect tomorrow, will save Maryland citizens $270 million over the next five years. In the first week of July alone, Marylanders should save $2.1 million that they can spend on their 4th of July celebrations and summer vacations.
"We're giving Marylanders another reason to celebrate this July 4th as we decrease toll rates across the state," said Governor Hogan. "I was elected to roll back taxes, tolls and fees and I'm pleased to deliver on this promise by putting more than a quarter billion back into the pockets of hardworking Maryland families."
The following toll reductions and changes are effective Wednesday, July 1, 2015:
▪ Eliminate the E-ZPass Maryland monthly $1.50 account fee for Maryland addresses and for out-of-state addresses with three or more trips at Maryland toll facilities in the previous statement period.
▪ Reduce all Cash, Video, Commuter and Shoppers' toll rates at the Bay Bridge (US 50/301), including a reduction in the two-axle cash rate from $6 to $4 round trip and in the Commuter rate from $2.10 to $1.40.
▪ Increase the E-ZPass Maryland discount from 10% to 37.5% at the Bay Bridge -- toll drops from $5.40 to $2.50 round trip.
▪ Increase the E-ZPass Maryland discount from 10% to 25% for the Baltimore Harbor (I-895) and Fort McHenry (I-95) tunnels, the Francis Scott Key Bridge (I-695), the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge (US 40) and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway (I-95) -- toll drops from $7.20 to $6 round trip -- and for the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge (US 301) -- toll drops from $5.40 to $4.50 round trip.
▪ Reduce two-axle toll rates on the ICC/MD200 and I-95 ETL for all pricing periods by $.03 per mile. This change reduces a two-axle, peak period trip from I-270/I-370 to US 1 on the ICC from $4.40 to $3.86 (E-ZPass), and a two-axle, peak period trip on the I-95 ETL from $1.75 to $1.54 (E-ZPass). Other ICC and I-95 ETL toll rates also will be reduced based on standard multipliers per axle.
▪ Establish a 30% discount at the Hatem Bridge for three- and four-axle vehicles with E-ZPass Maryland -- three-axle toll drops from $16 to $11.20, while four-axle toll drops from $24 to $16.80.
▪ Increase E-ZPass Maryland supplemental rebate program for vehicles with five or more axles by 5 percentage points per trip level.
The following change is effective January 1, 2016:
▪ For vehicles using the Childs Street and I-695 turnaround exits at the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel and Key Bridge respectively, E-ZPass Maryland toll rates will decrease to $2 per axle for three- to six-plus-axle vehicles. For example, three-axle vehicles will see a toll reduction from $8 to $6 and four-axle vehicles from $12 to $8.
To take advantage of the new E-ZPass discounts, motorists are urged to sign up for E-ZPass Maryland at ezpassmd.com. The new discounts increase from 10% to a range of25% to 37.5%.
