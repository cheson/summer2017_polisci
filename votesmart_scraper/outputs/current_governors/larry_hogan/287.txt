Governor Larry Hogan Celebrates Maryland Day
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: March 25, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

In observance of Maryland Day, Governor Larry Hogan today visited the Maryland State Archives and issued a statewide proclamation in recognition of March 25, 2015 as Maryland Day. The governor presented the Maryland Day proclamation to Acting State Archivist, Timothy D. Baker.
The holiday commemorates the day in 1634 when English settlers from the Ark and the Dove landed at St. Clements Island, in what is now St. Mary's County. The formal observance of Maryland Day began in schools in 1903 and was named a legal holiday by the Maryland General Assembly in 1916.
"This day commemorates the 381st anniversary of settlers landing on Maryland soil," said Governor Hogan. "Today, I am reminded of those brave first Marylanders, who came to this land seeking freedom and opportunity when the Ark and the Dove landed at St. Clements Island. While the challenges facing us today are different, I know that the courage and spirit of Marylanders is the same."
