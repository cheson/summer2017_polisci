Governor Larry Hogan Announces "Governor's Young Readers" Initiative in Baltimore City
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Dec. 21, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Hogan today announced that every child, from infancy to age 5, in Baltimore City will be eligible to enroll, free of charge, in a new reading and book-delivery program starting in the New Year. Named "Governor's Young Readers," the program is a replica of country star Dolly Parton's Imagination Library, the Tennessee-based nonprofit organization that mails a specifically selected, age-appropriate book each month to the homes of participating children. Maryland is the second state, after Tennessee, to adopt the Imagination Library program.
"I want children in Maryland to be excited about books and reading--and every single child should have access to books, regardless of their family's circumstances," said Governor Hogan. "Childhood books are incredibly important building blocks in a child's education and I still remember my favorite one, The Little Engine That Could. My hope is that this program will foster a love of reading and learning, and help put these children on a path for lifelong success."
