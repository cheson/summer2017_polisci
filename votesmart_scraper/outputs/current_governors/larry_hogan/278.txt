Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: April 6, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today issued Executive Order 01.01.2015.15, which will extend Maryland's General Assembly session for no longer than 10 days to provide additional time for legislators to pass a budget. During the 10-day extension, the budget bill is the only piece of legislation that can be debated among the General Assembly.
Article III, Section 52 (10) of the Maryland Constitution provides that the Governor shall issue a proclamation extending the session to allow for passage of the budget bill when the budget bill has not been passed by the 83rd day of the regular legislative session.
"With the final week of session upon us, I am happy to give legislators extra time to reach an agreement on the budget," said Governor Hogan. "I remain committed to working with the General Assembly to reach a bipartisan budget resolution that delivers the tax relief and fiscal responsibility that Marylanders are demanding."
