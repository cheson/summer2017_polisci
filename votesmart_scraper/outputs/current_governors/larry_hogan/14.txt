Statement from Governor Larry Hogan on Purple Line Ruling
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: May 22, 2017
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today released the following statement in response to Judge Richard J. Leon's ruling on the Purple Line transit project:
"Today's partial ruling by Judge Leon is incredibly disappointing, but not entirely surprising. The fact that it took a federal judge this long to reach the conclusion that more study is needed is completely baffling and, if allowed to stand, will cause irreparable harm to this vital project and cost the state hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars.
"Moreover, the judge's concerns were thoroughly addressed by federal transit officials by studies already completed and in public testimony more than five months ago. Ultimately, this ruling completely ignores both federal and state transportation experts, as well as environmental advocates, who are strong proponents of the Purple Line.
"This is not a political issue -- it's an important transportation and transit priority for Maryland and the region that has strong bipartisan support. The state will continue to pursue any and all legal action to ensure that the Purple Line will move forward."
