Governor Larry Hogan today signed an Executive Order declaring a state of emergency in Maryland in anticipation of heavy rains, potential flooding, and the possibility that Hurricane Joaquin may affect Maryland.
"While the path of Hurricane Joaquin remains uncertain, taking proactive measures is the first step in preparing for extreme weather and will ensure that resources are available in the areas with the greatest need," said Governor Larry Hogan. "At this time we are strongly encouraging Marylanders to use common sense in the days ahead and look after family members and neighbors who might need assistance. Now is the time to start preparing for possible flooding or any other hazards."
