"A Middle Temperament"

Speaker Busch, President Miller, members of the General Assembly, distinguished guests, fellow Marylanders:
A year ago I stood before you, confident in our collective ability to usher in a new era of cooperation and prosperity for Maryland, while mindful of the challenges facing us and the uncertainties that we shared.
In spite of political mindsets that might drive us apart, could we find middle ground?
Could the growing discord between our citizens and their government be repaired?
Would we as elected leaders choose serving the people over serving government?
Yet none of us could have foreseen just how much we would be asked to overcome:
The riots and lawlessness that threatened to tear Baltimore City apart;
For me personally, a life-altering diagnosis requiring me to publicly wage what is normally a very private battle;
And last week a historic winter storm that left a season's worth of snowfall in just two days.
Together, we have been tested.
But in the face of adversity, we were not Democrats of Republicans looking backward. We were Marylanders with our eyes fixed forward, working together for a better tomorrow.
