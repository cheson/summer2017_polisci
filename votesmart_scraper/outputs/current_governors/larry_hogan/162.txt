Governor Larry Hogan has received the first of three reports from the Maryland Regulatory Reform Commission. In July, the governor established the commission through Executive Order 01.01.2015.20 for the purpose of conducting a comprehensive review of Maryland's regulatory climate.
The commission, consisting of two co-chairs and 10 members, was tasked with identifying and making recommendations to resolve the regulations and issues negatively impacting Maryland's business environment, while continuing to protect the health, safety, and welfare of Marylanders.
The first report, which is divided into three sections, recommends 12 ways to improve the state's regulatory and business climate including:
Restructure and Reform State Government
Create a One-Stop Shop for Licensing
Adopt Electronic Documentation and Online Filings
Streamline the Review Process for Development
Consolidate Professional Licenses
Reduce Fees and Payment Frequency
Fully Embrace Nutrient Pollution Trading
Revise Brownfields Guidelines
Eliminate Obstacles to Mortgage Lender Licensing
Expand Minority and Disadvantaged Business Opportunities
Review Vineyard and Food Truck Requirements
Review State Procurement Process
"By streamlining Maryland's regulatory climate and raising our standards for customer service, our administration hopes to provide the environment employers need to grow and succeed," said Governor Hogan. "I look forward to reading the commission's recommendations about how to restore a fair, accountable, and balanced regulatory climate for Maryland's businesses."
