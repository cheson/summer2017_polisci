Governor Larry Hogan Announces $25 Million for Local Road Investments
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Sept. 10, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

In an effort to support counties and municipalities with road improvements, local governments will be receiving applications in the mail soon that need to be submitted by September 30. These applications also can be downloaded online at this link.
Historically, 30 percent of all Highway User Revenues went to counties and municipalities to support their local transportation funding, but during the 2010 legislative session, the amount going to local jurisdictions was cut from 30 percent down to 9.6 percent.
"This administration remains committed to restoring funding levels for local road improvements and this $25 million investment is a step in the right direction," Governor Hogan said. "Everyone in the state relies on Maryland's roads, and this funding will help local governments deliver the quality infrastructure our citizens need and deserve."
