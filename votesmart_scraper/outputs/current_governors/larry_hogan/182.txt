Governor Larry Hogan Signs Executive Order Rescinding State of Emergency in Eight Counties
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 2, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today signed Executive Order 01.01.2015.24 rescinding the state of emergency in eight Maryland counties: Garrett, Allegany, Washington, Frederick, Carroll, Montgomery, Howard, and Prince George's. Based on the current weather projections and recommendations from the Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), the remaining 15 Maryland counties and Baltimore City will remain under the state of emergency until further notice. This allows the state to efficiently coordinate resources between jurisdictions to support response operations.
"With the storm moving away from our coasts, we are directing state resources to the counties and areas with the highest potential to need assistance," said Governor Hogan. "However, the majority of the state still remains under a state of emergency and rain and wind gusts could cause power outages and flooding in low-lying areas. We continue to encourage Marylanders to use common sense and look after family members and neighbors who might need help during this time."
