Hogan: Torrential Rainfall Underscores O'Malley-Brown Failure to Protect Bay From Millions of Tons of Conowingo Sediment

As rain and flash flood warnings hit Maryland this afternoon, gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan urged state officials to take immediate action to protect the Chesapeake Bay from catastrophic releases of polluted sediment from the long-neglected control reservoirs, or ponds, above the Conowingo Dam.
When constructed, the 14 mile long "Conowingo Pond" was 125 feet deep, trapping vast quantities of upstream sediment and pollution. Today, it is an ineffective dozen or so feet deep, and releases millions of tons of polluted sediment from Pennsylvania and New York State following heavy rains. In fact, the sediment flows down the Susquehanna are the source of 40 percent of the Bay's pollution and have virtually destroyed oystering and crabbing above the Chesapeake Bridge.
According to Hogan, "When torrential rains hit Pennsylvania and New York State, Marylanders and the Bay's submerged vegetation and aquatic life pay the price. For eight years, Martin O'Malley and Anthony Brown have concluded it's easier to levy a Rain Tax on Maryland's watermen, farmers and struggling families than fight to protect the Bay from federal and corporate neglect.
"Until something is done about the Conowingo Pond, the Chesapeake Bay will never be healthy. As governor I will make it a priority to dredge the pond, work with the EPA, Pennsylvania, and New York to address the Susquehanna River, and always give farmers and watermen a seat at the table. We will work together to find common sense, efficient, and cost-effective measures to cleaning up the Chesapeake for generations to come, and it starts with the Conowingo."
