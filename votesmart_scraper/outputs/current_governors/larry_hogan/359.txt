Hogan Denounces Lt. Governor's Latest Round of Dishonest Attack Ads
Press Release

Larry Hogan today issued the following statement on Lt. Governor Anthony Brown's latest round of dishonest attack ads.
"Anthony Brown is now doubling down on his false and vile ad campaign by putting out even more ads that are even worse and tell even bigger lies than the previous ones.
What's worse, it now seems these ads are being paid for in part with special interest money from the very corporations Anthony Brown hired to build his failed Health Exchange, which is currently under a federal fraud investigation.
My belief is that all women in Maryland should have access to the birth control of their choice; this is my position as a lifelong Marylander, a business owner, a candidate, a husband, and a father of three grown women. It will be the policy of my administration should I be honored to become the next governor.
In fact, my support for unfettered access to birth control for every single woman in Maryland is documented by all news organizations they mention as sources for their dishonest ads claiming otherwise.
Improving the lives of women and increasing access to health services requires that we turn our economy around."
