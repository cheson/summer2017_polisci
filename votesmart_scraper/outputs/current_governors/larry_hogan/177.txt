Date: Oct. 27, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today announced his appointments to the Commission to Review Maryland's Use of Assessments and Testing in Public Schools. On May 12, 2015, the governor signed into law HB 452, which established the Commission to Review Maryland's Use of Assessments and Testing in Public Schools. The commission's first meeting will be held on November 17, 2015.
"When schools and teachers are forced to overemphasize standardized tests in the classroom, they deprive students of the kind of quality education they deserve," said Governor Larry Hogan. "It is clear to most Marylanders that we are over-testing our students and the process needs to be greatly improved. I look forward to reviewing the findings and solutions that this commission produces to help get our schools back on the right track."
