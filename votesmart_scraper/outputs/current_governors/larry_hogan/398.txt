Taxes for military veterans are becoming a talking point in the race for Maryland's next governor.
Republican candidate for governor Larry Hogan on Wednesday said he would push to eliminate Maryland's income tax on military pensions. He said veterans deserve much better than they've been getting from the state and federal government.
The Republican nominee said veterans have earned the tax break and said the tax is bad economic policy.
Hogan talked about those tax cuts in Ocean City. While on the Eastern Shore, he also attended the 38th annual Tawes Crab Feast, something his opponent, Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, did not end up getting to as planned.
Brown's campaign said Brown and his running mate, Howard County Executive Ken Ulman, attended a funeral in Baltimore County instead.
The seafood festival that usually draws many politicians had fewer this year, possibly because Maryland's primary was held before the event.
On Thursday, Brown made a similar statement about the tax on veterans, saying he would exempt military retirement income from state income taxes for most vets. Brown also proposed creating a program to help vets find jobs, as well as new treatment programs.
