"What started as a normal morning turned into a day that would change our world forever. The First Lady and I are praying for all those whose lives were impacted that day, for the first responders whose bravery and strength comforted a nation in mourning, and for all our leaders who work tirelessly to ensure peace and security in our country. Since that fateful day fourteen years ago, America has persevered, her strength and fortitude an example of what is possible when we are united as one."
