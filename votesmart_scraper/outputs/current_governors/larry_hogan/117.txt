Governor Larry Hogan has issued a statewide proclamation declaring April 24-30 "Zika Virus Awareness Week" in Maryland -- a time for residents to take simple, but critically important steps to prevent the spread of the mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus. It is critical that Maryland residents survey their properties and their communities and eliminate or treat mosquito breeding sites.
"As we learn more about the serious health risks associated with Zika, it is crucial that Marylanders -- especially those who are traveling to areas where the virus is being actively transmitted -- are equipped with knowledge that will help reduce their chances of contracting the virus," said Governor Hogan.
Although researchers still have a lot to discover about Zika, they know that the major source of transmission is through the bite of certain species of infected Aedes mosquitoes, which lay their eggs in containers of standing water around the home, rather than in wetland areas. As of March 31, there were eight confirmed cases of Zika virus in Maryland--all associated with travel to areas where the disease has been actively transmitted. The disease has not been transmitted locally by mosquitoes; however, that may change as the Aedes mosquitoes become active in warmer weather, usually around the beginning of May in Maryland. If a mosquito takes a blood meal from a recent traveler who has Zika virus circulating in his or her blood, the mosquito can become infected and transmit the virus when it takes another blood meal.
