Hogan Campaign Releases Latest Ad, 'Backwards;' Slams Brown for Failed Economic Policies
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Sept. 22, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

The Hogan for Governor campaign released its latest ad, "Backwards" today, slamming Lt. Governor Brown on the failed economic policies of the last eight years. Under the leadership of Anthony Brown and Martin O'Malley, the state has lost 8,000 small businesses and nearly 200,000 people are out of work; Maryland is second in the nation in foreclosures, has experienced zero economic growth, and the state economy ranks 49 out of 50 states. According to a recent Gallup poll, these failed policies have resulted in nearly half of all Marylanders wanting to leave the state.
Hogan said, "While Anthony Brown attempts to slander and defame me with completely false ads, we are going to continue to focus on the truth and his failed policies of the last eight years. Anthony Brown likes to take credit for being in charge of economic development, but under this administration our economy has completely completely stalled. Our economy ranks 49 out of 50 states -- that is completely unacceptable. In a Hogan-Rutherford administration, our number one priority will be to grow the private sector, put people back to work, and turn our economy around. Maryland deserves better than the weak leadership of Anthony Brown. We can't afford to keep moving Maryland backwards for another four years."
