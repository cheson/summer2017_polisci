As I've traversed the state of Maryland, I've learned that effective campaigning means clearly and honestly explaining to voters how your decisions in office would be better than those of your opponent.
For Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, however, campaigning involves dodging accountability, remaining invisible on the campaign trail and hiding behind wildly off-base and false attack ads.
Lieutenant Governor Brown is unable to defend his eight-year record of failure. He continues to try to distract voters by lying about my stances on long-settled issues, including abortion rights and gun laws.
The only thing his campaign has to offer is fear.
This election is about jobs, the economy and middle-class families -- and just about everyone but the lieutenant governor knows it.
Lieutenant Governor Brown has been in charge of economic development efforts. However, his record is just too damning for him to discuss -- and Marylanders are fed up.
After all, they had to pick up the $288,337,000 tab for the lieutenant governor's health care exchange debacle.
They suffered under the yoke of 40 consecutive O'Malley-Brown tax hikes -- including a higher gas tax, higher commuter taxes through tolls and a new tax on the rain.
