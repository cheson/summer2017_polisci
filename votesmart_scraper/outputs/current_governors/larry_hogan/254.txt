Governor Larry Hogan Calls For Statewide "Day Of Prayer And Peace"
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: May 2, 2015
Location: Baltimore, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today called for a statewide "Day of Prayer and Peace" to start tomorrow following the weeklong demonstrations in Baltimore City. The governor released the following statement:
"Just a few days ago, the people of Baltimore City, Maryland, and the entire nation watched as Baltimore was consumed by violence and tragedy. Homes and businesses were devastated and police officers were openly attacked by the few who chose aggression over peaceful demonstration. Tonight, I once again strongly urge all citizens of Baltimore, and those from outside our city and state, to remain peaceful, and nonviolent. As we prepare to start a new week, I ask that all Maryland citizens join me in a day of prayer and unity for Baltimore City and the State of Maryland.
"Over the last week, I have witnessed countless acts of compassion, kindness, and leadership by the residents of Baltimore. I have seen what is possible when we stand united against violence in our communities. As we begin to rebuild and restore, let us renew our faith in the true spirit of our city and its people. I pray that tomorrow will be a day of reflection and will serve as a foundation for how we all conduct ourselves in the days and months to come."
As part of the statewide "Day of Prayer and Peace," Governor Hogan will attend a church service at St. Peter Claver, tomorrow at 10:45 AM with Archbishop William E. Lori. The governor will be available for brief questions following the service.
In addition, Lt. Governor Boyd Rutherford will attend a service at 12:00 PM at Southern Baptist Church, 1701 N. Chester St. Baltimore MD 21213.
