Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: April 15, 2016
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today welcomed hundreds of individuals who provide services and support to Marylanders who have been victims of crime, at the first statewide Maryland Crime Victims' Rights Conference at the DoubleTree Hotel near BWI Airport in Linthicum. The daylong conference, sponsored in part by the Governor's Office of Crime Control & Prevention, provided opportunities for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, victim service providers, nonprofit organizations, and health department officials to learn about new methods to apply a victim-centered approach to every aspect of the criminal justice system in Maryland.
"Decades ago, victims were expected to stay on the sidelines of the criminal justice system, but today that is no longer true," said Governor Hogan. "Our administration is committed to helping these individuals rebuild, and creating a criminal justice system that does not exclude crime victims, and holds those who inflict harm accountable for their actions."
After delivering opening remarks, Governor Hogan presented Governor's Victim Assistance Awards to three Marylanders who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to assist crime victims. The awards are given in memory of individuals who helped to put crime victims' rights and services on the map in Maryland and nationally.
"It is an honor to recognize those who have contributed so much to the crime victims' rights movement here in Maryland--the advocates and counselors, police officers, prosecutors, forensic nurses, hotline workers, and trainers. Thank you for the incredibly selfless work you do," said Governor Hogan, who also presented two governor's proclamations, one proclaiming April 3 as "Crime Victim and Advocate Commemorative Day," and another proclaiming April 10-16 as "Crime Victims' Rights Week" in Maryland.
