Governor Larry Hogan, First Lady Yumi Hogan, and Secretary of State John Wobensmith on Friday met with Jeong Ui-hwa, speaker of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, to discuss ways to strengthen Maryland's business relationship with South Korea. The National Assembly is South Korea's lawmaking body, and is composed of 300 members.
"I want to thank Speaker Jeong Ui-hwa, leader and symbol of Korea's nascent democracy, for personally inviting us to meet with him," said Governor Hogan. "It was an honor to learn about the legislature's work in promoting businesses, and I look forward to working with the speaker in meaningful ways to strengthen the Korean businesses that are already located in Maryland, as well as position Maryland companies for new trade and investment opportunities in Korea--one of Asia's fastest-growing economies."
There are 10 Korean companies in Maryland and more than 25 Maryland-based companies in Korea. South Korea's top five economic industries--shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, construction, defense, and tourism--are also industries important to Maryland's economy.
