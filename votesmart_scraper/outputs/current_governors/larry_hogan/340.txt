Republican gubernatorial candidate said Larry Hogan indicated Wednesday that his opposition to state financing of the construction of Baltimore's Red Line and another large transit project doesn't necessarily mean forever.
Hogan continued to insist, as he has since launching his campaign, that the state cannot afford to begin building the $2.6 billion Red Line and $2.4 billion Purple Line In the Washington suburbs at this time.
"I'm not really opposed to the Red Line or the Purple Line and both of them I think are worth considering and I'm not even opposed to continuing along the planning and engineering phases, but quite frankly, you know, we've robbed a billion dollars out of the Transportation Trust Fund," Hogan said.
"Robbed " is Hogan's characterization of Gov. Martin O'Malley's decision to ask the General Assembly to transfer of money from the fund to balance the budget when the 2008-2009 recession caused a severe revenue shortfall for several years.
Campaigning against Democratic rival Anthony G. Brown, Hogan said on WBAL's Derek Hunter Show that he believes that state will have to spend its transportation funds primarily on "backed-up road projects" over the next few years.
Adam Dubitsky, a Hogan spokesman, said the candidate's comments did not represent a change of position. He said Hogan remains a skeptic about building both projects as light rail lines, adding that a rapid bus system using dedicated lines would be less costly and more capable of being rerouted in the future.
