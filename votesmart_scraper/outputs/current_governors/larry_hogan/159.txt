Governor Larry Hogan Makes Heroin Grant Awards Announcement in Western Maryland
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Dec. 8, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

As part of a four-day visit to Western Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan today joined Christopher B. Shank, executive director of the Governor's Office of Crime Control & Prevention, and law enforcement officials to award $91,760 to the Washington County Sheriff's Office and $125,000 to the Maryland State Police to identify and prosecute drug traffickers and help those struggling with drug addiction get the best possible treatment.
The grant to the Washington County Sheriff's Office will be used for a deputy to investigate overdose cases, with the ultimate goal of identifying dealers and suppliers for prosecution, as well as a drug reentry coordinator who will work with the Washington County Detention Center and the Washington County Narcotics Task Force to help facilitate treatment for addicts, and overtime pay for investigators. Additionally, the funds will provide for Cellebrite technology enhancements to enable law enforcement to access crucial information to identify and prosecute drug traffickers. Maryland State Police will use the funds for technology improvements to aid in narcotics interdiction efforts in the region.
"Addressing the heroin and opioid epidemic in our state has been a top priority of our administration from day one and it will continue to be going forward," said Governor Hogan. "These grants are just one part of our efforts to identify drug traffickers and dealers who are contributing to overdoses and deaths in this region and throughout the state -- and to finally shut down the "heroin highway' for good."
