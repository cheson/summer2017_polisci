Republican Larry Hogan says he would push to eliminate Maryland's income tax on military pensions, if he is elected governor.
Hogan spoke Wednesday to the Maryland American Legion's annual convention in Ocean City.
He says veterans deserve much better than they have been getting from the state and federal government.
Hogan says veterans have earned the tax break. He also says the tax is bad economic policy.
The Anne Arundel County real estate broker says he will cut wasteful spending, if he is elected. After that, he says he'll look to roll back as many tax increases that have gone into effect in recent years as possible.
