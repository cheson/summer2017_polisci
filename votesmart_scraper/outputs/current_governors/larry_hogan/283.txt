By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: March 30, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan and Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam today challenged each other to a friendly wager, ahead of tonight's "Elite 8" women's basketball matchup between the #1 ranked University of Maryland Terrapins and the #2 University of Tennessee Volunteers.
Confident that the Terrapins will win, Governor Hogan called Governor Haslam, and they agreed to place the wager over a bushel of Maryland blue crabs and ribs from the world-famous Charles Vergos' Rendezvous restaurant in Memphis.
"The Lady Terps are going to the Final 4; it's that simple," said Governor Hogan. "Don't forget the barbecue sauce, Governor Haslam!"
The game airs tonight at 9 PM EST on ESPN.
