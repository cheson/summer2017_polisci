Woodgrain Millwork, a family-owned and operated business that is one of the largest millwork operations in the country, has announced plans to open a new distribution center in Baltimore City. The company -- a manufacturer of mouldings and turnings, and distributor of doors, windows, and other woodwork -- will locate the new facility near Montgomery Park on Washington Boulevard and supply about 300 home improvement stores on the East Coast. Over the next three years, Woodgrain Millwork plans to hire 65 new full-time employees.
"Job creation and economic development are our primary focus in Maryland, and welcoming Woodgrain Millwork to our state is a shining example of the progress we are making," said Governor Larry Hogan. "This is exciting news for Baltimore City, and exactly what my administration wants for Maryland -- thriving businesses that provide the citizens of our state with great jobs and opportunity."
