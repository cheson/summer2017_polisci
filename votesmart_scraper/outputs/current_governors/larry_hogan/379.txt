Larry Hogan Connects with Voters at Charlestown Gubernatorial Forum
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Aug. 19, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

Larry Hogan addressed voters at the Charlestown Retirement Community gubernatorial forum this evening in Catonsville, Baltimore County. Hogan's bi-partisan economic message resonated strongly with the crowd, many of whom expressed disappointment with the current administration's approach to retirees in the state.
Hogan told the crowd, "The failed economic policies of Anthony Brown and Martin O'Malley have crushed our economy, hitting seniors and struggling families the hardestÂ… I believe that an overwhelming majority of Marylanders, regardless of their party affiliation, desperately want new leadership in Annapolis. This is not your typical fight between Democrats and Republicans -- It's more important than that. This is a fight for Maryland's future, and it's a fight worth fighting."
Hogan recently proposed relief for Maryland retirees: he has called for the elimination of the state income tax on pensions for military veterans, law enforcement, and fire, emergency, and rescue personnel. Hogan has said that his ultimate goal is to make it more affordable to live, work, and retire in Maryland. "There are too many good people leaving our state because they can't afford to live here," Hogan said. "It's just not right, and it's something I will change when I am governor."
Democratic nominee Anthony Brown attended the forum, but again did not appear with Hogan on stage. Hogan remained after the event, mingling with residents and discussing their individual concerns.
