Governor Larry Hogan today issued a statewide proclamation announcing November 28, 2015 as Small Business Saturday in Maryland. With this proclamation, the governor is encouraging Marylanders to join a nationwide movement to support local businesses during the holiday season. Small Business Saturday is recognized by public and private organizations across the country each year on the Saturday following Thanksgiving.
"Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and our administration is committed to supporting them as we work to turn our economy around," Governor Larry Hogan said. "This is just one small way that we can all make an impact on our communities this holiday season. Whether it's a clothing store on Main Street or a neighborhood grocery store, small businesses create jobs, boost local economies, and preserve our neighborhoods."
