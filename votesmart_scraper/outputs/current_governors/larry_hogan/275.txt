Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan was today joined by Senate President Mike Miller and Speaker of the House Michael Busch in his second bill signing ceremony. Governor Hogan today signed 121 bills into law.
"The majority of the bills signed today were passed by both chambers unanimously and are a reflection of the bipartisanship that Maryland citizens expect and deserve of their elected officials," said Governor Hogan. "I am proud to sign bills that include assistance for Maryland's veterans and small businesses and take the necessary steps to address matters of health and public safety."
One of the bills signed today include SB 602, for which Governor Hogan previously expressed his support. This bill establishes the Justice Reinvestment Coordinating Council in the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention. The Council will develop statewide policy to reduce spending on corrections and build strategies to increase public safety and reduce recidivism.
"Taking a tough stance on crime isn't just about incarceration," said Governor Hogan. "In order to achieve lasting results in our criminal justice system, we must strike a balance and explore better, smarter options to reduce recidivism."
