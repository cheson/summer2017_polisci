Press Release

Location: Annapolis, MD

As the race for Maryland governor tightens, prominent GOP leaders from across the country have come out strong in support of Larry Hogan. Governor Jeb Bush, Governor Mitt Romney, Governor Bob Ehrlich, and Lt. Governor and former RNC Chairman Michael Steele have all penned letters on behalf of the Maryland gubernatorial nominee. In addition, former Homeland Security Secretary, Governor Tom Ridge will come to the state early next week for an evening reception while Republican Governors Association Chairman, Governor Chris Christie will make his second visit to Maryland for a fundraising breakfast.
"Voters are tired with the failed economic policies of the current administration and the politics-as-usual attitude of career politicians that have driven away countless jobs, businesses, and families from Maryland. Anthony Brown's increasingly negative and blatantly false campaign is turning them off even more," said Hogan. "With our race now receiving national attention, the momentum continues to surge in our favor and we are confident that Marylanders will vote for change on November 4."
Governor Tom Ridge will travel to Maryland on Monday, October 20 for an evening reception in Gambrills. Governor Chris Christie will join Hogan in Potomac for a breakfast reception on Tuesday, October 21.
