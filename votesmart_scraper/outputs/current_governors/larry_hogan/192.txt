Governor Larry Hogan Announces Redistricting Reform Commission's Public Meeting Schedule
Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Sept. 10, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan has announced that the recently formed Maryland Redistricting Reform Commission will hold its first regional meeting on Tuesday, September 15, at Towson University. This is the first of five meetings to be held throughout the state this fall.
On August 6, Governor Hogan issued Executive Order 01.01.2015.21, which established the Redistricting Reform Commission. The commission is charged with examining the state's redistricting process and making recommendations to improve election integrity and reduce political gerrymandering. The commission's report is due to the governor and the presiding officers of the Senate and House by November 3, 2015.
"For far too long, the political gamesmanship of gerrymandering has stifled real political debate and deprived citizens of meaningful choices," Governor Hogan said. "Through the work of this commission, my administration's goal is to put Maryland's redistricting process on a new path toward transparency, fair representation, and election integrity. I encourage all Maryland citizens to attend a regional meeting and share their thoughts and concerns on legislative and congressional redistricting."
