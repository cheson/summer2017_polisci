On Eve of First General Election Debate, Hogan Demands Answers from a "Radio Silent" Brown
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 6, 2014
Location: Annapolis, MD

Twenty-four hours before Larry Hogan and Lt. Gov. Brown take the stage for their first debate of the general election, Hogan is demanding answers from Brown on how he will address the real issues in the campaign: the economy, job loss, and tax increases.
According to Larry Hogan, "For the last eight years, Lt. Gov. Brown has been in charge of our state's economic development--but he has refused to address the economic issues time and again, because his record is just too damning."
"Lt. Gov. Brown has remained completely silent on the most recent economic news: Our state unemployment rate went up again last week, and well over 200,000 Marylanders are out of work. We also recently found out our state is facing a $405 million revenue shortfall, but again, no word from Brown. And just last week, Democratic Comptroller Peter Franchot reported that property taxes could go up by a whopping 67 percent if we continue backwards down this path of economic decline. What was Brown's response? Again, radio silence."
"Marylanders are fed up; they want answers on how Lt. Gov. Brown will fix the mess he's made," Hogan continued. "Now is the time for him to give Marylanders the answers they deserve. I look forward to debating him tomorrow."
Hogan and Brown will participate in their first debate of the general election season tomorrow morning, October 7. The debate will air on Baltimore's WJZ-TV Channel 13 later in the day, at 7 p.m.
