As part of a four-day visit to Western Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan today visited Rocky Gap State Park to celebrate the completion of their new water treatment plant. The state invested $5.64 million to replace obsolete, unreliable technology with a fully automated, membrane ultra-filtration water system to accommodate the Rocky Gap Resort and campground.
"Rocky Gap Resort and campground continues to be an important economic driver for Western Maryland," said Governor Hogan. "By investing in the water treatment plant, we are ensuring that the current and future needs of visitors and businesses will be met."
