Hogan Responds to July Job Losses in Maryland: Largest Decline in Nation Symptom of Failing Economy
Press Release

Location: Annapolis, MD

Gubernatorial candidate Larry Hogan responded to the latest figures from the U.S. Department of Labor's jobs report that showed Maryland experienced one of the country's largest declines in jobs in the month of July, second only to Ohio. Most states in the country gained jobs during the same period.
Hogan said, "While Anthony Brown wants to talk about everything except the economy, 9,000 more Marylanders joined the unemployment line. Our campaign is the only one talking about the need for jobs and turning around the economy in Maryland.
This latest report from the Department of Labor reiterates what we have been saying for months. The failed policies of Anthony Brown and Martin O'Malley over the last eight years have crushed Maryland job creators, and have made it more difficult for average Marylanders to support themselves and their families. As governor, my number one priority will be to attract and retain as many job creators in Maryland as we possibly can. Unemployment has risen over 75% over the last eight years -- it is time for us to focus on policies to attract employers and provide opportunity for Maryland families across the state."
