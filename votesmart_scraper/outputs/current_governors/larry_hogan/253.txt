Governor Larry Hogan Announces $68 Million In Support Of State Employee COLA
Press Release
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: May 6, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today announced that $68 million would be released from the budget to maintain the 2 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for all state employees into the next fiscal year. Additionally, the governor issued a statewide proclamation announcing today as State Employee Recognition Day.
"State employees are the backbone of our government and it is an honor to serve the people of Maryland alongside them," said Governor Hogan. "What I witnessed last week in Baltimore once again underscored their selfless dedication and commitment to our citizens. Despite the fiscal challenges we continue to face, I am proud to continue to provide our state employees with the pay increase they need and deserve."
Prior to the Governor Hogan's inauguration and under the previous administration, a COLA went into effect on January 1, 2015, but without a long-term funding mechanism in place.
Despite facing a nearly $1 billion budget deficit upon taking office, the budget proposed by the Hogan administration in January put Maryland on sound financial footing without raising taxes or fees and without laying off a single state employee or implementing furloughs.
