Employees shall exhibit exemplary conduct and use honest efforts in the performance of their duties.
Employees shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.
Employees shall adhere to all applicable laws and regulations that provide equal opportunity for all Marylanders regardless of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability or sexual orientation.
