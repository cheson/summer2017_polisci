Republican candidate for governor Larry Hogan came to Easton on a campaign stop on Monday, Sept. 8, and stopped by the offices of The Star Democrat for an interview.
Hogan was upbeat about his chances in the upcoming election, citing a recent poll showing he and Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown are in a "statistical tie" in the race. A June Washington Post poll had Brown with an 18 point lead, but an OnMessage poll recently released by the Maryland Republican Party shows Brown up by only 3 percentage points, at 45-42 percent.
"We're putting miles on the bus," Hogan said. "We're not going to take anything for granted. We're working as hard as we can ... we are challenging every vote, like we are spending a ton of time in Prince George's County, and Baltimore City, Montgomery County, places where some Republicans wouldn't even go."
Hogan said his message is resonating with people from all parts of the political spectrum.
"People are really frustrated, and they are very concerned about the direction of the state, and they are looking for a change. An overwhelming majority of them are not happy with where we are," he said.
His message on Monday focused on the economy, slamming the O'Malley and Brown administration on tax increases and spending, and calling for a more business-friendly climate in the state. When asked about issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, he said, "I don't have a social agenda at all." Those issues are already decided, he said, and he has no desire to readdress them.
