Statement
By: Larry Hogan, Jr.
Date: Oct. 7, 2015
Location: Annapolis, MD

Governor Larry Hogan today visited the Ronald McDonald House in Baltimore for a pep rally prior to the start of his sixth and final round of chemotherapy on Friday. The governor and members of his executive staff served dinner to patients and their families while guests visited and took pictures with Baltimore Ravens cheerleaders and the Orioles Bird.
"I'm thrilled to be here at the Ronald McDonald House today with so many inspiring kids and their families," Governor Hogan said. "Throughout my treatment I've had the privilege to meet many brave cancer patients, but it's the stories of these young kids fighting such tough battles that have really touched my heart. I know I get more out of meeting them and hearing their stories than they get out of meeting me."
