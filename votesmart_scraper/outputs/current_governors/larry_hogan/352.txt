Press Release

In a rare interview since beginning his general election campaign for governor, Anthony Brown again refused to take responsibility for his failed Maryland health exchange. The reclusive Lt. Governor also used the interview to reiterate that his plan for economic revival that is no different than the failed policies of the last eight years.
Larry Hogan said, "It is very concerning that Anthony Brown's strategy is to spend millions of dollars trying to frighten women. Meanwhile, for the last three months, he has remained silent on the issues that really matter to overtaxed Maryland voters: creating jobs and restoring our failing economy, which is ranked 49th out of 50 states. There's nothing "silly" about honest questions about his record for the past eight years and it's time for the Lt. Governor to engage in an honest debate on the issues that matter."
