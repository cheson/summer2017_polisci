With a showdown set, Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown and Larry Hogan in primary election victory speeches Tuesday night laid out two options.
Brown presented one set of options.
"Marylanders will have a real choice between returning to the failed Republican policies of record spending and corporate tax giveaways," Brown said. "Or standing with us as we write the next chapter in Maryland by strengthening middle-class families and growing our economy."
Hogan presented another.
"Brown is asking for a promotion, so he can continue these same failed policies for another four years. But we can't let that happen," Hogan said. "This may be our last chance to turn out great state around before it's too late. The people of Maryland simply cannot afford another four years of O'Malley-Brown, tax-and-spend, politics-as-usual."
