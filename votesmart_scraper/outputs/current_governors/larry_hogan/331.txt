The National Federation of Independent Business threw its weight Thursday behind Republican Larry Hogan's campaign for governor, calling him the the best choice to control taxes and government spending.
The small-business group delivered its endorsement in Hogan's race against Democrat Anthony G. Brown as Hogan toured Sunrise Safety Services, a company in Glen Burnie that makes signs and provides a variety of transportation related services.
Phyllis Burlage, chairwoman of the NFIB's state political action committee, said that as a business owner and an individual, she was tired of the government taking so much of workers' hard-earned money and spending it on what she called failed policies.
The group's backing of Hogan comes as no surprise. The NFIB, which often stakes out positions to the right of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, typically backs Republicans and a handful of conservative Democrats.
Hogan basked in the praise and vowed to win his race.
"It's people like you that are the reason I'm running for governor," he told the group of about two dozen at Sunrise's offices.
The Brown campaign contrasted the federation's traditional opposition to minimum wage increases with Hogan's recent statement that he wouldn't seek to reverse the hike approved by the General Assembly with Brown's support this year.
"After trying to flip-flop on his opposition to a modest raise for Maryland workers, it's not surprising to see Larry Hogan again reverse course and accept an endorsement from a Republican lobbying group that fought hard against raising Maryland's minimum wage," said Brown campaign manager Justin Schall.
