The race for Maryland governor took an interesting financial turn recently when it was reported that Larry Hogan would be the first candidate in 20 years to use the public financing system.
This means he will be millions of dollars short of his opponent Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown for campaign spending, however Hogan assured us that his focus isn't on the money, it's on the people.
"My main focus is on jobs, middle class families, and restoring our economy and basically I want to get the government off our backs and out of our pockets so we can grow the private sector, put people back to work and turn our economy around."
We wanted to catch up with candidate Anthony Brown at Tawes to get his thoughts, but he was not able to attend the event.
