Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Nov. 5, 2013
Location: Santa Fe, NM

New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez announced the first orientation of her administration‟s "Operation Soundstage" program, a unique multi-agency effort to help New Mexico‟s veterans obtain employment in the state‟s television and film industry. On Friday, November 15 at 1:30 p.m., the New Mexico Film Office, in partnership with the New Mexico Departments of Veteran‟s Services and Workforce Solutions, will hold an orientation to give resident veterans an overview of the basics of television and film production, and in turn give productions more confidence when hiring those new to the industry.
"The diverse set of skills, backgrounds, and training that New Mexico‟s veterans bring to the table will be a strong asset to film and television productions. This Operation Soundstage‟ orientation will provide a primer in film and television production that will give New Mexico‟s veterans an opportunity to ensure that their professionalism and skills are effectively put to use," said Governor Martinez.
The New Mexico Film Office, through the Jobs Training Incentive Program, currently finances training that helps New Mexico crew members advance their education and become qualified for new crew jobs. These funds are only available for a limited number of positions for each production. This program will provide the opportunity for veterans and reserve component members to start in entry-level positions and transition into advanced film and television crew positions. Military veterans provide an excellent pool of skilled and talented professionals to fill job openings such as carpenters, electricians, editors, technicians, production assistants, caterers, drivers and dozens of other positions typically needed for television and movie projects.
To register or learn more about the program, veterans should email info@nmfilm.com or call (505) 476-5600. More program details are also available online from the New Mexico Film Office at http://www.nmfilm.com/operation-sound-stage.aspx. Seating is limited.
"Our military members and veterans are good at what they do," said Martinez. "In the service, they‟ve received some of the best training available, and they‟ve practiced their craft in difficult situations. Someone who has served our country should never be on an unemployment line."
Governor Susana Martinez has introduced several programs to help veterans more easily find jobs in the civilian workforce, including the film program and a pilot program that trained veterans to serve as wild land firefighters, which the Governor has proposed to make permanent. Governor Martinez also signed legislation to help expedite professional licenses for active duty military, veterans and their spouses. Just last month, Martinez announced that her administration has launched an effort to help streamline the licensing process for veterans seeking to work as commercial truck drivers or emergency medical technicians.
