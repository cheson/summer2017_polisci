Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced a $1 million expansion of the
Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) Family Support Worker program, which she
initiated as a pilot program in Bernalillo County in April of 2014. The program will now serve
six New Mexico counties and provides specifically high-risk families with service and support
aimed at preventing child maltreatment. The Governor also urged legislators to enact stiffer
penalties for those who assault child abuse caseworkers in New Mexico.
"Expanding the number of family support workers is critical to our efforts to improve child
welfare in New Mexico," said Governor Martinez. "By engaging high-risk families and
providing them with the proper support, we can better keep our children safe and promote
healthy, loving homes and families."
The Family Support Worker program, which Governor Martinez initiated as a pilot program in
2014 along with numerous other proposals aimed at improving the well-being of New Mexico's
children, served a total of 452 families in Bernalillo County from September of 2014 to
September of 2015. Governor Martinez secured $1 million in CYFD's FY16 budget to expand
the program, and she will call for an additional $1 million during the upcoming legislative
session for further expansion.
"Our caseworkers have one of the toughest jobs out there," said Governor Martinez. "It's
important that we afford these workers the same legal protection from assault and battery that is
given to other professionals that serve families and children such as paramedics, teachers and
sports officials."
