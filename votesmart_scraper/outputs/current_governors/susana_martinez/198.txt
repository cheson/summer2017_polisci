Press Release

Location: Albuquerque, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced the 2014 Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), which provides nutritious meals to New Mexico children during the summer months.
"While students are eager for a summer break, many will face the unacceptable uncertainty of missing meals throughout the day when school is closed," said Governor Martinez. "We have continued to expand this important program statewide, so that more New Mexico children have access to the high-quality and nutritious meals they need and deserve, even while school is not in session."
Since taking office in 2011, Governor Martinez has significantly expanded SFSP, both in Bernalillo County and throughout New Mexico. Since 2010, 29 sites have been added statewide, including an additional 7 sites for 2014, which makes 36 NEW summer sites since 2010. This includes 15 new sites in Bernalillo County alone. In 2013, SFSP served 91,000 more breakfasts than in 2010, and 23,000 more lunches. For 2014, statewide sponsoring organizations are expecting to serve more than 2.1 million meals across New Mexico.
In 2013, sponsoring organizations provided nearly 2 million nutritious meals to New Mexico children through 691 local sites throughout the state, including nearly 630,000 meals at 212 sites in the Albuquerque area alone.
SFSP is funded nationally by the USDA and operated by the New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department, which reimburses statewide sponsoring organizations (administering agencies) for the administration and service of meals at approved meal sites when school is not in session. The meals are free and no registration is required.
"Governor Martinez continues to work hard to ensure the success of SFSP in New Mexico," said Secretary Deines. "Her continued support for this important program helps many New Mexico families and children get the food they need over the summer."
SFSP begins on June 2 and runs through August 1. To locate a participating meal site, or for more information about SFSP, parents can call 1-800-EAT-COOL (1-800-328-2665) or visit the program's website at summerfoodnm.org.
In addition to SFSP, Governor Martinez has also expanded the Breakfast After the Bell program, which allows schools to serve breakfast to kids who don't make it to school in time to have breakfast before class. Thanks to such efforts, New Mexico continues to be a national leader in providing meals to low-income children. The Food Research and Action Center has ranked New Mexico 1st in the nation for serving breakfasts to low-income children, and 2nd in the nation for serving meals to low-income children over the summer.
CYFD Cabinet Secretary Yolanda Deines, U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service SFSP Southwest Region Representative JoEllen Collin, and local community leaders joined Governor Martinez for today's announcement.
