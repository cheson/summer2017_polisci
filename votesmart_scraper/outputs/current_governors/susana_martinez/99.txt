Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced the launch of a mentorship
program that pairs struggling teachers with their high-performing colleagues to provide
additional support, professional development and an opportunity to grow in their field. This year,
more than 170 teachers will participate in the program in Alamogordo, Belen, Farmington, and
Pe√±asco school districts.
"If we want to improve our schools, we should empower our struggling teachers and give them
the tools they need to succeed," Governor Martinez said. "By pairing our high-performing
teachers with struggling ones, we can make big gains -- classroom by classroom, and school by
school."
