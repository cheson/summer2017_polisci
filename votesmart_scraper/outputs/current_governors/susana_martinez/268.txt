Governor Susana Martinez today announced that the Human Services Department (HSD) and the Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) will soon distribute back-to-school cash assistance for low-income children and children in foster care.
"These are two ways in which we can ensure that our neediest children have everything they need to be able to focus in the classroom," said Governor Martinez. "Proper clothing and supplies make it easier for students to concentrate and makes it more likely that they will have a successful school year."
The annual children's clothing allowance through HSD provides a $50 payment per qualifying New Mexico child to purchase clothes for the upcoming school year. The allowance is part of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. HSD estimates they will help more than 15,100 low-income children at a cost of roughly $755,000.
CYFD will provide $100 to foster families and providers for each foster child in their care that is three years old and above. The funding is to help foster families purchase backto-school supplies. More than 1,500 foster children are preparing to go back to school.
"We are very appreciative of foster families and providers who work hard to get our foster children ready and prepared for the new school year," said Governor Martinez.
The CYFD funding allows foster parents to purchase items such as pencils, pens, markers, notebooks, calculators, back packs, and clothing for foster children in their care.
