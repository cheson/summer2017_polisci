Today at the Roundhouse, Governor Susana Martinez signed Senate Bill 56, allowing for the transport of oversized loads of hay on state roads in New Mexico. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Stuart Ingle (R-Portales), comes in response to ongoing drought conditions in the state that have placed an enormous strain on both ranchers and livestock. SB 56 will provide special permits for hay transportation in areas specified under the permit. Current law only allows for the transport of oversized hay loads on national highways, but not state roads. Governor Martinez signed the bill this afternoon at the annual Roundhouse Ag Feed.
"In all corners of the state, agriculture is a backbone of New Mexico's economy," said Governor Martinez. "As we deal with ongoing drought conditions that can greatly affect livestock, our farmers and ranchers need the right tools to keep their operations going when hay supplies in a particular region of the state or throughout New Mexico become scarce. I'm grateful that Sen. Ingle took the lead on this issue so New Mexico's agriculture community can continue to make a great impact on our state even under difficult circumstances."
"With hay harder to come by in New Mexico, these larger shipments will allow farmers and ranchers to get the supplies they need to keep going during times of drought or emergency," added Sen. Ingle. "I thank Governor Martinez for working with us in the agriculture community to solve this problem and allow the industry to succeed."
