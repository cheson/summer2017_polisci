Governor Susana Martinez Urges Meaningful Education Reform by Ending Social Promotion
Press Conference

Governor Susana Martinez held a press conference at the Roundhouse
today to urge support for legislation that would end the practice of social promotion in New Mexico schools. Social promotion is the policy that allows students to the next grade even when unwarranted by classroom performance. The Governor was joined by Public Education Secretary-designate Hanna Skandera, as well as Sen. Mary Jane Garcia (D-Do√±a Ana), Rep. Nora Espinoza (R-Roswell), Rep. Mary Helen Garcia (D-Las Cruces), and other Republican and Democratic lawmakers supporting this important piece of education reform.
"We must stop putting our children at a disadvantage in the classroom," said Governor Martinez. "Advancing students to the next grade without the tools required to succeed at the previous level only breeds frustration, disappointment, and ultimately apathy. Ending social promotion will make sure that New Mexico's children are mastering the instruction they receive in key grades before advancing and it will stem one of the greatest failures of
our education system -- a dropout rate of nearly 40 percent.
"Once again, I am encouraged by the willingness of the legislature to put aside partisan differences in order to address the needs of our broken education system. It's time for our education policies to be guided by what's best for New Mexico's students. That is the only way we will see real results in the classroom and a brighter future for our children."
