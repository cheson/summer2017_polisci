Governor Susana Martinez Statement on Tax Day
Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: April 15, 2011
Location: Las Cruses, NM

Governor Susana Martinez today made the following statement on Tax
Day, the day that typically marks the deadline that American taxpayers must have their
tax returns submitted to the federal government.
"Today is a reminder of the burden that New Mexico taxpayers face each and every
year," said Governor Martinez. "Unfortunately, while Tax Day is filled with symbolism,
New Mexico's families and small businesses feel the financial drain and uncertainty
caused year-round when the federal government attempts to take more and more money
out of their pockets to fund out-of-control spending. Both our state and federal tax system
should encourage small businesses to grow and hire, allow families to prosper, and
permit New Mexicans to keep more of their hard-earned money.
"That's why I'm fighting hard against big government and excessive taxes. The budget
that I just signed is a symbol of our priorities -- it cuts spending, preserves classroom
funding and healthcare for the most vulnerable, and it does not raise taxes on a single
New Mexican. And, as promised, I vetoed every tax increase sent to my desk. New
Mexico's economy simply cannot turn the corner when families and employers face the
uncertainty and financial hardship caused by high taxes and runaway spending. I will
continue to fight against government excess as we work to cut spending, put our state
back on sound fiscal footing, and create a business-friendly environment that allows for
economic growth and job creation."
