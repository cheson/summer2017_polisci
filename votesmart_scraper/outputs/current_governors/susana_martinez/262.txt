Location: Santa Teresa, NM

Today Governor Susana Martinez and New Mexico Economic Development Secretary Jon Barela joined Chihuahua Governor César Duarte and Chihuahua Secretary of the Economy Álvaro Navarro to announce the creation of a 70,000 acre, first-of-its kind, bi-national, master-planned community around the Santa Teresa-San Jeronimo border crossing.
"The potential of the Santa Teresa-San Jeronimo area is endless, and with this visionary, masterplanned community we will be well-positioned to compete for large, global investments to locate in New Mexico," said Governor Martinez. "This region is strategically located in the central corridor of the NAFTA region and it's right in the middle of the U.S.-Mexico Border between the two major seaports of Houston and Long Beach making it an attractive location for manufacturers, transportation and logistics companies."
Governor Martinez has focused on developing the border area since taking office. She has taken a three-pronged approach that includes tax and regulatory reform, and targeted investments in infrastructure, to encourage investment and growth.
The community has major industrial anchors on both sides of the border -- the Union Pacific Intermodal Rail Facility in Santa Teresa and the 640 acre Foxconn manufacturing campus in San Jeronimo, Chihuahua. It will be positioned to attract large, global industrial and commercial businesses, include residential and retail development and incorporate state-of-the-art energy, water and sustainability technologies.The bi-national community is the model of cross-border development incorporating the largest inland port to facilitate economic development by consolidating a new industrial, commercial and residential community at the San Jeronimo- Santa Teresa border crossing.
"Over the last two and a half years both administrations have been committed to increase economic development through cross-border cooperation," Secretary Barela said. "We have seen great benefits to the entire state of New Mexico through our efforts to grow the Santa Teresa Borderplex and we expect this to also contribute greatly."
In addition to more than 70,000 acres of land available for industrial, commercial and residential development, it includes more than 2,000 acres of rail-served industrial land.
Region's Competitive Advantage:
- Equidistance to the seaports of Long Beach and Houston, and integrated into the Northern Economic Corridor in Mexico connected to the Pacific seaports by both rail and highway
- Foreign Trade Zone (U.S) adjacent to Recinto Fiscalizado Estrategico (Mexico) on border
- Efficient border crossing that handles commercial oversize and overweight loads
- Easternmost land crossing on the U.S.-Mexico border
- Inland port with full intermodal capabilities planned on both sides of the border
- Juarez railroad bypass project
- Common industrial clusters
- Central corridor of the NAFTA region
Efforts to include:
- A joint master plan of San Jeronimo, Chi, Mexico and Santa Teresa, NM, U.S.
- Launching the proposed pilot program for Dual Customs Clearance facility between U.S. and Mexico
- Marketing Worktables to recruit large OEMs (Original Equipment Manufactures) to locate in the community
- Attraction of local and foreign investment
- Creation of world-class industrial zone and a globally recognized and competitive community
- Increasing the work skills of the local employment base
