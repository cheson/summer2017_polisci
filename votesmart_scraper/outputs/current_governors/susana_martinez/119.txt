Today, Governor Susana Martinez encouraged New Mexico families to take
advantage of the annual tax-free weekend, which will save them money and prepare their
children with clothes and supplies to return to school this fall.
"This is a great opportunity for families to do back-to-school shopping and save some of their
hard-earned money," said Governor Martinez. "The tax-free weekend is a win-win for both
families and businesses. And most importantly, it helps our kids get back to school with more of
the supplies they need to be prepared and ready to learn."
