Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez issued the following statement regarding the
death of Osama bin Laden:
"Osama bin Laden's death marks an important and extraordinary victory, nearly ten years after tyrants and murderers chose to kill thousands of innocent Americans on September 11, 2001 and target freedom-loving people across the world with violence," said Governor Martinez. "It is appropriate for us to celebrate this moment of great consequence today, but we must remain steadfast in our efforts to keep Americans safe, confront terrorism, and support the members of our Armed Forces whose life purpose is to protect and defend us."
"The sacrifices made by the men and women in uniform who have bravely served in the pursuit of our nation's greatest enemies will not be forgotten. I am particularly honored to recognize the efforts of the state's National Guard and New Mexicans who have served or who continue to serve in our military. Today, they can embrace a sense of pride and gratitude that, through their perseverance and sacrifice, they have brought to justice the man behind the worst terrorist strike in American history. We are grateful. We are blessed. And we are thankful for their service."
