Senate Committee Ignores New Mexicans, Amends HB 78 to Allow for Continued Issuance of Driver's Licenses to Illegal Immigrants
Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: March 8, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement after certain members of the Senate Judiciary Committee adopted amendments to House Bill 78, turning the legislation into a bill that would no longer stop the policy of issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.
"The bill in its current form is a sham and insults the intelligence of every New Mexican who wants to see this dangerous law overturned," said Governor Martinez. "New Mexicans deserve an up-or-down vote on a bill that will actually stop the issuance of driver's licenses to illegal immigrants to protect the people of New Mexico, rather than a sham bill designed to protect politicians from being honest with their constituents."
