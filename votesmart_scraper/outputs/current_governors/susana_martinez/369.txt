Location: Albuquerque, NM

Governor Susana Martinez attended the American Heart Association's Go
Red for Women Luncheon this afternoon, where she supported efforts to bring attention to the
fight against heart disease by signing House Bill 33. The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Conrad
James (R-Albuquerque) and Sen. Howie Morales (D-Silver City), will allow the state to
designate hospitals as primary stroke centers and make it easier for them to provide higherquality care to patients who have suffered from a stroke. Under the new law, the Department of Health will be able to designate acute care hospitals as stroke centers, which will particularly increase access to stroke care for individuals living in rural communities.
"Heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death in New Mexico," said Governor
Martinez. "It's extremely important that we take steps like this to ensure that people have access to the care they need in the event of a life-threatening medical situation like a stroke. I hope that all New Mexicans embrace healthy lifestyle choices so we can reduce the rate of heart-related illnesses and I'm grateful to Rep. James and Sen. Morales for their work on this important legislation."
"New Mexico is working hard to fight health issues that have long been a problem in our state,"
added Rep. James. "This law will make it easier for New Mexicans who suffer a stroke to receive treatment. I thank Governor Martinez for signing this bill so we can take the next step toward making our state a safer and healthier place for all New Mexicans.
