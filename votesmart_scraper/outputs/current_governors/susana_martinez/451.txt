Locomotive Fuel Tax Exemption Headed to the Governor's Desk
Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: March 18, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement after a bill exempting locomotive fuel from New Mexico's gross receipts tax passed through the House of Representatives, bringing the bill to the Governor's desk. The legislation is expected to lead to the creation of 3,000 jobs in New Mexico, including roughly 660 permanent jobs, and make New Mexico competitive with neighboring states, such as Texas, that already have such an exemption.
"Encouraging businesses to invest in our state is an important step toward reviving New Mexico's economy," Governor Martinez said. "Reducing taxes to make us more competitive with neighboring states is a common-sense policy that will foster growth and encourage businesses to come here and hire New
Mexico workers. I thank members from both parties for coming together to pass this much-needed measure that allows us the opportunity to take back jobs lost to other states, attract new development, and give New
Mexico businesses the tools to grow and succeed."
The locomotive fuel tax exemption will allow for the groundbreaking of a new Union Pacific rail facility in Santa Teresa. Union Pacific estimates that its construction will create approximately 3,000 jobs over time with 900 sustained jobs at the peak and permanent operation will employ up to 660 workers.
