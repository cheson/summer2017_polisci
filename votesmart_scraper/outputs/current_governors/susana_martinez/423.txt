Today, Governor Susana Martinez issued the following statement in
response to the indictment of Judge Michael Murphy for his role in a bribery scheme in which he allegedly paid $4,000 for his judicial appointment.
"The indictment of a sitting judge on charges that he paid bribes for his judicial
appointment and solicited bribes from another judicial candidate is deeply troubling," said Governor Martinez. "No one is above the law and this criminal defendant should not be given any special treatment."
