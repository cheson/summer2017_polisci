This week, Governor Susana Martinez and statewide community literacy partners
sent award letters and prize packages to more than one thousand New Mexico students who participated in the 2014 New Mexico True Summer Reading Challenge for children.
The New Mexico True Summer Reading Challenge provides an opportunity for all New Mexico elementary school children, ages five through twelve, to earn prizes for reading. The challenge began on April 22 and ran through July 31.
Every participant who submitted a reading log will receive a New Mexico True bookmark and a certificate recognizing their accomplishment. Readers who submit their reading log complete with information regarding the twelve books read, as well as a short essay explaining "Why I Love New Mexico," also had their names entered in the random drawing to receive one of several grand prizes.
"It's so important that our children learn to read well in order to build a foundation for success in academics, and ultimately, for success in the workplace and in life. As adults, we should always be looking for opportunities to encourage our children's success and the prizes are reflective of New Mexico community leaders' commitment to making learning a priority," said Governor Martinez. "I am proud to join our statewide partners in rewarding children for reading throughout the summer months.
