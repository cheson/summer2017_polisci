Governor Susana Martinez joined law enforcement officials today to launch the Summer Safety Blast. The season-long initiative focuses on decreasing traffic deaths by enforcing DWI and seat belt laws. The safety blast includes State Police's new zero tolerance policy on unrestrained drivers and passengers, including children not properly restrained in a child safety seat. The initiative also includes the national Click It Or Ticket seatbelt campaign and New Mexico's 100 Days of Summer D.W.I. crackdown.
"We believe this is a great plan and by increasing awareness about not driving drunk and buckling up, we can save lives," said Governor Susana Martinez. "By combining these three initiatives, our chances of stopping or preventing dangerous driving behavior are vastly increased. This is an important message for people to understand: If you drive drunk, you will be caught. And if you don't buckle up your kids, you will pay a fine."
So far this year, 78 people have died in traffic crashes on New Mexico roads. Forty-five percent of those crashes were alcohol-related while at least 14 of those crash victims weren't wearing a seat belt.
As part of the Summer Safety Blast, law enforcement officers will conduct saturation patrols looking for anyone not wearing a seatbelt. That includes youngsters not properly restrained in a child safety seat. State Police has a new zero tolerance seatbelt policy, which means no warnings will be given. You break the law, you will be cited.
"Fastening your seat belt and making sure your kids are properly buckled up is such an easy thing to do, and it's the best way to protect yourself and your family in the event of a crash," said State Police Chief Robert Shilling.
