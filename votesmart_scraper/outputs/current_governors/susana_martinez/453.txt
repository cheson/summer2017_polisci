Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement after the House
of Representatives voted to strengthen accountability and increase transparency in New Mexico's schools by assigning them an A-through-F grade based on performance. House Bill 355, sponsored by Representative Dennis Roch (R -- Texico) passed by a bipartisan vote of 46-22. Yesterday afternoon, the Senate passed identical companion legislation, Senate Bill 427, sponsored by Senator Vernon Asbill (R -- Carlsbad).
"Today, New Mexico took another significant step toward bold education reform," said Governor Martinez. "Implementing a transparent school grading system will allow everyone to understand the progress in our classrooms, enabling us to recognize excellence and reverse failure. I thank Representative Roch for his leadership and applaud Representatives George Dodge, Rhonda King, Joni Gutierrez, Andy Nunez, Kiki Saavedra and all of the members of the House who today rejected the status quo and chose to put the interests of New Mexico's children first. I now encourage the leadership
of both chambers to take the necessary procedural actions required to bring this critical legislation to my desk."
Governor Martinez has made improving education in New Mexico a top priority and is committed to ensuring every student has access to quality schools and teachers. Her education reform plan includes key initiatives to increase accountability and transparency, set students up for success by ending social promotion, target resources where they are needed the most and identify and reward our most effective educators and leaders.
