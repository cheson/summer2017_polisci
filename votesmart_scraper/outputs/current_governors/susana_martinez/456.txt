Governor Susana Martinez Calls for Clean Version of Katie's Law Expansion
Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: March 12, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement after the Senate
watered down a bill that would expand Katie's Law, effectively dismantling the original legislation.
"The bill passed by the Senate this evening would not only fail to give law enforcement expanded tools to catch and convict criminals, it would strip them of the tools provided by the original version of Katie's Law that they have been using for years," said Governor Martinez. "A clean version of the bill that has already passed the House is absolutely necessary as we work to make New Mexico's communities safer. I urge Republicans and Democrats in both chambers to work together to pass a clean bill and give our law enforcement community the necessary means to prosecute criminals, prevent crimes, and provide justice for victims and their families."
