Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Jan. 20, 2012
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez met today with governors and representatives from five Mexican states in an organized effort to discuss projects and initiatives that would be mutually beneficial to economic development efforts on both sides of the border. The meeting was facilitated by Governor Martinez and Chihuahua Governor Cesar Duarte in order to form a working relationship between states who share a commitment to making New Mexico a key trade corridor between Mexico and the United States. Governors and other participants discussed the importance of the new Union Pacific rail facility in Santa Teresa as well as infrastructure projects such as a recently-announced water treatment facility that will allow for even greater economic development in southern New Mexico.
"New Mexico has the opportunity to establish itself as an economic hub in the relationship between the United States and Mexico," said Governor Martinez. "We are already seeing a significant impact from efforts to develop our border region economy and the resulting growth and job creation in southern New Mexico has been extremely encouraging. I hope to continue the conversations we had today in order to further foster our economic development efforts in New Mexico and make our state a major corridor for trade and growth that will benefit businesses and workers on both sides of the border."
Today's meeting was held independent of New Mexico's participation in other organizations such as the Border Governors Conference, the New Mexico-Chihuahua Commission, and the New Mexico-Sonora Commission.
