By: Susana Martinez
Date: June 15, 2016
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez declared a state of emergency in response
to the Dog Head Wildfire affecting portions of Bernalillo and Torrance Counties. The Governor
has also directed state agencies to offer all available resources to assist local authorities in the
affected areas.
"Our first priority is the health and safety of New Mexicans in the affected areas and
communities," Governor Martinez said. "I've directed our state agencies to offer all available
resources to assist our local partners in responding to the fire, and we'll continue to coordinate
with the emergency response team to monitor the fire. Property can be replaced, but lives cannot
-- as our coordinated response to the fire continues, I ask New Mexicans to be mindful of this,
and to not take unnecessary risks."
The Governor's declaration of a state of emergency will enable counties to order and pay for
additional resources needed to help with this emergency. Earlier today, the Governor also
ordered the activation of New Mexico's Emergency Operations Center to assist in the
coordinated response to the fire.
State agencies such as the New Mexico State Police, the Department of Homeland Security and
Emergency Management, New Mexico State Forestry, and others are assisting with the response
to the fire. The Governor has also directed the New Mexico National Guard to be prepared to
assist with the response if needed.
