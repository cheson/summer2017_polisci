Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: June 29, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez announced today that she has declared a State of Emergency in New Mexico through July 6th, 2011 regarding the use of fireworks. While State law does not allow the Governor to ban fireworks by executive order, she is urging all New Mexicans to refrain from buying, selling, or using fireworks during the dry summer fire season and has instructed the Department of Public Safety to increase staffing of officers and coordination with local law enforcement agencies to enforce all statewide and local fireworks bans or restrictions.
"The conditions in New Mexico are simply too dangerous for anyone to buy, sell, or use fireworks this summer," said Governor Martinez. "This order increases the number of State Police officers who will be available to support local communities in enforcing the bans or restrictions put in place by both the State and local governments. This is a reminder to all New Mexicans that there can be serious consequences for violating fireworks restrictions."
