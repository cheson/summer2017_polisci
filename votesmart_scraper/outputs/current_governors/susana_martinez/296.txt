Governor Susana Martinez Signs Bill Tightening New Mexico's Sex Offender Laws
Statement

Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez announced today that she has signed House Bill 570, strengthening state sex offender registration laws in order to make New Mexico's communities safer. A joint effort between Governor Martinez, Rep. Antonio "Moe" Maestas (DAlbuquerque), and Rep. Yvette Herrell (R-Alamogordo), the legislation closes the existing outof-state loophole for sex offenders. Previously, some sex offenders registered in another state did not have to register upon moving to New Mexico. HB 570 requires these individuals to register as a sex offender in New Mexico for the remaining period of time as required by their sentence from another state or for the duration that would be required for an equivalent offense under New Mexico law -- whichever is longer.
"Our families deserve to know that we are doing everything we can to protect them from sex offenders, provide law enforcement with the most complete information, and make our communities as safe as possible," said Governor Martinez. "I'm proud to sign this bill to give New Mexicans more peace of mind and to ensure that sex offenders can no longer take advantage of a potentially dangerous loophole. I'm grateful to Rep. Maestas for his willingness to work together to craft this bill and pass it on behalf of all New Mexicans."
"This bill is a step in the right direction that will shore up the registration loophole and provide additional protection for the children of New Mexico," added Rep. Herrell. "It has been an honor to carry this bill for Governor Martinez and I am thrilled that this bi-partisan compromise made it to her desk to be signed. The governor and I are passionate about the safety of New Mexico children and this bill will provide the additional protection they deserve."
"Our communities and families deserve the peace of mind that comes with rigorous sex offender registration requirements. I'm proud to have worked with the governor and across the aisle to carry this legislation which closes the out of state loophole," added Rep. Maestas. "This bill also modernizes our sex offender requirements that will help keep New Mexico's kids safe in the community as well on the internet."
In addition to closing the out-of-state loophole, HB 570 also requires sex offenders to register:
* Current physical and mailing address as well as the address of every place the
offender habitually lives;
* Names, email addresses, and other monikers used on social networking sites;
* Landline and cellular telephone numbers and any other numbers used primarily
by the offender;
* Professional licenses;
* License plate or identifier and description of any vehicle owned or primarily
operated by the offender;
* Name and address of any school or higher education institute the offender is
attending; and
* Copies of passport and immigration documents.
