Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement applauding
the Senate Education Committee's passage of Senate Bill 502, sponsored by Senate Education Committee Chair Cynthia Nava (D-Las Cruces), legislation creating a comprehensive strategy to identify, recruit, retain and reward effective teachers and leaders for New Mexico classrooms.
"I applaud Chair Nava and the entire Senate Education Committee for their
overwhelming, bipartisan support for bold education reform legislation to reward teachers who improve student achievement in their classrooms," said Governor Martinez. "A system that rewards great teachers will enable New Mexico to attract and retain the best education professionals in the nation and allow us to fundamentally improve schools in our sate.
The "Rewarding Effective Educators and Leaders" initiative charges a diverse group of education stakeholders -- including teachers, parents and representation from the business community -- with creating a system to evaluate teachers based on student outcomes, and local determinations, such as classroom observations, and reward them for their hard work and commitment to raising student achievement.
Governor Martinez continued, "I encourage the legislature to pass the bold series of education reforms proposed this year to increase accountability in our schools, end social promotion for struggling students and reward outstanding educators. I am optimistic that we can partner together and pass meaningful laws that will reform New Mexico's education system and yield real results."
Governor Martinez has made improving education in New Mexico a top priority and is committed to ensuring every student has access to quality schools and teachers. Her "Kids First, New Mexico Wins" plan is comprised of four key initiatives to increase accountability and transparency, set students up for success by ending social promotion, target resources where they are needed the most and identify and reward our most effective educators and leaders.
