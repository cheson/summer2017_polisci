Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement in response to today's tragic events in Boston:
"My thoughts and prayers are with all of today's victims who were injured or killed, as well as their friends and family members and all of the New Mexicans who were visiting the great city of Boston for today's marathon. I also pray for the first responders to this tragic situation, who are doing everything they can to provide aid and comfort to those who have been affected. It's still too early to speculate as to what happened, but I am sickened by this horrible act of violence and I am confident that anyone who may have perpetrated this tragedy will be brought to justice."
