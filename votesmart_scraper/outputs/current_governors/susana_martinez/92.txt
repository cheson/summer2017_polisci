Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Dec. 1, 2015
Location: Albuquerque, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez proposed a $1.25 million investment to
establish a Rapid Workforce Development Fund that can be used to quickly train and certify
employees in specialized fields to fulfill the workforce requirements of a company looking to
move to New Mexico or expand its existing operations in the state. It would be funded with onetime,
non-recurring money, to be used only in instances when an expansion or recruitment of a
large company would not be possible without the swift development of a specialized type of
worker in the state.
"As we continue to grow and diversify our economy, we will need to continue to build a skilled
and talented workforce pipeline to help our businesses thrive and keep more of our graduates in
New Mexico," Governor Martinez said. "By establishing this fund, we can tap into yet another
resource to recruit companies from out of state and help our New Mexico-based businesses
grow."
