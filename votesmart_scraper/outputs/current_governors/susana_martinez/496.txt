Governor Susana Martinez Announces Spending Cuts at the Governor's Residence
Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Jan. 4, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced her plans to begin the process of cutting waste in state government by cutting wasteful spending in the Governor's residence.
Martinez will permanently eliminate the positions of two chefs, currently budgeted at annual salaries of $91,821 and $62,400, respectively. In addition, the residence manager's annual salary will be reduced by nearly $25,000, to $55,000. A short-order cook and housekeeper will be
retained.
Total savings in Governor's residence salaries will amount to at least $178,862, a total spending cut of 55 percent.
"Tax dollars should not be wasted on a stable of chefs at the Governor's residence," said Governor Martinez. "This is a prime example of wasteful spending that exists in state government. At a time when New Mexicans are struggling and are being forced to make their own household budget cuts, there is no justifiable reason to budget two chefs for the governor."
