Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Aug. 25, 2015
Location: Sante Fe, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez is ordering compliance investigators with the State Public Education Department and individuals from the Department of Public Safety to conduct an immediate review of background check policies for each school district in the state and undertake a thorough compliance review to ensure school districts are requiring personnel to receive timely criminal background checks.
"Jason Martinez should have never been hired at Albuquerque Public Schools; he has no
business being around children. APS dropped the ball, and it's completely unacceptable,"
Governor Martinez said. "I am ordering this immediate review because our parents need to know
that our districts are following the law, are conducting background checks, and providing a safe
environment at all times for our children. This review should help districts craft stronger policies
and immediately identify any lapses or gaps in background check compliance by school districts
throughout the state."
