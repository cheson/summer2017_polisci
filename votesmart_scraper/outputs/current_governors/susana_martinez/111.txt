For the fourth year in a row, Governor Susana Martinez announced the success of New Mexico's annual child support bench warrant round up. This year's program collected more than $150,000 in unpaid child support.
"The bench warrant round up is an invaluable tool in standing up for New Mexico's children,"
said Governor Martinez. "The round up delivers real, meaningful results for children and
families, and it sends a clear message that if parents don't fulfill their financial obligations to
their kids, law enforcement will hold them accountable."
This year's bench warrant round up led to 110 arrests, with a total of $76,809.47 collected so far.
The bench warrant amnesty period led to the collection of $73,474.90 from 183 non-custodial
parents. The total amount of child support collected from the round up so far, combined with
collections from the amnesty period, is more than $150,284.37.
The New Mexico Human Services Department's (HSD) Child Support Enforcement Division
(CSED) the New Mexico State Police (NMSP) and local law enforcement partners across the
state acted on more than 550 child support warrants during this year's round up.
During Fiscal Year 2015, CSED set yet another record in child support collections with a total of
$140.1 million. Each of the past four fiscal years, New Mexico has broken state records for child
support collections, with CSED collecting $137.1 million in FY 2014, $132.2 million in FY
2013, and $129.6 million in FY 2012. Thanks to programs like the bench warrant amnesty and
round up period, New Mexico was recognized by the National Child Support Enforcement
Association in 2012 as the nation's most improved.
In conjunction with the bench warrant amnesty and round up period, Governor Martinez
proclaimed August 2015 to be Child Support Awareness Month to recognize New Mexico
parents who support their children, and encourage all parents to take responsibility for improving
the economic and social well-being of their children. The Governor's proclamation is available
online here.
