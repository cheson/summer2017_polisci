Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced New Mexico's participation in National Prescription Drug Take Back Day on Saturday, April 26. National Prescription Drug Take Back Day offers the opportunity for the safe disposal of prescription medications.
"New Mexico continues to work hard to combat prescription drug abuse, but we also need families and individuals to recognize the potential danger of keeping expired or unused medications in the home where they are susceptible to misuse and are easily accessible to children," said Governor Martinez. "I encourage all New Mexicans to take advantage of this opportunity and dispose of unused, unwanted, and expired prescription drugs safely."
On Saturday, April 26 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., dozens of locations throughout New Mexico will be set up as collection sites, staffed by state and local law enforcement. The service is free and anonymous.
Sponsored by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, National Drug Take Back Day has helped to successfully remove more than 3.4 million pounds, or 1,733 tons, of prescription medication from circulation. The New Mexico Department of Health reports 486 New Mexicans died of a drug overdose in 2012, a seven percent decrease from 2011.
Governor Martinez has declared the year 2014 "New Mexico's Crisis of Preventable Overdose Deaths," to encourage all New Mexicans to get involved in advocating for reducing preventable overdose deaths among family, friends, and neighbors
