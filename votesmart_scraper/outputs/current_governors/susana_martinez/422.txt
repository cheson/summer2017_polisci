Location: Santa Fe, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez signed an executive order that directs
the state purchasing agent to suspend or disallow public contracting with companies that betray the public trust.
"Companies engaged in corrupt activity should not receive public contracts or continue to be allowed to do business with the state," Governor Martinez remarked. "This executive order is a key first step in reforming the state's procurement process to ensure that it is open, fair, and more resistant to favoritism and corruption."
In addition, the Governor signed an executive order to establish a "Task Force on Procurement Reform" that will review procurement regulations and statutes and recommend ways to improve and streamline the procurement process to not only ensure its fairness, but to make it more friendly for businesses as well.
"We are sending a clear signal that we take the contracting process seriously. New Mexicans must know that their tax dollars are being spent responsibly and with transparency and accountability. I have asked the task force to recommend further changes in order to provide greater reform to the process and provide taxpayers the assurances they deserve."
The task force will report to the Governor in May and November of each calendar year with legislative and regulatory recommendations. The full text of the executive orders can be found below.
