Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced plans to bring high-speed
Internet access to every New Mexico classroom by the 2018 school year. By leveraging $49
million in appropriated state funds over the next few years, several state agencies and a national
nonprofit will team up with local districts to improve infrastructure and bring high-speed Internet
to every student in New Mexico. Currently, more than 30 percent of New Mexico's school
districts don't have access to high-speed Internet.
"I have always believed that every child can learn -- no matter their circumstances or
background. But as leaders, we must also give our students the tools they need to succeed. In
2015, that means providing every school with access to high-speed Internet," Governor Martinez
said. "For many of New Mexico's kids, this commitment will be a game-changer, allowing our
students to access tools and content where it matters most: in the classroom."
