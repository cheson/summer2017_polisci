Susana Martinez's Plan For Jobs & Economic Recovery
"The Richardson-Denish Administration has grown state government over 50% during their time in office. There are now 24.5 state employees for every 1,000 New Mexicans, which far exceeds the national average of 14.3 per 1,000. What we are left with is a bloated, inefficient government staffed by political appointees interested in securing personal advantage. To grow our economy, we must reign in wasteful spending, streamline state government and reform the way we do business in New Mexico and protect taxpayers."
Susana Martinez's Plan For Jobs & Economic Recovery:
Reduce Or Eliminate Many Exempt Positions In State Government. Greater reliance on merit, qualification and experience as factors in the hiring of state government positions.
Create An On-Line Check Book.To ensure voters can access state spending records in real-time and easily search the database, we must create a real-time, on-line and searchable checkbook that empowers New Mexicans to see how their tax dollars are being spent.
Reform The Capital Outlay Program To Ensure Greater Planning, Efficiency, Coordination And Prioritization.Today's capital outlay program is plagued by waste and inefficiency, used to further expand government and reward political insiders.
NOTE: If Directed By Better Priorities, The Capital Outlay Program Can Grow Our Economy And Create Jobs. During times of economic stress, capital outlay money can be utilized to create economic activity and jobs. We need to set better priorities at the executive level to direct the use of the people's money.
