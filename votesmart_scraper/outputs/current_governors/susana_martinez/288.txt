Today, Governor Susana Martinez marked Child Abuse Prevention Awareness Month at a state-wide Multidisciplinary Team Summit by calling on every single county in New Mexico to establish a teamwork approach to child abuse investigations and response.
Governor Martinez has pushed for this approach since she took office, and directed the Children, Youth, and Families Department to work with local governments to establish Multi-Disciplinary Teams in every county in the state. More than 23 counties were represented at today's summit, where participants will learn how to set up MDTs in their own communities.
Multidisciplinary teams are agreements between various agencies that each play a different role in investigating child abuse and providing services to children and families where abuse has taken place.
"As a former prosecutor, I know how critical it is for District Attorneys, District Judges, law enforcement, and child protective services to work together to keep kids safe," said Governor Martinez. "Having MDT's in every New Mexico County is a great way to ensure that child abuse cases are handled efficiently and timely which is in the best interest of the child. I'm very encouraged by today's response."
MDT's are composed of various types of professionals such as law enforcement, child protection workers, prosecutors, medical professionals and forensic investigators. The teamwork approach encourages more communication between the different people involved in child abuse investigation.
The Multidisciplinary Summit provided an opportunity for members of current and potential MDTs to come together to discuss the benefits of MDTs in responding to child welfare cases and to learn how to run successful MDT's in their own counties.
