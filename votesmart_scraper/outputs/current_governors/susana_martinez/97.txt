Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced that National American
University (NAU) has chosen Albuquerque as a location for its Distance Learning National
Operations Center. NAU will hire 30 to 50 workers immediately, and add approximately 50
employees every few months, creating up to 300 new jobs over the next few years. The news
comes just a day after the Governor announced 300 new high-tech jobs in Albuquerque.
"We're proud that our increased competitiveness and business friendliness brought NAU to New
Mexico," said Governor Susana Martinez. "They could have gone anywhere in the country, but
their decision to grow in Albuquerque shows the progress we're continuing to make in growing
and diversifying the private sector in New Mexico."
