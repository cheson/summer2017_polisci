Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Nov. 11, 2015
Location: Fort Stanton, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez dedicated the new $5.7 Million Veterans
Cemetery in Fort Stanton. The cemetery is the first of four proposed by Governor Martinez in
2013 for veterans who live in rural areas throughout the state.
"We come together today to honor the service of all men and women who have worn our
country's uniform," said Governor Martinez. "New Mexicans have always stood ready to defend
our state and nation in the U.S. Armed Forces, and they deserve a final resting place that is close
to home."
