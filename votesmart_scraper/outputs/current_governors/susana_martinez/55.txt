Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: April 19, 2016
Location: Albuquerque, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced that an RFP has been
awarded to Mothers Against Drunk Driving for an initiative that will place monitors in certain
courtrooms across the state to watch the DWI adjudication process and provide information to
the public about how those cases are being handled. The monitors will attend DWI hearings in
person and compile reports on how judges and others involved in the legal process are dealing
with drunk drivers. The program is part of the Governor's executive initiatives to fight DWI.
"Too many lives have been shattered by drunk drivers, and too often our justice system fails our
families by going easy on the criminals," said Governor Susana Martinez. "By shining a light on
our courtrooms, New Mexicans can see first-hand how DWI cases are being handled."
MADD, which was awarded a two-year $800,000 contract, will place New Mexicans in
courtrooms in Bernalillo, Dona Ana, McKinley, Rio Arriba, and San Juan Counties. The
monitors will also provide details about DWI case outcomes, which will then be posted to social
media for the public to view.
"MADD is looking forward to helping to put more New Mexicans on the front lines in the war
against drunk driving," said MADD State Executive Director Aisha Smith. "This program will
help ensure the public knows how DWI is handled in courts, as well as that courts know the
public is watching."
