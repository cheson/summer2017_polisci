Governor Susana Martinez Supports Legislation to Close Restitution Loophole
Press Release

Location: Santa Fe, NM

Today, Governor Martinez announced her support for legislative efforts
aimed at clarifying state law and ensuring that New Mexico's civil process includes garnishment of wages in order to pay restitution to victims and their families when an offender no longer falls under the jurisdiction of the state's criminal court system.
The introduction of Reece's Law comes in response to recent revelations that the drunk driver who struck and killed fourteen-year-old Reece Nord was able to cease courtordered payments to the victim's family. Once the offender completed the terms of his imprisonment and parole, he was no longer under the jurisdiction of the criminal courts or New Mexico's Corrections Department and therefore not subject to enforcement under
that system. The Nord family's story was reported last month by KRQE and the Albuquerque Journal.
"Unfortunately, the tragic incident involving the Nord family exposed a vulnerability in our criminal system which robs victims of justice and allows offenders to avoid accountability," stated Governor Susana Martinez.
"Reece's Law will provide survivors with the ability to seek restitution and make sure that criminals complete the full terms of their sentences even after the criminal justice system has failed to do so."
"Sadly, this loophole allows criminals to victimize families for years after they commit their crimes," commented Mothers Against Drunk Driving Executive Director Lora Lee Ortiz. "It's inexcusable to let these people walk away from justice before they have served their full punishment."
Reece's law and an accompanying Senate Memorial will be sponsored by Sen. Kent Cravens (R-Albuquerque).
