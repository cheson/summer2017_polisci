Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Sept. 9, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez issued the following statement today in remembrance of the victims and heroes of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On Sunday, Governor Martinez will participate in remembrance services in both Santa Fe and Albuquerque. She has also declared this Sunday "Patriot Day" across New Mexico and has ordered flags flown at half-staff from sundown on Friday, September 9 to
sundown on Sunday, September 11 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
"September 11th is a day for all of us to remember and reflect on the innocent lives lost and the selfless sacrifice we witnessed ten years ago. I encourage all New Mexicans to honor the victims and heroes of 9/11 and celebrate America's enduring compassion, courage, and resolve in the face of incredible trials and challenges," said Governor Martinez. "We are still in awe of the courageous first responders who risked everything that day to save strangers and keep their communities safe. From New Mexico and across
the country, specialized crews and aid relief streamed into New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania -- a moving testament to the compassion fostered in a free society.
Today, we still have troops fighting on the front lines around the globe to keep us safe and bring justice on behalf of the victims of 9/11. These brave men and women and their families carry the heavy burden of a nation's resolve. I urge all New Mexicans to join me in observing a day of remembrance and appreciation for the victims and heroes of 9/11 who lost their lives; thanking our military; praying for the safe return of our troops, and giving thanks for America's greatness."
