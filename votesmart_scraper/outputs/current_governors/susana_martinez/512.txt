"A Bold Agenda For Education In New Mexico"
With the last approved budget, New Mexico spends over 45.2% of state general funds on K-12 education. (Source: Legislative Finance Committee)
We must learn to use our resources more intelligently and efficiently and provide our children with an excellent education.
Out Of The Bureaucracy & Into The Classroom -- If we are asking more of our teachers, we have to give them the tools to get the job done -- that means more education dollars directly into our schools and classrooms. Today, only 61% of New Mexico's education dollars get to the classroom. We need 4% more going directly to the students in the form of the first-rate teachers, quality textbooks and the latest technology. This would mean directing more resources in the area of $74 million into the classroom. While student enrollment has increased by only 1.5% since the 2002-2003 school year, the education budget has grown $728 million dollars or 43%. We must get money out of the bloated bureaucracy and into the classroom. (Sources: New Mexico Public Education Department & Legislative Finance Committee)
Efficiency Studies For Districts -- Every year businesses undertake rigorous audits and studies to understand how their resources are being used and where those resources can be applied in a more efficient manner. Our school districts should undertake similar studies. These efficiency studies are not punitive in nature, but rather will help our school administrators better understand where and how to better allocate resources and get even more money to the classroom. The Public Education Department, working in conjunction with LFC and LESC, can take representative samples of districts with a wide cross section as a normal part of their work plan to look at efficiencies and cost savings.
