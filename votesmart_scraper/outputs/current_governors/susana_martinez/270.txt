Today Governor Susana Martinez announced that for the third year in a row New Mexico's Family Infant Toddler (FIT) Program received high marks from the U.S. Department of Education. The FIT Program provides comprehensive early intervention services including developmental, speech, physical, and occupational therapy to more than 13,000 New Mexico children from birth to the age of three.
Based on 14 performance indicators, New Mexico's program is in the highest category of "Meets Requirements." Only about 25 to 30 percent of states meet that standard.
"New Mexico's FIT program is providing young children and their families with timely early intervention services and tools all across the state. The services are typically provided where children spend their day so that they feel comfortable," said Governor Susana Martinez. "The FIT program provides activities and strategies that families can use every day to ensure children reach their full potential."
The FIT program has 34 provider agencies throughout New Mexico. The total amount of funding committed to the program this year from the New Mexico General Fund, Federal Funds, and Private Funds is $18,505,000 for FY14.
"The first three years are a critical time in a child's development and therefore it is important that referrals are made early," said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. "We encourage parents to ask their child's doctor to use a standardized developmental screening tool to track their child's development. Parents concerned about their child's development, including fine and gross motor skills, can also contact one of FIT's early intervention providers."
