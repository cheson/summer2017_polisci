Martinez Statement on DNA Lab
Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: July 16, 2010
Location: Albuquerque, NM

Candidate for Governor Susana Martinez issued the following statement today regarding the effort by Department of Public Safety to move the operations of the Albuquerque-run DNA lab.
"As governor, I will oppose efforts by the state to seize control of the DNA lab in Albuquerque and perform its operations in Santa Fe. The Albuquerque lab has identified over 50 homicide suspects and been widely praised by law enforcement, victims advocates, and elected leaders from both parties who worked to make this program a success. The Albuquerque lab has an agreement with the FBI and meets its strict guidelines. As a prosecutor, I fully appreciate the importance of reliable DNA evidence to solve crimes and convict criminals and that is why I have been such a strong supporter of this program. After a decade of success, the program is working well and should not be moved." -- Susana Martinez
NOTE: Susana Martinez was named Heart Magazine's 2007 "Woman of the Year" for her efforts advocating Katie's Law, which requires that DNA samples be taken from most suspects arrested for felonies in New Mexico. Heart Magazine praised Martinez for her "work with children's advocacy across the state of New Mexico and, indeed, with the growing awareness of Katie's Law across the country."
Katie's Law is named after Katie Sepich, who was raped and murdered in 2003. Martinez's office prosecuted her killer, who was identified by DNA two years after the murder.
