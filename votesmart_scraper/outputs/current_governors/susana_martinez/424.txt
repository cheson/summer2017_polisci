Governor Susana Martinez announced that she has issued a
proclamation declaring today, May 3, "Honoring New Mexico's Commitment and Sacrifice in the Fight Against Terrorism Day.' The proclamation was issued as a symbol of respect and gratitude to over 30,000 New Mexicans who have served in the armed forces during the United States' fight against terrorism in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, including 75 who lost their lives.
"All New Mexicans owe a debt of gratitude to our native sons and daughters who answered the call of duty to fight terrorism and protect the freedoms we treasure," said Governor Martinez. "We have scored a decisive and important victory against those who seek to undo the American way of life through violence and hate. Each of the 30,000 New Mexicans who have served their country since September 11, 2001 deserves recognition for their bravery in the face of extreme danger. For the 75 who made the ultimate sacrifice, their families and loved ones can take comfort that their service, and
their death, was not in vain. I am honored to sign this proclamation as a small sign of appreciation to all of those who have served and sacrificed in defense of our country, our values, and our freedom."
