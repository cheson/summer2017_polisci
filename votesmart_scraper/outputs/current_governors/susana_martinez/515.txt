Martinez Applauds Albuquerque Apprehensions; Enforcement Policy Working
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Aug. 9, 2010
Location: Albuquerque, NM

Susana Martinez, Republican gubernatorial nominee today issued the following statement in response to news reports that 150 individuals arrested in Albuquerque for various crimes have been identified as illegal immigrants since Mayor Richard Berry ended Albuquerque's "sanctuary city" policy for criminals. Berry ordered law enforcement officers to determine the immigration status of all arrested individuals booked into jail, regardless of race: "Just a few months ago, I applauded the actions of Mayor Richard Berry who ended the sanctuary policy for criminals in Albuquerque. As a result, 150 illegal immigrants have already been identified after being arrested for committing crimes such as DWI, theft, and violent offenses and will be reported to federal authorities. This is a common-sense reform that targets criminals, while protecting victims and witnesses. The Richardson/Denish administration have not supported this pragmatic approach as they have advocated for the policies that have made New Mexico a sanctuary for illegal immigrants by providing them driver's licenses and allowing their immigration status to remain unknown when incarcerated for committing a crime. As District Attorney in Do√±a Ana County, I understand the ramifications of the failures of both the state and federal government to address the immigration issue as my office deals with hundreds of cases related to border security each year. As governor, I will fight to repeal the law that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and end the sanctuary policy for criminals ordered by the Richardson/Denish Administration."
