Today, Governor Susana Martinez unveiled a series of powerful TV ads to
fight drunk driving on the state's roads and highways. These new ads feature New Mexico State
Police officers sharing their personal stories of coming face-to-face with the real and horrible
consequences of drunk driving, witnessing the devastating fatal crashes and having to inform
families that their loved ones have been killed. To view these new ads, visit www.endwi.com.
"Our police officers are often the first on the scene. They see firsthand -- with their own two eyes
-- the horror when someone decides to take the wheel after drinking," Governor Martinez said.
"These ads feature their stories. They are powerful and heart-wrenching. By sharing their
experiences, we hope more people will think twice before drinking and driving."
