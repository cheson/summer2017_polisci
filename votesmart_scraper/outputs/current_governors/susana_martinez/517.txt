"A Bold Agenda For Fighting Corruption"
Reduce/Eliminate Political Positions -- Over the last eight years, the number of political appointees has exploded under the Richardson/Denish Administration. We must reduce or eliminate many of these positions. We must have greater reliance on merit, qualification and experience as factors in the hiring of state government positions, rather than on political connections.
Strengthen The Governmental Conduct Act -- Currently, only legislators are required to undergo ethics training every two years. All state elected officials, political appointees and state employees should take ethics training, attending a minimum of two hours of ethics and professionalism continuing education and training each year.
Eliminate Finders Fees -- New Mexico needs a strong law eliminating the use of finder's fees in state investments. The State Investment Council has implemented a policy against this practice, but the only way to strengthen this policy is to place it in law and institute harsh penalties for violating it.
