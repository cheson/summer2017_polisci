Statement

Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement tonight after the House of Representatives passed a bill that would overturn New Mexico's policy of issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. The bill, carried by Rep. Andy Nu√±ez (DTS-Hatch), was passed by a vote of 42-28.
"Today, the will of the people of New Mexico was heard in the House of Representatives," said Governor Martinez. "Despite numerous procedural schemes to defend the status quo, a broad coalition of Republicans, Democrats, and the House's lone Independent came together to stand with an overwhelming majority of New Mexicans who want to see the dangerous practice of issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants overturned. I hope the Senate will also listen to the people of New Mexico and give this bill an up-or-down vote."
