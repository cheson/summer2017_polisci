New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Brigadier General Andrew
Salas, the Adjutant General, released the following joint statement today, regarding an attack on New Mexico Guard Soldiers serving in Egypt's Sinai peninsula:
"This afternoon, we received reports from Egypt that violent and armed protestors attacked and attempted to gain entry to the headquarters of the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai where New Mexico National Guard Soldiers are serving alongside other U.S. and Coalition Military troops. Early reports from the unit indicate that the attack was beaten back, and though a few coalition troops from other countries sustained injuries, we have been told that no U.S. Soldiers were injured. Appropriate force protection measures have been initiated by the command. We will continue to monitor the situation in northern Egypt and will communicate with the families of our Soldiers about further developments as they become available to us. New Mexico National Guard Soldiers are well trained, highly skilled and equipped to complete their mission; we appreciate their sacrifice and service during this difficult time, as conflict and violence has entered into their peacekeeping efforts. Our prayers are with our New Mexico soldiers in Egypt and their families, as well as with all other military personnel who are protecting our freedom throughout the world."
The mission of the Multinational Force and Observers is to oversee the arrangements for securing the Sinai as agreed to by Israel and Egypt in their 1979 peace treaty.
