Spending by visitors to New Mexico increased by 7 percent in 2013 and overall tourism increased, according to data released Monday by the governor's office.
The new figures for 2013 show that the state's leisure and hospitality industry created 1,700 new jobs. A record 32.2 million people traveled to the state last year, according to the data.
"Tourism is a strong economic driver and a critical component of the diverse economy we are working to create in communities throughout New Mexico," said Governor Susana Martinez. "More people are experiencing the adventure and beauty of New Mexico and spending more money while they're here. This leads to new jobs and growth in cities, towns and villages throughout the state."
Since 2010, the state has seen an increase in visitor spending of more than 24 percent, and overnight trips are up by 38 percent.
The Tourism Department said it is seeing encouraging signs that this momentum will continue through 2014, due in part to the fact that statewide lodging receipts through May 2014 are up 6.1 percent over last year and gross receipts accommodations taxes are up 6.4 percent through the first quarter of 2014.
