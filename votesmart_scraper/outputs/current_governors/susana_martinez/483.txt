Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Feb. 3, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez announced today that she has signed two
Executive Orders in response to extreme cold weather and natural gas outages across the state and outlined a few steps that New Mexicans can take to help in the response to current situations. The Governor has declared a State of Emergency in New Mexico and has also suspended regulations on the number of hours that propane suppliers may drive in order to more rapidly move liquid petroleum gas into and across the state.
In addition, Governor Martinez released from work all non-essential state employees today and ordered all state buildings to turn down thermostats to conserve energy. She also urged New Mexicans to limit their use of electrical appliances and also turn down their thermostats to collectively reduce the demand for natural gas. The Governor noted that increased use of electricity has the potential to further inhibit the flow of natural gas
to communities in New Mexico. New Mexicans who are not facing emergencies but who need assistance in dealing with the cold weather or in finding the nearest shelter should call local police and fire department non-emergency phone numbers.
