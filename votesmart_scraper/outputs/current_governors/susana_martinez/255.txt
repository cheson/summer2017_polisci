"On this 12th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, we join New Mexicans and Americans of all walks of life to mourn and remember the victims who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, and the families they left behind.
"We also honor the brave men and women who serve in all branches of our United States
military, volunteering to protect and secure our nation.
"Each and every day, thousands of firefighters and law enforcement officials patrol our streets and man fire stations, ready to protect our citizens across New Mexico. They devote their careers and make tremendous sacrifices to ensure that our communities are safe and protected.
"Because of ordinary people whom do extraordinary things, the United States will always serve as a beacon of freedom and liberty.
"May God bless the United States of America."
