Governor Susana Martinez today kicked off the W82TXT‟ campaign, which seeks to discourage New Mexicans from texting while driving. The public awareness campaign, sponsored by 2KASA Fox and sister station KRQE News 13 in partnership with the Office of the Governor and the New Mexico Department of Public Transportation, is a statewide grassroots effort that asks New Mexicans to take a pledge against distracted driving.
"This campaign is an important reminder that texting while driving can have devastating consequences," said Governor Martinez. "New Mexico‟s drivers must know that they are putting themselves and others at risk when they allow themselves to be distracted on our roads. We must make all New Mexicans aware of the dangers of distracted driving and encourage them not to send or read text messages while behind the wheel of a car."
According to the New Mexico Department of Transportation, studies show that those who text while driving are 23 times more likely to be involved in a critical safety event resulting in severe injury, dismemberment, brain damage, or death. Additionally, NMDOT reports that over 20 percent of fatal car accidents involving teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 were the result of cell phone usage, with that figure expected to grow. A Harvard study estimated that cell phone activity contributes to 636 motor vehicle crashes, 330,000 injuries, and 2,600 fatalities each year, and almost half of all drivers between the ages of 18 and 24 text while driving.
"2KASA‟s W82TXT campaign is a new initiative to promote safe driving by asking New Mexico to literally wait to text," said 2KASA/ KRQE NEWS 13 president and general manager Bill Anderson. "We are proud to partner with the Governor‟s office and the New Mexico Department of Transportation to shed light on this important issue through news stories, social media, and public events in the coming months."
2KASA and KRQE News 13 will distribute W82TXT‟ thumb bands at events throughout the summer, reminding New Mexicans to put their phones away while driving. 2KASA, KRQE News 13, and Clear Channel Communications will also implement a multi-media public service announcement campaign that includes television, radio, and billboard ads featuring Governor Martinez and numerous other community figures.
