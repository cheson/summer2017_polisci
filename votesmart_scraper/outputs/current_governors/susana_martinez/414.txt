Governor Susana Martinez today once again called on New Mexicans to
refrain from using personal fireworks this summer as crews battle wildfires across the state. While the Administration exercised its full authority to ban the use of all fireworks on state and private wild lands on April 22nd and several municipal and county governments have also enacted bans, fireworks are still permitted in many areas across the state. State law does not allow the Governor to ban fireworks by executive order.
"There is absolutely no reason to buy, sell, or use personal fireworks in New Mexico this summer," said Governor Martinez. "The potential consequences are simply too severe and the patriotic thing to do this 4th of July is to attend a public fireworks display, or celebrate the 4th fireworks free."
As of today, extreme dry conditions have contributed to 987 fires that have burned nearly 712,000 acres of land across all jurisdictions in New Mexico.
The Governor says it is critical that New Mexicans refrain from using fireworks,
discarding cigarettes, using open flames for any purpose, or taking any other action that might set brush or any other vegetation on fire. "Preventing additional fires this summer will require all of us to be vigilant and responsible," Governor Martinez concluded.
