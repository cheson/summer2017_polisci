Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced that Seamless Medical Systems, a high-tech start-up company, is creating up to 30 new jobs in the next two years with an average annual salary of $90,000. Governor Martinez also announced proposals to attract and develop new research, innovation, and high-tech firms in New Mexico by expanding the use of the Angel Investment Credit and investing $1 million in the Technology Research Collaborative (TRC).
"When small business innovators and entrepreneurs thrive, our economy thrives," said Governor Susana Martinez. "We're proud that innovators like Seamless Medical are helping us to further diversify our economy. Results like these show how important it is that we continue to foster innovation and entrepreneurship to help new ideas and opportunities get off the ground right here in New Mexico."
Angel investors provide capital to start-up companies, helping them get off the ground. Governor Martinez's proposal would increase the total amount of annual credits that may be issued from $750,000 to $2 million, as well as clarify the number of investments that may qualify, extend the sunset provision, and increase the carry forward to five years. The Governor also proposed to invest $1 million in the TRC allows teams of researchers to compete for funding to support the development and commercialization of innovative ideas and products -- so that they can be brought to market in our state. The TRC requires that each project it reviews and funds be a collaboration between a national laboratory and a research university in our state.
"As a founder of a healthcare technology company I have found New Mexico to be a supportive environment," said David Perez, founder and CEO of Seamless Medical Systems. "The Angel Tax Credit is an incentive that helped me raise $2 million of capital from New Mexicans. Now, Seamless Medical is on a rapid growth trajectory."
Seamless Medical Systems is a mobile medical technology company, founded in 2011 in Santa Fe. Seamless developed the first iPad-based patient registration form for replacing clipboard forms in doctor and hospital waiting rooms.
