Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez announced today that she has appointed former
New Mexico Supreme Court Justice Paul Kennedy of Albuquerque to the vacant
Supreme Court position created by the retirement of Justice Patricio Serna. Kennedy, a former Marine, has practiced law for 36 years. Early in his legal career, Kennedy served as a public defender in Albuquerque at both the state and federal levels. He then went on to build a successful private law practice handling both civil and criminal cases. In addition to his extensive trial experience, Kennedy has handled more than 75 appeals. He previously served on the state's highest court in 2002. In 2005, Kennedy served as counsel to the bipartisan House special committee on impeachment of then state treasurer, Robert Vigil, who resigned before official impeachment proceedings and was later indicted. Kennedy was one of two individuals sent to the Governor for consideration by a judicial nominating commission.
"Mr. Kennedy brings a unique list of accomplishments to the bench. As a former
Supreme Court Justice, a public defender, and an experienced trial and appellate lawyer, I'm certain that Mr. Kennedy will fairly and faithfully uphold the law on behalf of all New Mexicans," said Governor Martinez.
Kennedy, who earned a Fulbright Scholarship, graduated with a degree in International Relations with a certificate in Latin American Studies from St. Joseph's University and earned his law degree from Georgetown University Law Center.
