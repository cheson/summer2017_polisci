Statement

Location: Santa Fe, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced an expansion of Healthy Kids
New Mexico, a series of initiatives designed to provide families, children, and communities
throughout the state with more resources and education for healthier eating and more active
lifestyles. Through more efficient use of federal funding, the New Mexico Department of Health
(DOH) will expand participation in Healthy Kids New Mexico from nine counties to 18, and
from two tribal communities to eight.
"Fighting childhood obesity is a battle we can and must win," said Governor Martinez. "A
healthier diet and more exercise can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and help kids learn in the
classroom. Giving more of our kids opportunities to eat healthy and get active will lay a stronger
foundation for them to succeed."
