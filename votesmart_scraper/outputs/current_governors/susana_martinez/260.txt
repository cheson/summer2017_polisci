Governor Susana Martinez announced today that her administration is creating a new position that will be dedicated to coordinating services, research, and public awareness of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Martinez wants to provide help and support to family caregivers who often feel isolated and alone.
Martinez says more than 31,000 New Mexicans have Alzheimer's disease and the number is expected to increase to 43,000 by 2025.
"This new position will allow for better communication and more collaboration between all the organizations and individuals already working with people with Alzheimer's and related dementias. Too often, we hear that families don't know where to turn or what to do next when they get a diagnosis," said Governor Martinez. "Families, who often face this terrible disease in isolation, will know that they are not alone, and that there is a clear path for help."
The Alzheimer's position will be housed at the Aging and Long-Term Services Department and will report directly to that agency's Cabinet Secretary.
The creation of the Alzheimer's coordinator position is just one part of a statewide plan Governor Martinez unveiled today to confront the growing challenge posed by Alzheimer's disease. The New Mexico State Plan for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias is the result of 18 months of work by the Aging and Long-Term Services Department, New Mexico Department of Health, and more than 60 stakeholders including the Alzheimer's Association, New Mexico Chapter.

The State Plan for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias lays out goals, and then prescribes strategies to meet them. Martinez says the new Alzheimer's position will be in charge of executing the plan, focusing on five key areas:
