Governor Susana Martinez Establishes Child Advocacy Center Pilot Program in Valencia County
Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: April 4, 2014
Location: Los Lumas, NM

Governor Susana Martinez this week signed an executive order establishing a child
advocacy center pilot program in Valencia County to enable better coordination between CYFD
caseworkers, law enforcement, and community partners who work on child maltreatment cases.
Child advocacy centers house a variety of non-profit and public partners all dedicated to
supporting children who have been victims of abuse; they can include law enforcement officers,
child forensic interviewers, sexual assault nurse examiners, various social service organizations,
and child abuse caseworkers.
"This model of bringing together a diverse team of trained and dedicated professionals will help
keep more of our children safe," said Governor Martinez. "Emphasizing the team approach will
help improve communication and information sharing, so these professionals can better protect
the children and families they serve."
Valencia County is one of the highest-risk and highest-need areas of the state for child welfare
services; the Governor's executive order directs state agencies to establish and staff a child
advocacy center in Los Lunas, where the Henry Perea Building has been identified as a suitable
location and local partners exist to help provide comprehensive child welfare services.
Additionally, Governor Martinez has directed CYFD to work with local partners in other New
Mexico communities to identify areas where it would be feasible and helpful to establish
additional child advocacy centers.
