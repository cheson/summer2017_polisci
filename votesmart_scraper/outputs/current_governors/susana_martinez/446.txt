Governor Susana Martinez Signs School Breakfast Bill
Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: April 2, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez announced today that she has signed Senate
Bill 144, establishing a school breakfast program in schools where at least 85 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-cost lunch. The legislation does not increase the amount of money appropriated for school meals, but will provide an increased flow of federal matching funds.
"No child should start the school day hungry," said Governor Martinez. "Every child in New Mexico has a right to a positive learning environment and this law will help ensure more students are better able to concentrate on learning, with no additional cost to New Mexico taxpayers."
