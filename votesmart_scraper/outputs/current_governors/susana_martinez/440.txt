Governor Susana Martinez Signs New Mexico Chile Advertising Act
Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: April 5, 2011
Location: Hatch, NM

Governor Susana Martinez visited Hatch today to sign House Bill 485, the
New Mexico Chile Advertising Act. Sponsored by Rep. Andy Nu単ez (DTS-Hatch), the legislation makes it illegal to advertise any product as New Mexico chile unless those chiles are grown in the state. Governor Martinez was joined by Rep. Nu単ez, Sen. George Mu単oz (D-Gallup), and other state and local officials at the Pepper Pot Restaurant in Hatch this morning.
"New Mexico's chiles are a core part of the culture and economy of our state," said Governor Martinez. "This bill ensures that people around the world know that the best chile comes from the Land of Enchantment. New Mexicans may still have to think long and hard to answer the official state question - "red or green?' - but with this legislation, at least they won't have to wonder whether their chile is grown right here in New Mexico."
"People all over the country advertise New Mexico chile -- whether it's genuine or not," said Rep. Nu単ez. "This law makes it easier to protect one of our state's most treasured products and preserve the good name of our world-class chiles."
