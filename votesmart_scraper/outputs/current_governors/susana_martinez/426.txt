Press Release

Location: Farmington, NM

Governor Susana Martinez visited Farmington today to meet with
superintendents from northwest New Mexico and recognize them for the decisions
they've made to preserve classroom spending in their school districts as they assemble
their budgets for the upcoming fiscal year.
Speaking at an event at Piedra Vista High School honoring Advanced Placement
students, as well as their families and teachers, Governor Martinez remarked,
"Prioritizing dollars to the classroom is the first critical step in ensuring that our children
receive the world-class education they deserve. When we put our kids first, New Mexico
wins, and I'm encouraged to stand with superintendents who share my commitment to
protecting classroom spending."
Superintendents Janel Ryan of Farmington, Kirk Carpenter of Aztec, Joe Rasor of
Bloomfield, and Greg Epperson of Central Consolidated Schools have all pledged that
their budgets for the upcoming fiscal year will trim only administrative costs and
preserve funding to classrooms in their districts.
Yesterday, Governor Martinez signed an executive order that created a task force that
will begin New Mexico's move to a performance-based education system that will better
identify, recruit, reward and retain outstanding teachers. As part of the Governor's
initiatives to reform New Mexico's schools, she has signed legislation that allows for
schools to be graded on an understandable A-F grading scale, requires disclosure of
school district finances on the state's Sunshine Portal, and increases state funding to
public schools by $56 million.
"When we increase transparency and accountability in our schools, when we reward and
retain teachers who help our children achieve, and when we focus dollars in the
classroom, we put our children first," Governor Martinez concluded, "Secretary Hanna
Skandera and I are committed to working with superintendents, teachers, parents and
community leaders throughout the state to keep money in the classroom and implement
meaningful reform that will turn New Mexico's schools around. Our children deserve
nothing less."
