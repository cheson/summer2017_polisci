Implement Cooling Off Period -- Legislators and members of a Martinez Administration will be prohibited from lobbying for two-years after leaving the legislature or leaving the administration. By implementing a two-year waiting period before legislators and members of the executive can become lobbyists, it will ensure that we close any revolving doors and ensure there have been no inappropriate relationships between those in decision-making positions and those seeking to do business with the state. Currently legislators are excluded from this provision in the Governmental Conduct Act.
Limit Government Lobbying -- Currently, state agencies are allowed to utilize the services of paid lobbyists to advocate for or against bills during a legislative session. No department or agency should be allowed to use taxpayer funds to lobby the legislature. Cabinet officials and departments of government have many talented individuals who are experts in their field. As a savings to state government these secretaries, deputy secretaries or department heads should be the advocates for their agencies in front of the legislature, not paid contract lobbyists.
