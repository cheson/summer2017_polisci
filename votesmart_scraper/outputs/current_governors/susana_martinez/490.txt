Governor Susana Martinez Invites New Mexicans to Submit Ideas for Cutting Spending
Press Release

Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez announced today that she is inviting all New Mexicans to submit their ideas to cut waste and reduce the size of government by sending an e-mail directly to the Governor's office. Anyone interested in submitting a proposal can do so by writing to:
CutWasteTips@state.nm.us
"If we are going to balance the budget and restore prosperity in New Mexico, we will have to work together to identify and eliminate unnecessary costs," said Governor Martinez. "I welcome ideas from my fellow New Mexicans as we work in the coming days and weeks to pass a balanced budget. From day one, my administration has been committed to listening to the people we serve. Today, I am asking for their help as we work to cut wasteful spending, reduce the size of government, and put our state back on track."
Since taking office, Governor Martinez has ordered cuts across the executive branch of state government, including eliminating two chef positions and cutting salaries by 55 percent at the governor's mansion, as well as trimming cabinet salaries by at least ten percent. On Monday, the Governor introduced a balanced budget proposal that trims government and eliminates inefficiencies, but protects classroom spending and health care for those most in need -- all without raising taxes on a single New Mexican.
