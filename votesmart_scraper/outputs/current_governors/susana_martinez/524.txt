"A Bold Agenda For Fighting Corruption"
Public corruption is a serious crime and must be treated as such. We must strengthen our enforcement mechanisms and provide real consequences for corruption. There will be zero tolerance for violating the public trust in a Martinez Administration.
Failure To Report --Elected officials have a responsibility to the public to report crimes of violating the public trust. Failure to report these acts should be a crime.
Loss Of Contract Status/Lobbyist Registration --Lifetime ban for any contractor of the state or lobbyist convicted of violating the public trust.
Public Corruption Division --A new Public Corruption Division should be created within the New Mexico State Police. The division will be charged with collecting tips from the public on government corruption through a new public corruption hotline, investigating acts that violate the public trust and referring any cases for prosecution to the proper authority.
Harsh Sentences For Public Corruption --For public officials or public employees convicted of violating the public trust, the sentence should be severe. For each of these individuals they should face harsh felony consequences along with minimum mandatory imprisonment.
Increased Penalties --For any elected official or public employee convicted of violating the public trust for personal gain, they must surrender their accrued pensions as well as face a fine not greater than their salary.
Elected Official Removal From Office --Those convicted of a crime for any felony or crime of moral turpitude, while serving in office should be immediately removed from office upon conviction and barred from elective office for life.
