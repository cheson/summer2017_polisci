Press Release

Location: Santa Fe, NM

Today Governor Susana Martinez announced New Mexico's first-of-its-kind state wellness program designed to improve health outcomes and save taxpayer dollars. Under Governor Martinez's initiative, State & Local Public Body (LPB) employees, spouses, and domestic partners who have medical coverage with New Mexico's Group Benefits Plan will have easy access to wellness check-ups and screenings.
"This is an important step in adapting to the challenges presented by health care reform," said Governor Susana Martinez. "As health care costs continue to rise nationally, taking a proactive approach to providing preventative care helps us reduce health care costs due to injuries and chronic diseases and illnesses. This will keep our families and communities healthier and save taxpayer dollars. Innovations like this show how New Mexico continues to lead through the health care challenges we face."
Beginning this month, the State of New Mexico will bring wellness checkups to employees near their place of work. Eligible employees will be able to schedule a 45 minute health evaluation by a licensed Nurse Practitioner (NP) and health technician, provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield's partner, Catapult Health. These appointments will include laboratory-accurate testing such as cholesterol and glucose levels, height, weight, blood pressure, and others, and will then be reviewed onsite with participants by the NP. These screenings can help identify health problems such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and others.
