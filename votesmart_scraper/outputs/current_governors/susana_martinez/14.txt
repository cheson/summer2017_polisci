Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced that more students than ever before are taking Advanced Placement classes and earning college credit as a result of passing the end-of-course exams. In addition, New Mexico is also a national leader in AP access for low-income students and year-over-year percentage growth in students taking AP exams.
"AP courses are some of the most challenging courses our high school students can take," Governor Martinez said. "Results like these show yet again that our students and teachers have limitless potential to succeed together -- when challenged to meet high standards, they always rise to the occasion. We need to continue to do all we can to raise the bar for our students and give them access to more opportunities like AP coursework."
AP classes are rigorous, university-level courses that give students the opportunity to earn college credit while still in high school. According to the College Board, which administers the AP program nationally, New Mexico ranks 2nd in the nation for year-over-year percentage growth in the number of students taking an AP exam and the number of AP exams taken. In addition, New Mexico ranks 4th in the nation in providing AP access to low-income students.
In 2016, New Mexico students took more than 5,500 AP exams, and earned nearly 17,000 potential college credits. At an average of $212.33 per credit hour, New Mexico's students and families could save as much $3.55 million on college costs.
"New Mexico's students are rising to the challenge, and their hard work is paying off," said New Mexico Secretary of Education Hanna Skandera. "Our students and schools across this state aremaking progress, which is why it's so important that we continue to implement and invest in reforms that send money directly into the classroom."
Governor Martinez continues to expand access to AP courses for New Mexico's students. These include investing more than $4 million to support AP programs in New Mexico, offering more training for AP teachers, and investing in more online AP courses so more rural and underserved students can access the program.
