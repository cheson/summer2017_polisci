Getting Our Books in Order and Demanding of State Government What Families and Businesses Expect of Themselves
Under the Richardson/Denish Administration, government spending grew over 50%. From using taxpayer-funded chefs and private jets for the governor to raiding the children's permanent fund, Diane Denish oversaw an administration that went on a wild spending spree with taxpayers footing the bill.
I oppose raising taxes to solve the budget mess as it will hinder economic growth and instead support cutting wasteful spending with real, noticeable belt tightening in state government. I believe budget problems are created by poor financial decisions and little to no planning. In good economic years, I will make sure money is put away in a rainy-day fund for down economic times, while refunding taxpayers their hard-earned dollars to stimulate and grow the economy.
As governor, I will immediately work to restore sanity to the budgetary process by eliminating programs that don't work and bolstering programs that achieve results. Real and consistent focus will be placed on the relationship between revenue and spending with a goal of achieving in state government what families and businesses achieve every year -- a balanced budget that focuses on priorities and saves for the future.
