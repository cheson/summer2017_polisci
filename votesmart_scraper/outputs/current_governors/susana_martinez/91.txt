Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Dec. 3, 2015
Location: Albuquerque, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez unveiled the National Hispanic Cultural
Center as the first-ever New Mexico theater to showcase Heart Gallery children before every
film and other performances. Heart Galleries feature foster children who are available for
adoption and help them find forever families. There are more than 500 Children, Youth, and
Families Department (CYFD) foster children statewide who are currently available for adoption,
with 180 in Bernalillo County alone.
"Every child needs and deserves a loving family," said Governor Martinez. "Heart Galleries are
such a wonderful way for us to help introduce kids to forever families. And with nearly 270,000
people visiting the National Hispanic Cultural Center every year, this will be an excellent
opportunity to show an even wider audience these wonderful children."
