"A Bold Agenda For Fighting Corruption"
Campaign Report Examinations -- Currently, the Secretary of State must examine 10% of all campaign reports at random. These examinations should be posted online with a report of how many were conducted, what discrepancies were discovered and what is being done to remedy the problems that were uncovered.
Increased Campaign Reporting -- Campaign contributions too often fly under the radar in New Mexico, with too much time between reporting cycles, especially in non-election years. To help increase transparency we need to move to a year-round, real-time campaign reporting system. This will help to identify who is giving to campaigns and who is receiving, helping to root-out pay-to-play issues.
