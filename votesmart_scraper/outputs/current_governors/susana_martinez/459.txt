Press Release

Location: Silver City, NM

Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement applauding the House of Representatives for unanimously passing House Bill 378, legislation that would impose stricter penalties for public corruption. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Nate Gentry (R-Albuquerque), will increase jail sentences for public officials who are convicted of corruption, prohibit them from lobbying or doing business with the state, and force corrupt officials to forfeit their state pensions.
"The law must be clear that those who abuse the public trust for personal gain will be punished," said Governor Martinez. "Public officials are not above the law. By increasing jail time for corrupt public officials, prohibiting them from lobbying and doing business with the state, and forcing them to forfeit their state pensions, we are sending a clear signal that everyone must play by the same rules in New Mexico. Corruption is a crime, not an ethical dilemma, and it has no place in our government. I thank Rep. Gentry for his
leadership on this important measure and Rep. Park for his hard work in guiding this bill through the Judiciary Committee."
Sen. Sue Wilson Beffort and Sen. Bill Payne are also carrying legislation in the Senate that would impose stricter penalties on public corruption.
