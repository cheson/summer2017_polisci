Today, Governor Susana Martinez and Attorney General Gary King urged members of the New Mexico Legislature to quickly hear and pass legislation that would bring New Mexico into compliance with the federal Adam Walsh Act by tightening sex offender registration and notification laws. The Governor and Attorney General are supporting HB 179, which has yet to be heard in any House committee. Currently, it is scheduled to have a hearing in the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee tomorrow morning.
The language in HB 179 is based on recommendations that were sought from the Department of Justice by the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, regarding the changes that needed to be made in New Mexico law to move toward federal compliance.
"Protecting New Mexico's children and making our communities safer should be a shared priority for all lawmakers," said Governor Martinez. "This legislation will not only require registration for a broader set of sex crimes, but it will help provide law enforcement greater tools for cracking down on sex offenders through federal grant funds. I strongly urge the legislature to take quick action on this bipartisan legislation so we can take critical steps that will help keep our kids safe."
The New Mexico Sheriffs' and Police Association has expressed its support for the legislation as
well.
"This legislation is critical to law enforcement's efforts to keep tabs on sex offenders and keep them away from kids," added Jack LeVick of the New Mexico Sheriffs' and Police Association.
"We are committed to keeping New Mexico's communities safe, but it's important that lawmakers provide law enforcement with the necessary tools to complete our mission."
