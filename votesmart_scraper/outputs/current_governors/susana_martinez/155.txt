Governor Susana Martinez today announced more than $1 million in funding for the first five projects to be selected for funding under the 2014 River Stewards Initiative. During the most recent legislative session, the Governor secured $2.5 million in funding for River Stewards, an important program designed to restore and protect New Mexico's precious rivers and streams. "In the face of unprecedented wildfires, flooding, and drought, it is more important than ever that we look after our rivers and watersheds to secure our water supply, protect our environment, and support local economies," said Governor Martinez. "These projects will demonstrate how our communities can use River Stewards funds to improve and safeguard our critical water resources." River Stewards funds projects that improve surface water quality and river habitat statewide. The River Stewards Initiative is now in the process of awarding funds to projects that will clear vegetation in river areas, lower river banklines, replant native species vegetation, revitalize wetlands, and install erosion control.
The first five communities to be awarded funds for 2014 through Governor Martinez's initiative are:
-Las Vegas: $287,000 to improve drinking water quality and reduce the flooding impact of the Gallinas River on private property in Las Vegas;
-Silver City: $148,000 to reduce the urban runoff of San Vicente Creek;
-Raton: $150,000 to rehabilitate Segerstrom Creek and improve drinking water quality following the Track Wildfire;
-Santa Rosa: $174,000 to improve stream habitat on El Rito Creek; and,
