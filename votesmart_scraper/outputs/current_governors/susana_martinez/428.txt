Governor Susana Martinez announced today that Department of Public

Mexico State Police. Before being named acting chief in January 2011, Shilling most
recently served as the Law Enforcement Budget Director and Commander of

"Mr. Shilling's extensive record of service within the State Police makes him the ideal
choice for the chief position," said Governor Martinez. "He is well-known in the world of
law enforcement for his expertise in executing successful criminal and narcotics
investigations. Secretary Eden, Chief Shilling and I share an unwavering commitment to
keeping New Mexicans safe and I look forward to continuing to work closely with the
State Police under his direction."
A native of New Mexico, Robert Shilling began his career in law enforcement as an
officer with the Silver City Police Department. He joined the New Mexico State Police as
a patrol officer in 1992 and went on to serve as task supervisor for the Southwestern New
Mexico Drug Task Force. Following that, he served as an assistant commander for
Narcotics Investigations as well as assistant commander for Criminal Investigations.
Upon earning the rank of Captain in 2007, Shilling was named the commander of
Criminal Investigations. In 2008, he was promoted to Major and was named the Bureau
Chief for the Law Enforcement Records Bureau. Last year, he was named Law
Enforcement Budget Director as well as Commander of Investigations before taking over
duties as acting chief in 2011.
