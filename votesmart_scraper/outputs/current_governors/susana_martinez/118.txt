Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Aug. 10, 2015
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez declared a state of emergency in response to
the massive 3 million gallon waste spill in the Animas River in Colorado that EPA officials have
admitted to causing. The Governor toured the spill by helicopter and met with local officials in
San Juan County on Saturday. The day before, Governor Martinez established a multi-agency
response team that has been assisting affected communities, and New Mexico Environment
Department Secretary Ryan Flynn issued emergency orders allowing for additional hazardous
waste funding to be made available to assist with response efforts.
In addition to declaring a state of emergency today, the Governor is also directing the multiagency
team to remain in northwest New Mexico for an indefinite period of time to provide onthe-ground
support as residents and community leaders respond to the realities of this spill in the
coming days.
"I had the chance to see the spill with my own eyes. It is absolutely devastating, and I am
heartbroken by this environmental catastrophe," Governor Martinez said. "As I've said before, I
am very concerned by EPA's lack of communication and inability to provide accurate
information. One day, the spill is 1 million gallons. The next, it's 3 million. New Mexicans
deserve answers we can rely on."
Martinez continued, "I want New Mexicans to know that we are committed to working around
the clock to keep local communities informed and protected, and providing whatever resources
we can to assist communities in the affected area."
