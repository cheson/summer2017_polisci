Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Oct. 7, 2015
Location: Albuquerque, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced that tourism in 2014
generated the largest economic impact in state history, injecting $6.1 billion into New Mexico's
economy and supporting nearly 89,000 jobs.
"Tourism plays a critical role in diversifying our state's economy. When more people visit New
Mexico, more dollars go directly into our communities, and that results in more jobs and better
opportunities for our families," Governor Martinez said. "Earlier this year, we announced yet
another record-breaking year for tourism. And now I'm proud to say that the direct impact that
tourism has on our state's economy is greater than we've ever seen before."
