Today, Governor Susana Martinez unveiled a sweeping new energy policy
and implementation plan for the State of New Mexico, entitled: "Seizing our Energy Potential:
Creating a More Diverse Economy in New Mexico." Among other things, the blueprint calls for
an "all of the above" approach to energy development that promotes the production of all sources
of energy as a means of creating jobs, diversifying a key sector of our economy, and supporting
our nation's efforts to achieve energy independence.
"New Mexico is one of the most energy-rich and energy-diverse states in the nation, and we have
an excellent opportunity to utilize this position to grow our economy and create more jobs," said
Governor Martinez. "Improving our energy infrastructure, responsibly developing and producing
energy of all types, and better preparing our workforce for the needs of our energy sector are all
critical components not only of a strong economic future, but of helping lead America to energy
independence."
