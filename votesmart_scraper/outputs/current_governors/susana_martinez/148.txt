Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced her Fiscal Year 2016 budget proposal, which continues the Governor's commitment to responsible budgeting and targets funding toward initiatives designed to grow the State's economy and improve the education and general well-being of New Mexico children.
According to the latest meeting of the consensus revenue forecast committee, projected revenues exceed this year's spending -- by roughly $141 million, and due to proper spending restraint, the State's current reserve level stands at roughly 10 percent.
The Governor's $6.29 billion budget proposal, which represents an increase in recurring state spending of 2.3% (or $141 million), can be found online on the Governor's website at www.governor.state.nm.us.
"This budget targets and prioritizes helping our kids learn, ensuring that our children and families are safe, and creating a diverse economy and additional jobs throughout New Mexico," said Governor Martinez. "Since taking office and working with the Legislature to resolve the state's largest structural deficit, we've taken a responsible approach to spending that prioritizes available dollars on reform in education and improving economic growth. I am confident that we will once again be able to come to agreement with the Legislature on a responsible budget that continues to prioritize these
critical goals and keep moving New Mexico forward."
The Governor's FY 2016 budget includes:
ï‚· $68 million in new funding to support the needs of New Mexico's public school classrooms and students. This represents 48% of the Governor's proposed total new recurring spending.
