Governor Susana Martinez Announces Initiative to Keep More Kids in School
Press Release

Location: Albuquerque, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced a statewide initiative aimed at
keeping more kids in school and on track to graduate. At West Mesa High School in Albuquerque,
the Governor announced $3.8 million to hire nearly 60 dropout coaches and social workers for
schools across New Mexico.
"I firmly believe that every child can learn, regardless of their background, and I am committed to
providing them with the tools they need to succeed in the classroom," Governor Martinez said. "By
putting dropout coaches and social workers in our schools, we provide our students with a stronger
support network that will help them stay in class and on track to graduate. Our kids deserve nothing
less."
The positions will be placed in middle and high schools in 21 districts and charter schools across
New Mexico to keep kids in school, reduce truancy, and help more students graduate.
The funding for each position is through a grant process with the New Mexico Public Education
Department. Districts and charter schools receiving the grant funding demonstrated both the highest
needs in reducing truancy, as well as a clear plan for using the new staff.
New Mexico was recognized earlier this year by the U.S. Department of Education for having the 3rd
fastest growing graduation rate in the country, at more than triple the national average. These new
positions will help New Mexico's schools continue that momentum.
