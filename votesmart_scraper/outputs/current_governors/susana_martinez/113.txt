Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced the grand prize winners of this year's New Mexico True Summer Reading Challenge, a program that encourages kids to read over the summer. The Governor surprised two of the winners by stopping in their classrooms and personally handing them their prizes at Chaparral Elementary School in Santa Fe and Pi√±on Elementary School in White Rock. Tomorrow, the Governor will announce the top prize: an allexpense-paid family vacation to Disney's Animal Kingdom in Orlando.
"Knowing how to read is the very foundation of learning. Once our kids learn to read, they read
to learn. And that is a skill they will need for the rest of their lives," said Governor Martinez.
"We started this program three years ago because we wanted a fun way to encourage children to
read over the summer months, and I am so proud of every kiddo who stepped up to the
challenge."
This year's challenge, designed to help students from losing reading skills during the summer,
was open to all New Mexico elementary school children, ages 5 to 12, and ran from May 6 to
July 31. All students who submitted a completed log showing that they read six books will
receive a New Mexico True bookmark and a certificate recognizing their accomplishment.
Students who read 12 or more books and submitted a short essay explaining why they love New
Mexico will receive a New Mexico True bookmark, a certificate recognizing their
accomplishment, and were entered in the random drawing to win one of the Grand Prizes.
