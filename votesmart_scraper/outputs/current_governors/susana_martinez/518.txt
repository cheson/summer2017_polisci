Web Casting Of Meetings -- All meetings of the legislature that are Web cast should be archived online, bringing people closer to the workings of state government regardless of where they live. Recently, the legislature opened their doors for the first time to live broadcasts of their meetings online to help people watch and listen to the legislature in action. The governor and executive branch of government should follow their lead and open up meetings of executive boards and commissions to the public by streaming them online.
Create An Online Real-Time Checkbook -- If New Mexico is to become truly transparent, our online checkbook must have real-time information, similar to the award winning operation created by Missouri. Transparency at all levels of state government is necessary, but especially so in our budgeting and spending process.
Contracts Online -- All government contracts should be available online in an easy-to-search database. Currently only state contracts of $20,000 or greater are posted online.
