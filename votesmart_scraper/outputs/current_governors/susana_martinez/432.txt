Governor Susana Martinez Statement on Tax Day
Press Release
By: Susana Martinez

Location: Las Cruces, NW

Governor Susana Martinez today made the following statement on Tax Day, the day that typically marks the deadline that American taxpayers must have their tax returns submitted to the federal government.
"Today is a reminder of the burden that New Mexico taxpayers face each and every year," said Governor Martinez. "Unfortunately, while Tax Day is filled with symbolism, New Mexico's families and small businesses feel the financial drain and uncertainty caused year-round when the federal government attempts to take more and more money out of their pockets to fund out-of-control spending. Both our state and federal tax system should encourage small businesses to grow and hire, allow families to prosper, and permit New Mexicans to keep more of their hard-earned money.
"That's why I'm fighting hard against big government and excessive taxes. The budget that I just signed is a symbol of our priorities -- it cuts spending, preserves classroom funding and healthcare for the most vulnerable, and it does not raise taxes on a single New Mexican. And, as promised, I vetoed every tax increase sent to my desk. New Mexico's economy simply cannot turn the corner when families and employers face the uncertainty and financial hardship caused by high taxes and runaway spending. I will continue to fight against government excess as we work to cut spending, put our state back on sound fiscal footing, and create a business-friendly environment that allows for economic growth and job creation."
