Martinez Statement on Newly-Released Employment Numbers
Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: July 20, 2010
Location: Albuquerque, NM

Susana Martinez, Republican gubernatorial nominee today released the following statement in response to state employment numbers issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:
"Today's jobs report confirms what we already understand to be reality, the Richardson/Denish Administration has failed miserably on the top issue confronting our state: job creation. For months, Diane Denish has tried to avoid any criticism related to an administration she helped lead for the last eight years, while disingenuously claiming credit for its few successes. New Mexicans understand we can't simply continue on the same track and we need to turn things around. We need new leadership that will shake up the status quo and deliver bold change if we are to get back on track economically. For months now, I have campaigned on an economic plan that was introduced in the primary campaign and will make our state competitive, clean up the budget mess in Santa Fe, and bring real accountability and transparency to the Roundhouse. My plan has been endorsed by state leaders, employers and small business organizations. As governor, I will do what Diane Denish has proven incapable of: turn New Mexico's economy around and help small businesses create good-paying, quality jobs."
