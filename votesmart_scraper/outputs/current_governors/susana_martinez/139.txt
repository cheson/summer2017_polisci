Today, Governor Susana Martinez issued the following statement on the conviction of child murderer Noe Torres in Clovis:
"Today, a jury convicted child murderer Noe Torres on all counts, and he faces a sentence of life plus 35 years.
"Noe Torres is a coward. He is a coward who killed a child, Carlos Perez, while he was sleeping in his bed, and then fled to Mexico to avoid being brought to justice for his crimes. He taunted the district attorney, Matt Chandler, who prosecuted the other criminals involved in the murder and ultimately taunted me soon after I was elected Governor.
"Working together with Governor Cesar Duarte of Chihuahua, other Mexican government officials, District Attorney Chandler, and the U.S. Marshals, we were successful in finding where he was hiding, arresting him, and extraditing him to the United States.
"The family of Carlos Perez has been through hell. As a former prosecutor, I understand the hurt and grief they have faced. This is justice, and it was long overdue.
"New Mexico is deeply grateful for the tireless dedication and tenacity that District Attorney Matt Chandler showed in this case. Exceedingly compassionate and tough, he never gave up - not once. For nearly ten years, he never stopped fighting to locate, arrest, and convict every person responsible for Carlos' murder.
"The world lost Carlos far too young, but I pray that on a day like today, his family and all those who have fought so hard to stand on the side of justice can feel a small bit of solace in this outcome."
