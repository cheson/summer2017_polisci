Governor Susana Martinez Statement on Speaker Lujan's Refusal to Allow Vote on Driver's License Bill
Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: March 2, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez issued the following statement after Speaker Ben Lujan violated rules and adjourned the House of Representatives to recess after a vote was requested to bring a bill overturning the policy of issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants to the House floor.
"It's outrageous that Speaker Lujan broke House rules to block an up-or-down vote on the bill to repeal driver's licenses for illegal immigrants," said Governor Martinez. "It's tactics like this that cause the public to lose faith in its elected leaders. Come tomorrow morning, every House member will make a choice -- either stand with Speaker Lujan and support driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, or stand with New Mexicans to overturn this dangerous law."
**NOTE: The Governor's office recorded the House floor proceedings. Footage of the request to bring the bill to the floor as well as the Speaker's refusal to comply with House rules and allow a vote can be found on the Governor's website: http://tinyurl.com/5tvrnyx.
