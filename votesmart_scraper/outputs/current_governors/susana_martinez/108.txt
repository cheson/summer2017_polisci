Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Sept. 23, 2015
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced that the state served more than 2
million nutritious meals to low-income children over the summer. The Children, Youth, and
Families Department, through its partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, provides
free nutritious meals during the summer months to children age 18 and younger.
"Making sure that New Mexico's children have food on their plates every day is so important to
their health and wellbeing," said Governor Martinez. "And sadly, when school is out of session,
many of our kids no longer have access to the healthy meals they once relied on. That's why I'm
proud that our summer food program continues to feed our low-income kids who need it most --
even when school is not in session."
