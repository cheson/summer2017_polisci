Location: Albuquerque, NM

Today Governor Susana Martinez highlighted Tax Help New Mexico's free tax services for low income and senior citizen New Mexicans at Central New Mexico Community College (CNM) in Albuquerque.
"Thanks to the efforts of Tax Help New Mexico's dedicated and well-trained volunteers, more low-income and senior citizen New Mexicans will be able to keep more of their hard-earned money," said Governor Martinez.
Tax Help New Mexico, which served more than 22,000 low-income New Mexicans last year, provides free tax preparation services for New Mexicans whose annual income is less than $52,000 (or for those who are 65 and older regardless of income). Last season, 31,478 returns were prepared, $19,194,721 dollars were returned to taxpayers, and New Mexicans saved more than $4,145,820 in preparation fees, through Tax Help New Mexico.
Tax Help New Mexico is provided through a partnership with the United Way of Central New Mexico and the Central New Mexico Community College. There are more than 25 sites around the state, staffed by volunteers who have passed an IRS certification exam. Volunteers are trained to help taxpayers properly use tax credits they are entitled to, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit.
