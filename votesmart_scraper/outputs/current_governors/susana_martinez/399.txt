Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement after the New Mexico Senate unanimously passed an in-state procurement bill that would close a loophole that allows out-of-state companies to receive a preference reserved for New Mexico businesses when bidding on state contracts.
"I'm pleased the New Mexico Senate came together today to close a loophole that had previously allowed out-of-state corporations to pose as New Mexico businesses in order to receive a five percent in-state preference on government contracts," said Governor Martinez. "This bill will create jobs in New Mexico and support businesses that truly make their home in our state. We must provide New Mexico businesses with the tools to succeed and grow here at home. I'm thankful for the bi-partisan support this bill has received in the legislature as well as the broad backing from the business and labor communities. I encourage the House of Representatives to act quickly on this legislation."
"This legislation will assist local companies who are bidding on state contracts and create a more competitive playing field for New Mexico businesses," said Sen. Timothy Keller (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored the legislation. "Closing this loophole will reward businesses that set up shop in our state and make it easier for them to hire New Mexico workers."
