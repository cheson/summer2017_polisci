By: Susana Martinez
Date: Jan. 12, 2011
Location: Albuquerque, NM

Governor Susana Martinez issued the following statement after speaking at
the Children's Law Institute, an annual conference of legal professionals and workers focused on juvenile justice and child protection services.
"As a former District Attorney, I know firsthand the need to be vigilant about keeping our children safe," said Governor Martinez. "It is imperative that law enforcement and child services professionals have the necessary tools to make New Mexico a safer place. From day one of this administration, we have committed ourselves to fight for the future of our children and bring to
justice those who would seek to do them harm."
During her time as District Attorney for New Mexico's Third Judicial District, Governor Martinez personally prosecuted some of the toughest cases of child abuse and child homicide. In 2006 she was instrumental in passing Katie's Law, requiring DNA collection from violent criminals in order to make it easier to prosecute crimes committed against children. On her first day in office, Governor Martinez announced her support for an expansion of this law to include all criminals arrested for felony offenses.
