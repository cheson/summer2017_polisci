Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Oct. 5, 2015
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced the approval of more than $5.7
million in federal grant funding to establish a veterans cemetery in Fort Stanton. Fort Stanton is
one of four locations throughout rural New Mexico proposed by Governor Martinez in 2013 to
establish more local veterans cemeteries throughout the state.
"Our veterans have put their lives on the line to defend our great nation, and they deserve a final
resting place that is close to home -- no matter where they live in our state," said Governor
Martinez. "Today's announcement gets us one step closer to establishing more local veterans
cemeteries throughout New Mexico so that families won't have to drive hours upon hours to visit
the gravesites of their loved ones."
