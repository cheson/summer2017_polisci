Governor Susana Martinez announced today that small businesses who
incurred non-structural economic impact from the current wildfires across the state may be eligible for low-interest loans. The governor is encouraging these businesses to complete the "Estimated Disaster Economic Injury Worksheet for Businesses" available to them through their county emergency managers or on the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management Website at http://www.nmdhsem.org/.
"I am committed to helping small businesses that were forced to close or experienced significant economic impact as a result of the fires obtain help from the Small Business Administration," Governor Martinez said. "These low-interest loans can help our communities recover more quickly."
The Small Business Administration (SBA) makes an Economic Injury Disaster
Declaration upon the Governor's certification that at least five small businesses in a disaster area have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of a disaster and are in need of financial assistance not otherwise available. Upon the approval of the SBA, Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) will be available through the Small Business Administration (SBA).
While the completion of the worksheet does not guarantee SBA loans, Governor Martinez is urging affected small businesses to complete the form in order to help provide additional means by which to recover. Small Businesses must complete the worksheet within 120 days of the disaster that caused an economic impact.
