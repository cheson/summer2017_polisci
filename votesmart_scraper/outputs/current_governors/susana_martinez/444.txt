Press Release

Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez announced today that she has signed two key
legislative items to protect New Mexico's children. The Governor signed Senate Bill 77, requiring child abuse incident training for police. On Friday, Governor Martinez declared April as "Child Abuse Awareness Month' and encouraged all New Mexicans to spot and report child abuse and neglect. Earlier today, she announced that New Mexicans can dial #SAFE, a new toll-free number, to report suspected child abuse.
"New Mexico's children deserve to grow up in a positive environment," said Governor Martinez. "By providing law enforcement officers with greater tools to recognize and respond to child abuse, we can better protect children from violence and neglect. I hope that all New Mexicans will be vigilant in recognizing and reporting child abuse as we take measures to prevent this senseless crime against some of the most vulnerable members of society."
Governor Martinez also signed Senate Bill 78, providing direction to local school boards to prevent bullying in New Mexico's schools.
"Just as children should feel safe at home, they should also feel safe at school," continued Governor Martinez. "By preventing bullying in schools, we can create a better setting that allows children to learn without fear of violence or harassment."
Additionally, the Governor signed House Bill 47, allowing school districts and charter schools to roll over surplus cash balances from previous fiscal years in order to cover certain costs.
