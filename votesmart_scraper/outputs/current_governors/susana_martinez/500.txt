Susana Martinez for Governor Statement on Corruption
Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Sept. 3, 2010
Location: Albuquerque, NM

The Susana Martinez for Governor campaign today released the following statement from Campaign Manager Ryan Cangiolosi:
"Between the news surrounding Guy Riordan's kickback scheme yesterday, and now Bruce Malott's resignation today, it is clear that the culture of corruption is deeply rooted in the Richardson/Denish Administration and we are finding more conflicts and wrongdoing every day. Denish stood by Gov. Richardson's side and has strong ties with almost all the individuals making headlines for their crooked deals, which have held New Mexico back. New Mexicans have a right to know who else in the Richardson/Denish Administration and their boards had financial interests in these taxpayer-funded deals."
