For the third year in a row, Governor Susana Martinez announced the success of
New Mexico's annual child support bench warrant round up, which collected more than $140,000 in unpaid child support.
"Parents have a responsibility to contribute to the upbringing of their children," said Governor Martinez. "This annual round up continues to show real results for kids and families in improving their economic stability. New Mexico remains committed to providing as many tools as possible to help parents support their children emotionally and financially."
The bench warrant round up resulted in 104 arrests, with a total of $67,666.80 collected to date, with more to come. The amnesty week resulted in a total collection of $72,376.41 from 125 noncustodial parents, which goes directly to child support cases. The total amount of collections from the bench warrant amnesty and subsequent round up totals more than $140,043.21.
"Child support bench warrant round ups have been very valuable tools in collecting support payments from delinquent non-custodial parents," said New Mexico Human Services Department (HSD) Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED) Director Steven Smith. "We will continue to act on operations like this in order to get the families and children the support they are due."
CSED, the New Mexico State Police (NMSP), and local law enforcement agencies throughout the state partnered through August for a two-part crack-down on non-custodial parents who aren't paying child support. Through August 4 to August 29, CSED offered non-custodial parents with outstanding bench warrants the opportunity to visit one of New Mexico's 14 child support offices across the state to pay the full amount of the bond and get the warrant quashed or cancelled without fear of arrest. During the final week of August, law enforcement partners throughout the state began the round up portion, where those non-custodial parents with outstanding bench warrants faced arrest.
New Mexico continues to make marked improvement in ensuring that non-custodial parents are fulfilling their obligations to their children and non-custodial parents. During Fiscal Year 2014, CSED set yet another record in child support collections with a total of $137.1 million collected. Each of the past three fiscal years, New Mexico has broken state records for child support collections, with CSED collecting $132.2 million in FY 2013 and $129.6 million in FY 2012. Thanks to innovative programs like the bench warrant round up, New Mexico was recognized by the National Child Support Enforcement Association in 2012 as the nation's most improved.
A list of all non-custodial parents with outstanding bench warrants issued throughout the state is posted on the HSD website at http://www.hsd.state.nm.us/bench-warrant-program.aspx. Individuals with questions may contact CSED toll free at: (800) 288-7207 in-state or (800) 585-7631 out-of-state. A list of the CSED offices across the state can be found on the HSD website at http://www.hsd.state.nm.us/LookingForAssistance/Field_Offices.aspx.
"Once again our partnerships with law enforcement agencies have paid off for the children of New Mexico," said HSD Secretary Sidonie Squier. "I want to thank each law enforcement agency that has participated and hope to see as much success with this program in the future."
Governor Martinez proclaimed August 2014 Child Support Awareness Month to salute all New Mexico parents who support their children, and encourage all parents to assume responsibility for improving the economic and social well-being of their children.
