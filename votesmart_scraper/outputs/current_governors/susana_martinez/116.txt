Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Aug. 14, 2015
Location: Farmington, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced the creation of a multiagency, long-term impact review team to monitor the effects of the massive 3 million gallon waste spill in the Animas River that EPA officials have admitted to causing.
After touring the spill by helicopter for the second time in less than a week, the Governor made
the announcement with cabinet secretaries and directors of the New Mexico Departments of
Agriculture, Environment, Game and Fish, Health, and the Office of the State Engineer.
"As the river begins to clear up, there are still many questions left unanswered by the EPA. New
Mexicans deserve to know the long-term effects this environmental catastrophe will have on our
communities, our agriculture and our wildlife," Governor Martinez said. "That is why I have
called on state agencies to come together to work with local and federal officials to investigate
and shed light on the potential impacts this waste spill could have on our families in the coming
days, months and years."
Governor Martinez continued, "And make no mistake about it: we will keep the EPA honest
when they say they intend to hold themselves accountable at an even higher standard than a
private business."
With today's announcement, the long-term impact review team will conduct research,
collaborate with local communities, federal officials, and members of the public, and share
information to learn more about the potential long-term impact of the spill on local communities,
wildlife, and agriculture.
