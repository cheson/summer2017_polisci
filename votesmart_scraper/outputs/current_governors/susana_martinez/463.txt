Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement after the New Mexico House of Representatives approved a "blast-out" motion to allow floor debate for a bill that would ban driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. The motion, led by Rep. Andy Nu√±ez (DTS-Hatch) was approved by a vote of 36-34. Rep. Dona Irwin (D-Deming) and Rep. Sandra Jeff (D-Crownpoint) broke ranks with the majority to approve the measure.
"Today, Republicans, Democrats, and the House's only Independent ensured that New Mexicans will get the up-or-down vote on a bill they have repeatedly demanded be passed," said Governor Martinez. "I applaud House members, especially the two Democrats, who courageously stood up to Speaker Ben Lujan and stood with New Mexicans who want this dangerous law repealed."
