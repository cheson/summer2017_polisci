Governor Susana Martinez visited Alamogordo this evening to sign
House Bill 527, legislation that authorizes the Department of Public Safety to provide updates to criminal history record checks. By signing the bill into law, New Mexico comes into alignment with federal law and is eligible for $1.5 million in federal funds. Governor Martinez was joined at the Otero County Courthouse by the bill's sponsor, Rep. Yvette Herrell (R-Alamogordo), as well as Alamogordo Mayor Ron Griggs, Otero County Sheriff Benny House, Alamogordo Police Chief Sam Trujillo, and numerous other law enforcement officers and local officials.
"Providing updates to criminal history records to state agencies that employ individuals who have a direct relationship with the general public ensures both public safety and government transparency," said Governor Martinez. "This legislation protects New Mexicans by ensuring that those employed by the state are not engaging in criminal activity. I'm grateful to Rep. Herrell for working to pass this important bill and I have signed it into law as part of my commitment to keep all New Mexicans safe."
