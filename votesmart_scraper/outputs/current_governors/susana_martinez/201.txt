Location: Albuquerque, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez announced the 2014 "New Mexico True"
Summer Reading Challenge, designed to help stop the "summer slide," to help prevent students from losing reading proficiency while not in school. Community partners, including UNM Lobo Men's and Women's Basketball Coaches Craig Neal and Yvonne Sanchez, business leaders, Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry, and others, joined Governor Martinez for the announcement.
"It is essential that our children learn to read well in order to build a foundation for success in academics, and ultimately, for success in the workplace and in life," said Governor Martinez. "It is encouraging to join statewide leaders who have also made reading a priority for our children. I'm hopeful that all New Mexico students will participate in the challenge throughout the summer months as they work toward winning one of the amazing prizes we have to reward them for their commitment to reading."
The "New Mexico True" Summer Reading Challenge is open to all New Mexico elementary school children, ages five through twelve. All readers who submit a completed reading log with information regarding the six books they read will receive a "New Mexico True" bookmark and a certificate recognizing their accomplishment. Readers who submit their completed reading log with information regarding the twelve books they read, as well as a short essay explaining "Why I Love New Mexico," will receive a "New Mexico True" bookmark, a certificate recognizing their accomplishment, and have their name entered in the random drawing to receive one of the following Grand Prizes:
