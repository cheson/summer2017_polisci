Governor Susana Martinez held a press conference at the Roundhouse today to call for tougher penalties on public officials who are convicted of corruption. The Governor announced her support for House Bill 378, a bi-partisan effort sponsored by Sen. Tim Keller (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Nate Gentry (R-Albuquerque). HB378 contains key provisions that enhance prison sentences for corrupt public officials, prohibit public officials convicted of corruption from lobbying or doing business with the state, and force corrupt officials to forfeit their state pensions.
"Public officials are not above the law," said Governor Martinez. Unfortunately, our state's reputation has been tainted in the past because elected and appointed officials have misused their office for personal gain.
By increasing prison sentences for public corruption, prohibiting corrupt officials from lobbying and doing business with the state, and forcing those convicted of corruption to forfeit their pensions, we are sending a clear signal that there will be severe penalties for any public servant who puts their own personal gain ahead of the interests of the people of New Mexico. It's time to treat corruption for what it is -- a crime that abuses the public trust and wastes taxpayer money."
Governor Martinez was joined by several legislators who are supporting this important anti-corruption measure, and she also voiced her support for the establishment of a public corrpution investigative unit in the Department of Public Safety alongside bill sponsor Rep. David Doyle (R-Albuquerque).
