Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: March 5, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement after legislation to expand Katie's Law passed the House Judiciary Committee by a 10-1 margin, clearing the way for an up-or-down vote on the floor of both the House and Senate. The legislation would require a DNA sample from anyone arrested for a felony crime in New Mexico.
"Since 2006, we have seen that Katie's Law has gotten results -- but we can do more," said Governor Martinez. "Requiring a DNA sample from anyone arrested for a felony in New Mexico will give law enforcement even greater tools to prevent crimes, make our communities safer, and put criminals behind
bars. I applaud the strong bipartisan support that this legislation has seen so far and I am optimistic that all sides can continue to come together to pass it on the floor of the House and the Senate. I look forward to signing this important bill into law and making our state a safer place for all New Mexicans."
