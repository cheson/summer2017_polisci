Gov. Susana Martinez announced Monday two programs that will provide assistance to low-income and foster children for back to school needs.
The Human Services Department (HSD) and the Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) will provide assistance with clothing and back to school supplies, according to a press release by the governor.
"These are two ways in which we can ensure that our neediest children have everything they need to be able to focus in the classroom," Martinez said. "Proper clothing and supplies make it easier for students to concentrate and makes it more likely that they will have a successful school year."
The annual children's clothing allowance through HSD will provide a $50 for each qualifying New Mexico child for the purchase clothes for the upcoming school year, according to the release. The allowance is part of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, according to the release. HSD estimates they will help more than 15,765 low-income children at a cost of roughly $788,000, the release states.
Matt Kennicott, Director of External Affairs with the Human Service Department, said there are generally about 1,000 foster parents in state.
"It is our main way of helping our foster parents and our foster children get ready for school," Kennicott said.
