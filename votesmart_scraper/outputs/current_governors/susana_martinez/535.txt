Public Officials Will Be Held to Account and Integrity in Government Restored
There will be no higher priority in a Martinez Administration than rooting out corruption in Santa Fe and instilling confidence on the part of the voter and taxpayer in their state government. The waste, fraud and abuse of public funds and taxpayer dollars will cease and those involved in exploiting New Mexico citizens will be confronted head on when I am governor.
Identifying and eliminating corruption will require real, substantive changes in the Roundhouse with the first being, Diane Denish no longer serving in state government. Recently and in response to news that the U.S. Department of Justice would not prosecute the Richardson Administration, Lieutenant Governor Denish responded, "It's good news for New Mexico." (Release, Diane Denish, 8/27/09)
Denish's comment was especially troubling because the U.S. Attorney for New Mexico believed "pressure from the governor's office resulted in the corruption of the procurement process" and pointed out that the lack of indictments "should not be interpreted as exoneration of any party's conduct in that matter." (NM Independent, 8/31/09)
The truth is that "pay to play" has become commonplace and part of everyday business in Santa Fe under Diane Denish's watch and no one believes that "it's good news for New Mexico."
A powerful government without checks and balances is ripe for corruption. That's why I believe we need a smaller government that is open and transparent. As governor, I will support opening conference committees to the public and will use my prosecutorial experience to end "pay to play" in state government.
