New Mexicans deserve a state government that looks out for the best interests of the people. But under the previous administration, our state was rife with corruption and malfeasance.
When Governor Martinez took office, public confidence in our state government was at an all-time low. She immediately began work to restore confidence with New Mexicans by changing the way business is done in Santa Fe.
That included selling the state jet -- a symbol of waste fraud and abuse. She also signed a bill that allows judges to strip those convicted of public corruptions charges of their public pensions.
Governor Martinez will continue to enact policies that hold elected officials accountable and give New Mexicans more confidence in their state government.
-Reached recovery settlements totaling $24 million related to secret fees paid to Richardson cronies in the pay-to-play scandals involving state pension funds, which will be largest recovery in state history.
-To end the practice of public officials using their time in public service to create a personal payday, Governor Martinez required all administration employees to forego lobbying for two-years after separating from state government.
-Enacted lifetime ban on corrupt government contractors convicted of corruption.
-Issued executive order prohibiting agencies or boards from hiring lobbyists.
-Signed legislation allowing judges to seize pensions of elected officials convicted of corruption.
