Governor Susana Martinez Proposes Nearly Doubling Funding for Early Reading Initiative
Statement

Location: Albuquerque, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez proposed a targeted $10 million
expansion of the New Mexico Reads to Lead initiative, a statewide program that identifies
struggling students in kindergarten through third grade and provides them with the help they
need to strengthen their reading skills.
"I've always said that every child can learn. And it starts with reading," said Governor Martinez.
"If we want our kids to succeed in the classroom, we need to help them build a strong foundation
of reading skills. By expanding New Mexico Reads to Lead, we will be able to identify more
struggling students and give them the help they deserve -- no matter their background or where
they go to school."
Governor Martinez first established New Mexico Reads to Lead in 2012 to help teachers and
schools better identify students struggling in reading, and provide more resources to help build
and strengthen reading skills. The program provides valuable resources to students, teachers,
parents, and schools such as reading coaches, professional development for teachers, reading
skills screening in elementary schools, family activities, and workshops like "Readers Raise the
Roof."
"We need to inundate our struggling schools with literacy support -- targeted help to give
students the best chance to learn to read," concluded Governor Martinez. "And as I've continued
to call for, we need to demand that children learn to read early on, and stop shuffling struggling
students into higher grades to face discouragement and despair."
