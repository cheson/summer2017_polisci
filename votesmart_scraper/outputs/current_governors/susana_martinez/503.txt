After Eight Years Of Staying Silent While Her Administration Looted State Resources, Lieutenant Governor Refuses To Stand Up
Susana Martinez, Republican gubernatorial nominee today released the following statement:
"Nearly a month ago, I called on Diane Denish to match her rhetoric on corruption with action; since then, she has yet to step forward and call on her running mate Brian Colón to release the names of the donors to the Moving America Forward Foundation. Today, we learn of a federal grand jury probe into pay-to-play scandals during the Richardson/Denish Administration, which demands the lieutenant governor speak to the matter. For eight years, Denish has sat by idly and did nothing as corruption ran rampant around her. Diane Denish often speaks about the need to fight the corruption that has plagued New Mexico politics, but if her words had any authenticity, she would call upon her running mate, Brian Colón, to end the cover ups and release the names. As a candidate for governor, Denish has an obligation to shine her own Sunshine Portal on one of the worst examples of corruption in New Mexico political history; otherwise, admit what all of us already know to be true, she represents the status quo and would be nothing more than an extension of the current administration and its corrupt ways."
