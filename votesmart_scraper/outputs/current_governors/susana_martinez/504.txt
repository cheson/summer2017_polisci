Only Bold Change Will Clean Up The Mess In State Government
Susana Martinez for Governor Campaign Manager Ryan Cangiolosi today released the following statement concerning news reports detailing more troubling and questionable activity from the Secretary of State's office:
"Today, there are additional examples of how state government is failing New Mexicans and why we need bold change to clean up the mess in Santa Fe. Accusations that a state employee has been suspended for speaking with federal authorities about illegal activities in the Secretary of State's office demonstrates the desperate need to restore order in state government and change the culture of corruption that has become institutionalized by the Richardson/Denish Administration. Susana Martinez has a plan to change the way business is done in Santa Fe starting with holding elected officials to account if they fail to report corrupt activities. New Mexicans are tired of the ineffective leadership and embarrassing revelations that have become a calling card for those in the state capital and will vote this fall to elect leaders that are committed to reform and accountability."
