Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement after the Senate
approved a key component of her education reform plan with overwhelming bi-partisan support. Senate Bill 502, legislation carried by Sen. Cynthia Nava, creates a comprehensive strategy to identify, recruit, retain and reward effective teachers and educators. It passed by a vote of 34 to 6.
"Recruiting and rewarding excellent teachers and educators is a critical step toward reforming New Mexico's education system," said Governor Martinez. "In order to give our children the best opportunities for success, we must make sure that we have the best leaders in our classrooms. This legislation will allow us to attract and retain the best education professionals in the nation and put us on the right track to improve New Mexico schools. I appreciate the hard work that went into the crafting of this bill by Sen. Nava, Secretary Skandera, New Mexico's superintendents, and multiple teacher's unions. I'm hopeful that it will receive a quick hearing and a similar level of bi-partisan support in the House."
Governor Martinez has made improving education in New Mexico a top priority and is committed to ensuring every student has access to quality schools and teachers. Her education reform plan is comprised of key initiatives to increase accountability and transparency, set students up for success by ending social promotion, target resources where they are needed the most and identify and reward our most effective educators and leaders.
