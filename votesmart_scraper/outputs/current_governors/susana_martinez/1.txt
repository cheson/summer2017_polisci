Today, Governor Susana Martinez unveiled the latest powerful TV ad to fight DWI. In addition, the Governor announced an increased law enforcement presence on New Mexico's roads and highways to target DWI and other dangerous driving throughout the summer.
"The consequences of DWI are unmistakable -- it costs lives and takes loved ones away from their families." said Governor Martinez. "I saw it all the time as a prosecutor. This new ad shows exactly what happens when people make the choice to get behind the wheel drunk. There is no excuse, and it must stop."
The new ad is from the perspective of a DWI offender who is haunted in prison by his victim. In the ad, the DWI offender has too much to drink at the bar then gets behind the wheel of the car drunk. In the end, he kills a woman walking on the street with her friends who haunts him while he sits in prison. The ads are available online here.
The Governor also kicked off this year's 100 Days and Nights of Summer, a coordinated statewide law enforcement effort that puts more police officers on the roads to target DWI, texting behind the wheel, not buckling up, and other dangerous driving behaviors.
The 100 Days and Nights of Summer safety campaign runs through the end of September. Drivers can expect to see more DWI checkpoints, saturation patrols, and more officers on the road.
"It is important that drivers realize they have a responsibility to keep our roads safe," said NMDOT Deputy Cabinet Secretary Loren Hatch. "Everyone needs to make the smart decision not to drive drunk. It could save your life or someone else's life."
