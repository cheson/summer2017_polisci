Statement
By: Susana Martinez
Date: Sept. 8, 2015
Location: Albuquerque, NM

Today, Governor Susana Martinez directed state agencies to create an
online "Students Work" internship portal that will connect New Mexico college students with
employers in our state through a wide range of internship offerings.
"By encouraging more students to gain professional work experience with New Mexico
companies while in college, we can build a more skilled and talented workforce pipeline for New
Mexico businesses and keep more of our students in New Mexico after they graduate," said
Governor Martinez.
