Making New Mexico Prosperous and Competitive
In this economy, companies have choices and will locate their businesses where they have the best chance to succeed. Higher taxes and excessive regulations force jobs out of New Mexico.
My primary goal will be to make certain businesses in New Mexico continue to operate in the state, while attracting others to set up shop here.
I believe we need to create new jobs in New Mexico by lowering taxes and making our state more competitive, and I do not believe that is achieved by massively increasing government spending. This means I will reform the tax and regulatory system by cutting red tape and making it easier to create jobs in New Mexico than it is in neighboring states.
As governor, I will bring the same level of dedication and commitment to job creation and economic advancement that employers across New Mexico do each day. While working in my family's small business, I learned a key lesson: the private citizen -- not the government -- assumes risk and creates opportunity. Instead, government should serve as the citizen's partner and strongest supporter.
A critical component of attracting new jobs in New Mexico is building a quality workforce. I will work to create a high-performing education system that prepares our children to confront the real world and succeed in the jobs of tomorrow.
