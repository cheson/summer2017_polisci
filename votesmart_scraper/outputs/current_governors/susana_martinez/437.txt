Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: April 7, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez today signed Senate Bill 208, legislation that
requires more transparency and a stricter review process for health insurance companies seeking to increase rates on New Mexico consumers.
"This bill will help ensure that consumers are getting a fair deal when insurance companies seek to increase their rates," said Governor Martinez. "It is important that the rate review process is as thorough and transparent as possible, especially during these difficult times when many families are cutting costs to make ends meet."
The Governor also signed Senate Bill 9, placing restrictions on the ability of minors to obtain a driver's license if they have committed certain violations, including traffic violations and buying or possessing alcohol.
"Young New Mexicans should demonstrate the responsibility required to get behind the wheel of a car," said Governor Martinez. "These provisions will make our streets safer and communicate to minors that driving is a privilege, not a right."
