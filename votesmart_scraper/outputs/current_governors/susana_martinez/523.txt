Public Statements
Eliminating Conflicts of Interest
Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: July 30, 2010
Location: Unknown

Disclosing & Avoiding Conflicts --All appointed members of the Martinez administration will file personal financial disclosure information to ensure their work for the public does not benefit themselves, their family or their business associates. All financial disclosure statements will be posted online for easy access by the public.
Capital Outlay Reform --We must eliminate conflicts from the capital outlay process. Legislators should be prohibited from appropriating funds that benefit any private company or organization with whom they have financial interests or government entity controlled by relatives. Each capital outlay request must have an affidavit by the sponsoring legislator stating that they, their family or business associates will not benefit from the capital outlay funds. Those found in violation of the policy will face penalties.
