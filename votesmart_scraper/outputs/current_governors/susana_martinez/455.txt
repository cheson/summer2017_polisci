Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement following the
Senate Education Committee's unanimous vote this morning to end social promotion for New Mexico third graders. Social promotion is the policy that allows students to be promoted to the next grade even when unwarranted by classroom performance. House Bill 21, championed by Representative Mary Helen Garcia (D-Las Cruces) and Representative Nora Espinoza (R-Roswell), ensures struggling students receive the assistance they need to succeed in future grades.
"Raising student achievement in our state begins with ensuring all students master the fundamental life skill of reading," said Governor Martinez. "The Senate Education Committee's unanimous support for bold education reform to aid struggling readers underscores the importance of preparing every child to succeed in school, college and the workforce. As we enter the final days of the 2011 legislative session, I urge Senate leadership to quickly take up this bipartisan legislation on the floor."
Governor Martinez has made improving education in New Mexico a top priority and is committed to ensuring every student has access to quality schools and teachers. Her education reform plan includes key initiatives to increase accountability and transparency, set students up for success by ending social promotion, target resources where they are needed the most and identify and reward our most effective educators and leaders.
