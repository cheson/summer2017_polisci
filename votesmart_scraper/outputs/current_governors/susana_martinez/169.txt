Process Equipment and Service Company, known as PESCO, will create as man[y] as 150 jobs by next year as it expands its Farmington headquarters, company president Kyle Rhodes announced on Friday in a factory building filled with more than 100 people, including Gov. Susana Martinez.
The oil-field servicing company, employing 340 workers, has grown in the last nine months by about 80 jobs.
By April 1, Rhodes hopes to open a new 16,000-square-foot shop, enlarging the Farmington factory by 70 percent. PESCO is now trying to fill the remaining positions in the factory and will begin hiring more employees once the expansion is complete, Human Resource Assistant Nashota Yazzie said in an interview after the announcement.
Entry-level employees make $11 or more, and PESCO adjusts its wages based on a worker's experience, she said.
New employees will also need training, which can take one to three weeks, she said.
PESCO's announcement comes less than a week after The Daily Times reported BP American Production Company is attempting to sell its San Juan Basin South assets, putting at least 120 jobs at risk.
During the PESCO ceremony, Martinez said the state will give PESCO $500,000 to help the company build its new factory. The funding will come through the New Mexico Economic Development Department's Local Economic Development Act.
