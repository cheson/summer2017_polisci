Governor Susana Martinez Signs Legislation to Allow Dogs in Outdoor Restaurants, Increase Hunting Licenses Available to New Mexicans
Press Release
By: Susana Martinez
Date: April 8, 2011
Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez was joined today by Riggs, the First Dog, as
she signed Senate Bill 11, legislation allowing dogs in certain designated outdoor dining areas in New Mexico. Governor Martinez was also joined this morning by First Gentleman Chuck Franco and bill sponsor Sen. Peter Wirth at Louie's Corner Cafe in Santa Fe.
"For many New Mexicans, their canine companions are just like family members," said Governor Martinez. "Now, restaurant owners in New Mexico have the option of welcoming dogs onto their patios and outdoor dining areas -- and dog owners can bring their four-legged friends along when they go out for a bite to eat."
The Governor also signed Senate Bill 196 with a message, expanding hunting
opportunities for New Mexico residents by increasing the number of licenses available for big-game hunts on public lands, commenting, "It's only common sense to increase the opportunities for New Mexicans to hunt on their own state land. This provision also brings New Mexico's split between the issuance of resident and non-resident licenses into closer alignment with other states."
