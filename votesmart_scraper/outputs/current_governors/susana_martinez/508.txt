Educators Across The State Endorse Bold Reform Plan
Susana Martinez, Republican gubernatorial nominee today announced her statewide Educators for Martinez coalition. Coalition members include educators from across New Mexico who have endorsed Martinez's Education Reform Plan and her vision for turning our schools around.
"There is nothing more important than getting our education system back on track in New Mexico and doing this will require bold and comprehensive change. We will start reforming our education system on day one of a Martinez Administration," stated Susana Martinez, Republican gubernatorial nominee. "The Richardson/Denish Administration has failed our children for too long, which is why we need a new direction for our schools and state. My plan will get 65% of every education dollar directly into the classroom and out of the bureaucracy, hold students to high standards by eliminating social promotion, increase accountability in our schools and ensure teachers whose students are achieving in the classroom are rewarded through merit pay."
