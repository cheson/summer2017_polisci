Press Release

Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez made the following statement after the United States Department of Labor released New Mexico's latest unemployment figures. New Mexico saw the largest drop in unemployment in the country, with the unemployment rate decreasing from 8.7 percent to 8.1 percent.
"We still have a lot of work to do, but I am encouraged that New Mexico's unemployment rate saw the largest monthly drop in America," said Governor Martinez. "In a bi-partisan fashion, we recently put our financial house in order without raising taxes and by cutting wasteful spending, while protecting key priorities like classroom spending. It is critical that we continue down the road to economic recovery by helping small businesses hire more New Mexicans and that means opposing job-killing tax increases. I am committed to ensuring that job creators understand that New Mexico is open for business."
