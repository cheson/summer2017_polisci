Governor Susana Martinez Responds to the News of Noe Torres' Extradition
Statement

Location: Santa Fe, NM

Governor Susana Martinez issued the following statement in response to
the news that alleged fugitive child killer Noe Torres will soon be extradited to New Mexico to stand trial for the murder of 10-year old Carlos Perez in 2005.
"Over the past few months, we have remained in close contact with Mexican authorities to ensure that Noe Torres would be returned to New Mexico to stand trial for the murder of Carlos Perez. His return will not only ensure that justice continues to be served in this case, but I have no doubt it is welcome news to a family that continues to grieve the loss of young Carlos.
"I continue to be encouraged by the relationship that we have worked to build with our neighboring states in Mexico. Working closely with Chihuahua Governor Cesar Duarte, motivated by a shared resolve to bring justice to Carlos' murderers, we were able to secure the arrest of Noe Torres in six days - an effort that had eluded us for more than six years.
"His impending return is welcome news, and I'm grateful to all of the law enforcement and government officials in Mexico and New Mexico who have worked so hard on behalf of Carlos."
Governor Martinez has worked diligently with Ninth Judicial District Attorney Matt Chandler in addition to Mexican authorities, particularly over the last few weeks, to ensure a successful extradition. District Attorney Chandler has also been in close contact with Carlos Perez's family as New Mexican and Mexican officials work to complete the extradition process and bring Torres to justice.
