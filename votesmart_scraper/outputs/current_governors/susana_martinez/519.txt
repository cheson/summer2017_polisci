Susana Martinez, Republican gubernatorial nominee today released the following statement concerning the fact that only 22% of New Mexico schools are meeting adequate year progress (AYP) standards, a 10% drop from last year and lowest percentage in five years:
"It was with great anguish that many of us heard the news that less than a quarter of New Mexico schools are meeting adequate year progress standards, meaning a significant majority of our students are failing. The results are the lowest in five years and there has been a significant drop off in the last year alone. On the issue of education, the Richardson/Denish Administration has failed New Mexico and worst of all, they have failed our children. In 2003, Denish herself said, "failure is not an option. We will not fail the voters. We will not fail our children.' The record of failure of the Richardson/Denish Administration could not be any clearer. Denish believes her administration's plans just "need more time.' After eight years, their time is up. New Mexico is demanding bold change, not four more years of the same failed policies. Instead of offering excuses or pleading for more time, I am putting forward a vision for reform to turn our education system around right now. As governor, I will never accept mediocrity or a culture of low expectations in our education system. It is time to put more money directly into the classroom and increase school accountability, end the practice of social promotion, reward our best teachers with merit-based pay increases and ensure struggling students immediately get the assistance they need."
