Susana Martinez, Republican gubernatorial nominee today released the following statement concerning recent news reports of continuing and escalating violence on the border:
"Recent and unfortunate news developments along our border emphasize that the next governor of New Mexico must decisively address issues concerning border security. As violence on our border escalates on a seemingly daily basis, it has become increasingly clear that the federal government has completely failed in its duty to secure our borders. Furthermore, the Richardson/Denish Administration has only made matters worse by promoting sanctuary policies, such as granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, which make New Mexico a magnet and safe haven for illegal immigrants. As governor, my experience prosecuting border-related criminal cases will enable me to take bold and common-sense steps that address this issue. Unlike my opponent, I will fight to revoke the driver's licenses issued to illegal immigrants and work to end the sanctuary policies that allow illegal immigrants arrested for criminal acts to elude federal authorities. For eight years, my opponent has largely ignored this issue or supported policies that have exacerbated the problem as opposed to resolving it. We must have leadership in the Roundhouse that acts swiftly to secure our borders and as governor, I will."
