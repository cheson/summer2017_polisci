Governor Susana Martinez announced today that she has issued a
proclamation declaring April "Child Abuse Awareness Month.'
"Reporting abuse is the surest way to prevent and stop violence against our children," said Governor Martinez. "Child abuse and neglect is a serious problem that must be addressed. I am calling on all New Mexicans to promote a safe and nurturing community free of fear and violence. By working together, we can create an environment that allows all of our children to grow, thrive, and succeed."
"Children are the most precious resource we have in New Mexico," stated Children, Youth, and Families Department Secretary Yolanda Deines. "The best cure for child abuse is prevention, not intervention. We want New Mexicans this month to take a deep breath and really think about child abuse in our society. There are no easy answers. But working together and increasing our awareness strengthens our ability to protect our children."
