Governor Paul R. LePage today released a statement about LD 1835, "An Act to Improve Maine's Ability to Attract Major Private Investments," which was defeated along party lines.
"The defeat of our Open for Business Zones is just the latest assault by job-killing liberal politicians on our efforts to improve our state's business climate and create careers for Mainers. The liberals have pursued their anti-business philosophy with a vengeance this session. They tried to penalize call centers, which bring good-paying jobs to Mainers across the state. They denied hard-working Mainers the chance to vote on whether they wanted to lower taxes. They even prevented teenagers from getting jobs in movie theaters and bowling alleys.
"Now they are chasing away major employers who would create high-paying jobs and long-term careers that would provide economic opportunities for Maine families. These liberals would rather try to score political points than allow Mainers to get good jobs. It's incomprehensible."
