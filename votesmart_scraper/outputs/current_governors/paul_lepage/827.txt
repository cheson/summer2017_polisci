Baldacci-Mitchell Budget Shorts Maine's Hospitals $400 Million
At a candidate forum this morning, Paul LePage, the Republican candidate for Governor, challenged that notion that the Baldacci-Mitchell Budget is balanced.
"It is easy to say your budget is balanced if you don't pay your bills," said Paul LePage." And under the leadership of Governor Baldacci and Senate President Libby Mitchell, we have short changed our hospitals by $400 million dollars.
"Hospitals are major employers in communities throughout Maine and when the State does not pay its bills, working Maine families end up paying instead," added LePage.
Recently reported budget woes and job losses directly tied to the state's failure to pay its bills include:
· A $1.4 million operating deficit at Maine Coast Memorial Hospital in Ellsworth and an accumulated four-year deficit in state payments of $12.8 Million.
· Central Maine Healthcare in Lewiston recently laid off 35 employees in Lewiston as part of a cost cutting measure citing $56 million the state owes in back MaineCare payments.
· Pen Bay Healthcare in Rockport reportedly cut 19 positions in part because of the $7 million owed the facility in back MaineCare reimbursements.
