Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage issued a statement today announcing the Maine Department of Health and Human Services will appeal a decision from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services disallowing $51 million that has been drawn down in disproportionate share resources (DSH) for the support of Riverview Psychiatric Center.
"Since Riverview Psychiatric Center was decertified in 2013, our administration has clearly communicated on numerous occasions that continuing to use DSH funding posed a significant risk of disallowance. Our administration warned the Legislature over and over that action needed to be taken and those warnings were ignored. Now, we are faced with a financial tsunami," said Governor LePage. "I expect the Legislature to allocate $51 million in the biennial budget and take responsibility for its missteps and jeopardizing the financial well-being of our state."
The letter from CMS to DHHS is attached below.
