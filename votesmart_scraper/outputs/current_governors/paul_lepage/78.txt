We have made progress to lower the income tax, fight the drug epidemic, create jobs and get Mainers more involved in their local elections. But activists are working hard to reverse this progress. They want to take Maine backwards.
Hello, this is Governor Paul LePage.
These activists have put questions on the November ballot to increase taxes, legalize drugs, destroy entry-level jobs and determine the outcome of elections in an unconstitutional manner.
We have fought for five years to reduce the income tax from 8.5 to 7.15%. We want to gradually phase it out until it is gone. It would be the biggest wage increase we can give to Mainers.
But the union bosses at the Maine Education Association are asking Mainers to add another 3% tax to the income-tax burden of modestly successful Mainers. They want an extra tax so they can spend more money on education.
It would drive the income tax to 10% for Mainers and small business owners making over $200,000. This punishes Mainers who have worked hard their entire lives and who are already paying their fair share of taxes. Even worse, the Maine education system has plenty of money, especially since student enrollment is declining every year.
Instead of taxing successful people, we should be making our school system more effective and more efficient. Increasing taxes is the wrong way to go.
