Governor Forced to Sign Executive Order to Pay for Legislature's Unfunded Bills
Press Release
By: Paul LePage
Date: June 27, 2016
Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage today signed an Executive Order authorizing the Executive Branch to distribute funding for several bills, which the Legislature failed to pay for prior to its adjournment.
"Unfortunately, the Legislature's lack of fiscal management is going to place unnecessary strain on various programs and salary negotiating processes within the Executive Branch," the Governor said. "We are going to do our best to mitigate the impacts of this unfunded legislation with available resources. Maine law demands that the budget be balanced. Since Democratic leadership refuses to fund these bills, I have taken action by issuing an executive order to ensure government is being funded in a fiscally responsible manner."
Last week, Governor LePage met with Legislative leadership to discuss where they expected the Executive Branch to identify money to pay for four bills--three of which do not have funding sources. Democrat Speaker of the House Mark Eves told Governor LePage during the meeting that legislators would not be coming back to Augusta to deal with the unfunded mandates. If the Governor did call a special session, Eves stated they would "adjourn immediately."
The related-bills are:
LD 1465 Resolve, To Require the Department of Health and Human Services To Conduct a Study of Ambulance Services. This bill requires that DHHS contract with a third-party consultant to conduct a rate study of ambulance services and assess the feasibility of reimbursing for community paramedicine services, but doesn't appropriate any money to fund it.
LD 1552 An Act To Reduce Morbidity and Mortality Related to Injected Drugs. This bill creates a new needle exchange program for drug users but the Legislature stripped the needed $75,000 in funding.
