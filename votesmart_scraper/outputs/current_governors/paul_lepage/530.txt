Governor Paul R. LePage says expanding natural gas service in Maine is critical to retaining the state's manufacturer base and applauds Lincoln Paper and Tissues announcement earlier today that it has signed a natural gas pipeline transportation agreement with Bangor Gas.
"I applaud the effort of Lincoln Paper and Tissue and Bangor Gas to move forward with ambitious plans to bring this critical resource to power the Lincoln mill," said Governor LePage. "Expanding natural gas service in Maine is critical to retaining our manufacturing base, attracting business investment, and keeping Mainers employed. This positions Lincoln Paper and Tissue to be more competitive in attracting new customers and larger orders, which will lead to more jobs. I look forward in working with them in making this critical investment a reality."
Pipeline service to the mill will begin in late 2014 and will provide clean natural gas for tissue drying and the lime kiln process, according to press release distributed by Lincoln Paper and Tissue.
