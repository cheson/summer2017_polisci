Governor Reminds Officials of State Emergency Resources
Statement

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage is reminding officials throughout the State that the most effective way for a municipality to receive needed emergency resources from the State is to make a request through the Maine Emergency Management Agency.
"Let your County Emergency Management Agency know what your problem is, and what you think you might need," the Governor said. "The County will contact the Maine Emergency Management Agency and they will start working on it right away. This process ensures proper procedure is followed and federal funding may be authorized if such a request is needed in the future."
Emergency assistance from the State may come in different forms, including MaineDOT snow-removal help, such as has been provided to Lubec and Eastport in the last two days. Or it may be coordinating assistance for residents, through either state agency programs or volunteer teams.
