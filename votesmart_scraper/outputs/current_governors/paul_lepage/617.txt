Today, Governor Paul LePage released the following statement in remembrance of the victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and United Flight 93:
"Today marks the eleventh anniversary of that tragic day on which America was forever changed. The terrorists who hijacked our skies, attempted to attack the White House, and flew planes into both the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were on a mission to weaken our resolve and instill fear in our hearts. America's courage was tested that day, but we answered the call. From the first responders who worked tirelessly to rescue the victims of those terrorists, to the countless people who flooded their local blood banks to give all they could, to our men and women in uniform who continue to protect our borders and our freedoms from other would-be attackers, America stands as a testament to the resiliency and the bravery of its people.
I encourage all Mainers to take a moment out of their day today to reflect and mourn those we lost to this act of hatred and violence. I also hope that the people of Maine will take pride in knowing that in the face of tragedy, Americans rose united to face the challenges against our nation. That is what makes America so truly great."
