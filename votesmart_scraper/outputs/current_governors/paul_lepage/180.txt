Governor Paul R. LePage commended House Republicans today for having the courage to stand up for the Maine people by insisting that the budget must include meaningful income tax cuts and common-sense welfare reforms.
"Democrats led by Speaker of the House Mark Eves and Senate Democratic Leader Justin Alfond are fighting tooth and nail to defend the status quo and ignore the best interests of the people they claim to represent," said Governor LePage. "Democrats and their allies want to pass a budget that is devoid of tax relief for hard-working Mainers, but distributes taxpayers' money to illegal aliens, even though it is against federal law.
"I commend the House Republicans for standing strong on significant tax cuts for the Maine people and the kind of welfare reform that is overwhelmingly supported by Mainers. They demand a budget based on solid principles, while Democrats want to pass a business-as-usual budget just so they can pack up and go home for the summer. Let me be clear: A government shutdown is not necessary. Shame on Democrats for once again using it as a scare tactic. Instead of threatening state workers, they should get back to work and do what's right for the Maine people."
