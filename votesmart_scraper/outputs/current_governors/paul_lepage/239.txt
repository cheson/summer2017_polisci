Governor Paul R. LePage invites the Maine people to join him on Wednesday, February 11 for a discussion on his tax cut plan, which provides a $300 million reduction in the tax burden for Maine families and small businesses.
The cornerstone of the Governor's budget is his tax proposal, which modernizes Maine's tax code, lowers top individual and corporate income tax rates, amends the sales tax base to some services and adjusts the sales tax rate, while at the same time offering tax credits for low-income Mainers.
In an effort to answer questions about the proposal and better inform Mainers about how it affects them, Governor LePage and Office of Policy and Management Jonathan LaBonte will be at the Westbrook Performing Arts Center at 6 p.m. to hear from Maine citizens. The public is welcome to attend. Attendees will have an opportunity to ask questions directly to Governor LePage and Director LaBonte.
"The State now takes $1.3 billion right from the paychecks of Mainers, and I want that money to go back to the people. My tax-cut plan lays out the first phase of eliminating the income tax by returning $300 million to the Maine people. If our state is to prosper, we must have the courage to fix our antiquated tax system and put more of the people's money back in their pockets. The government should not decide how to spend the earnings of hard-working Mainers; the people should decide how they spend their own money," Governor LePage said.
