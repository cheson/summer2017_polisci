Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage has signed a third limited Emergency Proclamation that will allow Maine fuel transport and delivery trucks to drive additional hours to ensure timely heating fuel deliveries during the cold winter weather.
"The declaration allows heating fuel to be delivered to Maine families when they need it most," Governor LePage said. "Keeping homes warm is critical to protect the public health and safety of Mainers."
Heating fuel and bulk petroleum products in Maine continue to be in great demand due to a number of factors, including cold winter weather, regional and national storage and supply issues. Much of the heating fuels and bulk petroleum products are being delivered from outside of the State of Maine, which adds to the delivery time.
The Governor's proclamation waives U.S. Department of Transportation rules and extends the hours of service for heating fuel transport and delivery trucks within the State of Maine for three weeks from January 19 through February 8, 2014.
