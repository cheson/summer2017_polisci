Democrats Reject Military Recruiter Bill
Statement

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement after House Democrats voted to block a bill requiring school districts to adopt policies allowing uniformed military recruiters the same access and opportunity to meet with students enjoyed by other postsecondary and career recruiters:
"The American military uniform represents freedom, honor and integrity to millions around the world. I am not surprised, but appalled that some Democrats in the Maine Legislature are playing a political game with the men and women in uniform who defend our country.
"It is a disgrace they have denied our American heroes in uniform the opportunity to speak with Maine students. Their claim in blocking my bill was that there was no proof of a problem, despite the Maine National Guard's recruiters repeatedly saying there are issues.
"For Democrats to call into question the word of our patriotic and principled service members is a slap in the face to Maine's long and proud history of service to this country."
Background: Twenty Democrats today flipped their votes on LD 1503, a bill that would have allowed military recruiters the same access to Maine public schools as civilian career recruiters and would have further allowed them to wear their uniforms while visiting schools.
