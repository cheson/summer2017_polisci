Governor Paul LePage is committed to improving education so that every Maine child has a chance to succeed and earn a good living in the career field of their choice.

He believes it is critical to offer parents and students choices in their education and to recognize great teachers who deliver results for our kids.

Homeless as a young man, Paul worked his way through high school, college and on to an advanced college degree. Governor LePage credits education with helping him out of poverty.

While other Governors across the country were cutting funding for education, both Republicans and Democrats; Governor LePage proposed $80 million of increased funding for our local schools.

He added funding along with increased accountability so that every kid can have a real chance to succeed.

Today, under Governor LePage, Maine spends more money on K-12 education than it did when he first took office. The Governor has also emphasized support for our technical colleges so that our students are trained for today's jobs and the jobs of tomorrow. In addition he has worked to minimize budget impacts that would gut our state universities, where he earned his MBA.

For too long politicians in Maine have spent their time trying to cater to government employee labor unions and bureaucrats. We should be focused on what is best for students, their parents and teachers when it comes to education reform. Governor LePage has worked to reverse that trend.

The Governor has said, "School choice should not be just for the wealthy elite. All Maine students deserve an equal chance of success whether they live in Cape Elizabeth or Fort Kent. This is how we break the cycle of generational poverty for Maine's children." That is why he has supported reforms to create choices for students and parents.

We must make sure we put kids first and provide them the education they need to succeed.

In addition to increasing funding, Governor LePage has taken the following important steps:

-Created a new incentive fund to support innovation among Maine's school districts.
-Supported expansion of the Bridge Year program with $500,000 in targeted funding to help high school students earn college credits while still in high school making post-secondary education more affordable for Maine families.
-Passed legislation that will decrease the cost of health insurance for school districts, allowing more money to be spent in classrooms.
-Initiated a red-tape review of Department of Education laws and rules to reduce burdens on local schools and teachers.
-Passed legislation allowing CHARTER SCHOOLS in Maine for the first time; so that Maine is now part of the more than 40 states in the country which have this option for parents and students.
-Brought in national experts with a Governor's Education Conference to hear from policy leaders around the country on ideas that work in improving education.
-Promoted STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education to better prepare our students for the jobs of tomorrow.
-Introduced and passed comprehensive new laws addressing educator effectiveness to ensure Maine's educators are evaluated regularly, given the training and support they need to improve, and are held accountable for student achievement and growth.
-Developed Maine's first statewide school accountability system (A-F school grades) to ensure transparency in school performance for families and students; joining other states and cities around the country who offer these grades on schools -- grades that are based on information Maine already collected but that had been sitting in file cabinets at the Department of Education.
-Enacted a series of reforms to improve Career and Technical Education in Maine and to make it a great choice for kids who find this as their best path to succeed.
-Supported Maine families in deciding what is in the best interest of their children by approving dozens of superintendent transfer agreements.
