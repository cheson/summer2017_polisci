Governor Paul R. LePage has designated $25,000 from his contingency funds to support services offered by Family Hope in Scarborough. Founded in 2012, Family Hope serves the needs of those struggling with mental illness by providing resources to their families and caregivers.
"Family Hope is an excellent example of Mainers working together to fulfill an unmet need in their community," said Governor LePage. "I commend the community of stakeholders who have dedicated themselves to supporting those who care for mentally ill loved ones."
Family Hope's services include recommendations for therapists and counselors, as well as phone support and one-on-one consultations. Their Family Support Navigator Program is equipped with licensed clinical social workers who connect families with resources, answers to questions and a "next steps" plan.
"Family Hope is dedicated to educating, providing encouragement and suggesting resources to aid family members of people living with mental illness in Maine," said Donna Betts, founder and executive director of Family Hope. "We are very grateful for this generous designation from Governor LePage to support our Family Support Navigator Program, an innovative, new model of support for these families."
According to Betts, 265,000 Maine families are affected by mental illness every year. "In a nation where 36,000 families every year experience the loss of a loved one due to suicide, Family Hope's work regarding crisis and suicide prevention is especially meaningful," said Governor LePage.
