Governor Paul R. LePage has signed an emergency proclamation to ensure Maine residents receive heating oil deliveries without delay.
"Frigid temperatures have hit Maine early this winter season, and our oil delivery drivers need the flexibility to be on the roads so Mainers can stay warm during these cold days," said Governor LePage. The State of Emergency proclamation will enable the granting of a waiver from the Federal Department of Transportation to allow heating oil delivery personnel to stay on the road longer to make sure homes and businesses stay warm.
The Governor also reminds drivers who are picking up extra hours to remain safe on the roadways. "We want to keep Mainers warm, but drivers and business owners should understand their limitations too," said Governor LePage.
The order is in effect until January 18 or until the Governor declares the emergency is over.
