Governor Paul R. LePage and Commissioner Anne Head of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation (DPFR) on Wednesday highlighted bills proposed by the Administration during this year's legislative session that would make it easier to hire and work in Maine.
DPFR oversees Maine's professional licensing boards, which regulate who may obtain or maintain a license to work in certain professions, including engineering, medicine, building trades, cosmetology and many more.
"One of the biggest challenges Maine businesses face is finding the qualified professionals they need to do the work that needs to be done," said Governor LePage. "For Mainers and people thinking of moving here, one of the biggest barriers to starting work is the regulatory wall they must scale in order to become licensed to practice their trade here. To keep our economy moving, we have to make it easier for people to work in Maine and for businesses to hire in Maine."
Three bills introduced by DPFR and its associated professional boards would remove barriers to professional entry for engineers, electricians, funeral practitioners and pump installers. Measures include allowing boards more discretion to license professionals from out of state, simplifying the process of professional examination, allowing experience to substitute for formal education and removing residency requirements.
Another bill focuses on veterans, allowing the director of the Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation to waive or amend licensing requirements at her discretion, under the consultation of the board, for veterans with military training and experience comparable to those required by civilian licensure boards.
