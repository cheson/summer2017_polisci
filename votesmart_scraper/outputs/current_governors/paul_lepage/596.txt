Governor Paul R. LePage said the state's hospitals will be paid the $484 million they are owed and that he'll issue $205 million in bonds, for a total direct investment of nearly $700 million into Maine's economy in 2013.
The Governor announced Tuesday he has submitted emergency legislation to the Revisor's Office that will authorize the State to immediately issue a revenue bond on its future liquor sales when enacted. The State will retain operational control over liquor sales starting in the summer of 2014 when the current 10-year private contract expires. That revenue bond would cover the $186 million the State owes its hospitals for MaineCare services dating back to 2009 and immediately trigger a $298 million federal match.
"Maine people work hard to pay their medical bills. This plan puts Maine on the right track to doing the same," said Governor LePage. "By paying the State's bills we strengthen our economy and the hospitals that care for and employ Maine people. Hospitals will be able do the same including paying new and existing employees and local vendors, pursuing capital improvements and maintaining the high level of service that has earned the state national recognition for quality care."
With that debt erased, the Governor said he will issue voter-authorized bonds, including $51.5 million for transportation infrastructure improvements and $53.5 million for conservation, clean water upgrades, and construction and energy efficiency at post-secondary educational institutions.
The Governor has also proposed a $100 million facilities bond for the construction of new corrections facilities in Windham, to be paid from savings generated by more efficient operations.
