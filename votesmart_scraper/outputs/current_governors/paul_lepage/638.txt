Location: Augusta, ME

On Friday, July 13, Governor Paul LePage and Representative Ken Fredette will hold a joint media conference in the Cabinet Room of the Office of the Governor at the State Capitol. Rep. Fredette will present the Governor with a check for approximately $18,000. The money was raised to fund the Governor's task force to explore electronic monitoring systems for domestic violence offenders. The conference is scheduled to begin at 10:15am.
Last year, Governor LePage signed an executive order to create a task force to explore electronic monitoring systems for domestic violence offenders in Maine. This seven-member task force is charged with assessing the most effective and affordable ways to utilize electronic monitoring tools in Maine, as well as the most efficient ways to implement these systems.
"This task force will help protect all of Maine's citizens," said Governor LePage. "Their work is crucial in protecting victims of domestic violence from their abusers."
Rep. Ken Fredette created the Electronic Monitoring Fund as part of the last Supplemental Budget passed by the Legislature for the purpose of giving the State the ability to accept and use donated funds for this purpose.
"I would like to congratulate Kelley Gay, the event organizer, for her hard work in raising so much money for this purpose. These privately raised funds will bring fundamental change to the process of how we in Maine deal with domestic violence." said Rep. Fredette.
The primary contribution to the fund came from the Second Annual Amy Lake Memorial 5K fundraiser, which was held last month in Dexter.
