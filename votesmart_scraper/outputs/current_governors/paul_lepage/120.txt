Governor LePage to Consider Tax Conformity Options
Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

Today Governor Paul R. LePage announced his plans to review recently passed federal legislation that makes a number of changes to federal tax law. The governor's review is necessary following changes made by the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016.
President Obama signed the legislation, known more commonly as the omnibus spending bill, into law on December 18, 2015. In addition to funding the federal government through September 30, 2016, the Act retroactively extended a number of federal tax relief provisions through the end of 2015 after they initially expired on December 31, 2014.
"Congress waited until the waning weeks 2015 to approve some tax breaks that will only be good for this year," said Governor LePage. "To their credit, Congress has made a number of so-called tax extenders permanent. However, delaying such important decisions unnecessarily burdens our small businesses as they plan their investments and estimate their tax obligations."
