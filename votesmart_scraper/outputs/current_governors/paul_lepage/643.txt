Location: Augusta, ME

Governor LePage announced today the details regarding two additional Governor's Workshops on Job Creation. The workshops will be held in Sanford and Presque Isle. The seminars are part of a series of industry-specific workshops designed to bring business leaders together to share ideas and concerns about government policy.
"It is critical that we work directly with Maine's business community to get input and feedback on what we can do to improve job creation in our state," said Governor Paul LePage. "Mainers deserve prosperity, and state government must be a partner to the business community, and not an adversary, in order to get Maine people back to work." On June 13, Governor LePage met with more than 70 people in Brunswick from the marine resources and tourism industries during his first job creation workshop of the summer. Karan Cushman and her husband own a Maine branding firm and commented that the workshop was a valuable experience. "The dialogue between business owners and government leadership is essential to creating resilient Maine industries, so thanks to you and the administration as well for initiating these conversations," Karan Cushman said.
