Governor Paul R. LePage released a statement today about a bill that seeks to limit the Governor's authority to issue voter-approved bonds.
"I represent all 1.3 million people in Maine, not just wealthy special interests," said Governor LePage. "Senator Katz and the other sponsors of this bill should be more concerned with keeping low-income Mainers warm than grandstanding for TV cameras. If they want LMF bonds released, they and their environmentalist friends should support my bill that would direct money from the state's timber harvest to help Mainers with more affordable heating options for their homes. How quickly these legislators forget what a bitter cold winter we just experienced. The snow may be gone, but my commitment to Mainers who need to stay warm will never go away."
