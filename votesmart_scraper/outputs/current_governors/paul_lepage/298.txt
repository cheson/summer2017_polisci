Today Governor LePage has made the decision to participate in the 5 pre-scheduled debates. This decision has come after much reflection over the past week on the value in debating Congressman Michael Michaud who has continually been dishonest with the Maine people about Governor LePage's stance on Social Security.

Governor Paul LePage:

"The Maine people deserve a leader as their governor, not a follower. It is a sad state of affairs that Congressman Michael Michaud is failing to step up to the plate and be honest with the Maine people. While I hoped he would come around and tell the truth prior to the debates, it appears he does not have the character that I once thought he had. As Governor I believe the Maine people deserve to hear real honest answers in the debates, while Congressman Michael Michaud has proven he is unable to be honest with Mainers, I want to make sure they get the record straight prior to the election."
