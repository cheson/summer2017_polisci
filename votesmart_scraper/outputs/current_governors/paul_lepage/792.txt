Good Morning. This is Maine Governor Paul LePage.
We knew we faced many challenges with the Department of Health and Human Services when we took office. Now that Commissioner Mary Mayhew and her new leadership team are in place, it is becoming clear that the problems with Maine's biggest state agency are worse than we feared.
Before I get into the problems, I would like to share some good news. Our new leadership team at DHHS is finding a great deal of energy and optimism among front line service providers within the department.
Many of the public servants at DHHS have great ideas and are ready to contribute to our reform effort. Working together, we are going to make the Department of Health and Human Services work for consumers, providers and taxpayers.
With that said, there has been additional debt uncovered within DHHS that is enormous.
Tens of millions in budgeting errors have been found which will likely require a new supplemental budget to bridge shortfalls in the MaineCare program through the end of the current fiscal year in June.
What we found includes sixty-six million in overpayments in Maine hospitals, a ten-million spike in weekly claims to MaineCare providers, and a nearly thirty-million dollar targeted case management lawsuit that D-H-H-S lost that will require the state to repay the federal government money we just don't have.
