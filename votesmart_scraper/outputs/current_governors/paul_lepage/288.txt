Governor Paul R. LePage announced on Thursday the successful establishment of the New England Ocean Cluster in Portland. The Iceland Ocean Cluster led by Thor Sigfusson, has partnered with North Atlantic Assets and Soli DG, Inc of Maine to establish the New England Ocean Cluster and New England Ocean Cluster House.
"This past June, I led a trade mission to Iceland where our delegation witnessed first-hand the work of the Ocean Cluster House," said Governor LePage. "This model is an excellent example of how private sector investment in innovation and cluster development can result in economic growth. I am proud of my administration's partnership with Iceland's Ocean Cluster and the new product development that will result from the establishment of a New England Ocean Cluster House in Portland."
This private sector enterprise is focused on commercialization of new products related to the Ocean as a resource. The goal of the cluster is to create, encourage and spinoff new companies and products with cluster members with the goal of utilizing 100% of materials being harvested from the ocean, while focusing on higher and higher margins.
"It is a spinoff factory," said Thor Sigfusson, "we create an environment where collaboration amongst our members happens naturally and we build upon new relationships with ideas, guidance, support, equity, whatever it takes to get moving."
Patrick Arnold of Soli DG, Inc., the US based ownership of the New England Ocean Cluster, was very excited to be working with Thor and the Iceland Ocean Cluster. "Maine has always had hard working people with great ideas. This is an opportunity to link up with and learn from some of the best talent overseas while creating new opportunities in Maine and New England," he said.
