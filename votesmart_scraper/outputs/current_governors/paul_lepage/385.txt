Governor Paul R. LePage today released a statement after the Maine Senate sustained his veto of LD 1487, "An Act to Implement Managed Care in the MaineCare Program."
"I am pleased that the Senate chose fiscal responsibility instead of spending millions of Maine's taxpayer dollars to expand welfare to able-bodied adults who have other options for virtually free health care. I commend the Senators who had the courage to stand firm against liberal politicians and do what is right for the hard-working Mainers who would have had to foot the bill for this massive expansion.
"We learned a hard lesson from the last time Maine expanded welfare, which had a disastrous effect on the state budget and failed to reduce the number of uninsured Mainers. Medicaid spending grew by one billion dollars, hospitals were owed $750 million, budgets were broken and thousands of elderly and people with disabilities were forced to wait for critical services. We cannot go down this road again."
