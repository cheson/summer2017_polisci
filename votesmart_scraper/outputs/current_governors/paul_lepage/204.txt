The Maine State Council of the Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) has kicked off the tenth annual "Best Places to Work in Maine" program. The program, endorsed by, Best Companies Group, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, The Maine Department of Labor, The Department of Economic and Community Development, Maine HR Convention and Mainebiz recognizes companies that have established and consistently fostered outstanding workplace environments.
"This program, for the past nine years, has been successful because of the great companies who recognize that part of their success is based on the importance placed on recruiting and retaining top talent," said Marcia Benner, State Director of the SHRM Maine State Council.
In June, Best Companies Group will survey all the Maine companies that have registered online by the deadline of May 22nd. The scientifically validated survey will incorporate a company's employee benefits and policies and responses from a comprehensive employee engagement and satisfaction survey. The data collected from the assessment will be used to determine the Best Places to Work in Maine.
"I'm pleased to support a program that takes care of their most valuable resource, which is the people who work for them," said Governor Paul R. LePage. "Maine's job creators help make our State the best place to live, work and raise a family. I look forward to hearing about who is at the top of the list this year."
The Best Companies Group "Employee Feedback Report" is presented to each participating company, even if they did not make the list. The report includes the summarized employee engagement and satisfaction data, the Maine Benchmark Report, and the transcript of employee written comments. The report is used by many to make significant improvements in their workplace culture.
