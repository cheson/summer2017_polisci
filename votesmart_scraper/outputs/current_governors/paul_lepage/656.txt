Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul LePage released today a comprehensive book of accomplishments of his first 500 days in office. The Governor's 500th day as Maine's Chief Executive is Saturday, May 19, 2012. The 20-page compilation, titled Making Maine Prosperous, The First 500 Days of Governor Paul LePage, details the achievements made by the LePage Administration and the State of Maine 125th Legislature. A web version of the book is free to the public and available on the Governor's website.
During the past 500 days, Governor LePage has proved he is able to keep campaign promises and improve Maine's economy. From January 2011 to March 2012, Maine's private sector grew by 4,100 jobs, according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics. The growth may be contributed to a number of initiatives, which are outlined in the book, including tax incentives which encourage job creators to invest in Maine and regulatory reform aimed to streamline the licensing and permitting process.
The state's unemployment rate has also declined since January 2011, from nearly 8 percent to 7.2 percent. During the past seventeen months, the LePage Administration has focused on developing job skills and training for Mainers searching for work. Under the Governor's leadership, the Maine Jobs Council, now referred to as the State Workforce Investment Board (SWIB), has been revamped to better address workforce development programs.
"Two of my greatest priorities as Governor relate directly to Maine's workforce." Governor LePage said. "We need to ensure students have the skills they need to be productive workers when they graduate, and we must get targeted training to people in the workforce today so that they can be competitive and successful in the job market."
The needs of Maine Veterans are being addressed within the Administration as well. Legislation was enacted to ensure that Veterans are given full credit for relevant military training and experience when they apply for an occupational license from the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation. Steps have already been taken to implement the intent of LD 1850, "An Act To Assist Maine's Current and Former Members of the United States Armed Forces", by making sure the expertise of Maine veterans is recognized and valued when they apply for a license.
Making Maine Prosperous, The First 500 Days of Governor Paul LePage also highlights other reforms led and/or supported by the Governor including changes made in the areas of
* Welfare
* Education
* Energy
* Domestic Violence
* Public Safety
* Regulatory/Red Tape
* Environmental Protection/Natural Resources
* Pension Debt
* Health Care
A free copy of the book, Making Maine Prosperous, The First 500 Days of Governor Paul LePage, is available on the Office of the Governor website. The published version of the book is available at the Office of the Governor.
