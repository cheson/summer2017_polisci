To pay tribute to those who perished in the July 6 train derailment and fires in Lac Megantic, Quebec, Governor Paul R. LePage will attend a memorial mass Saturday for the victims. Prior to the ceremony, the Governor will meet with Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche and other Canadian dignitaries.
"With a heavy heart, I will visit Lac Megantic, Quebec," said Governor LePage. "While a line divides our countries, it does not divide our people and it is important for Maine to support our northern neighbors during this time of need."
Maine-Canada Trade Ombudsman Daniel Deveau, who works within the Office of the Governor, travelled to Lac Megantic last week with a Maine Delegation from Franklin County. The Delegation assessed the needs of the area in an effort to provide ongoing support for the community.
"For years these two communities have forged relationships to share culture and economic growth. And in difficult times like this those bonds extend even farther," the Governor said. "Recovery work remains, and I have pledged to the people of Lac Megantic and the region our support."
Meanwhile, the LePage Administration continues to address environmental and transportation needs within the State of Maine as it relates to railroad safety. Immediately following the derailment, Governor LePage issued an Executive Order directing the Maine Department of Transportation (MaineDOT) to review the safety of freight rail transportation.
Additionally, Maine Department of Transportation Commissioner David Bernhardt has sent a letter to all five freight railroads operating in Maine requesting review and submission of best practices regarding the securing of parked freight trains.
