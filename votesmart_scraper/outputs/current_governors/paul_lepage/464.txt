Governor Paul R. LePage announced today that all remaining federally funded state employees who were laid off and or displaced to a different position because of the federal government shutdown will return back to work Friday. Department of Administrative and Financial Services began calling employees Thursday evening.
"It is unfortunate that we were unable to execute an agreement with the union, but they were dragging their feet and we couldn't wait any longer," said Governor LePage. "The most important thing is to get Mainers back to work in their original jobs and that's what we're doing."
Once the Governor received official confirmation from the federal government that the State of Maine would receive reimbursement for affected employees, the Governor felt it necessary to take immediate action to get Mainers back to work.
On Thursday morning, the Department of Health and Human Services brought back disability determination specialists to its Winthrop office. Late Thursday afternoon, the State received assurance from the federal government that 44 Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management employees would receive back pay and will be back on the job Frid
