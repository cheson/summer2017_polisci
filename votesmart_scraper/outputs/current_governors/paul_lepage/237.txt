Governor Paul R. LePage requests Mainers to observe the month of February as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. On Tuesday he will join domestic violence awareness advocates in his office to sign a proclamation and thank them for their work.
"There is no room for any type of violence in Maine and I will do everything I can to stop the abuse," said the Governor. "Raising awareness and supporting victims is very important and that's exactly what these violence awareness advocates are doing. I commend each and every one of them, who are truly making a difference."
On Tuesday, February 10, domestic violence awareness and prevention organizations will convene at the State House to recognize Domestic Violence Awareness Day. Informational material will be on display and shared with the public in the Hall of Flags on the second floor of the State House.
The Governor invites Mainers to join violence awareness advocates in helping to raise awareness on this important issue by encouraging statewide youth, families, schools, law enforcement communities, government agencies, elected officials, civic organizations and other interested groups to show support for the organizations and individuals who provide critical advocacy and services and assistance to victims.
