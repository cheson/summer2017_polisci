Governor Paul LePage this morning released the following statement regarding the passage of the budget in the Senate.
"I was pleased to hear the budget was passed in the Senate.
The fiscal integrity of our State is frail, but the passage of this bill today is a step in the right direction. As Chief Executive, these decisions are not easy, but they are necessary in order to avoid a financial crisis within our welfare system. Unlike the federal government, Maine must be able to pay its bills and achieve a balanced budget.
After meeting with Senate Democratic Leader Barry Hobbins Thursday morning, it was clear we could find common ground to ensure Maine Veterans are fully aware of the benefits they have earned. Since I came into office, I have been working with commissioners Mary Mayhew and Major General John Libby on this very issue. We will continue our efforts in this area and I was happy to reaffirm the Administrations' commitment in a letter addressed to both commissioners.
