Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 127th Legislature and honored guests. Welcome.
First, I must thank Ann and my children for their love and support during the last four years and particularly through the recent campaign, which was very negative. I'm so proud of their strength and resilience through it all.
I'm especially proud of Ann, who has dedicated so much to the veterans of our state over the past four years.
However, I hope she doesn't jump out of any more planes! Je dois aussi remercier mon coll�gue Franco Am�ricans pour leur soutien. Je suis un enfant des rues du petit Canada, je n'ai jamais imagin� qu'un jour, je deviendrais votre gouverneur.
Mais � vous prendre en charge, nous l'avons fait.
J'ai jamais oublier o� je venais, et je n'oublierai jamais votre soutien ind�fectible. Merci beaucoup mais aimee.
Well, folks, we're back. The national experts and the media said we wouldn't be here today. They forgot to ask those who matter most: the Maine people.
Pundits and pollsters don't determine why a person should be Governor. The people do.
For four years, we have been taking our message directly to the people of Maine. We let our actions speak for themselves.
That's what the people want: action. They are so tired of politicians preaching to the people and not listening to the people. They promise one thing, then do another.
