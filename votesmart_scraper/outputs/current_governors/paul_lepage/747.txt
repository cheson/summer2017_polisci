Governor Paul LePage announced Thursday a special legislative session will be held September 27, 2011 in order to consider a Congressional reapportionment plan.
Every 10 years Congressional redistricting is required to be updated based on census changes. A federal judge has ordered the Legislature to complete its work redrawing the line between Maine's 1st and 2nd Districts by September 30 to reflect population changes in the 2010 census. New districts will be in effect by the 2012 election.
"Action by legislators is an important step to ensure our Congressional districts have fair representation from the people of Maine," Governor LePage said Thursday.
A bipartisan commission of seven Republicans, seven Democrats and one independent moderator has already begun the process of redistricting. Representative Kenneth Fredette, of Newport sits on the commission and says the goal is to achieve a plan that will win overwhelming legislative support. "Commission members are working hard on a reasonable plan that reflects the changing dynamics of Maine's population," he said.
