"The death of Osama bin Laden is a tribute to the undying resolve our country has shown through the past decade. Osama bin Laden's death brings some measure of justice to the families who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001 and throughout the Global War on Terror.
Our Nation stands united as we remember the 2,752 Americans lost in the 9/11 attacks. Ann and I send our thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of those who were taken from us. Their memories have not nor will they ever be overshadowed by one man.
The freedom we all share in our Nation and State has not come without great sacrifice. Fifty seven soldiers with ties to Maine have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of the freedoms we hold dear. I am humbled by each and every military member's dedication and courage to our country. President Barack Obama should be recognized for his leadership in following through with a mission begun by President George W. Bush. While this does not mark an end to the Global War on Terror, it does give us reason to celebrate and reinforces the determination of our military and our counterterrorism professionals that serve us all so well."
Paul R. LePage Governor
