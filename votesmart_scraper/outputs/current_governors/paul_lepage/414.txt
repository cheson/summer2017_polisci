Chief Justice Saufley, members of the 126th Legislature, distinguished guests, and my fellow citizens:
Tonight, I am here to update you, the people of Maine, about the condition of our great state.
First, I must recognize a few individuals. To my lovely wife Ann and children--please stand--I would not be here tonight without you. Ann, you have made Maine proud as our First Lady.
Staff Sergeant Douglas Connolly, the military herald this evening, thank you for your courageous service to our state and nation.
As we thank our men and women in uniform, we are reminded of those who are not with us. Bill Knight greeted thousands of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan at Bangor International Airport.
A World War II veteran, Bill was part of the Greatest Generation. He died on Christmas Day at age 91. He made greeting the troops his life's most important duty.
Another veteran who is not here tonight is someone many in this chamber know and respect. Michael Cianchette, who was my chief legal counsel, is now deployed to Afghanistan.
Mike is truly one of Maine's best and brightest, and we send him our best wishes for a safe return home. Mike's lovely wife, Michelle, is here with us tonight. Michelle, please stand.
Our administration is working hard so young Mainers like Mike and Michelle can continue to live and work in our state. We want our young families to enjoy a growing economy that allows them to prosper and succeed.
