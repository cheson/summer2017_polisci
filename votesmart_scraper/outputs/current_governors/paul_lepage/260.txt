Governor Paul R. LePage released a statement today about the 5.7 percent unemployment rate for November, which is down from 5.8 percent in October and down from 6.4 percent one year ago. The number of unemployed declined 5,400 over the year to 40,200.
The employment-to-population ratio, which is the percentage of adults who are employed and is a better indicator of economic recovery has held steady. Since the Governor took office employment to population ratio has increased much more than it has nationally and remains well above the national average.
"Our policies are working, and more and more Mainers are able to get a job and support their family," said Governor LePage. "We will keep working until every Mainer who wants a good career can get one. When we work to lower taxes, create fair and consistent regulation and implement business-friendly policies, we help strengthen our economy."
The Governor added, "We are also looking at ways in which we can grow our skilled workforce. Ensuring Mainers are able to transition from welfare to work is a priority of our administration. Our administration is committed to transitioning a welfare recipient to a career. It takes dedicated resources, time and effort of both the person receiving benefits and those providing the support."
Private sector jobs were up 7,300 over the year, primarily in the professional and business services, education and healthcare sectors. The estimated decrease of government jobs is down by 400 from one year ago.
