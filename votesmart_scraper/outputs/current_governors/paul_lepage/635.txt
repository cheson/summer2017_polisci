Governor Paul LePage released today the following statement regarding Congresswoman Chellie Pingree's recent remarks about the Affordable Care Act:
"Historically, Maine's delegation has worked with the State on behalf of Mainers. Congresswoman Pingree has made it crystal clear that she's siding with the Obama Administration over the people of Maine. She is ignoring the will of the Maine Legislature and putting her ideological views ahead of the Maine people.
Unlike Congress, Maine must balance its budget and all the Congresswoman has done is made it harder for our state to be fiscally responsible. She's part of big bloated government that hiked the debt ceiling to $16.4 trillion and is now saying that Maine should be forced to increase the burden to the taxpayers she claims to represent."
