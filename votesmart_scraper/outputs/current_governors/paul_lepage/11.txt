Governor Paul R. LePage is calling out liberals who are attacking the American Healthcare Act by falsely claiming "essential services" are not included in the bill. Liberals are mounting a last-ditch effort to push these patently false talking points before the vote by the United States House of Representatives, which is expected today.
"The liberals are desperately trying to ensure the AHCA fails so they can maintain their massive web of expensive and inefficient federal regulations that have devastated our healthcare system under ObamaCare," said Governor LePage. "The AHCA seeks to return more health insurance regulation to the states--where it belongs--to create more affordable and accessible coverage for all Americans. Liberals think only Washington knows what insurance plans are best for Maine. But long before ObamaCare, Maine guaranteed that essential benefits were covered by insurance plans sold in our state."
Essential services, including maternity benefits and health insurance coverage of children, are regulated by the states. For example, in Maine, maternity benefits were enacted in 1975.
