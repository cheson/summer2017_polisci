Governor LePage: The Root of America's Violence is Mental Illness
Statement
By: Paul LePage
Date: Oct. 5, 2015
Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage has ordered flags on all public buildings and grounds to be lowered to half-staff immediately until sunset on Tuesday, October 6, 2015 in honor of the victims of the tragedy in Roseburg, Oregon.
While the shooting in Oregon is a tragedy and Americans will take time to mourn the victims, Governor Paul R. LePage is urging the President and politicians to address the root of such violence in America: mental illness.
"Mental illness is plaguing millions of American lives, but politicians don't want to talk about it," said Governor LePage. "We blame guns when our nation's problem with violence is really about people with mental disease getting access to firearms."
"It is our responsibility as a society to address mental illness in a comprehensive manner, instead of attempting to curtail constitutional rights. When mental illness is understood and a plan is established, we have an opportunity to prevent the other serious issues resulting from this disease, such as joblessness, homelessness, substance abuse, incarceration and loss of life," the Governor said.
