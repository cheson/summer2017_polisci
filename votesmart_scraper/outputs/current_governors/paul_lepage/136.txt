Governor Paul R. LePage announced today that Dr. William Beardsley will serve as Acting Commissioner of the Department of Education. Dr. Beardsley is former president of Husson University and served as commissioner of the Department of Conservation.
"Bill has a strong track record in Maine and elsewhere, broad constituency support and a personal interest in education," said Governor LePage. "Bill has contributed greatly to the Administration already and we are fortunate to have his support again."
In 2012, Governor LePage appointed Dr. Beardsley to the state Board of Education and earlier this year appointed him to the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Council. He will continue to work with both groups.
