Governor's Statement on Senate Passage of Marketplace Fairness Act
Statement

Governor Paul R. LePage released Tuesday this statement following Senate passage of the Marketplace Fairness Act:
"Maine's economy is in transition. Although we still want to attract large manufacturers, we also need to recognize that our economy is increasingly reliant on small businesses and start-ups. That includes a healthy concentration of retail businesses. They are the backbone of our economy and our communities. That is why I believe this piece of legislation has particular merit for the people of Maine.
There must be a level playing field and the rules need to be fair and applied equitably to all retailers. Unfortunately, a damaging inequity exists in the retail marketplace because some online retailers are not required to collect Maine sales tax, but Maine retailers are. Businesses must be able to compete on equal terms.
The Marketplace Fairness Act does not raise taxes. It simply provides for the collection of sales tax already due. I have pledged to lower Maine income taxes and stop wasteful government spending. One powerful tool in achieving these goals would be to have the ability to collect taxes that are due.
I want to thank Senator Susan Collins for her leadership on this legislation, and I urge Representatives Chellie Pingree and Mike Michaud to support it as it moves forward to the House."
