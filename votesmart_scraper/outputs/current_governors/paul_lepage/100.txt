Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage today released a statement about the closure of Madison Paper Industries based on falling demand for the supercalendered paper it produces.
"We are saddened to hear that 214 Mainers will be losing their jobs, and our thoughts go out to them and their families," said Governor LePage. "With the rapid decline of daily newspapers and other publications, it is not surprising the demand for supercalendered paper is plummeting. This unfortunate situation illustrates the challenges Maine companies face in the national and global marketplace. That's why it is more important than ever to make sure Maine is competitive in attracting new job creators and retaining existing companies by lowering taxes, reducing energy costs and providing a welcoming atmosphere for businesses and capital investment."
