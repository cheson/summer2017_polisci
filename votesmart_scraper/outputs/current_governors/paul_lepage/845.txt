As Mayor of Waterville, Paul knows the grip Augusta has on our local communities. Unfunded mandates, broken promises, and unreasonable regulations force too many communities to raise property taxes. Paul will eliminate the unnecessary policies driving up our local tax burden, and will make the state an ally, not a roadblock, to local governments trying to serve the people.
While Paul is Governor, he will:
* Roll Back Unfunded Mandates to Reduce Property Taxes. Paul will eliminate unnecessary unfunded state mandates to empower Maine cities and towns to reduce our property tax burden. If the state places requirements on towns, the state should pay for them, not local residents.
* Respect Local Decision Making. As long as laws are followed and liberties are protected, Maine's cities and towns should be able to govern without interference from the state. Local control is what makes Maine a great place to live and raise a family. Local control will be preserved and defended while Paul is Governor of Maine.
