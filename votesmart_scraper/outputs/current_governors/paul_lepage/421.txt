Welfare expansion will cost Maine more than $800 million dollars over the first 10 years. That's worth saying again. Over the next decade, if Maine expanded welfare, it will cost taxpayers more than $800 million dollars.
Hello, this is Governor Paul LePage.
While liberals are busy blasting me and the Administration about hiring a consultant to analyze whether we should expand Maine's Medicaid program, the reality is the report provides a road map to save taxpayers money and improve services for the truly needy.
This week our Administration provided Mainers and lawmakers The Feasibility of Medicaid Expansion under the Affordable Care Act. If Maine opts to expand Medicaid as it did 10 years ago, the report estimates it will cost the state more than $800 million--and that's without additional risk factors. It does not include the hundreds of millions of dollars that will be shifted onto the middle class who buy their insurance. This will cause private insurance premiums toskyrocket.
When risks like the poverty rate and costs of care are taken into consideration, Maine could pay up to $3.2 billion over 10 years.
History does repeat itself, as you well know, we just paid off the hospital debt from the 2002 expansion.
Maine already has the third-highest spending on Medicaid in the nation. Expanding is not affordable.
The report also predicts between 31 and 36 percent of all Mainers will be receiving taxpayer-funded health care by 2023. In other words, for every three Mainers, one will be on Medicaid at the taxpayer's expense.
