Location: Augusta, ME

Today Governor Paul LePage signed LD 19, An Act To Change The Annual Meeting Date And Fiscal Year of Mount Desert Island Regional School District, into law. The bill is the first of the 125th session to reach the Governor's desk. The emergency piece of legislation goes into effect immediately.
The Governor was accompanied in his office on Friday morning by bill sponsor Rep. Elspeth Flemings of Bar Harbor and cosponsor Sen. Brian Langley of Hancock.
L.D. 19 is a bill that changes the annual school budget meeting date for Mount Desert Island Regional School District from the 2nd Wednesday in February to the 1st Wednesday in April and conforms the district's fiscal year to requirements of the Maine Revised Statutes.
"L.D. 19 makes an important fix that will benefit the Mount Desert Island High School and taxpayers by enabling the high school to develop a more efficient and accurate budget," Rep. Flemings said. "The issue was very time sensitive and I'm pleased that I was able to work with Sen. Langley and the Governor's Office to move this bill forward so quickly."
"A big part of being Governor is working with Democrats and Republicans to make sure government is responsive," said Governor Paul LePage. "I am glad that the first law to take effect under my name was sponsored by a Democrat, supported by a Republican and puts people first."
