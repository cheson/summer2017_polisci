Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

After an early winter storm knocked out power to tens of thousands of Mainers and made travel conditions treacherous across the state, Governor Paul R. LePage today issued an emergency proclamation that will allow utility crews to drive additional hours to repair lines and restore power.
"The storm will leave the State overnight, but getting power restored is expected to take several days," said Governor LePage. "Our first concern is to get power back on for Mainers. Please stay safe and keep off the roads to allow utility crews to do their work."
As of 4 p.m. today, CMP reported outages for about 79,000 customers; Emera reported outages about 39,000 customers; and Eastern ME Electric Co-Op reported outages for about 2,000 customers.
"DOT is keeping up with roads," said Governor LePage. "The storm will wind down this evening, allowing DOT to continue their work. Our main concern for tomorrow will be getting all the power back on. Make sure you have what you need to weather the storm, and then check on neighbors who may need some extra help."
The Governor's "Emergency Proclamation for US-DOT Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Hours of Service Waiver" is in effect from November 2 to 9.
