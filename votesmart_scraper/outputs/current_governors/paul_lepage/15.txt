As your Governor, I want all Mainers to prosper. Providing opportunities for people to help themselves is the best pathway to success.
Hello, this is Governor Paul LePage.
Unfortunately, liberals believe a bigger government, higher taxes and more spending is going to help Mainers prosper.
For decades, they spent millions of taxpayer dollars on welfare programs with no accountability. They increased the tax burden on families and businesses, driving them out of state.
Now Maine has the second-highest income tax in the United States. Some folks have told me they can no longer afford to live here. In a time when we need to attract people into our state, we are driving them away with bad tax policies. I received a letter from a 67-year-old a man in Westbrook.
His name is Robert. In 1973 he and his wife Marti moved to Maine. They both started with low-paying jobs, but they worked very hard to become successful. They raised a family with two children and put them through college--one at Bates, the other at University of California-Berkeley.
Now, after 44 years in our great state, Robert and his wife are being forced to leave because of high taxes. They must decide whether to stay here or buy a home in Florida or Texas, both of which have no income tax.
