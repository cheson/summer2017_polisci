The following statement was released from Governor Paul LePage regarding the recent announcement Portland International Jetport officials released confirming Southwest Airlines commitment to the City of Portland.
"I am pleased to hear that Portland International Jetport made the competitive list of AirTran Airways locations that will continue to be served during the merger with Southwest." said Governor LePage on Monday. "The potential for expanded routes and more competitive fares is great news for the City of Portland as well as the rest of the state and certainly increases the possibility of more jobs at the Jetport.
