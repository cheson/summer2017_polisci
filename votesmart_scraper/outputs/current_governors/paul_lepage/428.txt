Paul LePage has spent his entire career creating jobs, resulting in thousands of jobs for the people of Maine.

As a successful Maine business turnaround specialist, and later as the General Manager of Mardens stores, Paul LePage proved you can create jobs in Maine even in the middle of a recession.

Now, as Maine's Governor he has successfully put that experience to work proving actions speak louder than words.

Since Governor LePage took office more than 10,000 new private sector jobs have been created. Major new companies have moved to Maine. More Maine people are now employed. The unemployment rate has dropped -- so far a 20% reduction in the rate from where it was when the Governor took office.

Under Maine's last Governor the unemployment rate in Maine was higher than the national average for some time. That has never happened under Governor LePage. We can't turn back to the failed policies of the past.
Governor LePage:
-Held job creation and red tape cutting workshops all over Maine, working with local Chambers of Commerce, to hear directly from small businesses on what they needed to help grow the economy and create jobs. Not made-for-tv moments, but real meetings with the Governor in the room working with small businesses.
-Helped cut taxes for businesses creating jobs.
