Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement regarding the deadly shootings in Dallas:
"It is a dark day in our nation. The First Lady and I send our thoughts and prayers to the families of the brave law enforcement officers who lost their lives as they protected others. As Maine grieves with the rest of our nation, we also pray for the wounded."
"This targeted and hateful attack is the epitome of evil. Our nation is built on a foundation of freedoms not hatred. Times like these determine a nation's character and as Americans we have a responsibility to uphold our integrity and beliefs through strong leadership. We will not stand for acts of violence of this nature and we as a people will rise up to unite and trust that justice will be served to those who commit such violence against our society."
"As Maine law enforcement officers from Calais to Kittery mourn for their colleagues, we are keeping in mind our own brave men and women in uniform as they serve and protect. We are grateful for the service you provide our great state and its citizens. This and every day, we want you to make it home safely to your family and loved ones."
