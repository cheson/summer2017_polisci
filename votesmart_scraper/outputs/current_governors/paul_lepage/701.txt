2012 can be a year of promise that moves the Maine economy forward or it can be an election year full of political rhetoric and impasse. I prefer the former.
This is Governor Paul LePage.
In 2011, Republicans were able to achieve progress during the 125th first regular session to move Maine ahead.
In my first budget I addressed pension reform. On January 5, the State of Maine faced a $1.3 billion budget shortfall and a $4.1 billion shortfall in the state pension system. We eliminated $1.7 billion while protecting retirees' future pensions through sensible reform.
Health care reform was passed that will lead to more affordable insurance.
Red tape was removed from government and the overall attitude within agencies toward its customer, you the Maine citizen, has improved.
As promised throughout my campaign -- a 5-year cap on welfare benefits was implemented.
School funding was increased and charter school legislation was adopted.
Maine's Transportation Department saved more than $100 million which allows more money to be used to improve our roads and bridges this year.
