Governor Paul R. LePage today praised initial actions by the ConnectME Authority to accelerate efforts to deploy high speed broadband service in Maine.
In December, Governor LePage suggested ConnectME to focus on investing more in modern internet service in underserved and unserved areas. Specifically, the Governor requested ConnectME to adopt a definition of "unserved" to those areas without access to broadband download and upload speeds of 10 Mbps, which is the minimal upload speed. The higher standard will help ensure limited state funding currently available will support the expansion of broadband.
"Maine needs to modernize our infrastructure, and broadband is a significant part of a modern economy," said Governor LePage. "I support the effort to increase the technology that the State supports and appreciate the work of the Public Advocate to push for bring high speed internet to Maine's homes and businesses."
The proposed definition of a minimum of 10 Mbps would be a first step and is consistent with the basic broadband speeds currently available in markets around the country. Recently the Federal Communication Commission required those companies receiving federal subsidies for broadband to provide at least 10 Mbps.
"Broadband access is vital to doing business in today's world. These sorts of investments open the gate to making Maine more competitive in attracting new businesses, expanding current businesses and creating new jobs," said Governor LePage.
