Maine Attorney General Bill Schneider announced today that the State of Florida will move the federal court to allow Maine to join the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the federal health care reform law.
"I am pleased that Maine is now among the states standing against the individual insurance mandates included in the federal Affordable Care Act. We are not a free people if the government can compel a private citizen to purchase a private product like health insurance. I applaud Attorney General Bill Schneider's decision," said Governor Paul LePage.
"Our experience is clear. Over regulation and cost shifting has created one of the most expensive health care systems in the country here in Maine. More of the same for more of the country is not the right solution for Maine families and small businesses."
