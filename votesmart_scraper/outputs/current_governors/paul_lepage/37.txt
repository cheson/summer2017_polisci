Governor Paul R. LePage today issued the following congratulatory statement to President-Elect Donald J. Trump:
"I congratulate Donald Trump on his historic, hard-fought and well-deserved win. I look forward to his ability to unite our country, put us back on the path to prosperity and restore our strength in the world. This election was a triumph for the American people, who rose up to defeat the forces of corruption, the political establishment and the elitist, out-of-touch media. We can now get to work to improve our economy, honor our Constitution, complete our Supreme Court and bring fiscal responsibility to our government."
