Statement of the Governor on Transparent Communications Between Executive and Legislative Branches
Statement

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement today regarding a letter from Democratic Committee Chairs, who complained about the Governor's request for transparency in communications between the Executive and Legislative Branches:
"I respect the deliberative process and understand that the legislative committees of jurisdiction request information and attendance of Executive Branch employees from time to time. In fact, my entire Administration and I have worked hard to assure that the legislative committees of jurisdiction receive pertinent and timely information as requested.
"In August, I provided a letter to Senate President Justin Alfond and House Speaker Mark Eves, asking that all requests for communication with Commissioners or other agency leadership or staff to attend a committee meeting be directed to me or include me as a cc on correspondence to a department.
"I have made no secret of this policy and I will continue this policy because it is a business-like and a professional approach to managing the relationship between two separate but equal branches of government. The previous relationship resulted in an inefficient use of Executive Branch resources and was disrespectful of the time and work of Commissioners and staff. Furthermore, there was a significant lack of transparency for all Mainers.
Mainers deserve access to a more transparent process and a public record between the two branches."
