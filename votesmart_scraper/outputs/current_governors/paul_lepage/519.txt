Democrats' Try to Shift Blame for Stalling on Bonds
Statement

Date: July 3, 2013
Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage announced today that he has already ordered the release of taxpayer-authorized general obligation bonds, despite Democrat leadership's false accusations that he is delaying the bonds.
On Tuesday, Senate President Justin Alfond claimed the Governor was holding up bonds, putting "jobs on the line and resulting in "roads crumbling."
"Justin Alfond should read his mail," the Governor said. "I wrote a letter on May 23 directing the Democratic State Treasurer to prepare the bonds. I have kept my word to the people of Maine, and I have released the bonds. My administration is working to make funds available while the Treasurer continues to prepare the bonds for sale."
On May 23, Governor LePage vetoed welfare expansion and reintroduced his bill to pay Maine's hospital debt. In the public ceremony held in the Hall of Flags, the Governor directed Democratic State Treasurer Neria Douglass to prepare the voter-authorized bonds for his signature.
"It's laughable that Senator Alfond is trying to shift the blame when it took him nearly six months to pay Maine's hospital debt," said Governor LePage. "He now claims that he is waiting to craft a strategic bond package. But that's just another delaying tactic. Democrats have no strategic plan. Once again, Alfond and the Democrats have shown that it is more important to them to play politics than to put Mainers back to work."
