While there is potential for serious flooding with some of the State's snowpack yet to melt, Governor Paul R. LePage says Maine's emergency management officials and resources are ready to respond, if needed.
Governor LePage met with the River Flow Advisory Commission (RFAC) on Thursday morning at the Maine Emergency Management Agency in Augusta to get information about the flood risk. The RFAC includes the US Geological Survey, Maine Geological Survey and the National Weather Service. State, county and local emergency managers and the State Emergency Response Team were also involved.
"In the event of serious flooding, Maine's emergency management team of state, county and local personnel and resources is well-prepared. We can't control Mother Nature, but we will do all we can to protect life and property," Governor LePage said.
While forecasts are still being developed, minor to moderate flooding on rivers such as the Kennebec appears possible; ice jam flooding potential is a concern in central regions and in the north; and small river and stream flooding is possible in all areas. Those in flood-prone areas should monitor local conditions and weather forecasts closely over the next 48 hours.
In preparation for flooding and any response and recovery efforts that may result, Governor LePage signed an Executive Order on Thursday updating the State of Maine emergency response and disaster recovery teams.
"When the State is responding to a major emergency, coordination among all the departments is critical," said Governor LePage. "This order ensures all proper procedures and people are in place to deal with all aspects of a disaster -- preparedness, response and recovery."
