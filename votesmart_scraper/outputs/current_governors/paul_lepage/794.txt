Governor Paul LePage welcomed home 173 members of the 1136th Transportation Company (SECFOR) of the Maine Army National Guard returning from Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom this morning at the Augusta Armory. The 1136th Transportation Company had served a year in Afghanistan.
"You have some of the most difficult work to do and you have sacrificed so much for your State and Nation," Governor LePage told the Troops. "Maine is proud of all you. I am proud of all of you. Your service is greatly appreciated and we are happy to have you home."
The soldiers deployed last March to Afghanistan, where they provided security for bases and convoys against Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces.
The 1136th Transportation Company is stationed in the Sanford, Bangor and Calais. In 2003, the unit deployed to Kuwait and Southern Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
