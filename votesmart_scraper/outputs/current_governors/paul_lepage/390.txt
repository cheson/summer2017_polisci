Governor Paul R. LePage released a statement today after the Legislature rejected four bills he proposed to reform welfare.
"I'm appalled that liberal legislators would reject these common-sense bills to reform our welfare system. Despite overwhelming data and firsthand accounts by well-respected law enforcement officials, liberals keep saying welfare fraud and abuse is "anecdotal.' Mainers are rightfully outraged their hard-earned tax dollars are being abused, and they know these liberals are out of touch with reality. Once again, they are playing politics instead of doing what's right for the Maine people.
"These liberal legislators and the media claim there is only a small percentage of fraud and abuse, but that percentage adds up to millions of wasted taxpayers' dollars. While they squabble over what percentage of welfare fraud is acceptable, our Administration is working to stop 100 percent of welfare fraud."
The Governor's proposals are less strict than those in Massachusetts, which has a Democratic Governor and Democratic majority in the Legislature. In Massachusetts, it is illegal to use EBT cash to purchase alcohol, tobacco, bail, firearms, lottery tickets, jewelry, tattoos, body piercings, pornographic performances or vacation services. Massachusetts EBT cards cannot be used in casinos or on cruise ships. They cannot be used in stores that sell pornography, ammunition, rent-to-own furniture or manicures.
