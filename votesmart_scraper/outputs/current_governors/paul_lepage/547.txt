Governor's Statement on the Democrats' Failure to Pass Common-Sense Welfare Reform

Governor Paul R. LePage today issued a statement on the party line vote by Democrats to allow welfare recipients to use their food stamps to buy junk food.
"Democrats once again have demonstrated an extreme agenda by obstructing any and all common-sense welfare reforms," said Governor LePage. "The inconsistency of the majority party continues to stun me. On one hand, they talk about wanting to reduce health care costs. But on the other hand, they encourage people to eat junk food with absolutely no nutritional value, all while being funded by Maine taxpayers.
"Maine people can simply not afford a government that squanders their valuable tax dollars," said the Governor. "Mainers expect their elected officials to make the tough decisions needed to improve Maine's economy and the lives of the people who live here. Enabling welfare recipients to buy junk food with taxpayer money doesn't accomplish either."
