Monday morning, Governor Paul LePage celebrated the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during a community breakfast in Central Maine.
"For the past several years, I have attended the Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Breakfast in Waterville," said Gov. LePage. "I am continuing that tradition this morning, joining members of the greater Waterville Community in honoring the memory and work of Dr. King."
Spectrum Generations and the Waterville Rotary Club hosted its 21st Annual Community Breakfast honoring the life and works of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at Spectrum Generations Muskie Community Center in Waterville.
The Governor joined more than one-hundred people who took part in the event, which featured keynote speaker Reverend Effie McClain of the Oakland-Sidney United Methodist Church. African drummers, songs and music were also part of the festivities.
"Dr. King is someone who spent and ultimately gave his life making sure that people got a fair shake regardless of race. We have come far through the years, but the journey continues to make Dr. King's dreams a reality," said Gov. LePage. "I urge all Mainers to work as one for a better life for all."
Last week, Gov. LePage signed a proclamation declaring January 17, 2011 "The Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service" in Maine. Governor LePage signed the proclamation to honor Dr. King and to encourage Mainers to give back to their communities as King did. The King Day of Service is the only federal holiday commemorated as a national day of service.
