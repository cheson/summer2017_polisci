Statement

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement today responding to suggestions from the Mayors' Coalition on how to balance the upcoming two-year budget:
"The Coalition proposed three options: raise taxes, raise taxes or raise taxes. How original," said the Governor. "However, they don't address the real problem facing our state, which is out-of-control government spending.
"When I was mayor, I was able to reduce taxes without reducing services. I know that it can be done if local officials are willing to make the same difficult decisions I made as mayor.
"I made the tough choices when I presented my balanced budget four months ago. The state cannot keep spending money we don't have, and I will not keep adding to the tax burden of hardworking Mainers."
