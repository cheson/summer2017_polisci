Question 1 is not just bad for Maine, it can be deadly.
Marijuana kills people on the highways. Traffic deaths in Colorado have increased dramatically.
Marijuana is 3 times stronger than it was in the 1980s.
People addicted to marijuana are 3 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.
Heroin is already killing 5 Mainers a week. We don't need to legalize another drug that could lead to more deaths.
THC levels in marijuana snacks are so high, they could kill children and pets.
Pot snacks look like cookies, candy, gummy bears and soda. Children can't tell if there is weed in these snacks.
People will smoke marijuana in pot stores right next to schools, daycare centers and churches.
They will smoke weed and sell pot at state fairs.
Businesses could not fire employees for using marijuana.
Before you vote, please educate yourself on this dangerous issue.
