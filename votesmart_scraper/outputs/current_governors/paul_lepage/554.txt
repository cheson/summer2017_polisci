Hello. This is Governor Paul LePage.
In the coming weeks, you will read and hear about my Administration's initiative to grade schools. I announced this plan in February during my State of the State Address, and since then the Department of Education has been working on it.
Thirteen states and New York City have adopted the A through F grading system since Florida introduced it in 1999.
When you hear about A through F grading, you understand immediately what the letters mean. We chose A through F grades because we all know what they mean.
We also know that no one score or grade tells the whole story of a school. That's why our grading system is based on several factors, including student achievement in reading and math, growth in achievement, and the performance and growth of the bottom 25 percent of students (for elementary schools) and the graduation rate (for high schools).
DOE staff is working with school administrators to educate them about how we scored their school. We would like this to be a transparent process for everyone including teachers, students and parents. We would like these grades to encourage parents to become more involved if they are not already. And we would like this to start a real conversation on how we can work together to improve learning experiences for our children. We must put our students first.
Unfortunately, some legislators and union leaders have already attacked this approach, saying this "sends the wrong signal to our schools, teachers, students, parents and community." Democrats have even gone so far to say that providing a letter grade equates to brandishing schools with a "scarlet letter."
