Governor Paul R. LePage and First Lady Ann M. LePage today joined Bureau of Veterans Services Director Adria Horn, veterans and their families as they announced the Maine Veterans Legacy Project, a program helping to preserve the living histories of our veterans.
The Veterans Legacy Project provides an opportunity for all generations of Maine families to connect to our military heroes and enables citizens to actively volunteer to protect American history.
"This special program connects our past, present and future generations in a way that touches your heart. Our veterans are living history, and when you listen to some of their stories it brings tears to your eyes," said Governor LePage. "It is our responsibility to ensure these memories are saved and shared with fellow Mainers and Americans."
