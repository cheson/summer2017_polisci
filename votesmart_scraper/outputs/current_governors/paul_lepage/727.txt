Governor Paul LePage announced today the final closing has occurred on the purchase of the Katahdin area mills. The State and its partners including Cate Street Capital and Brookfield Asset Management took the final steps necessary Wednesday morning to complete this much anticipated sale.
"With hundreds of people starting to get back to work, it's a great day for Maine," said Governor LePage.
"I appreciate all the hard work and perseverance of Cate Street Capital, Brookfield Asset Management and members of my Administration to make this happen. This was a very long and complicated process, but everyone involved was focused on putting Mainers back to work. With the soaring unemployment rate in the Millinocket area we're excited to restore these jobs and explore new areas for economic growth."
