Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage on Friday signed an emergency proclamation to ensure Maine residents receive heating oil deliveries without delay.
"Our oil delivery drivers need the flexibility to be on the roads so that Mainers stay warm during the coldest part of winter," said Governor LePage.
The State of Emergency proclamation will enable the granting of a waiver from the Federal Department of Transportation to allow heating oil delivery personnel to stay on the road longer to make sure homes and businesses stay warm.
The Governor would also like to remind drivers who are picking up extra hours to remain safe on the roadways. "We want to keep Mainers warm, but drivers and business owners should understand their limitations too," said Governor LePage.
The order will remain active for 10 days, beginning on January 09, 2015, the day the order was issued, or until the Governor declares the emergency is over.
