In the spirit of Agriculture Day, held in the Hall of Flags this morning, Governor Paul LePage signed LD 1689 "Resolve, To Exempt Maple Sugarhouses from the 1,000-foot Setback Requirement of the Maine Land Use Regulation Commission."
"I was pleased to sign this bill which further reduces red tape in Maine's maple industry," said Governor LePage. "This bill takes an important step toward reducing the cost of doing business and streamlining the permitting process for Maine's job creators. In order to make Maine prosperous, we need to work with businesses, so they can expand and produce more jobs for Mainers," continued the Governor.
LD 1689 directs the Maine Land Use Regulatory Commission to amend its rules to exempt maple sugar houses from the 1,000-foot setback requirement. The bill significantly streamlines the process that developers undergo when building sugar houses. This bill is also expected to reduce the costs associated with the permitting process for sugar houses.
