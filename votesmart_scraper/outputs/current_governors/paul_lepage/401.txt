Governor: Solar and Wind Energy Will Not Help Mainers Heat Their Homes
Statement

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement on today's Ought to Pass report on LD 1252, "An Act To Improve Maine's Economy and Energy Security with Solar and Wind Energy," from the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology:
"Mainers are already struggling with high heating oil prices and a cold winter. Now, with the recent announcement by the PUC, they will soon be incurring more than a 10 percent increase in electricity prices. You would think that this situation would lead Augusta to help Mainers address their heating costs and promote cost-effective technologies, such as efficiency or heat pumps.
"Instead, liberal politicians in the Legislature have been entirely focused on imposing a new fee to provide a rebate for something that Efficiency Maine Trust has determined does not meet their cost-effectiveness test. This is an old, regressive policy that will take $1 million from hardworking families and give it to the very few who can afford solar. It is exactly the wrong way to develop a long-term policy for solar. It will not help the average household struggling with energy costs. This is not the way to move our economy forward."
