Every Maine citizen has a right to know what government is up to and how it spends our tax dollars. Paul will require all state spending to be posted online, and he will fight for stronger laws to protect and expand Maine citizens' right to access information from state and local government. When Paul is Governor, open government will be a reality, not a talking point.
While Paul is Governor, he will:
* Post All State Spending Online. Paul wants taxpayers to have the ability to see how the state spends their money--every single dollar of it. Paul will require all spending from every state agency and office be posted online in user-friendly formats to empower taxpayers with more information. Government is spending your money, and you should know where and how it spends it.
* Strengthen Maine's Freedom of Access Law. Any roadblocks Mainers face in the pursuit of public information from a governmental entity must be torn down. Paul will fight for a timelier, more inclusive Freedom of Access law, and require each governmental entity to designate an officer to oversee all requests for public information.
* Turn Televisions into Windows. Paul will provide Maine people with real-time access to their government by creating a Maine version of C-SPAN so people can watch live proceedings from the Maine Senate, House of Representatives, important committee hearings, and key gubernatorial presentations. Maine people deserve a close look underneath the State House dome to see what politicians are up to.
