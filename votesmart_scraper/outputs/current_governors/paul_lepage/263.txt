Statement

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement regarding the Senate District 25 election recount:
"I thank Senate President Thibodeau for his integrity throughout this process, in which liberals falsely accused Republicans of trying to manipulate the election with so-called "phantom ballots'. President Thibodeau followed the proper procedure to ensure the electoral process was upheld while awaiting the final decision from the Senate committee. It is unfortunate that Cathy Manchester had to endure a situation that was created entirely by the Secretary of State's office during the recount. We thank her for her service."
