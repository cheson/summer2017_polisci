Governor Paul R. LePage today announced that it has recently come to his attention that a contract executed by the Maine Military Authority (MMA) was underbid, resulting in unexpected costs to Maine taxpayers and putting good-paying jobs at Loring Development Authority in jeopardy.
Governor LePage has major concerns and expects more details in the coming weeks to become available about MMA's $19 million contract with Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MTBA).
"While we continue to work toward reducing costs as we renegotiate the contract terms, we must be reassured about the continuation of this contract as we move forward. We cannot in good faith create a financial burden to taxpayers and we will work to protect these good jobs for Mainers," said Brigadier General Douglas A. Farnham, who serves as Adjutant General, Maine National Guard and also as Commissioner for the Department of Defense. "We intend to personally discuss the issue with MMA staff and Massachusetts officials and act appropriately."
The Maine Military Authority, an instrument of the State of Maine with manufacturing operations and more than 50 employees in Limestone, entered into the contract in late 2014 to refurbish 32 articulated transit buses for MBTA.
