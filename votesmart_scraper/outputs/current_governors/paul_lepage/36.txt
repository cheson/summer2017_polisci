Governor Paul R. LePage today issued the following statement regarding the announcement from Twin Rivers:
"The paper industry is not dead. I commend Twin Rivers for its efforts to rebrand the pulp and paper industry. While the need for newsprint and other commodity papers continues to decline, we are beginning to see investments in other products, which our mills can support and remain competitive within the industry.
Now more than ever, it is important to make sure Maine is competitive in attracting new job creators and retaining existing companies by lowering taxes, reducing energy costs and providing a welcoming atmosphere for businesses and capital investment.
Maine is the only New England state in which industry is the largest energy-consuming sector. If the incoming Legislature is serious about strengthening the Maine economy, then it must reject above market energy contracts and seek low cost energy that does not harm the environment. In return, we will help job creators expand, hire more workers and bolster the Maine economy."
