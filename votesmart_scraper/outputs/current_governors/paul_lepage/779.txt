Governor Signs Casino Related Bill
Press Release
By: Paul LePage
Date: April 25, 2011
Location: Augusta, ME

The Governor signed Monday LD 677, "An Act Regarding the Determination of Distance for the Purposes of the Gambling Control Board Laws." The bill clarifies a law requiring a minimum 100-mile distance between state casinos.
Governor Paul LePage inked his signature to the bill, saying it makes sense to base the distance on how people would drive to the casino rather than as the crow flies "Crows don't gamble," the Governor said.
