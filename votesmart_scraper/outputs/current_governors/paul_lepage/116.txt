Governor Paul R. LePage has signed a limited Emergency Declaration allowing electric utility contractors from Canada into Maine to assist with power restoration efforts following Sunday's strong rain and wind storm.
There were approximately 27,000 outages Monday morning and assistance is needed to aid in rapid restoration efforts. The declaration will help Maine power providers pre-place their crews by extending the hours their crews can drive.
"This effort will allow power crews to restore power in areas that were impacted by the storm," Governor LePage said. "The ability to have electrical service repaired quickly is critical to protect public health and safety of Mainers."
The Governor's proclamation waives Federal Department of Transportation rules and extends the hours of service for workers, and allows additional crews from other states to assist with repairs.
