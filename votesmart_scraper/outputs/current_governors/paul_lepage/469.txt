Governor Paul R. LePage released today the following statement with regard to Statoil's announcement to close the Hywinds Maine project:
"The Administration has been perfectly clear through the regulatory process that the term-sheet offered by Statoil was ironclad in its cost -- placing a $200 million burden on Mainers by way of increasing electric costs. Additionally, the corporation was ambiguous in its commitment to growing Maine's economy.
"Through bipartisan legislation the Governor and the Legislature worked to ensure that additional competition could be considered prior to embarking on a 20 year plan for Maine's offshore wind industry and to finalize the best contract for Maine by the end of the year. With electric rates the 12th highest in the country we must continue to attract lower cost electricity that will grow Maine jobs."
