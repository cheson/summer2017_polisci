Governor Paul LePage will attend the first of three workshops organized by the Aroostook Area Agency on the Aging today in Fort Kent to listen to concerns and provide facts on the supplemental budget proposal.
The Governor spoke with the executive director on Thursday to let him know he would attend the Fort Kent session. The three workshops are designed to provide information and give residents the opportunity to discuss concerns and get information on the budget.
"We have proposed a plan that saves Medicaid for 290,000 people," says the Governor. "It is important that I hear concerns from the citizens and ensure they have all the facts."
Two other workshops are scheduled for later in the week in Houlton and Presque Isle.
