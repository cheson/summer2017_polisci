Statement of Governor LePage on Gestapo Comment
Statement
By: Paul LePage
Date: July 9, 2012
Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul LePage released the following statement Monday regarding his recent radio address in which a comparison was made of the Internal Revenue Service to the Gestapo:
"It was not my intent to insult anyone, especially the Jewish Community, or minimize the fact that millions of people were murdered.
Clearly, what has happened is that the use of the word Gestapo has clouded my message. Obamacare is forcing the American people to buy health insurance or else pay a tax. Our health care system is moving toward one that rations care and negatively impact millions of Americans.
We no longer are a free people. With every step that Obamacare moves forward, our individual freedoms are being stripped away by the Federal Government. This should anger all Americans."
