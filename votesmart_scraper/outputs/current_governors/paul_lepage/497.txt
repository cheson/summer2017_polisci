Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement following the unanimous endorsement this afternoon by the Legislature's Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee a bond package he'd initially introduced.
The $149.5 million package includes the Governor's original proposal of $100 million for infrastructure improvements to Maine's highways, bridges, ports and railroads, critical to the economic development of the state. The Appropriations-approved proposal also includes $14 million that the Governor requested for military armory upgrades and $35.5 million for higher education.
"Investing in transportation infrastructure is critically important to rebuilding not just our roads, rails, bridges and ports, but Maine's entire economy," said Governor LePage. "Today's unanimous support of my bond package from the Appropriations Committee puts Maine further down the road toward prosperity and increased productivity. I look forward to this package being approved by the full Legislature next week and by Maine voters this November so construction crews can quickly get to work and people and goods can continue to move safety and swiftly in and out of our state."
