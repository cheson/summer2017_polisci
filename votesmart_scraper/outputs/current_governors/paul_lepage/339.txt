Statement

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage released a statement today about the 5.5% unemployment rate for June, which is down from 6.7% in June a year ago and is the lowest since August 2008.
The employment-to-population ratio--the percentage of the population who are employed and a better indicator of economic recovery--is 61.6%. June was the 81st consecutive month the employment-to-population ratio was above the national average.
"Since we took office, almost 22,000 private-sector jobs have been created in Maine," said Governor LePage. "There are still plenty of jobs available, including almost 7,000 posted on the Maine Job Bank. Combined with our efforts to move individuals from welfare to work, there are more opportunities than ever for Mainers to get good-paying jobs that will improve the quality of life for them and their families."
The number of private-sector jobs is up 8,800 from one year ago. The number of government jobs is down 800.
"We have made progress, but we cannot stop now. Maine is still facing economic challenges that resulted from decades of failed policies from the past," said Governor LePage. "Our aging population presents a difficulty we must overcome to continue with economic and job growth. That's why we must keep working to bring more companies with good-paying jobs to our state, which will help attract and retain more young people and families. We must continue our efforts to transform Maine from a high-tax state with a large welfare population to a low-tax, business-friendly state that encourages companies to create good-paying career jobs for Maine families."
