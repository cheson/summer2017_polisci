Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul LePage addressed Maine Wood Products Association (MWPA) members during their annual meeting on Monday, January 9th, 2012 in Hallowell.
Governor LePage focused on what he considers Maine's three most important industries --farming, fishing and forest products. "Forestry and the wood products industry add tremendous value to our economy and our goal is to do more to assure that this industry thrives," the Governor told the crowd. "To help Maine strengthen its economy and boost competitiveness our Administration is working hard to reduce energy prices."
Maine currently has the 12th highest energy costs in the Nation -- 42 percent higher than other states. "Energy costs are being driven up so high that they are killing job opportunities in the State of Maine."
In addition to lowering energy prices, the LePage Administration is focused on improving the natural resource economy by merging the State of Maine Agriculture Department and Conservation Department into a single division, a proposal that was announced last fall. Governor LePage shared the plan with MWPA members stating that the merger will result in a natural resource based agency geared toward providing important services to the industry and working together with industry to address its needs and help move it forward.
The Maine Wood Products Association is a non-profit organization that assists Maine's secondary wood products industry with business, technical and marketing assistance. Based in Belfast, the MWPA has approximately 100 members statewide and also manages the Guild of Maine Woodworkers.
