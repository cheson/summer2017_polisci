Governor Paul R. LePage today signed an Executive Order directing rulemaking authority for the Marijuana Legalization Act to the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations (BABLO).
The "Order Regarding Executive Branch Implementation of the Marijuana Legalization Act" authorizes the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to direct rulemaking authority granted under the "Marijuana Legalization Act" to the Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services for rulemaking by the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations. BABLO already has expertise in managing retail sales, licensing and enforcement, as well as the process of rulemaking.
The Executive Order further outlines that no employee or department of the Executive Branch may use funds for the purpose of implementing the Marijuana Legalization Act until an appropriation is made by the Legislature for that purpose.
"The Executive Branch must be provided with the resources necessary to implement this new law," said Governor LePage. "We submitted language to direct rulemaking to BABLO and requested funding from the Legislature to implement it, but the Speaker of the House killed it. The longer Democrat leadership plays these political games, the more they show the Maine people who they really are. If they fail to do the right thing, I will take action to make sure rulemaking for the Marijuana Legalization Act Mainers is done properly and paid for appropriately."
The Executive Order language is as follows:
An Order Regarding Executive Branch Implementation of the Marijuana Legalization Act
