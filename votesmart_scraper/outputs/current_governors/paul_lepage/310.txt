Governor Paul R. LePage will visit Jotul's plant in Gorham to welcome jobs back to Maine. One-hundred percent of the Jotul brand wood and gas stoves, inserts and fireplaces sold in North America will now be manufactured in Gorham.
"I am pleased to see another internationally renowned Maine business bringing jobs and manufacturing back to our state," said Governor Paul R. LePage. "We congratulate Jotul on their expansion. As we continue to make Maine more competitive with lower taxes, lower costs for heat and energy and a better business climate, we will be able to retain and gain more jobs like these. We will show Jotul that Maine appreciates their capital investment."
Jotul North America currently imports approximately 9,000 wood stoves from their parent company in Fredrikstad, Norway to be sold throughout North America. Jotul AS will continue to produce the cast iron parts and flat pack them to Jotul NA where they will be assembled.
Jotul North America employs approximately 75 people and sells approximately 17,000 wood and gas stoves, inserts, and fireplaces throughout North America annually. It is considered the dominant cast iron player in the North America hearth products market.
