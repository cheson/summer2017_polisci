On Thursday, January 5, 2012, Governor Paul LePage chose to veto three bills that were passed during the first regular session of the 125th Maine State Legislature last year.
L.D. 1264, L.D. 338, and L.D. 205 were rejected by the Governor.
In the Governor's veto letter regarding, L.D. 338, "An Act to Provide an Income Tax Credit for Persons Engaged in Commercial Forestry," a bill sponsored by Sen. Troy Jackson, D-Allagash the Governor writes, "I intend to come forward with a tax relief package later in this session to ensure that our commercial timber harvesters receive the same sales tax treatment on equipment as their counterparts in the agriculture industry receive. As the Legislature is aware, my Administration is working to merge the Department of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Resources and the Department of Conservation to ensure that Maine will have a strong natural resource-based economy well into the future. This bill would place farmers and forestry on different footings, which works against the policy of creating uniformity and equity in our 21st-century natural resource-based industries."
The letter continues to read, "Further, this bill will likely do little to achieve its proposed objective -- encouraging timber companies to hire Maine residents. The amended version allows full access to the $1000 fuel tax credit as long as someone from Maine is employed by the company. Quite frankly, there are better ways to give our loggers tax relief and allow them to create jobs in our working forests. I look forward to working with the Legislature on finding and implementing those better ways."
