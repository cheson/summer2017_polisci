Press Release

Location: Washington, DC

Maine Chief Justice Leigh Saufley delivered the State of the Judiciary Address Thursday morning which received high praise from the Governor. During the annual update Justice Saufley addressed courthouse security and providing adequate legal services for the poor, however, Governor Paul LePage took special notice to her efforts involving domestic violence.
Justice Saufley highlighted in her speech that bail commissioners will no longer have the authority to set bail for accused domestic violence offenders unless there is access to the Maine criminal record of the accused offender. This effort is consistent with the Governor's efforts to ensure bail is set appropriately.
"I applaud Chief Justice Saufley for taking a proactive step which will ensure the safety of the public. Any type of violence against a person is a threat to their well-being and we know domestic violence can be particularly harmful and escalate quickly for those who are in relationships," said Governor LePage. "I commend the leadership of the Chief Justice for this renewed focus on domestic violence and implementation of meaningful change which will benefit many Mainers."
