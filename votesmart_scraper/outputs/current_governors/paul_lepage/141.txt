Statement of the Governor on Lincoln Paper and Tissue Bankruptcy
Statement
By: Paul LePage
Date: Sept. 28, 2015
Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement Monday regarding Lincoln Paper and Tissue filing a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maine:
"Until the Legislature addresses the high cost of energy in Maine, which is a major burden on our manufacturing industry, mills like Lincoln Paper and Tissue, Verso Paper and Old Town Fuel and Fiber will be forced to shut down. Every decision I make as Governor is geared toward making Maine more competitive. Unfortunately, too many legislators can't say the same. Their strict adherence to high-cost energy policies will surely result in the loss of more jobs."
"I will do everything I can to lower energy costs. We are now in partnership with four other New England states working to expand natural gas and hydropower into our region. We must move forward with bold energy legislation, rather than stick with status quo policies that are adding costs to employers and hurting employees."
"Meanwhile, the State will continue to work with LPT management to assist in any way we can to provide the best possible resolution."
