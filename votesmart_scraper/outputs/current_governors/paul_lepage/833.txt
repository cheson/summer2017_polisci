Issue Position

Paul will get government out of the way and allow Maine's small businesses to create jobs. It's time to get Maine working again, and that means tearing down the roadblocks that establishment politicians have built over the past 40 years. Smaller, smarter government is the key to new jobs and financial security for Maine families.
While Paul is Governor, he will:
* Issue a full review of every state regulation. Government agencies will have to prove their regulatory policies improve Maine and are not costing us new job opportunities.
* Unleash Maine's entrepreneurs. Paul will promote a speedier permitting process, immediate capital expensing, and additional tax deductions for business purchases. He will also fight to eliminate statewide fees on start-ups so small business owners can create new jobs in Maine.
* Prepare future job creators for success. Paul will strengthen the relationship between government, the business community and public and private schools to identify Maine's economic opportunities, and how education reforms can help young people meet them and succeed.
* Support Maine industries. Paul knows local industries are a vital component in economic recovery in Maine. As Governor, he will ensure that agricultural, marine resources, forestry and other local industries are protected and able to grow.
* Lower Taxes, Controlled Spending
* Patient-Centered Health Care
* Student-Focused Education Reforms
