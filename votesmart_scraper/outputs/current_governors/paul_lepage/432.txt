Governor LePage understands government authority comes from the people. The government is there to work on behalf of the people -- it is not the other way around.

Too many politicians put politics before the people. For Governor LePage that is unacceptable.

Governor LePage's goal is to ensure the government is there to protect the freedoms of Maine people. Our freedoms are inherently outlined in the first two sections of Maine's Constitution:

Section 1. Natural rights. All people are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.

Section 2. Power inherent in people. All power is inherent in the people; all free governments are founded in their authority and instituted for their benefit; they have therefore an unalienable and indefeasible right to institute government, and to alter, reform, or totally change the same, when their safety and happiness require it.

Our state Constitution outlines freedoms which are also enshrined in our national Constitution under the 2nd Amendment.

Our Maine Constitution states under Section 16: To keep and bear arms. Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms and this right shall never be questioned.

It is clear the government should not infringe on the right to keep or bear arms. Governor LePage has vetoed and resisted efforts to harm those rights and he will continue to support these freedoms outlined in our constitutions.

Over and over again the Governor has vetoed or stopped laws which would go too far and infringe on our freedoms.
