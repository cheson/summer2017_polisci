Statement of Governor LePage on VA Scandal
Statement
By: Paul LePage
Date: May 23, 2014
Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage today released a statement calling for action from President Barack Obama as a result of the administration's "failed leadership" to ensure accessible healthcare for our nation's veterans:
"I am deeply disturbed by the inaction of the President of the United States. The unscrupulous politics surrounding the VA right now is intolerable and an embarrassment to our nation."
"The VA has systemic problems, which are severely entrenched within bureaucracy and there has been an absolute failure of accountability within the agency. The failed leadership of the Obama Administration demonstrates a complete lack of compassion and care for our veterans who have given so much to our great nation."
"Congressman Mike Michaud, Ranking Member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee has had six long years to fix problems within the VA and demand change. Instead, during an election year, just last month, he decides to propose reform -- too little, too late.
"It is my hope that the Obama Administration will do the right thing and fix the VA with action not empty promises."
