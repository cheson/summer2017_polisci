Press Release

Date: Sept. 18, 2012
Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul LePage will be travelling to Erskine Academy in South China to speak with students and raise awareness about domestic violence in Maine. The event will be held tomorrow, September 19, from 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.
"Teens are in touch with what's going on around them and I want them to know that they have the power to stop domestic abuse," said Governor LePage. "While the majority of domestic violence victims are women, this is not only a women's issue, and women cannot be expected to be solely responsible for stopping the abuse. Young men must be the solution to eliminating this heinous behavior. My message to students is that when we all stand up, speak up and man up we will make it socially unacceptable."
During the Governor's presentation he will distribute informational booklets that include a personal letter from the Governor, as well as helpful resources to assist victims of domestic violence. Additionally, each booklet has a wristlet promoting domestic violence awareness with Governor LePage's motto "If it is to be, it is up to me."
"A gentleman once told me those ten words that changed my life. I hope students will take away the message that ending domestic violence is a community effort, and it is up to all of us to speak up against this horrific crime," said Governor LePage.
