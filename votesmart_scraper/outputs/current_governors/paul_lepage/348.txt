LePage campaign spokesman Alex Willette Issued the following response.

"Governor LePage does not think Social Security is welfare. That is preposterous, and the liberals intentionally took it out of context. It was Governor LePage who proposed the elimination of income taxes on seniors' pensions. The Governor will always support and defend Social Security and will always protect our seniors."
