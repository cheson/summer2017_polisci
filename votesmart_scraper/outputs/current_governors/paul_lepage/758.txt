Statement
By: Paul LePage
Date: June 28, 2011
Location: Augusta, ME

The following statement was released Tuesday from the Office of the Governor. The statement is regarding Maine experiencing the highest state rate of casualties in Afghanistan.
"It is with great sorrow we recognize so many of our own have given the ultimate sacrifice. The loss of one life is too many and Maine has sacrificed 19 brave souls to the war in Afghanistan. These losses are a testament of the patriotism our fellow Mainers encompass and I am forever indebted to them.
Our history demonstrates that Mainers have always answered the call of duty to defend our State and Nation. During the Civil War, the First Maine Heavy Artillery experienced the highest number of casualties in a single battle. It's estimated that Maine soldiers suffered an 18.9% casualty rate, including deaths by disease, the highest percentage of loss for any Union state during the war.
We continue to have large numbers of military members serving and I salute them for their dedication to the defense of our freedom. If it were not for our service members' commitment, from the past and present, we would not be the great Nation we are today or will be tomorrow."
