Governor Paul R. LePage expressed disappointment Wednesday as the Committee on Taxation voted against eliminating the income tax burden on Mainers. Committee members voted 7-5 along party lines with one member absent. Absent members have 24 hours to vote.
"The people of Maine should know how their legislators are voting, and only then will politicians be held accountable for their actions. It is a disgrace for these politicians to refuse Mainers the opportunity to vote on eliminating the income tax," said Governor LePage. "I urge people to demand to know why their legislators don't want you to have a say in the process."
