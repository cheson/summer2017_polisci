The character of a Nation is within its people.
Hello, this is Governor Paul LePage.
Our men and women in uniform have courageously defended our country for more than 250 years and continue to do so to this day. Along with our Nation's history of patriotism and honor comes an expectation of commitment and care to our veterans long after they leave the battlefield.
This is where America's character shines through.
The Veterans Affairs scandal is disappointing, to say the least. I have urged the federal government to fix these systemic problems. We need leadership in Washington that is helping our veterans, not hindering their support services.
America takes care of the men and women who have so bravely fought and sacrificed to defend the freedoms we share. As a people, it is our duty to demand our federal government follow through on its promises.
In Maine, we have the distinct honor of having one of the highest numbers of veterans by population among all states. We have nearly 128,000 veterans, each one deserving more than empty promises of accessible, quality health care.
Our Administration has worked hard to fight for veterans. We have enacted laws to ensure our veterans are given full credit for their military training and experience when they apply for an occupational license from the state.
