Location: Augusta, ME

Governor LePage announced today the details regarding the fourth and final Governor's Workshop on Job Creation to be held this summer. The workshop will be held in the Roberts Learning Center at the University of Maine Farmington, on August 15, 2012. The seminars are part of a series of industry-specific workshops designed to bring business leaders together to share ideas and concerns about government policy.
"It is critical that we work directly with Maine's job creators to get input and feedback on what we can do to improve the business climate and job creation in our state," said Governor Paul LePage. "Mainers deserve prosperity, and state government can act as a partner to the private sector, allowing more opportunities for Maine people to get back to work," continued the Governor.
Previous workshops have been held throughout the months of June and July in Brunswick, Springvale, and Presque Isle.
