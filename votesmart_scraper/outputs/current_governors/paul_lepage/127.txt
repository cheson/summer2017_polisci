The First Lady and I opened the Blaine House doors again this month for our annual food drive, and we were pleased to see the generosity of Mainers helping other Mainers.
Hello, this is Governor Paul LePage.
Mainers travel from all parts of our State each year to donate food to needy people they have never met. The holidays are often hard for the less fortunate, so it is truly heartwarming to see their fellow Mainers stepping up to help. We were humbled by the hundreds of Mainers who came to donate thousands of pounds of non-perishable foods. The Good Shepherd Food Bank will distribute the food to those who need it most.
As I reflect on this Thanksgiving season, I am thankful for my family and for the generous spirit of the people of Maine. Instilling the gift of service to others has always been very important to Ann and me. Our children were raised to understand that while receiving something is always nice, giving to others is even more rewarding.
Giving back to your community is an important part of being a good citizen and a good neighbor.
I am someone who has been in need. But it wasn't the government that helped me out. I never forget that it was the commitment and love of Maine people who gave me the support I needed to succeed. Government should certainly provide a safety net for our most vulnerable, but government programs do not change lives: people do.
Mainers have a long tradition of caring for their neighbors as they care for themselves and their own families. And when you extend your goodwill, it has a way of encouraging others to do the same. So, as we approach the holiday season, let's take a moment to pause and reflect on what it is we are thankful for. Let us also think about how we can contribute to our communities and the future of Maine.
