Statement

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul LePage released the following statement today on Maine's Supreme Court ruling which states the Land Use Regulation Commissioner did not violate rules when the agency approved Plum Creek's development plan.
"This court decision affirms our belief that good land-use planning, conservation easements on working forests and expansion of the eco-economy in the Piscataquis and Somerset counties can be founded on common ground. I commend Plum Creek, conservation groups engaged in the easement, LURC, the forest industry and the Greenville community on their achievement.
First comes the establishment of working-forests conservation easements that exceed the combined acreage of the Baxter State Park and Acadia national Park, then the permit process. The work has just begun!"
