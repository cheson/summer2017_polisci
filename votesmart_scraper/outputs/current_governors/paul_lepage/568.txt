Hello. This is Governor Paul LePage.
Our first education conference was a great success, and I would like to thank everyone who participated. One of those participants was Mohamed Nur. He is a sophomore at Deering High School in Portland. He is a high honors student, a Maine Seeds of Peace leader, and he is very enthusiastic about his future.
But Mohamed noticed that not all students were as eager as he is to learn. So, he asked his peers why. The answer surprised him. He was told that they were uninterested in class because they didn't like how or what they were being taught.
That answer led to a dialogue between Mohamed and his classmates. And that conversation is one every superintendent, principal, teacher, and parent should engage in, too. How do we motivate our students to learn?
A quality education is critical to any child's well-being and future success. The status quo no longer works. Accountability, best practices and multiple options will help Maine students excel.
First, we must create a system with accountability. By measuring school performance and providing assistance to struggling schools, we can improve achievement.
High-performing states like Florida put accountability and improvement systems in place to identify schools needing support and then provide them with the tools and resources to succeed. In this legislative session, we're proposing similar reform in Maine.
Options must be available to students and parents. In other words, they need choice. Giving students more learning options and the ability to determine what school is best suited for them will enhance every student's public education.
