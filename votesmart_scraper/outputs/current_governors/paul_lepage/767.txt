Bill to Ban Texting Receives Governor's Signature
Press Release
By: Paul LePage
Date: June 3, 2011
Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul LePage signed today legislation that aims to improve safety on Maine roads. The bill sponsor, Senator Bill Diamond joined the Governor Friday as LD 736, "An Act to Prohibit Texting while Driving" was signed into law.
"All too often we see drivers with one hand on the wheel and their attention diverted from the road to a cell phone," said Governor LePage. "While many motorists are able to multitask as they drive, the safest driving is done when drivers direct full attention to the road and their surroundings. The intent of this bill is to improve safety for everyone using Maine roads."
Senator Diamond who served as Maine Secretary of State from 1989 to 1997 is a member of the Transportation Committee and has been an ardent supporter of legislation focused on transportation safety measures. In 2009, the Senator sponsored Maine's distracted driving law which took effect that same year.
"Texting is addictive, and doing it while you are driving is very dangerous. It is going to take a cultural change to break people, especially young people, of the habit. Making this dangerous behavior a violation is a good way to get people to recognize the seriousness of this activity, and to keep people from doing it."
The law will go into effect 90 days after legislative session ends.
