September eleventh, now ingrained as nine-eleven in our minds, revealed an unthinkable tragedy and the beginning of modern day war.
Hello. This is Governor Paul LePage.
As we take time out of our busy schedules this Memorial Day weekend for barbecues and ball games, let us pause to pay tribute to those who have fought in the defense of our freedoms. Let us remember those who have sacrificed their all.
Mainers have fought in many battles since the Civil War -- the Spanish-American, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the two Gulf Wars, and Afghanistan, among others. Thousands of lives have been claimed to the perils of war -- 51 brave souls since nine-eleven alone.
They all served with honor, integrity and courage.
I ask you to take this moment of silence with me to remember every Maine Soldier, Sailor, Coast Guardsman, Airman and Marine who has died on the front line or otherwise.
{Moment of silence}
This Memorial Day weekend I extend my thanks to the families of our fallen military men and women. We are forever indebted to your loved ones' service and sacrifice. It is fitting, that this weekend, Mainers from across our State will remember and honor those who have passed with a powerful statement. Thousands of American flags will be placed by volunteers near each grave at Maine Veterans' Memorial Cemeteries.
