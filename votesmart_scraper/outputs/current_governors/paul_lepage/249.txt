Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage on Friday signed an emergency proclamation to ensure Maine residents receive heating oil deliveries without delay.
"Our oil delivery drivers need the flexibility to be on the roads so that Mainers stay warm during the coldest part of winter," said Governor LePage.
The State of Emergency proclamation will enable the granting of a waiver from the Federal Department of Transportation to allow heating oil delivery personnel to stay on the road longer to make sure homes and businesses stay warm.
The Governor would also like to remind drivers who are picking up extra hours to remain safe on the roadways. "We want to keep Mainers warm, but drivers and business owners should understand their limitations too," said Governor LePage.
The order will remain active for 10 days, beginning on January 09, 2015, the day the order was issued, or until the Governor declares the emergency is over.
The text of the proclamation follows:
Governor's Emergency Proclamation for US-DOT Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Hours of Service Waiver

WHEREAS, homes and businesses alike are impacted; and
WHEREAS, federal motor carrier safety regulations determine the number of hours the drivers of heating fuel and bulk petroleum delivery and transport vehicles may operate; and
WHEREAS, many drivers in the State will shortly be approaching their federal limit on hours of operation and may have to cease delivery of heating fuel and bulk petroleum fuels; and
WHEREAS, these conditions threaten essential public health and safety services and endanger public property if heating fuels and bulk petroleum products cannot be transported or delivered within the State of Maine; and

LePage, Governor of the State of Maine, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of Maine, find that these conditions constitute a civil emergency under 37-B M.R.S.A. section 742, and for the purpose pursuant to 49 CFR part 390.23 of facilitating a waiver to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, specifically 49 CFR part 395 Hours of Service of Drivers, do hereby declare that a State of Emergency within Maine for heating fuel and bulk petroleum delivery drivers as of January 9 through January 23, 2015.
