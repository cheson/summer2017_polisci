Statement

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement with regard to LD 1354, "An Act to Improve the Maine Administrative Procedure Act":
"Rule-making is delegated to the Executive Branch by the Legislature. In this process, agencies are entrusted to write regulations. Repeatedly, we are unable to do this important work because we have an Attorney General who says the agency rules are illegal."
"As Governor, I do not have the sole authority to create laws. The Legislature passes laws and the executive branch implements and enforces those laws. Rule-making by the Executive Branch is a necessary step to ensure laws are carried out in a meaningful and just manner. In a perfect world the Legislature, which passes laws, would do this work."
"When the Attorney General inserts veto power, the executive branch is unable to complete the work of the people. Our bill seeks to restore and strengthen the balance of the separation of powers by realigning the Attorney General's role in rule-making to that of an attorney rather than that of an executive." Cynthia Montgomery, chief legal counsel, for the Governor testified on this bill Monday. Testimony is here.
