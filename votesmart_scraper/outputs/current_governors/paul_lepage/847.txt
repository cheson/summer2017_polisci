Paul's energy policy is very simple: Maine people and Maine companies will have the opportunity to make energy choices that put price ahead of politics. Paul's administration will not be in the business of picking favorites when it comes to energy. In fact, Paul's plan is to let consumers make their own choices, while his administration focuses on policies that offer consumers choices that lower their energy costs.
While Paul is Governor, he will:
* Promote the Power of More. Biomass, wind, co-generation, nuclear, solar, tidal and hydro all offer tremendous potential for lower costs as well as a more diverse, local energy source. In short, Paul's administration will welcome any energy that can compete on price. It's that simple.
* Empower Consumers. We can use the tax code to create incentives for renovation, efficiency and conservation. What's important is that we put the consumer in the driver's seat on how best to lower their energy costs.
* Capitalize on Maine's Unique Advantage as an Energy Corridor. Paul's administration will focus on a strategy to tap into new power sources to provide at-cost power to the local economy as a part of their doing business in Maine. It will be a priority for Paul's administration to secure access ramps along the transmission corridor to further enhance Maine's energy choices.
