Press Release

Date: March 3, 2011
Location: Augusta, ME

Nearly one-hundred Mainers who favor Governor LePage's fiscal reforms stood in the frigid cold Thursday outside the State House to support the Governor's budget proposal. News Talk WLOB Radio Hosts Ray Richardson organized the rally.
Governor LePage made an impromptu appearance to thank those who travelled from across the state to stand up for fiscal responsibility within State government. "When we campaigned last year we said that we were not going to have status quo. We were coming here to fix the problems. We are here to fix our problems," said the Governor. "I appreciate your support. We are going to continue the fight of bringing fiscal sanity to State government."
Meanwhile, Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee members continue with public hearings on the Governor's budget proposal (L.R. 2067).
