Issue Position

Paul will reduce Maine's excessive tax burden so Maine families can keep more of their own money. You know how best to spend or save your hard-earned wages, not government. Paul will control state spending to guarantee lower taxes, while ensuring our highest priorities and programs for our most vulnerable neighbors are supported.
While Paul is Governor, he will:
* Institute Zero-Based Budgeting. Paul's general fund budgets will start at zero to ensure departments and programs get necessary funding without added taxpayer dollars that will go to waste. The Augusta way has failed. During times of economic crisis, simply tweaking the previous budget is irresponsible. Paul will start from scratch to protect Maine taxpayers from excessive spending.
* Commission a Full Audit of Every Government Agency. Mainers have footed the bill for duplicated government programs, questionable travel reimbursements, and departments that have nothing to show for the millions in tax dollars they receive. Paul will commission an independent, top-down audit of state government to identify waste and abuse of our tax dollars.
* Institute Performance Benchmarks. As Governor, Paul will require all government departments and programs set and meet goals designed to ensure tax dollars are spent wisely and Maine citizens are receiving the services they should expect from government.
* Fight to Cut Income Taxes. Paul wants a flat, 5% income tax rate for Maine families that take home at least $30,000. Paul will also work for a flat 5% corporate income tax rate for businesses earning between $30,000 and $500,000.
* Cut the Car Tax. Paul will require that the automobile excise tax we pay be tied to a vehicle's actual purchase price instead of the MSRP. Paul will also reduce the excise tax 20% per year thereon.
