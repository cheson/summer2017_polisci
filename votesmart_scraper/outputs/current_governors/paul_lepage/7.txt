Governor Paul R. LePage released a statement today on Maine's unemployment rate reaching the lowest it has ever been since the current statistical system was established in 1976. Maine's unemployment rate for March was only 3%, which is down from 8% when Governor LePage took office. The national average is 4.5%.
"Maine now has the lowest percentage of government employees in the workforce since 1976 and the highest number of jobs in the private sector ever," said Governor LePage. "This shows that our efforts to lower taxes, reform welfare and bring fiscal responsibility to government are working. Liberals are trying to reverse all the progress we have made by raising taxes and expanding welfare. We must work even harder now to continue our progress and stop the liberals from harming the economy with their tax-and-spend policies."
The unemployment rate has been below 4% in 14 of the last 17 months--only the third such period in the last 41 years, according to the Department of Labor. The preliminary nonfarm payroll jobs estimate of 623,000 for March was up 5,300 from one year ago, reaching a new all-time high.
The private-sector jobs estimate of 523,200 also was a new high. The percentage of government jobs is the lowest share on record.
