Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement today regarding the announcement that Sappi Limited will invest $165 million at its Skowhegan mill:
"This significant investment is welcome and demonstrates the commitment Sappi has to Maine," said Governor LePage. "Sappi is capitalizing on an opportunity in the packaging market. Our paper mills are not dead, but they do need to reinvent themselves. Sappi has identified new markets and technologies that will ensure the company continues to make superior products and employ Mainers with good paying jobs for many years."
While this news is promising for Somerset County, the Governor continues to encourage legislators to turn their attention to the rising energy costs in Maine. In the Governor's State of the State Tuesday evening he emphasized how high energy prices have a devastating effect on the paper industry and many mill workers have been laid off as a result.
"We have slipped from 12th to the 11th highest energy prices in the Nation. When Maine businesses are forced to pay more for energy and taxes it is less money the company is able to invest in its employees with higher wages and benefits. We must encourage our economy to grow and we do that by supporting good policies that do no harm to Mainers or the environment. We can achieve a balance between the economy and environment when we pass policies focusing on the lowest cost renewable energy resources and the least effect on the environment. It's a win-win for Maine families, businesses and our natural resources," said Governor LePage.
