Governor to Raise Awareness about Human Trafficking at Upcoming Summit
Statement
By: Paul LePage
Date: Nov. 9, 2015
Location: Augusta, ME

The Office of the Governor and the Not Here Justice in Action Network have partnered to host the conference, which will educate attendees about the exploitation of women and children, discuss labor and sex trafficking in Maine, develop best practices regarding reporting policies and procedures and advance the effort to create a statewide action plan to combat human trafficking in Maine.
As Governor and throughout his life, Governor LePage has been an outspoken advocate for reducing domestic violence in Maine. Governor LePage also supports anti-human trafficking efforts, signing in 2014 a law making sex trafficking an affirmative defense to the charge of prostitution, preventing victims of trafficking from being branded with a criminal conviction. The Governor also declared January 25-31, 2015 as Human Trafficking Awareness Week.
"No one person, organization, agency or community can eliminate human trafficking on their own, but we can work together to educate our entire population about how we can all prevent human trafficking and support victims, survivors and their communities," said Governor LePage.
