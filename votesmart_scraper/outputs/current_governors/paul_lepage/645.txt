Governor Paul LePage joined state officials at the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation and Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other agencies and Maine organizations, in focusing attention on World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, which is recognized each June 15th throughout the United States and in other countries.
As he has done with the issue of domestic violence, Governor LePage is encouraging greater awareness of elder abuse. To highlight what is sometimes referred to as the "crime of the 21st century,' because of its increasing prevalence and devastating impacts, the Governor issued a proclamation designating June 15th "Maine Elder Abuse Awareness Day." The proclamation urges the State's residents to join this effort by reporting suspected abuse of Maine's seniors.
"Elder abuse comes in various forms -- emotional, physical, financial," Governor LePage commented. "It can involve neglect, abandonment and the draining of a senior's monetary assets. Sadly, these crimes are under-reported, leaving too many victims to suffer. The State of Maine has the resources and strong desire to provide assistance and support, but it's imperative that more people speak up and report their concerns."
Commissioner Anne L. Head from the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation (DPFR) noted that financial abuse, which includes investment fraud and exploitation, is among the most common forms of elder abuse, costing its victims an estimated $2.9 billion a year.
"Seniors are disproportionately the target of financial exploitation," Commissioner Head commented. "All too often, the abuse is perpetrated by caregivers, family members or financial advisers."
