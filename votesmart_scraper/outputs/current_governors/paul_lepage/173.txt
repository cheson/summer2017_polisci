Governor Paul R. LePage today administered the oath of office to economist Dr. Bruce Williamson, the newest member of the Maine Public Utilities Commission.
"We now have an engineer, an attorney and an economist at the Maine Public Utilities Commission," said Governor LePage. "They bring extensive knowledge and the expertise needed to lower energy costs for Maine rate payers. There is much work to do on the state's complex energy issues and challenges, and I am confident the three Commissioners will serve the best interest of the Maine people with integrity and professionalism."
Dr. Williamson is a senior economist at the University of Tennessee's Howard Baker Center for Public Policy. He has also served as a research professor at the University's College of Business Administration, lectured in advanced data analytics and worked as a senior economist at the National Defense Business Institute.
The MPUC regulates electric, natural gas, telecommunications and water utilities to ensure that Maine consumers enjoy safe, adequate and reliable services at rates that are just and reasonable for both consumers and utilities. The Commission oversees emerging competitive markets for some of these services. The Commission also regulates water taxis and ferries in Casco Bay and promotes safe digging through the Dig Safe underground utility damage prevention program.
Williamson replaces outgoing Commissioner David Littell, whose term expired in March.
