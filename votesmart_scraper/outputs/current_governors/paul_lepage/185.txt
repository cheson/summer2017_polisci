Governor Paul R. LePage, Senate President Michael Thibodeau and House Minority Leader Ken Fredette issued a joint statement today about the need for real tax reform in the biennial budget now under consideration.
"We all firmly believe the next budget must include meaningful income tax cuts that allow Mainers to keep more of the money they have rightfully earned. The elimination of the income tax is a priority for Republicans. We will continue to work together to reduce the income tax until it is gone once and for all."
