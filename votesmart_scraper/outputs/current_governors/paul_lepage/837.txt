The challenge for Maine with our educational system is our return on
investment. Maine is in the top third of all our states in education spending;
yet we are in the bottom third in results. As Governor, it will be my priority
to reform Maine's educational system so that students have the opportunity
to create results that correspond with our significant investment in the
system.
Many educational reforms will not cost taxpayers additional money. There
is plenty of money in the system; it's how we choose to prioritize our
spending that is impacting educational results. Increased competition will
breed excellence; therefore, I support statewide choice by implementing a
voucher system as well as the creation of new charter schools.
The current trend in education is teaching to the test scores to boost test
results. We need to eliminate teaching to national assessments and allow
teachers to create a learning environment that challenges all of our students
to excel to their own diverse strengths rather than a standard of mediocrity.
For Special Education, we should eliminate the disparity between school
districts in identifying and supporting students requiring special education
services.
Finally, my goal as Governor will be to increase the school year, not shorten
it and lower the average class size, not increase it. For example, school dis-
tricts must work together to pool their resources. We fail to use our tax
dollars wisely when some classes have as few as 4 students and others up
to 25. A goal of 16 to 20 students is achievable with the resources we have
committed to our educational system.
