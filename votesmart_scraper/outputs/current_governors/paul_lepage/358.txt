Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage today issued a statement to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of D-Day.
"We are losing members of The Greatest Generation every day, but we must never forget the sacrifice, courage and bravery of those who landed on D-Day during the largest invasion by sea in the history of the United States," said Governor LePage. "The landings on the beaches at Normandy claimed 2,500 American lives, but they were just the start of some of the most savage fighting of the war. Those who fought so heroically and made it off the beaches cleared the way for the liberation of Europe and the Allied effort to make the world safe for democracy."
The American Cemetery at Normandy is the final resting place for 9,387 U.S. servicemen, many of them from Maine, who gave their lives in the Normandy Campaign that began seventy years ago today.
