Governor LePage Focuses on Employees Affected by Federal Shutdown
Press Release

Governor Paul R. LePage issued the following statement today about his decision to declare a civil emergency to manage the financial crisis created in Maine by the federal shutdown:
"Washington, D.C. is a mess, and the politicians down there need to find a way to end the shutdown. I cannot control this shutdown. I can only deal with the effects. Right now my goal is to avoid finger pointing and concentrate on leading the state through this crisis.
Liberal politicians in Augusta have offered no solutions and have chosen to focus their energies on false, political attacks. But I will continue to manage our state and focus on the employees negatively impacted by Washington politicians."
Background: Speaker of the House Mark Eves told the media today that Governor LePage tried to shut down state government, a claim that is false and misleading.
This is a quote from Governor LePage's radio address on June 7: "Folks, let me be clear. I do not want to shut down government. A shut-down is an act of failure. It is a failure to do the right thing for hard-working Maine families. But it is not up to me. It is up to Senate President Alfond and Speaker of the House Eves."
In May, the Maine State Employees Association, the union that represents state employees, said the Governor issued a directive to prepare for a shutdown. The Governor gave no such directive.
On May 13, Governor LePage issued a press release calling on the union to stop spreading fear and misinformation about a state government shutdown. "This has been manufactured by the MSEA," the Governor stated in the release. "It did not come from the executive branch."
