Governor Paul LePage released the following statement today regarding LD 1383, "An Act to Improve the Process by which Logging Contractors Hire Legal Foreign Workers." The bill, which is sponsored by Senator Thomas Saviello, was heard recently by the Joint Standing Committee on Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development.
"This bill ensures that Mainers come first. It cuts through the bureaucracy and red tape that has restrained businesses. Maine has gone far beyond federal government standards imposing its own set of additional regulations, fines and penalties. The existing law does nothing to promote the hiring of Maine workers. Instead, it creates red tape burdens.
LD 1383 addresses the real issue which is to help Maine loggers find jobs. By maintaining and strengthening an employer clearinghouse for logging jobs, this bill matches those seeking logging jobs with the employers who have them. This legislation is designed to actually find Mainers jobs, not penalize the employers who create them.
LD 1383 is necessary not only to help Maine's loggers through the logging clearinghouse, but to assure that the wood supply to Maine mills remains stable. Existing red tape burdens have jeopardized that wood supply, putting the jobs of those Mainers who work in paper and lumber mills at risk. In this competitive environment, we must assure that Maine jobs are not placed at risk by needless and ineffective red tape."
