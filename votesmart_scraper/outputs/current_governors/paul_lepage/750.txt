I understand firsthand that life can be quite a journey.
For some along that journey, a helping hand is needed.
Hello. This is Governor Paul LePage.
Welfare should be there when anyone hits a devastating bump in the road. But it is not, nor was it ever intended to be, the final destination. Sadly, that is becoming a reality for more Maine families.
My goal is to ensure that the transition does not become a final destination and that welfare becomes a brief stop toward a better life.
Unfortunately, right now there are some people who take advantage of the system.
Recently, the Fraud and Abuse Prevention Team was formed to analyze current systems and existing resources available within state government to deter fraud before it happens. The team will also assure that all illegal activities within Medicaid, Food Supplement, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and other programs are being properly investigated.
As soon as I made this announcement Representative Peggy Rotundo, of Lewiston, speaking on behalf of the loyal opposition came out swinging saying that this team is just an example of governing by anecdote as opposed to governing based on data and good research.
