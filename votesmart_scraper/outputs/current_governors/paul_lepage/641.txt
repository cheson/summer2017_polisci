Statement

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul LePage released the following statement in light of the recent disastrous ruling by the United States Supreme Court declaring the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act constitutional:
"Washington DC now has the power to dictate how we, as Americans, live our lives. This is a massive overreach by the federal government, and is infringing upon the individual choices that we, as Americans, have in pursuing our own American Dream.
This decision has verified what President Obama has refused to admit all along, which is to say this law is an enormous tax on the American people. The federal government can force you to do or buy anything, as long as they call it a "tax.' This massive tax hike will only destroy the American economy as it forces us over the financial cliff.
This decision erodes the freedoms which made the United States the greatest country on Earth. It is a sad day, and it is now up to the American people to demand full repeal of Obamacare. The Washington DC elites cannot and should not run our lives."
