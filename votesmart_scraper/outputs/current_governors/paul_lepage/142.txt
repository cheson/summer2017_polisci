Governor Paul R. LePage has directed State of Maine flags to half-staff on Friday, September 11, 2015 in honor of the innocent victims, first responders and service members who lost their lives in the tragic terrorist attacks 14 years ago and ensuing conflicts. The United States flag should also be lowered to half-staff.
"It is important to set aside this day of observance recognizing the sacrifices of those who were injured or killed as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001," said Governor LePage. "Maine salutes these heroes, their families, our nation's first responders, and the dedication of our veterans and current military members. The freedom that we Americans enjoy is so rare for the rest of the world, and it is constantly under threat; we must not abandon it. We must never forget. My heart goes out to those who lost loved ones on this very tragic day."
