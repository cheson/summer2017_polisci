Governor Paul R. LePage announced today that he is not favor of raising taxes on cigarettes and tobacco products.
"My office has received many phones calls from people who received inaccurate information from outdated stickers placed on cigarette or tobacco packaging," said the Governor. "My position is clear. I do not support new taxes on tobacco products nor have I ever."
A coalition opposed to legislation being proposed by Democrats to raise taxes on cigarettes, cigars and tobacco distributed the outdated stickers, which instructed customers to call the Governor to object.
Those stickers were printed years ago to target former Governor John Baldacci, a Democrat who favored increased taxes on tobacco products.
In its rush to oppose the legislation, the coalition distributed the outdated stickers, resulting in angry calls to the Governor's Office. The coalition has since distributed the correct stickers to retailers. The text of the new stickers proclaims: "Call Augusta and tell them: No New Tobacco Taxes! Senate: 287-1540, House 287-1400."
"If Mainers do not want to see these new taxes, I strongly urge them to call their legislators in the House and Senate," said Governor LePage.
