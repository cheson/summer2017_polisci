Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage today ordered that the United States flag and the State of Maine flag at all state facilities be flown at half-staff Monday in observance of Memorial Day. Flags should be flown at half-staff from sunrise until noon on Monday, May 25.
"Maine has a profound heritage of dedication and service to our Nation," said Governor LePage. "Our brave servicemen and women have fought for us and died for us, and there is no way to repay them for what they have given. But on this Memorial Day, we can show that we are grateful for all of our fallen heroes."
Governor LePage also asks businesses and residents to lower their flags to half-staff to pay tribute to the brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defending our nation and our freedom.
Please note: Flags are flown half-staff until noon to honor those who died in battle and then raised to full height at noon to honor the living veterans. This recognizes those who have sacrificed and those who are still with us.
