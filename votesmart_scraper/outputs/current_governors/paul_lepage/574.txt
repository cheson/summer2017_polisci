Governor Receives St. Patrick's Day Bill and Intends to Sign it into Law
Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage announced today that he will sign emergency legislation to allow bars to start serving alcoholic drinks at 6 a.m. on St. Patrick's Day, which is Sunday.
State law prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages before 9 a.m. on Sundays. But St. Patrick's Day falls on a Sunday this year so Rep. Barry Hobbins, D-Saco, submitted LD 216, "An Act To Extend the Hours for the Sale of Liquor on Sunday When St. Patrick's Day is on a Sunday."
The Governor had promised to veto any legislation that arrived on his desk before the legislature approves his bill to pay the hospitals.
After a productive meeting with Rep. Hobbins on Wednesday, the Governor decided he would sign LD 216.
"Mainers know that I am a man of my word. But I am always open to reasonable suggestions," the Governor said. "I'm pleased to sign this bill as a gesture of goodwill and as a supporter of Maine's fine establishments that wish to open earlier on St. Patrick's Day."
"With that said, now is the time for the Legislature to move forward in paying our bills to the hospitals. The sooner the Legislature passes this bill, the sooner we can put Mainers back to work."
