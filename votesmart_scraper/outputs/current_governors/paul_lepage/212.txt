Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage has issued an Executive Order prohibiting state workers from accessing pornographic and other sexually explicit material on government computers or devices.
"Employees of State agencies are compensated for their public service by Maine taxpayers and as Chief Executive I take employee workplace policies very seriously," said Governor LePage. "State agencies already have rules to prohibit this behavior at work, but the practice continues. This Order establishes clear rules for all departments and employees across the board."
All Executive Branch policies banning State employees from using State resources to access pornography will be amended to provide specifically that such misconduct will not be tolerated even when it is incidental in nature, or when it is committed off-duty, according to the Executive Order. It further clarifies policies will be amended to provide clear and unequivocal notice that such misconduct will constitute just cause for termination.
There is an exemption for State employees, such as investigators, required to access pornographic material within their official duties and there are procedures for employees who accidentally access inappropriate material.
The State will be taking all appropriate steps to implement the Governor's policy directive. This includes formally posting a work rule, informing leadership of the bargaining units that represent employees, and communicating directly with employees.
"While it is exceedingly rare for state employees to access pornography during work hours or using state resources, the State of Maine takes all violations of this policy seriously," said Joyce Oreskovich, director of the Bureau of Human Resources. "Misconduct such as this, while uncommon, is a violation of the public's trust and could expose the State to sexual harassment complaints. Governor LePage's Executive Order provides clear guidance to state employees that this conduct will not be tolerated."
The Executive Order language is as follows and may be found on the Office of the Governor website
