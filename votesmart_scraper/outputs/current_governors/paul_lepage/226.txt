Governor Paul R. LePage and First Lady Ann M. LePage are among many in Maine mourning the loss of Operation Tribute Founder, Marcel "Marc" Badeau who passed away on February 27, 2015.
Founded in 2007, Operation Tribute recognizes the sacrifices being made by the children of all military families living in New England, New York and New Jersey including the Coast Guard, National Guard, Reserves, Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines by offering them a holiday gift. Operation Tribute received the Governor's Award as Maine's Outstanding non-profit for 2011.
"I'm deeply saddened by Marc's passing," said Mrs. LePage. "I have worked with Operation Tribute; Marc and his wife Margo, since first becoming Maine's First Lady. My prayers go out to the entire Badeau family and all those mourning the loss of such a great man and friend."
"Military families are truly unsung heroes. I have been ever impressed by Operation Tribute and especially Marc's passion to recognize the sacrifices made by children in particular. His passing is a terrible loss for the veterans' community and all of Maine," added Governor LePage.
Visiting hours will be from 6-8 p.m. on Monday, March 2, 2015, at the Dolby and Dorr Funeral Chapel, 76 State St., Gorham. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, March 3, at St. Anne's Catholic Church, 299 Main St., Gorham.
