Welfare should be a temporary helping hand to get Mainers back on their feet -- not a lifestyle and ticket to permanent dependence on government. Paul's Welfare reforms value productivity and the need to get Maine working. Paul's plan will make sure Mainers who need help most will be taken care of, while creating a series of benchmarks and incentives so a job becomes a better choice than welfare.
While Paul is Governor, he will:
* Save Welfare for People Who Need it Most. Paul will revisit eligibility requirements for Welfare benefits to ensure those who are able to work are not using resources that should be reserved for Maine's most vulnerable citizens.
* Create Lifetime Caps on Benefits. Welfare should not be a ticket to government dependency. Paul's Welfare reform plan creates a lifetime benefit limit of no more than five years.
* Require Recipients to Serve our Communities. Paul will expand the workfare program if paid employment is unavailable to require all recipients perform valuable community services, such as working in libraries, community centers and Meals on Wheels.
* Stop Punishing Hard Work. Work provides meaning and dignity in our lives, and sets an example of productivity for our children. Paul will reform welfare so hard work and advancement will help people on the system.
* Connect People with Better Jobs. Instead of finding ways to keep people on Welfare, the Department of Health and Human Services should find ways to connect people with work. Paul will turn case workers into career counselors who help find people jobs so they can support themselves and their families.
* Provide a Bridge to Independence. Transition from welfare to work should be a smooth one. Paul supports allowing welfare recipients to keep a majority of every new dollar they earn through working longer hours, getting a raise, or getting a newer, better job. Welfare should encourage people to better themselves. It should not punish productivity.
