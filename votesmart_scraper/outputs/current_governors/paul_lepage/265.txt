Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage will join the Salvation Army to kick off its Annual Christmas Kettle campaign on Thursday, December 4, 11:15 a.m. in a ceremony at the State House.
"For more than 120 years, Salvation Army red kettles around the world have been linked to the Christmas season," said Governor LePage. "Mainers are generous people known to help our neighbors and the kettle campaign is one way to help those who need it most. I commend the Salvation Army and all the dedicated volunteers who will be ringing the bells this year and I encourage you, if you are able, to donate to this good cause."
The charitable organization expects to have more than 100 red kettles throughout the state on street corners and shopping areas through December 24th. The Salvation Army statewide Kettle campaign goal is $734,000.
Last year, funds donated at these kettles enabled The Salvation Army to provide services and programs to 41,000 men, women and children statewide during the holidays and throughout the year.
Lieutenant Joel Lyle, corps commanding officer of the Capital Region states, "We invite all community residents to join us in this effort to ensure that families in the communities we serve receive assistance such as food, clothing, utilities and more."
A Salvation Army Brass Ensemble will also be part of the festivities playing holiday carols.
There are 9 Salvation Army Corps (facilities) in Maine that offer services and programs for children, adults and seniors.
* Bangor
* Capital Region- Augusta and Waterville communities
* Bath
* Houlton
* Lewiston
* Old Orchard Beach
* Portland

Also, The Salvation Army serves those in need in 91 other communities through volunteers at its service units.
