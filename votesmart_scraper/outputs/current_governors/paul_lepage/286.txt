Governor LePage and First Lady to Host 4th Annual Blaine House Food Drive
Press Release
By: Paul LePage
Date: Oct. 16, 2014
Location: Augusta, ME

The First Family invites the public to visit the Blaine House once again this year in an effort to help fellow Mainers who are less fortunate. Since Governor Paul R. LePage and First Lady Ann M. LePage began the food drive in 2011, they have collected thousands of pounds of food for pantries and shelters across Maine.
This year's food drives will take place on three consecutive Saturdays: October 18 and 25 and November 1. Mainers will have an opportunity to bring a food donation, get a tour of the Blaine House led by Governor LePage and enjoy light refreshments.
"Our family has been blessed, and this is our opportunity to give back in a very meaningful way," said Governor LePage. "It is heartwarming to see our neighbors, friends, co-workers, students and various groups like the Boy and Girl Scouts dropping off donations year after year. Mainers are generous people, and in times of need we come together for a greater cause -- that's what the holiday season is all about."
The Good Shepherd Food-Bank will accept all donations brought to the Blaine House. Good Shepherd Food-Bank will determine the communities that need the food most and distribute the donations.
Doors will be open at the Blaine House between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. every Saturday.
