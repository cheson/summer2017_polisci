"I am encouraged by the agreement reached between Katahdin Paper Company and Meriturn Partners, LLC.
The East Millinocket Mill employs hundreds of workers in Penobscot County and my Administration is committed to supporting the sale to keep those jobs intact. With this deal, the hope is to restart the Millinocket Mill, where more jobs can be created.
In the upcoming days and weeks we will be working closely with the parties to reach the conditions that have been set forth to ensure a shutdown is not in the foreseeable future."
