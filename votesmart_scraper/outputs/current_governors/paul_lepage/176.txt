Radio Address: The Budget That Could Have Been, But is Not

Five months ago, we handed politicians in Augusta a balanced budget that included welfare reforms and a $300 million tax cut for Mainers. That budget never saw the light of day and today, that budget is long gone.
Hello, this is Governor Paul LePage.
Previous budgets maintained the status quo and did nothing to move Maine forward. My Administration stunned legislators by presenting them with a bold and comprehensive budget. We put the best interests of the Maine people before politics. We prioritized our working-class families and our most vulnerable citizens. For the first time in decades, our budget provided meaningful tax relief for Mainers with a vision for a prosperous future.
Politicians claim my budget focused on "tax breaks for the rich." But Maine's highest tax rate now kicks in for someone making only $20,000--only liberals would call that rich. My plan would have cut taxes for Mainers of all income levels, and it would have moved 60,000 more low-income families off the tax rolls.
We also created tax credits for Mainers with low incomes and a high property tax burden. We chose to give property tax relief directly to Mainers--not to municipal politicians--by expanding the Property Tax Fairness Credit.
We provided even more tax relief for our elderly and those on fixed incomes by doubling the Homestead Exemption to help offset their property taxes.
While we heard a lot about taxes, our budget also strengthened our safety net for the elderly, disabled and mentally ill. We fully funded the Medicaid waitlist with $46 million to provide services to all 2,000 eligible Mainers. For nearly five years, I have sought to adequately fund programs and services for our most vulnerable, but the call for help continues to fall on deaf ears.
