As the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, Governor Paul R. LePage is wishing Mainers and their families safe travels as they take to Maine roads and highways this week.
"The First Lady and I want everybody to make it to their destination safely," said Governor LePage. "Holidays are a time to be with family and friends, but it also results in traffic that is more congested than we are used to. A predicted snowstorm, combined with Maine's uncertain and quickly changing weather, means people need to be even more alert and more cautious while traveling."
Weather experts are indicating a significant winter storm late Wednesday to early Thursday, which could leave of 6 to 12 inches of snow accumulations across Maine.
According to American Automobile Association, 2 million New Englanders will travel 50 miles or more from home during Thanksgiving weekend, which is Wednesday to Sunday.
