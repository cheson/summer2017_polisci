Press Release
By: Paul LePage
Date: April 23, 2014
Location: Augusta, ME

Thursday, April 24, is recognized nationally as Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day. Governor Paul R. LePage is encouraging Mainers to actively participate in bringing children, between the ages of 9 and 15, into the workplace for all or part of the day. The Governor will deliver remarks at a special ceremony in the courtyard between the Cross Office Building and the State House Thursday at 11:30 a.m. to highlight the occasion.
For more than 20 years, individuals, families, organizations, and workplaces have joined in Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day to broaden career opportunities of millions of girls and boys. Hundreds of youth are expected to accompany State of Maine employees who work within various State departments and agencies. Governor LePage is encouraging departments to support the initiative to make it a positive experience for everyone. Some tips for success:
* Create a welcome packet that introduces information about your department/agency
* Walk participants around the office and introduce them to staff
* Think about what you would like your child to see or do based on their personal interests
Office of the Governor staff and their children will begin the day with a meeting with Governor LePage, a State House tour, interviews with staff members, and during the afternoon will join First Lady Ann LePage for lunch at the Blaine House.
"As children begin to think about their future career paths, it's important for parents, mentors and teachers to provide them ways to learn what they are most passionate about. One of the best gifts we can give our children is someone who can show them their potential and let them know that a job can turn into a career they love to do," said Governor LePage.
