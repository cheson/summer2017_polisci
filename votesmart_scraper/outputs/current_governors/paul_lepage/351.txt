Governor Paul R. LePage released a statement today about the 5.7% unemployment rate for May, which is down from 6.7% a year ago and is the lowest since September 2008. The employment-to-population ratio, which is the percentage of adults who have a job and is a better indicator of economic recovery, is 61.6% -- well above the national average.
"Just this week, the New York Times affirmed the efforts we have made to recover jobs lost during the great recession," said Governor LePage. "Thousands more Mainers are working in the private sector now than when I took office."
The number of private-sector jobs is up 9,900 from one year ago, mostly in leisure and hospitality; retail trade; professional and business services; and education and healthcare. The number of government jobs is down 700.
The New York Times highlights Maine as one of three states that have recovered a significant number of jobs lost during the recession.
"Employment rates have rebounded in some states with strong growth, like Utah, Nebraska and Montana. But only three states -- Maine, Texas and Utah -- have retraced more than half their losses," The New York Times reported.
Since Governor LePage took office, 15,000 private-sector jobs have been created; there are now almost 8,000 job openings on the Maine Job Bank; and Maine's employment-to-population ratio remains higher than the national average.
The New York Times reports that the number of adults actually employed is a more accurate indicator of how the economy is doing. The share of Maine's population that is employed remains at 61.8 percent, which is above the U.S. average of 58.9 percent. April was the 79th consecutive month the employment-to-population ratio was above the national average.
