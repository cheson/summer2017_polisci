The politicians in Augusta panic whenever the economy downturns and tax revenues decrease. They lose sight of the fact that in the years
of surplus revenue they spent the well dry. Maine's budget woes
reflect a lack of commitment and discipline to fiscal responsibility.
Fiscal responsibility starts and ends with the understanding that taxpayers have a right to keep as much of their hard-earned money as
possible- not that government has the right to collect as much money
as it thinks it needs. If a state government program has no fiscal or
social benefit, then it's expendable, and should be eliminated from
the state budget.
My first priority as Governor will be to ensure that state government spends every tax dollar wisely. I will not tolerate wasteful spending. The tax and spend practices in Augusta will come to an end, and I will fight to keep every dollar where it rightfully belongs, in your pocket.
The most important job for the Governor is to develop and propose to the Legislature a balanced biennial state budget. The budget drives the policies and programs that are handed down from Augusta each year. As Governor, my first budget will reflect the many reforms that are necessary to bring accountability to our state government.
My three top reform priorities include general assistance (welfare), government regulations and education.
