Governor Paul R. LePage has directed State of Maine flags to half-staff on Thursday, September 11, 2014, and proclaimed Thursday as a "Day of Service and Remembrance" in honor of the innocent victims, first responders and service members who lost their lives in the tragic terrorist attacks 13 years ago and ensuing conflicts.
"It is important to set aside this day of observance recognizing the sacrifices of those who were injured or killed as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001," said Governor LePage. "Maine salutes these heroes, their families, our nation's first responders, and the dedication of our veterans and current military members. The freedom that we Americans enjoy is so rare for the rest of the world, and it is constantly under threat; we must not abandon it. We must never forget. My heart goes out to those who lost loved ones on this very tragic day."
In issuing a proclamation to mark the observance, Governor LePage emphasized the significance of service as a way to pay tribute to the thousands of individuals, families and communities directly impacted by the terrorist attacks.
Additionally, the President today regarding Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, 2014, signed a proclamation. In it, the President calls upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.
