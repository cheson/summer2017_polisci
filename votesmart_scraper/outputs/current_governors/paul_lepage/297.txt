Governor Paul R. LePage will recognize Breast Cancer Awareness Month by delivering remarks and planting pink tulips at the Maine Department of Transportation headquarters in Augusta at 11:30 a.m., Wednesday, October 8.
"Breast cancer affects so many lives, from those diagnosed with this disease to those in support roles such as family, friends and medical professionals," said Governor LePage. "Early detection is critical to treating this type of cancer and I am glad to help raise awareness. Until a cure is found, it is up to all of us to take the steps needed to get checked regularly and to support those, with all of our hearts, who have to battle this awful disease."
Also giving remarks will be MaineDOT's Chief Engineer, Joyce Taylor. Joyce is currently undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer after being diagnosed in late May 2014. She had a bi-lateral mastectomy in June and started chemo in July. She is through the first half of her treatments and will be speaking about early detection and taking action.
Members of the media are encouraged to attend the event.
