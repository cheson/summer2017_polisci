Our entire welfare system is designed to breed dependency- once you've
become skilled at milking the system, breaking free is almost
impossible. If you want to know how destructive and corrupt welfare
is, ask anybody who's on it. As a result, the state's general assistance
program as managed by the state and municipalities
needs immediate reform.
My proposals include establishing a statewide residency requirement for general assistance and a lifetime benefit limit to five years. I propose expanding the workfare program which provides municipalities the right to require general assistance recipients to work in exchange for benefits to mandate that all recipients perform valuable community service such as working in libraries, community centers, meals on wheels, etc... or for private sector employers. Recipients with disabilities would be required to perform community services within the scope of their respective ability.
We need a welfare system that encourages recipients to seek better wages
without the consequences of immediately losing all of their benefits. There-
fore, I propose establishing a five tier income system beginning at the state
poverty level to the state earning wage level. Once a recipient reaches the
next tier of income, the tier benefits drop by only 20%, until they reach the
next tier where benefits would drop by another 20% and so on until they
reach the state's earning wage.
