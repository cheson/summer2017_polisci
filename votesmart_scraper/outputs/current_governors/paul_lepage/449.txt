Declining unemployment rates indicate our economic policies are putting more Mainers back to work.
Hello, this is Governor Paul LePage.
We have been working hard for three years to improve the business climate so Maine companies can do what they do best: create jobs.
We reduced taxes, cut red tape, streamlined regulations and made fiscally responsible decisions to right-size government. These factors make Maine more competitive in attracting and retaining jobs.
3,800 more Mainers were employed in October 2013 than in October 2012. The unemployment rate fell to 6.9% in September, and then dropped to 6.7% in October.
In fact, Maine's unemployment rate in October fell to its lowest since 2008. Meanwhile, the national unemployment rate is still at 7.3%.
The nation's unemployment rate remains high because of the broken system in Washington, D.C., which has resulted in $17 trillion of debt, unbalanced budgets, high taxes and uncertainty in the marketplace.
These job-killing efforts are the exact opposite of what a government should be doing to increase employment.
Career politicians don't know how to create jobs. I spent my entire career in business, and I understand what companies need to succeed. When businesses succeed, Maine families benefit from the good-paying jobs they provide.
