Publicly released documents regarding an Iranian refugee who lived in Freeport, Adnan Fazeli, have prompted Governor Paul R. LePage to reiterate the need to strengthen immigration policy in the United States. Fazeli, a secondary migrant who moved to Maine in 2009, joined ISIS and was killed during an attack against Lebanon in 2015.
Such cases are the result of an inadequate vetting process, which must be addressed by Congress, says Governor LePage.
"President Barack Obama's immigration policies have been an utter failure and continue to jeopardize the safety of millions of Americans," said Governor LePage. "While the Supreme Court rejected the President's overreach in his executive action to prevent deportation of millions of illegal immigrants, we must urge Congress to correct and enforce immigration policies to ensure they protect American citizens and reject those seeking to live in the United States who want to harm us or join our enemies."
"The screening process of immigrants has failed and will continue to place Americans at risk," the Governor said. "We cannot afford to harbor radical Islamic sympathizers on our watch. We have an upcoming election, which is pivotal in addressing U.S. foreign policy and immigration laws and two presidential candidates who are on opposite sides of the fence. These policies are vital to the future of our nation and our state. The safety of Americans must come first."
