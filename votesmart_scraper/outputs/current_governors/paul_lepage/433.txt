Governor Paul LePage and First Lade Ann LePage have made our veterans and their families a priority since entering the Blaine House.

From hosting private lunches and dinners with members of our armed services and veterans or Ann crisscrossing the great State of Maine to attend award and recognition ceremonies; the LePage's want to make sure Maine's military families and veterans are recognized for their service and dedication.

They have also worked to make sure we don't forget those who have made the greatest sacrifice. Highlighting the great volunteers and charitable hearts of Maine people, Ann LePage has been an ambassador climbing into the cabs of big rig trucks to deliver Maine made Christmas wreathes from our state all the way down the east coast to Arlington National Cemetery each December. There she, along with Governor LePage, have decorated the graves of our ultimate heroes.
As Governor, Paul LePage hasn't stopped at recognition. Actions speak louder than words. While politicians say they support veterans or send political letters to make it look like something is happening -- Governor LePage has taken action:

-Passed legislation to provide a waiver for the fees charged for obtaining a Driver's License and Non-driver Identification cards for current and recently discharged members of the Armed Forces.
