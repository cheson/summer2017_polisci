The endless debate regarding the merits of the Dirigo Health Plan is
distracting us from implementing true market based reforms for health
insurance. Politicians in Augusta continue to hem and haw on how they
can fix Dirigo. Unfortunately, their indecisiveness is hurting the people
and businesses of Maine. The Dirigo Health Plan has failed to accomplish
its goal's and should be repealed.
There are many solutions available to lower the cost of health insurance
that are completely ignored in Augusta. As Governor, I will embrace
solutions that have worked in other states to lower the cost of health
insurance. For example, we must encourage competition in the market-
place to lower costs. Enacting legislation to allow individuals and busi-
nesses to purchase insurance over state lines is a critical first step.
Supporting tort reform legislation at the state and federal level to reign in
trial lawyers will help as well. I also support tax credits to individuals and
businesses to assist in purchasing health insurance.
Finally, Maine is a small state, and our economy cannot afford a health
care system that is saddled with Cadillac mandates. It is time for the
politicians in Augusta to stop dictating health care policy through social
engineering. Let's reform insurance mandates to federally established
guidelines and allow Maine people to purchase coverage that makes
sense for their individual and family needs.
