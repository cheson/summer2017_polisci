A strong, efficient transportation network is vital to the economic success of Maine. Paul knows that transportation dollars are limited and valuable. As Governor, Paul will make sure our transportation dollars are spent wisely and efficiently.
While Paul is Governor, he will:
* Prioritize Our Transportation Dollars. Paul will ensure limited transportation funds are used to repair and maintain Maine's bridges and roads. A bloated transportation bureaucracy has consumed too much of Maine's highway budget, and our roadways have suffered as a result. Paul will finally create a set of new priorities so our roads and bridges are safe and Maine taxpayers are protected.
* Hold Maine's Department of Transportation Accountable of the People. We have a right to know how every dollar collected from Maine taxpayers is spent--that includes the Department of Transportation. Paul will make sure DOT is keeping track of what and how it spends, and he will make sure DOT is setting and meeting benchmarks to ensure our transportation network is sound and efficient.
* Advocate for Local Transportation Decisions. The federal government has systematically exerted control over how state's maintain their highways, and the state has exerted similar control over how local communities care for their own roadways and bridges. Paul will fight to make sure local transportation decisions are left to local folks.
