For several weeks MaineDOT and Public Works Departments across the State have been battling winter snow and ice conditions caused by an uncommon set of winter conditions. Temperatures have fluctuated through several cycles of extreme cold to well above freezing. During these fluctuations, precipitation in the forms of rain, snow and ice have accumulated on Maine's roads, bridges and in drainage structures.
Today, heavy rain and above freezing temperatures have caused pooling and ponding of water on the state's roads.
"Crews have done a remarkable job freeing drainage ways to allow water to drain from roads and parking areas," said Governor Paul R. LePage. "Despite these efforts, a dramatic drop in temperatures will likely cause numerous areas of "black ice' overnight and into the day tomorrow. Temperatures in many parts of Maine will be in the single digits to teens. At these temperatures, road sand and salt are less effective."
"I urge all Maine travelers to reduce their travel to the absolute minimum amount necessary tonight and early tomorrow. This is both for your safety and the safety of highway crews working to clear the roads. If you do need to travel, consider all roads ice covered unless you have knowledge to the contrary. "Black ice' is often patchy and cannot be seen until it is too late. When approaching intersections, low areas, areas known to flood and bridges please apply extra caution."
