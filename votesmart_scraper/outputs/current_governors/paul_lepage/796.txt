"In a few years our pension costs will consume one-in-every-four dollars in Maine General Fund revenue. Taxpayers do not have any more to give and reforms are needed to keep the checks coming for the retired teachers who are counting on a state pension. I know some teachers and retirees are struggling, but we need honest and shared solutions to solve our pension problem. We must also stay focused on the value of our teachers and improving education in Maine. We know the best teachers get better results. We are working on proposals to identify these educators and increase their pay."
