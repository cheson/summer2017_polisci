Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement about today's announcement from Verso Paper:
"I learned about closure of the Bucksport mill late this afternoon. I have spoken to Verso Paper CEO David Patterson and I continue to receive information. I have called an emergency meeting with my economic development team who is committed to working with Verso and other interested parties in order to keep the mill open. We will assess any and all options as we move forward. I have rearranged my schedule to attend to this developing situation and will be in the Bangor region Thursday.
"My thoughts are with the workers and families who are affected by this closure. As an Administration, we stand ready to provide resources to them, including the training and support needed to transition into new job opportunities. The Department of Labor has mobilized a team to assist these workers and will do everything it can to help them during this difficult time. "
