Governor Paul R. LePage issued the following statement Tuesday about the Administration's decision not to include keno among the draw games offered by the Maine State Lottery:
"Legislators could have brought their concerns to the Administration and we could have avoided this debate. While the Executive Branch is authorized to add a game to the Maine State Lottery without legislative approval, we will not add keno this year."
"Democrats have expanded gambling in our state, and the people of Maine have said they want casinos. But now is not the time to have another debate over gambling. We are focused on cutting the tax burden for Maine people by $300 million and bringing prosperity to the future of our state."
