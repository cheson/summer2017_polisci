Governor Moves to Ensure Utility Workers Responding to Power Outage Can Vote
Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage today signed an emergency proclamation to allow utility workers restoring power in Northern and Eastern Maine to vote remotely, as many of them are unable to get to their respective voting polls today.
The proclamation enables only utility workers who are restoring power due to the weekend snow storm to vote remotely, similarly to how overseas citizens and military personnel vote.
"Voting is our civic responsibility and right. This proclamation ensures that hard working Mainers called away from home to restore power to our citizens are able to remain on the job and still have an opportunity to vote," said Governor LePage.
