Governor Paul LePage announced Friday he will not be attending the upcoming Trade Mission in November to Chile and Brazil. The Governor has decided to forgo the trip due to fiscal priorities involving preparation for the upcoming Legislative session.
"The upcoming 2012-13 supplemental budget process will be a very challenging exercise. It is incumbent that I attend to these matters here in Maine," stated Governor LePage. "Additionally, we have embarked on a zero-based budgeting exercise, to which I will be intimately involved," added the Governor.
The Trade Mission, which is coordinated by the Maine International Trade Center (MITC), will still occur and is scheduled for November 12-19 with visits to the cities of Sï¿½o Paulo, Brazil and Santiago, Chile.
The Governor reiterated his support for expanding global markets for Maine companies and attracting foreign investment to Maine, "This mission is a great opportunity for Maine companies to expand their global presence and seek new markets. I strongly encourage Maine companies to consider this opportunity."
Nearly a dozen Maine businesses have agreed to participate in the mission. Janine Bisaillon-Cary, President of the Maine International Trade Center will represent Maine and report back details to the Governor and Maine Department of Economic & Community Development Commissioner after the trip. She will also work with the State to follow up on economic opportunities.
"We understand and appreciate the Governor's focus on our state's fiscal matters," she said. "While the Governor will not be able to attend, his administration will still benefit from the mission and this experience will afford Maine companies to expand their markets globally and attract foreign investment to Maine," concluded Bisaillon-Cary.
