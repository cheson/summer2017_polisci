Governor Paul R. LePage today ordered that the United States flag and the State of Maine flag at all state facilities be flown at half-staff, effective immediately through Friday, July 24, in honor of four United States Marines and a Navy Petty Officer killed in Chattanooga, Tenn.
"The shootings in Chattanooga were horrific acts of violence that took five brave Americans who fought to protect the freedoms we all share today," said Governor LePage. "Ann and I join Mainers in sending our thoughts and prayers to the families of the service members whose lives ended too soon because of a senseless and cowardly act. We will honor these heroes with the symbol of our great nation, which they so proudly served. I encourage all Mainers to lower flags in respect for them as we continue to mourn."
