Lowering Energy Costs is a Win for All Mainers During the bitter cold winter season, New England governors spoke with a sense of urgency about lowering energy costs. Now, just two months away from an election, that urgency is gone.
Hello, this is Governor Paul LePage.
My administration has made many achievements in the past three years. We paid nearly a billion dollars in welfare debt to Maine hospitals, lowered taxes and helped to attract businesses that are providing good-paying careers for Mainers.
Businesses come to Maine for various reasons. Our hard-working people are a tremendous asset, and our surroundings are beautiful. But that is often not enough for companies to come to Maine. Business owners must think about the bottom line, too.
Taxes and government regulations are major factors. My administration has worked to ensure permitting rules are clear and consistent. We have removed bureaucratic red tape, and our Governor's Account Executives help businesses navigate government quickly and efficiently.
We've passed tax cuts to assist companies expand and hire more Mainers. Companies like C and L Aerospace of Bangor and Auburn's Pioneer Plastics have done just that.
For 40 years, I helped businesses. Incentives are important. But just as important is a state's infrastructure and the cost of making products. Energy is one of the largest expenditures in making a product yet New England and Maine have failed to realize that our energy costs are simply not competitive. In 2001, our energy costs were 48 percent higher than the national average yet we have not made any progress as a region. Last year, New England's retail electricity prices were nearly 15 cents while the average cost in the United States was just over 10 cents. That is not the progress we need to attract investment.
