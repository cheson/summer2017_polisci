My 2016 "State of the State" address has been listed one of the best in the country in terms of the economic policy proposals we put forth.
Hello, this is Governor Paul LePage.
The address is listed in a report by ALEC--the American Legislative Exchange Council--which is a national organization made up of legislators from both parties. ALEC commends us for fighting to abolish both the income tax and death tax. They said: "If these taxes were repealed, the state would improve dramatically in economic competitiveness, leading to more residents and businesses moving in to the state and greater job growth."
The report also states: "Like New Hampshire, Maine could be a refuge for taxpayers, businesses and capital fleeing the poor tax and fiscal policies adopted by most Northeast states." Sound familiar? I've been saying that for years.
ALEC found more governors this year proposed reducing taxes than governors who proposed increasing taxes. Even Governor Malloy in Connecticut, a liberal Democrat who proposed major tax hikes, admits his policies have had drastic economic consequences. The ALEC report commends him for basing his new budget on how much the state actually has to spend--not how much politicians want to spend.
The report also gave me credit for recognizing Maine's high taxes--including income, corporate and death taxes--are holding our state back.
ALEC has found that corporate income taxes are harmful because they make it more difficult for businesses to innovate, hire employees and raise wages.
