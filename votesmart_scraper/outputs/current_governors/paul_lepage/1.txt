Governor Paul R. LePage today released the following statement regarding the House Republican Budget compromise:
"After weeks of gridlock, the budget compromise from House Republicans is fiscally responsible, supports important education reforms with increased funding for schools, prevents taxpayers' dollars from going to non-citizens and it takes care of elderly and truly needy Mainers now on waitlists for services. This budget also eliminates vacant positions within state government and reduces the tax burden on our job creators, small businesses and professionals who provide vital services to the Maine people."
"We cannot simply tax-and-spend our way out of a budget. Tough decisions must be made to deliver a budget that is balanced, fiscally responsible and benefits Maine's hard-working taxpayers. This is not the budget I proposed; I have agreed to support $125 million in new spending beyond what is fiscally prudent. However, this is my last and final concession. Taxpayers cannot afford any more spending without realizing improvement from our reforms, which will take some time. But House Republicans have worked very hard to put forth a reasonable proposal. If Democrats join with Republicans to immediately pass this budget, I will put my signature on it."
