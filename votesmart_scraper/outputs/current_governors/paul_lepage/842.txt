As the eldest son of eighteen children, and a parent of five children, Paul knows how important it is to protect the traditional Maine values that have created strong communities and strong families across the state.
While Paul is Governor, he will:
* Support the Voter's Decision to Keep the Current Law Defining Marriage. Paul does not believe that we need to redefine marriage as anything other than the sacred union of one man and one woman.
* Protect Life in Maine. Paul believes that every life deserves an opportunity to grow, contribute to society, and leave their mark on the world.
* Protect and Celebrate Maine Citizenship. Maine is a welcoming state, but the rights afforded to Maine people should not be taken advantage of by non-citizens. Paul will oppose legislation that would allow illegal or non-citizen residents from voting in Maine elections, receiving taxpayer-funded handouts, or running for office.
* Trust in the Voters. Paul respects the will of the voters. Maine people know what's best for themselves and their families, not Augusta politicians. Paul will empower voters to engage their government through the citizen initiative process, and within the halls of the State House. On important social issues, Paul will require any Legislature-approved social issue to go out to a mandatory referendum so the people have the final word.
