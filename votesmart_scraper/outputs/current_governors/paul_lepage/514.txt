Governor Paul R. LePage released a statement today about Maine's unemployment rate of 6.8 percent in June, which is the lowest rate since November 2008.
"About 8,000 more people are working in the private sector now than when I took office," said Governor LePage. "Our focus on helping to create jobs and improving the economy is putting more Mainers back to work and that is good news for everyone."
The unemployment rate of 6.8 percent in June is down from 7.3 percent one year ago. The unemployment rate has dropped more than 15 percent since Governor LePage has been in office.
The number of continued regular unemployment claims is reduced by more than 10 percent compared to this time last year. This is attributed to improved economic conditions and more Mainers working.
These numbers are good news, but we must keep working to improve our economy," said Governor LePage. "By reducing taxes, limiting the size of government and reforming our welfare system, we can continue to improve the business climate, help create more jobs and let Mainers keep more of their hard-earned money."
