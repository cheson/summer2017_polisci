Governor Expresses Disappointment at Summit Natural Gas Project Labor Agreement

Governor Paul R. LePage expressed his disappointment today that Summit Natural Gas has entered into a project labor agreement (PLA) for its Kennebec Valley natural gas project, which is set to begin this spring. The project is proposed to span from Augusta to Madison.
"While I appreciate Summit's commitment and investment in Maine to help reduce our cost of energy, I am extremely disappointed that they have chosen to implement a PLA on this project," said Governor LePage. "This action not only increases the cost of the project, but more importantly, it shuts out Maine's construction workers and their families from good job opportunities."
The PLA requires Maine contractors and subcontractors, regardless of their labor affiliation, to sign union agreements in order to work on an 88-mile stretch of steel pipeline expected to cost $100 million. Because 98.6% of Maine's construction workforce chooses not to belong to a union, the PLA would discriminate against almost all of Maine's construction workers and would most certainly require out-of-state workers to do the work.
