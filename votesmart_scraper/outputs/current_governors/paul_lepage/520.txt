Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage released the following statement regarding President Obama's decision to delay the employer mandate of ObamaCare:
"I have said all along that ObamaCare will drive up costs and bury both businesses and families in more government regulation. It is good to see Washington finally recognize more major problems with this law. It is time Congress and the President repeal ObamaCare and give each state the flexibility we need. It is the first step in saving our country."
