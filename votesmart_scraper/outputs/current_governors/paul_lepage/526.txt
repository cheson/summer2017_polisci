The Legislature has been in session for five months, but politicians waited until the 11th hour to tackle some of state's biggest challenges. After fighting insignificant skirmishes for months, legislators suddenly found themselves in the most important battle of the war: whether to hold the line on taxes.
Hello, this is Governor Paul LePage.
Politicians who try to reduce taxes always face resistance, but this year the opposition was fierce. Surrounded by outrage from municipal officials, school administrators, special interests and unions, the politicians did what they always do. They surrendered.
Unfortunately, one group didn't even stand a chance in this fight: Maine taxpayers. As lobbyists and legislators scurried back and forth under the dome, Maine taxpayers stood on the sidelines, hoping someone would summon up the courage to protect their interests. As usual, it didn't happen.
Folks, someone has to hold the line. Someone has to speak for the Maine taxpayer. Someone has to prevent us from heaping burden after burden on our children and our grandchildren. This isn't just about this year's budget, or even the next budget cycle. This is about the next generation.
Every year, politicians say they have to raise taxes just a little bit to pay for government. If cities and towns increase taxes only two to three percent every year, it doesn't sound like much. But over 10 years, that's a 20 to 30 percent tax hike. This has been going on for years at all levels of government.
