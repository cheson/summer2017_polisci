Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage ordered the flags of the United States and State of Maine be flown at half-staff effective immediately through sunset on Saturday, April 20, 2013 in accordance with a Presidential proclamation. On Tuesday, President Obama issued a proclamation as a mark of respect for the victims of Monday's tragic events in Boston, Massachusetts.
The two bomb explosions have resulted in 3 deaths and more than 170 injured.
After learning of the explosions at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday, Governor LePage immediately released the following statement:
"It is a very sad Patriot's Day in Boston. Ann and I send our thoughts and prayers to the families and friends of those who were killed and injured in today's horrific act of violence. For the many Mainers who are in Boston today we hope you are safe.
I have been in contact with Director Rob McAleer of the Maine Emergency Management Agency who is monitoring the situation and keeping me apprised of any developments. MEMA staff is on standby in the case they are called to assist."
