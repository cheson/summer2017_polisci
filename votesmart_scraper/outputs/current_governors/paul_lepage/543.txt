Democrats Still Refuse to let Hospital Bill Move Forward
Statement

Governor Paul R. LePage today renewed his call on legislative leadership to allow a vote on his plan to pay nearly $500 million in welfare debt the state owes Maine's hospitals.
"Mainers have made it very clear that they want the hospitals paid without it being tied to welfare expansion. Their opinions are confirmed in results from yesterday's poll. It is incomprehensible that Democrats continue to ignore the wishes of Mainers and refuse to move this bill forward.
"I am astounded by this last-minute political maneuvering to make an end run around the Maine people. So once again I am calling on Democratic leadership to let legislators take a simple up-or-down vote on my plan."
