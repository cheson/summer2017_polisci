Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage and First Lady Ann LePage will pay special honor this weekend to Vietnam veterans. The Vietnam Veterans Welcome Home ceremony is part of the State of Maine's ongoing recognition of Vietnam Veterans. The State is partnering with the Department of Defense to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, and to pay tribute to our Vietnam veterans and their families.
"Maine has a profound heritage of service to our country, and we take great pride in our troops. This ceremony will be a time of remembrance as we honor our heroes and their families who sacrificed much as a result of the Vietnam conflict," said Governor LePage. "These brave men and women defended our nation and the freedoms we all hold dear. They deserve to always be remembered and honored."
This ceremony will commemorate the 50th anniversary of 1964, the year the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed, which escalated the US involvement in Vietnam.
Homecomings are a long-time military tradition and demonstrate the appreciation we all share for their service. This symbolic ceremony allows the community to thank and honor veterans of the Vietnam War, including personnel who were held as prisoners of war or listed as missing in action, for their service and sacrifice.
WHEN: 1:00 p.m. Saturday, October 4, 2014
WHERE: Cole Land Transportation Museum, 405 Perry Road, Bangor
