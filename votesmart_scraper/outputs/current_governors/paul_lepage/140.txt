Report Shows Maine is Less Competitive with Other States in Energy Costs
Statement
By: Paul LePage
Date: Oct. 1, 2015
Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage today released a new report that shows high energy costs and Maine's inability to best use its natural resources will continue having a devastating impact on Maine's industrial and manufacturing sector, particularly mills and the forest products industry, limiting the state's ability to prosper and compete in the global marketplace.
"Maine must take action to be competitive in the marketplace. Politicians pretend to care about job creation and helping Maine people, yet they refuse to pass good public policy to lower energy prices," said Governor LePage. "Meanwhile, hundreds of Maine families are losing their jobs and businesses are closing or relocating. In order to achieve greater economic prosperity, we must work together and accept the hard facts. This report is a reality check for the Legislature."
