The Billion Dollar Question: Will You Support Eliminating the State Income Tax?
Press Release

Location: Augusta, ME

On Monday, Governor Paul R. LePage sent a letter to all members of Legislative leadership requesting bipartisan support for a bill to amend the Maine Constitution effectively eliminating the State income tax by 2020. LR 1983, "Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Eliminate the Income Tax," would put over one billion dollars a year back into the paychecks of hard-working Maine taxpayers.
"To ensure that any income tax cut is permanent and cannot be reinstated by future legislatures, it is critical that we change the Constitution," Governor LePage wrote in the letter. "We must remove the burden that the personal income tax places on Maine families -- from retirees on fixed incomes to job creators -- by amending the Constitution of the State of Maine to eliminate the personal income tax levied by our State once and for all."
Governor LePage introduced his two-year budget on January 9, which proposes gradually lowering the income tax burden by 2019 for hundreds of thousands of working Mainers while at the same time right-sizing government.
"As I have travelled around our state these last few months talking to Mainers in town halls, addressing business and civic organizations and speaking at many other forums, it has become clear to me that the people who elected us agree that the path to prosperity for Maine is a future with no State income tax. After all, the true power comes from the people of Maine, and every elected official works on their behalf," the Governor wrote.
Governor LePage has requested a response for support of the Constitutional amendment by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, April 21.
