Statement of Governor LePage About Medicaid Expansion as a Factor in Personal Income Growth Earnings
Statement
By: Paul LePage
Date: June 26, 2014
Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage issued the following statement today with regard to erroneous interpretations from the Portland Press Herald of his Medicaid expansion-related comments:
"I don't think Social Security or Medicare is welfare. Only the most liberal interpretation of my statements about Medicaid expansion would twist my words to include Social Security and Medicare. Welfare expansion is not a reliable, nor is it a sustainable income source for personal growth income earnings.
While my opponents are fighting for welfare expansion, my Administration is committed to preserve funding and resources for Maine's elderly. Some seniors may be forced out of their homes because of financial troubles within Maine's nursing homes and it is why I have pushed so hard to adequately fund those facilities.
Furthermore, I have advocated for the elimination of income taxes on pensions to protect our seniors. I have stood up for Maine's seniors and I will continue to support them."
