As Legislators continue budget negotiations behind closed doors during the final days of the legislative session, Governor Paul R. LePage is reminding Mainers the importance of having some form of an income tax cut.
"An income tax cut helps create jobs as we continue to strengthen our economy," said Governor LePage. "It sends a message to job creators that Maine is serious about making reforms to grow our economy. I am not a politician. I am a businessman who has spent the majority of my career turning companies around and growing them. Government policy can either help or hinder job creation. We must be doing everything we can to help. The entire reason I ran for Governor was to improve the lives of the Maine people."
The Governor is reminding Mainers that in his first year of office, he led an effort to implement the largest tax cut in Maine's history. The tax cut encouraged job creation and assisted low-income Mainers by effectively eliminating their State income tax.
Today's unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, compared to 8 percent in 2011. Additionally, Maine there are 25,000 more people working today than five years ago and 10,000 employment opportunities on the Maine Job Bank.
