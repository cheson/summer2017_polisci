Governor Highlights Technical Education as a valuable tool toward creating effective workforce development
Highlighting the LePage Administration's commitment to improving education through alternative educational strategies, Governor Paul LePage today visited the Hancock County Technical Center in Ellsworth to learn about its successful approach to career and vocational education.
"Technical Centers are a vital part of Maine's educational system," Governor LePage said. "For Maine to address the skills gap and expand educational opportunities for students we must create strong partnerships between educators and employers and increase collaboration among state departments with the goal of expanding the use of vocational technical schools."
Amy Boles directs the Hancock County Technical Center which serves students from eight area high schools and offers ten programs. The focus that Governor LePage has on Career and Technical Education is refreshing Boles says. "More and more, people are understanding the worth and value of our programming to get students college and career ready," she said. "Although the economy is suffering, people don't realize that there is still a great demand for highly skilled laborers. Career and technical education can fill that void. I am fortunate that I live and work in a community and county that understands this and has fully supported our school and its mission."
Courses offered at Hancock County Technical Center:
* Media Communications I and II
* Early Childhood Education I and II
* Academics
* Certified Nursing Assistant
* Culinary Arts I and II
* Carpentry/Building Trades I and II
* Law Enforcement I and II
* Diesel/Heavy Equipment Technology I and II
* Automotive Technology I and II
* Welding Technology I and II (this is a satellite program at Bucksport High School)
Currently, 8,343 students are educated in 27 vocational and technical schools statewide.
"There is no question that many of the job training skills of the 21st Century are learned in our technical schools. And when you connect these schools to business and industry you build the State's capacity for effective workforce development," said the Governor.
