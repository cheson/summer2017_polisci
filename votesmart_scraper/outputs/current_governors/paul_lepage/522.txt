Location: Augusta, ME

Governor Paul R. LePage will celebrate Independence Day in Maine's Queen City participating in the Bangor-Brewer Fourth of July parade. The annual tradition is the largest parade in Maine with more than 1,000 participants and viewed by more than 30,000 people.
"We are all Americans first. This bond can never be broken, and is held through our love of country, and sense of duty for the United States. We feel proud every time we pledge allegiance to our flag, or sing the Star Spangled Banner," stated Governor LePage.
The parade begins at 11 a.m., Thursday, at the Brewer Auditorium, crossing the Chamberlain Bridge into Bangor, and ending at the corner of Exchange and Harlow Streets in Bangor. The route from start to finish will take approximately two hours featuring marching bands, military and specialty units, veterans, floats, and much more.
Governor LePage reminds Mainers that Independence Day is a day to celebrate and also a day of reflection. "It is a time to reflect on what these freedoms mean to us, and how we are able to experience all that our nation has to offer," he said.
"It is because of our troops that we are able to salute our flag. It is because of our troops that we are able to appreciate Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. And it is because of our troops that we are able to experience and talk about the American Dream."
