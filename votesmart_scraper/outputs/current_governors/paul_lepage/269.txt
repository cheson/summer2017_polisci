Governor Paul R. LePage and First Lady Ann LePage have collected 2,154 pounds of food from the generosity of Mainers around the state over the course of three Saturdays in their 4th annual food drive hosted at the Blaine House.
"Every year, Ann and I have been thoroughly impressed by the spirit of giving shown by Mainers who donate their time and money by participating in the Blaine House Food Drive," said Governor LePage. "Mainers take care of each other; they know what it means to act as a community. Fulfilling the physical needs of neighbors less fortunate is an excellent way of working together to help those who have fallen on hard times."
On October 18 and 25, and November 1, Mainers of all ages came to the Blaine House bearing loads of donations to help out their fellow Mainers. Governor LePage led multiple tours of the Blaine House each day. He shared with his guests many historical tidbits and artifacts displayed throughout the Blaine House, plenty of laughs, an array of refreshments, and overall, an inviting atmosphere catered especially toward the youngest of visitors.
The Good Shepherd Food-Bank, which will distribute the donated goods to partnering hunger relief organizations throughout the state, estimates that this year's total contribution will amount to around 1,800 meals served in Maine's neediest communities.
