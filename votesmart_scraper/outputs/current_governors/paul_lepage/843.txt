Paul supports the 2nd amendment--no exceptions. Article I, Section 16 of the Maine Constitution says it best:
"Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms and this right shall never be questioned."
While Paul is Governor, he will:
* Protect Mainers' Gun Rights. Paul will veto any legislation that restricts Mainers' constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms.
* Preserve Mainers' Ability to Defend Themselves. Paul will re-evaluate all policies to ensure Mainers' right to defend their families from danger in their homes will receive the legal protections they deserve.
