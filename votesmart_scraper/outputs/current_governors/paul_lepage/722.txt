Governor Paul LePage joined Major General Bill Libby in the Hall of Flags Thursday afternoon to present Gold Star Honorable Service Medals to veterans and family members for their service and sacrifices dating back to World War II. The Gold & Silver Star Honorable Service Medal Presentation Ceremony was held at the State House where more than 50 guests attended.
"Our service members and their families give so much on our behalf to keep us safe and to secure our freedoms. It is our duty to recognize those who have sacrificed all. This gold star medal is a tribute to the families saluting our fallen heroes who have died in the line of duty," said the Governor. "I am indebted to the families and service members who have given the ultimate sacrifice."
18 soldiers were honored with the Gold Stars, 3 received Silver Star Medals and 2 were honored with an Honorable Service Certificate. Families of the fallen soldiers that were at the Hall of Flags received the gold medals in honor of their family member's service. The Silver Star medals were given to veterans who are former prisoners of war and Purple Heart recipients.
During today's ceremony the Governor also noted active military members saying, "We continue to have large numbers of military members serving and I salute them for their dedication to the defense of our freedom. If it were not for our service members' commitment, from the past and present, we would not be the great Nation we are today or will be tomorrow."
