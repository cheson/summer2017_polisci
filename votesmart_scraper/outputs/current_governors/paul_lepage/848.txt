Maine needs more competition in its health insurance and health care markets. Paul will fight the establishment and special interests so we have more affordable health care options. Paul will also reform government to make Maine's health care system more efficient, so patients and families have peace of mind they are receiving top-notch, affordable care anywhere in the state.
While Paul is Governor, he will:
* Repeal and Replace Dirigo Health. Paul knows the Dirigo Health plan has been a costly failure. The government plan has cost taxpayers more than $160 million to cover just 3,400 uninsured Mainers. Paul will work to repeal Dirigo, and replace it with a viable alternative that provides care for those most in need.
* Expand Private Health Care Options. More choices in Maine's health care market will lead to lower premiums and higher quality care for Maine patients. Paul will expand health insurance options by allowing Maine families and businesses to purchase coverage plans available in other New England states, adding up to a dozen new options for coverage in Maine.
* Eliminate Junk Lawsuits that Drive Premiums Higher. Mainers' health premiums should not be driven by lawyers seeking power and personal wealth. Paul will institute tort reform that achieves a necessary balance between medical best practices and the need for accountability. Tort reform will lower insurance premiums and health care costs so doctors can focus more on the health and wellness of Maine patients.
