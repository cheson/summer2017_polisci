It was a busy week at our Capitol as Maine's fiscal debate continued on the 6 billion dollar budget. We should have a budget within days.
Hi, this is Governor Paul LePage.
The budget is a complex piece of legislation that affects all of us. There are tax cuts for job creators and working families, pension reform that will help us save the system and substantial change to welfare programs that will not only save the State money, but will encourage people to become self-sufficient.
Separately these are intricate pieces of a puzzle that promise savings and promote fiscal responsibility. Together these pieces will help produce jobs and drive Maine forward.
There is a culture shift in Augusta that is being reflected through the budget process. The transformation is also being made through legislation that has already passed through the House and Senate.
This week LD 1 came to my desk. A major signing ceremony will be held soon. This bill, like the budget, will help build our economy.
LD 1 cuts through red tape that has tangled up government for decades. Many great ideas from citizens and job creators have been included in this bill.
Some of the changes that were introduced at my red tape audit workshops can be found in LD 1 such as the Business Liaison Program -- in other words, one-stop shopping for people who need help navigating through the maze of government permitting.
