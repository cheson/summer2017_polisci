Money to be used to build wind tribunes in Greensburg, Kansas
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated Greensburg Wind Farm for the $17.4 million loan it will receive from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The money will be used to build ten wind turbines which will provide power to the community of Greensburg, Kansas.
"This is great news for the city of Greensburg," said Brownback. "Kansas ranks third in the nation in total wind capacity potential and is ready to lead our nation towards a future of cleaner, renewable energy. I support a federal Renewable Electricity Standard in the comprehensive energy bill recently reported out of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. By pursuing a robust energy strategy that utilizes all forms of energy, both conventional and renewable, our country will one day achieve true energy independence."
According to the USDA, the total project cost is estimated at $23.3 million. Approximately, $17.4 million will come in the form of a loan to Greensburg Wind Farm, LLC, a subsidiary of John Deere Renewables. The loan will support the 10 wind turbine project that will generate 12.5 MWs of electricity that will serve the electric needs of the City of Greensburg and other rural communities through the Kansas Power Pool. Since Greensburg's devastating tornado in 2007, USDA Rural Development has provided an estimated $20 million in financing to help with the community rebuilding efforts.
