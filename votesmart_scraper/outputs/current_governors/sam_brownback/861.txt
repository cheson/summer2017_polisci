Brownback Comments on Net Neutrality Ruling
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the Federal Communications Commission's decision that Comcast violated net neutrality principles.
"I am disappointed in the FCC's action against Comcast," said Brownback. "There has been no market failure to justify the heavy-hand of so-called net neutrality, and I do not believe the Commission has the authority to enforce principles as if they were adopted rules. The Bush Administration has made deregulation of the Internet and the telecommunications sector a priority; today's move was a giant step backward and may harm innovation and broadband deployment. Competitive markets, not the government, should decide which business model best suits the industry." The Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 that Comcast violated the Commission's policy by slowing some Internet traffic.
