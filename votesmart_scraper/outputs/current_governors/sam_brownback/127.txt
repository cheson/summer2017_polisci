Governor Sam Brownback today commended the record-setting 15,780 new Kansas businesses established in 2014. The number of new domestic entities filed has increased every year Governor Brownback has been in office. Figures were released Tuesday by the Secretary of State's office in its annual Business Formation Report.
"This mark of health for the Kansas economy is the result of our pro-growth tax policies," Governor Brownback said. "Lifting the income tax burden from small businesses provides hard-working entrepreneurs the flexibility they need to create thriving businesses."
Most Kansans work for small businesses, with 10 or fewer employees. The more than 500,000 small businesses in Kansas help drive our economy while contributing to their local communities.
One such business owner is Candi Marr, a native Kansan, who embraced the promise of entrepreneurialism by opening her own homegoods and gifts store, Heart to Home LLC, in downtown Holton. Looking to leave her 20-year banking career due to increasing federal regulation of the industry, Marr wanted a vocation offering better hours and deeper relationships.
"I knew I wanted to own my own business," Marr said. "I wanted to offer Holton something they didn't have. It is important to me to meet their needs with quality products and to build relationships with my customers."
Feb. 18, 2014 Marr opened the doors of Heart to Home. The renovated location on the city's historic square holds 1,200 square feet of gifts and home d√©cor. Marr employs three part-time workers.
