WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today made the following statement to commemorate the second anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
Every American knows the details of what happened two years ago on this date all too well. For all of us, today is a day of remembrance. It is only fitting that we properly and solemnly remember those who lost their lives on September 11th, 2001. On the two year anniversary of these tragic events, the most important thing for us to do is honor the thousands of people who lost their lives that day.
Immediately following the attacks, America responded aggressively. We embarked upon a war on terrorism. This war continues today, and is unlike any war our nation has fought before. Instead of waiting for the terrorists to strike again, we have taken the war to the terrorists. The country of Afghanistan had been a training camp for the Al-Qaeda terror network, but we are dismantling them leader by leader. The growing threat of Iraq, along with known terrorists operating on their soil, required the U.S. to dismantle Saddam Hussein's brutal regime and its capacity to harm. This brought freedom to a brutally oppressed people.
The war we are waging against terrorism has been successful thus far. However, we will not let down our guard. We must remain ever vigilant, and continue to promote freedom around the world. We must remember those who died on September 11th, honor those who gave their lives in the war on terrorism, and stand with everyone who yearns for freedom around the world.
