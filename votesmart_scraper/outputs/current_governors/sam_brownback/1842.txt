WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today chaired a hearing entitled, "Cloning: A Risk to Women?," in the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space.
"Today, we want to try and better understand whether or not human cloning for so-called, 'therapeutic' purposes poses a risk to women's health," Brownback said. "Many of the proponents of human cloning claim that a cure to many of the diseases that plague humanity lie just around the corner. In this hearing we will examine some of these claims; and also what would have to happen in order for these claims to be realized.
"First, we should start with some definitions. The bipartisan Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003 (S. 245), sponsored by myself and Sen. Landrieu, defines human cloning as human asexual reproduction, that is accomplished by introducing nuclear material from one or more human somatic cells into a fertilized or unfertilized oocyte whose nuclear material has been removed or inactivated so as to produce a living organism (at any stage of development) that is genetically virtually identical to an existing or previously existing human organism.
"This definition is very important. The fusion of the somatic cell and the oocyte create a human embryo that is genetically identical to the somatic cell donor. This genetic match is what proponents of human cloning claim will solve the immune response rejection problem and will provide treatments for millions of people.
"This hearing will examine what would be necessary in order to realize the promise held out to those suffering by those who are advocating human cloning as a means to cure the diseases that plague humanity.
