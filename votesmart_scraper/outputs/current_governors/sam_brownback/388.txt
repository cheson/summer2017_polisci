Kansas Governor Sam Brownback released the following statement on the Big 12 realignment and announcement that the University of West Virginia is joining the league:
"I'm thrilled that just like the Wildcats and Jayhawks, the Big 12 is now playing offense. With the addition of West Virginia and TCU, the Midwest, not one of the coasts, is home to the best conference in the country. I'm very pleased to welcome both to the Big 12 Conference."
