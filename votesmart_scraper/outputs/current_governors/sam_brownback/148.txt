Governor Sam Brownback today issued a statement in honor of Veterans Day.
"Veterans Day is an important time to reflect on the cost of freedom, thank the men and women who protect our freedoms, and remember those who have willingly paid the ultimate price to defend us.
"America's veterans have served honorably across the globe, and we owe them our respect and gratitude for their commitment to our nation and the ideals we value.
"On this Veterans Day I encourage all Kansans to take time to thank those who have served in our armed forces. Their efforts help ensure that we can continue to enjoy the freedoms our Founding Fathers passed down to us.
"To every veteran -- those who have served and those who are serving today -- I thank you on behalf of the people of Kansas. God bless."
