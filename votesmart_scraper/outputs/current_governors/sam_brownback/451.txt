Kansas Governor Sam Brownback expressed his appreciation today for 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision to expedite its review of a federal district court's ruling that Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) is unconstitutional.
"It is important to resolve this lawsuit as quickly as possible. States are in the midst of building their budget plans and need to know now whether they should begin preparing for the tremendous financial burden of the federal health care law," Gov. Brownback said. "I am pleased states will not endure years of litigation. A quick resolution by the Court will provide finality for states, businesses, health care providers and citizens, and possibly avoid the implementation of the costly, burdensome and overreaching bill."
