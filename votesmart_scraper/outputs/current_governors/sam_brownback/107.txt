The Governor today issued the following statement in response to a final rule by the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers related to the "Waters of the U.S." (WOTUS). The State of Kansas previously requested that the proposed rule be withdrawn so appropriate coordination could take place with the states.
"This final rule from the EPA continues a pattern of federal overreach, by asserting broader federal jurisdiction over local water and land use.
"We will carefully review this rule to understand the full effect of this encroachment into an area where states should -- and are -- taking the lead to protect and preserve water quality. Such an expansion of the EPA's regulatory power will have a significant, negative effect on Kansas.
"Kansas already has laws in place to protect waters that fall under state jurisdiction. Not only is this rule an overreach by the federal government, it is a costly infringement on state's rights without providing any significant benefit.
"Now, federal agencies will expect Kansas to implement an onerous policy that was developed with little meaningful input from the states and other stakeholders. I will continue to work with other Governors and our state's federal officeholders to address this rule and protect the rights of Kansas land owners and businesses."
