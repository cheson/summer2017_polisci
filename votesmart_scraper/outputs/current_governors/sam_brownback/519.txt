BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this discussion we are having. I was here when the Congressional Review Act was put into place for the very purpose it is being used for, which is when we have a Federal agency that overreaches and seeks to put in place a regulation that will cost tens of billions of dollars, without any legislative action taking place, the Congress should step in. That is what the Congress is seeking to do with this--step in on something that has enormous economic consequences, enormous costs across society, and yet has not been voted on by this legislative body.
Clearly, if we are going to do something of this nature, it should pass the Senate. It should come up in front of this body.
Toward that end, I tell my colleagues we have a bipartisan energy bill that passed through the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, which Chairman Bingaman worked through his committee over a month's period of time, that has a number of issues regarding renewable energy, regarding nuclear technology, to reduce CO
2 emissions. Lots of things are in it. It passed in a bipartisan way through committee.
That is what we ought to bring up on the Senate floor. We should pass the Murkowski disapproval resolution so that EPA doesn't act prematurely before the Congress acts. We should bring up the bipartisan American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, consider it, and use that as the route forward for us as a legislative body to act on a major issue facing our country, without having it done by fiat by an unelected bureaucracy, which is going to make people mad, and it will have a lot of costs.
