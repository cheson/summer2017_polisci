WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today addressed the Association of Women's Business Centers at a reception on Capitol Hill. "Your effort toward encouraging women to start and grow business is a laudable endeavor," Brownback said. "I applaud you for your work. Our nation has a wealth of talented and capable people, and it is truly a travesty when individuals fail to act upon their dreamsespecially those dreams from which society at large would benefit.
"Now more than ever, our nation needs visionaries. It needs individuals who will dare to dream, and thenmost importantlytake steps to make those dreams become reality. That is where Women's Business Centers come into the picture. You are making a real difference in helping people overcome adversity as they launch their businesses and act upon their dreams.
"The best thing the Congress can do to help your efforts is to create a climate where small businesses can flourish. The way to accomplish this is through relieving the tax burden of small business owners, thereby allowing them to invest their capital as will best help their business. In so doing, new jobs will be created, and we will all benefit.
