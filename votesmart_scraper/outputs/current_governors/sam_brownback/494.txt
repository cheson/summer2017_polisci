U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the change in the U.S. mission in Iraq.
"As the US mission in Iraq evolves, we have another opportunity to recognize the amazing achievements of our men and women in uniform," said Brownback. "Their sacrifice and dedication resulted in an historic reversal of the security situation in Iraq and brought hope and opportunity to millions of Iraqis. It also enhanced our own security by bringing the fight to the terrorists and keeping them from our shores.
"Kansans were in the center of the fight. From ironing out new doctrine at Fort Leavenworth to enabling the build up from Fort Riley, the Kansas connection to success in Iraq is strong. And the men and women in our Guard and Reserve units continue to answer the call to consolidate these hard won gains.
"This tremendous progress is not irreversible. Al Qaeda and Iran stand ready to re-emerge if Iraqis do not take steps to make hard-won security gains permanent. Iraqis must continue to make tough political compromises among the country's various sectarian and ethnic groups. The Iraqi Armed Forces and police units must become more proficient and professional, and the Iraqi government must weed out corruption and manage its considerable oil resources wisely. I share President Obama's hope that our current course will allow us to achieve the goal of a stable Iraq that can govern and defend itself and be an ally in the war on terrorism. If conditions deteriorate, however, I hope President Obama will heed the advice of our military commanders and accordingly adjust this timetable to preserve our security interests in Iraq."
