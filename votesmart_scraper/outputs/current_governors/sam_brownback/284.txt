Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement today after notifying Kansas Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger that he would not support her grant application to partner with the federal government to create a state-federal partnership insurance exchange in Kansas.
"Kansans feel Obamacare is an overreach by Washington and have rejected the state's participation in this federal program. My administration will not partner with the federal government to create a state-federal partnership insurance exchange because we will not benefit from it and implementing it could costs Kansas taxpayers millions of dollars.
"Any other elected official who supports implementation of a federal-state partnership exchange should pursue legislation in the 2013 legislative session where lawmakers can debate and vote on the proposal."
