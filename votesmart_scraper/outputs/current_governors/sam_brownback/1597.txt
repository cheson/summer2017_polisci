Hearing of the Committee on the Judiciary on Confirmation Hearing of the Nomination of Alberto R.Gonzalas to be Attorney General of the United States
STATEMENT OF HON. SAM BROWNBACK, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF KANSAS
Senator Brownback. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is good to be back on the Committee and to welcome you as
Chairman. And I welcome Judge Gonzales and am delighted in your public service to the State of Texas, the United States, and what I believe will be soon as Attorney General of the United States. Delighted to have you here. Welcome to your family as well. I love the name of the town you are from of Humble, Texas. I think that is a great place for a public servant to
come from, and it reminds you of the proverb that humility comes before honor. You come from the right place to be honored
with this type of position.
