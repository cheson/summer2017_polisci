MSNBC "Super Tuesday"-Transcript
MR. SHUSTER: An August plagued by scandal has gone and September has arrived, but big morality questions still dog the GOP, rough debate over Iraq is about to begin, and fasten your seat belts because the 2008 race for president is now in the stage often referred to as the "demolition derby."
Hello, everybody. I'm David Shuster, and welcome to our continuing "Super Tuesday" coverage. We have a terrific hour ahead for you, including the latest on the presidential campaign trail, the big story today in New Hampshire, the fallout from the Larry Craig sex scandal, and the hot debate between Congress and the Bush administration over Iraq.
But we're going to begin this hour with Republican Senator Sam Brownback from Kansas. He's a 2008 presidential candidate. The outspoken conservative senator has been talking a lot about family structure and culture in his effort to rally the Republican Right.
The senator joins us from New Hampshire. Senator, welcome to the program.
SEN. BROWNBACK: Thank you, David. Good to join you.
MR. SHUSTER: Senator, when you were on a week ago, we asked you about the Larry Craig scandal -- one of my colleagues did -- and you said I think we ought to look and see what the facts are. Are you now willing to state that, yes, Larry Craig should have resigned?
