Brownback Recognizes Sudan Peace Agreement 3rd Anniversary
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today recognized the 3rd anniversary of Sudan's Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
"I applaud the anniversary of this historic moment for the people of Sudan," said Brownback. "The signing of the CPA was the beginning of the peace process between North and South Sudan, but it serves as a foundation for peace throughout all of Sudan. Now is the time to move forward for peace under this agreement and away from the violence that unfortunately still continues in Sudan."
The signing of the CPA, January 9, 2005, brought the end of two decades of a war between the North and the South; a war which had claimed the lives of over two million people and displaced six million people from their homes.
Brownback continued, "The CPA seeks to give the Sudanese people more control in how their country is governed. Under the terms of the CPA, elections are due in 2009 and a census was set to be completed in 2007. I urge the census to be completed and the elections to take place in 2009. This anniversary is an opportunity for the Sudanese government and the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement to display the fortitude to fully implement all terms of this important agreement."
