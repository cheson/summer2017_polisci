Brownback Condemns North Korean Regime for Deadly Attack on South Korean Ship
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today condemned the North Korean regime for its attack on a South Korean naval warship. Forty-six sailors were killed in the attack.

"The North Korean regime must be held responsible for its despicable act," said Brownback. "The United States should act quickly to re-list North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism and North Korea should face immediate, multi-lateral sanctions. North Korea is a threat to its neighbors, the East Asian region and the rest of the world and must be held accountable for its provocative actions."

Following a two month, international investigation, the South Korean government today issued a formal report about the attack on The Cheonan, a South Korean warship. The Cheonan in late March was torpedoed; the resulting explosion killed 46 sailors. The South Korean government had been investigating the incident and today formally blamed North Korea for the attack.
