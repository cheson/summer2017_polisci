Issue Position: Technology and Telecommunications
Communications TowerI believe telecommunications services and communications technologies hold the power to erase geographic and socioeconomic barriers in our nation. The Internet is revolutionizing the way Americans work, learn, and entertain themselves, and our nation's telecommunications policy must reflect the growing importance of connectivity in an increasingly online world. To this end, I am pursuing a pro-competitive, deregulatory framework for our nation's telecom sector, which will spur the deployment of new services and technologies in the marketplace. I am also dedicated to our nation's longstanding commitment to provide universal access to affordable telecommunications services so no American is left behind as we venture into the information age.
