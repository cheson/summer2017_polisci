STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
S. 1157. A bill to establish within the Smithsonian Institution the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, over 200 years ago, there was a dream that was America for a group of individuals who were brought to our shores in shackles. A dream so powerful that compelled a race of people to fight for the liberty of others when they were in bondage themselves. A dream that not only served as a catalyst for physical liberation in the African-American community but removed societal shackles from our culture and enabled us to realize the ideals set before us in the constitutionÂ—that all men are created equal under God.
Today, we celebrate this magnificent history. A history of people's quest for freedom that shaped this Nation into a symbol of freedom and democracy around the world. I am proud to stand here today with my colleagues and introduce once again to this body a bill that will create the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
