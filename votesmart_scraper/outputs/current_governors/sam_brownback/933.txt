Brownback Presses President Lee on Opening up South Korean Markets to U.S. Beef
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today met with South Korean President Lee Myung Bak to discuss the re-opening of South Korean markets to U.S. beef imports.
"Today I met with President Lee and made a strong case for the South Korean market to fully re-open to U.S. beef," said Brownback. "I am certain that American beef is the safest and highest quality beef available, and I am hopeful that the South Korean government will recognize that fact."
Brownback indicated hope that the issue would be resolved soon and that there were positive indications from the meeting.
In 2003, the South Korean market closed to U.S. beef imports, after a Canadian-born cow found in Washington State tested positive for BSE. South Korea partially re-opened its markets in 2006, and their markets are currently open to American boneless beef from cattle 30 months old or younger. South Korea imported more than 199,000 tons of U.S. beef in 2003, valued at $880 million, making South Korea America's third largest beef export market. CattleFax estimates that the Korean market is worth over $1 billion dollars annually to the United States, and $192.5 million to the state of Kansas.
Brownback earlier this year met with U.S. Trade Ambassador Susan Schwab to discuss the issue of international beef trade.
