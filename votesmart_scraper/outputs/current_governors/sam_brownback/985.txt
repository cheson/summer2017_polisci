U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commended the Department of Veterans Affairs for more than doubling its reimbursement rates for veterans traveling to VA medical facilities.
"This reimbursement increase is a win for our veterans, especially those who live in rural Kansas and must travel many miles to receive medical treatment," said Brownback. "With rising gasoline prices, this is the least we can do for these great Americans who have sacrificed so much for our country. It is a great honor to honor to serve our county, and the brave men and women of our armed forces should have access to the best care we can provide."
The appropriations bill for 2008 provided funding for VA to increase the travel mileage reimbursement rate from 11 cents per mile to 28.5 cents per mile. The increase goes into effect on February 1, 2008.
