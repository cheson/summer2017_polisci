Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement in observance of Memorial Day.
"Today in Kansas, and all across our great nation, we pause to remember those American men and women who have fought and died to defend our country. We owe a debt to our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and Coast Guard whose diligence and bravery makes our world a safer place.
"To those who have served in the past and to those who serve today, we thank you.
"Freedom is something we should cherish every day of the year, but never more so than on this holiday that recognizes the sacrifices made to achieve that freedom. I urge all Kansans to remember the spirit of this day and honor the memories of the Americans who have given their lives to defend America. Each one of these men and women was loved and cherished by family, friends and community. Our country is greater because of their service and sacrifice.
"May God continue to bless our nation, our state and the men and women who serve it."
