BROWNBACK:
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate you holding this hearing, the first one out of the box, on this subject, and your persistence on working on it.
I think it's an important issue. It's a tough issue. But you have certainly never been one to shy away from tough issues. And I'm glad you're grabbing and dealing with this one as well.
And I appreciateI see my old friend, Joe Lieberman, and working as well with Ron on this subject.
I just want to point out one narrow topic on this, because you can look at a whole array of issues to address on global climate change and way of addressing it, policy-wise. The one that I want to build on is what Ron already cited, is the area of carbon sequestration and conservation practices. And you've got a witness that's going to testify about that today.
I think there are things that we can do to positively affect our net national carbon emissions that have other environmental benefits and which can have a positive effect on the overall economy and that we can get through legislatively. I think these are things that we can get done.
Of course there, I'm referring to carbon sequestration and conservation practices. I know that we'll have Mr. Krupp will tell us about some of the innovative projects that his organization is working on in the Pacific Northwest. And these are projects that not only suck carbon out of the atmosphere, but have the more tangible benefits, as welladditional tangible benefitsof improving water quality and preserving wildlife habitat. It's a three-win issue in doing this.
