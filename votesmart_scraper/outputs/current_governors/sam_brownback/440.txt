Press Release

Date: April 27, 2011
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback sent a letter today to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, requesting the USDA issue a drought disaster declaration for 21 Kansas counties.
"Farmers in Kansas Counties are experiencing production losses caused by drought, wildfires, and high winds," Gov. Brownback said. "Declaring these county agricultural disasters will make them eligible for emergency loans administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency, as well as any other aid that may be available through the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program approved in the 2008 farm bill."
The 21 counties included in the Governor's request are Finney, Gove, Grant, Greeley, Hamilton, Haskell, Kearny, Lane, Logan, Meade, Morton, Ness, Scott, Seward, Sheridan, Sherman, Stanton, Stevens, Thomas, Wallace, and Wichita.
"Agriculture plays a vital role in our state economy," Kansas Secretary of Agriculture Dale Rodman said. "A disaster declaration will help Kansas farmers and ranchers mitigate the negative impact this drought has had on their operations."
The Governor's request reflects the recommendations of the Kansas State Emergency Board.
