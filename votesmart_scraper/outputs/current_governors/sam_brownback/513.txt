U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on Conference Committee negations to alter language to exempt auto dealers from being regulated under a new government agency created by the Financial Regulation bill.
"Both the House and Senate agreed to accept the original language of the auto dealer amendment, but now there are proposed changes that would radically alter the original intention of a sensible bipartisan compromise," said Brownback. "This is an unnecessary and harmful effort that will hurt auto dealers on Main Street, and I urge my Senate colleagues to fight against these changes."
The House and Senate last month passed versions of a Financial Regulation bill. The Conference Committee is now meeting to reconcile the differences contained in the two versions. Brownback language to keep auto dealers from being treated as financial institutions was included as a motion to instruct conferees. The House has offered to accept the original Brownback language.
