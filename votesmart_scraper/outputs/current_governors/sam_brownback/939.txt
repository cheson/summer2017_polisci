SEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R-KS): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
And Commissioner and witnesses, I appreciate very much you being here. We're all very interested in hearing about recent developments in the labors -- labor force. Today's news that the economy lost 80,000 payroll jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose 5.1 percent is disappointing to all of us. This is not good news. This is bad news. We will be working on what we can do to see that that not go further in a difficult way. I do want to get some questions to you as we get into a time period of questions, whenever that might be appropriate, to be able to ask what -- do we see any trendlines here in the data that can let us know where this is going or what particular areas seem to be the weakest and where do we have potential for strength? And those are the things I'm going to be curious about as well.
Mr. Chairman, thank you for letting me step in here. We had two votes on the Senate floor that I had to be at, and so I look forward to the rest of the presentation and some questions.

SEN. BROWNBACK: Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Thanks for the data and the information. We had Chairman Bernanke in earlier this week and he was talking about the growth in the export market that was taking place as one of the bright sides of the economy. Do you see any of that reflected in your employment data of either strength or less weakness in employment in export-oriented sectors?
