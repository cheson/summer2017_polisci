Brownback, Durbin Call on Governors to Aid Fight Against Darfur Genocide
U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Richard Durbin (D-IL) today called on state governors to help end the genocide in Darfur by divesting their states' public pension funds from companies that assist or do business with the Sudanese regime.
"Governors can send a tangible signal to Khartoum that the American people do not tolerate genocide," said Brownback. "Divestment helped bring an end to apartheid in South Africa and I hope the example already set by six states will inspire other governors to take action."
"Darfur is the first genocide of the 21st century and we all must do our part to stop the killing and displacement of innocent people," said Durbin. "We encourage the nation's governors to join Illinois and other states that have taken this clear and firm stand by passing their own divestment laws."
Brownback and Durbin sent the governors a letter asking them to review their states' pension funds and make targeted divestments from companies that do business with the Sudanese government, a principal actor in the ongoing genocide in Darfur.
California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey and Oregon have already taken steps to divest from companies doing business with Sudan. The senators sent the letter to the remaining 44 governors.
Following is the full text of the letter:
