DHS Secretary: "Reassessment" Nothing to do with NBAF Location
Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Feb. 14, 2012
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback spoke with U.S. Department of Homeland (DHS) Secretary Janet Napolitano this morning regarding President Obama's proposal to reassess the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF).
"Secretary Napolitano and I had an excellent conversation this morning. She assured me the 'reassessment' had nothing to do with the need for or location of the NBAF but rather with the overall cost and scope of the project," Governor Brownback said. "DHS selected Manhattan, Kansas as the location of the NBAF on the merits. And I fully expect that the NBAF will be built here."
Secretary Napolitano is scheduled to testify before U.S. House and Senate committees respectively on Wednesday and Thursday.
Brownback said the state and the federal delegation will strongly pursue federal funding of the facility. He will hold a meeting of his NBAF Steering Committee in the coming weeks.
