Legislation would require bills to be posted online, scored by CBO
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today co-sponsored the 72 Hour Transparency Resolution, a bill which would require Congress to make available to the general public information about all pending legislation.
"Lawmakers in Washington vote on many pieces of legislation which have long-lasting effects on the daily lives of Americans," said Brownback. "Congress must act responsibly as it considers important legislation, and be held accountable for its actions. The American people deserve to know exactly what Congress is debating; this bill would provide greater Congressional transparency."
The 72 Hour Transparency Resolution, introduced today by Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY), requires that all pending Congressional legislation be posted online, and fully scored by the Congressional Budget Office, 72 hours before consideration by a committee or the full Senate. In the case of emergency legislation, the rule could be over-ridden with a 2/3 vote of the Senate. According to a recent poll, 83% of U.S. voters say legislation should be posted online, in final form, and available for anyone to read before it is voted on by Congress.
