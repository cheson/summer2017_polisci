Gov. Matt Bevin, joined by Sen. Max Wise and members of American Heart Association, today ceremonially signed Senate Bill (SB) 33, requiring every public school district to ensure that students receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training a minimum of one time while enrolled in grades seven through twelve.
The training does not have to be provided by a certified instructor or result in the students being certified in CPR.
"The power of what you're learning here will literally change someone's life," Gov. Bevin said during the signing. "It is serious business, and I challenge each and every one of you to step up and learn as much as you can about it. You have the ability to change the world."
Senator Max Wise said SB 33 will teach hands-on life-saving skills that can be essential for saving lives.
"I would like to thank all the groups who helped raise awareness in the public and in the legislature on the importance of SB 33," Sen. Wise said. "This bill will teach hands-on life-saving skills to our public high school students that can be essential for saving lives in their communities. I also appreciate Gov. Bevin for his support, and everyone else who assisted in the passage of this bill."
