STEM CELLS -- (Senate - May 04, 2006)
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, another topic I will discuss is embryonic stem cell and adult stem cell research. I will show two books because we have a lot going on regarding stem cells and in stem cell research.
I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a chart on Federal funding of stem cell research.
There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:

U.S. FEDERAL TAXPAYER FUNDING TOTAL NIH STEM CELL RESEARCH FY 2002-FY 2006
[Dollars in millions]** FY 2002 Actual FY 2003 Actual FY 2004 Actual FY 2005 Actual
Non embryonic Embryonic Total Non embryonic Embryonic Total Non embryonic Embryonic Total Non embryonic Embryonic Total
Human, subtotal 170.9 10.1 181.0 190.7 20.3 211.0 203.2 24.3 227.5 199.4 39.6 239.0
Nonhuman, subtotal 134.1 71.5 205.5 192.1 113.5* 305.6 235.7 89.3* 325.0 273.2 97.0 370.2
NIH, total 305.0 81.6 386.6 382.9 133.8* 516.6 439.0 113.6* 552.5 472.5 136.7 609.2
*Decrease from FY03 to FY04 is the result of a change in methodology used to collect nonhuman embryonic funding figures. This methodology change also contributed to an increase in nonhuman non-embryonic.
**Numbers may not add due to rounding.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, noting for the record the actual spending in 2005 on embryonic stem cell research, the U.S. Federal Government spent nearly $40 million on human embryonic stem cell research. We spent $97 million on nonhuman embryonic stem cell research, for a total of $136 million the Federal Government spent on embryonic stem cell research.
That is a fair investment. We also spent $472 million in nonembryonic. What did we get for $136 million in embryonic stem cell research? Here is the folder that contains the human clinical trials of embryonic stem cell research in humans, treating and healing humans. This is the list of research results we have from a nearly $40 million Federal investment last year of human clinical trials with embryonic stem cell research. This is research where a young, embryonic human life is destroyed and stem cells harvested and taken out and applied.
I note that this folder is empty. This is the list of research results we have from embryonic stem cell research on humans.
We also invested in adult and cord blood stem cell research. The cord between the mother and child is rich in stem cells that can be used in a lot of treatment areas, along with adult stem cells. You have stem cells in your body and I have them in my mine. They are akin to a repair kit.
I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the listing of 69 different human illnesses being treated by adult and cord blood stem cells.
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. What did we get for our research investment in adult and cord blood in human clinical trials? This is the folder--it is getting heavy--of what we have discovered in human clinical trials with adult and cord blood stem cell research; real people being treated for real diseases such as bladder disease, lupus, cancer, heart, strokes, immunodeficiency areas, liver disease, neuro degenerative diseases, ocular, wounds and injuries, autoimmune diseases, anemias and other blood conditions, metabolic disorders, 69 human diseases being treated with adult and cord blood stem cells.
For my money on this, I would rather treat people--get real human treatments--than in this area of embryonic stem cell research where we are getting no cures. We are seeing a lot of cancer cells growing out of the embryonic stem cell areas and treatments.
Let's go for what is real. And let's do what is real. I further note, as I close, there is no prohibition in this country on embryonic stem cell research. None. No prohibitions. Yet why do the private companies not go into funding more embryonic stem cell research? It is because they are getting no results with embryonic stem cells. Nothing is happening results wise. Let's invest our money in adult stem cell research where we can actually treat people. That is important.
I yield the floor.
