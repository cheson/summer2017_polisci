OUR LOSS IN IRAQ TODAY -- (Senate - January 26, 2005)
Mr. BROWNBACK. I have an introduction of a bill I wish to talk about, but first I want to express our sympathy to the families of those who were lost in Iraq within the last 24 hours. There was a helicopter crash that took place. As I understand from the early news, 31 marines were killed in that helicopter crash. There were several other deaths in the last 24 hours leading up to this election in Iraq that takes place on Sunday. If we recall, there has been an increased level of violence taking place. We don't know the cause of this helicopter crash that took place, but we do know there was significant loss of life.
Our hearts and our prayers go out to the lost soldiers who stand in harm's way as we seek democracy, liberty, and freedom for the people of Iraq. Our heartfelt sympathies to the families, and our deepest dedication and devotion to those who continue to serve who are in harm's way.
I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that it be in order for us to take a moment of silence and prayer for those who have just lost their lives in Iraq.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, we will have a moment of silence.
(Moment of silence.)
