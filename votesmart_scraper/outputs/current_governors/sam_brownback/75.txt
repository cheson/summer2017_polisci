Governor Sam Brownback today issued a statement following the release of National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores for K-12 schools across the nation. Results show test scores across the nation, including in Kansas, are lower than in 2013. NAEP assessments are conducted every two years using a random sample of 4th and 8th grade students in each state.
"Today's NAEP scores reflect the need for real education reform to benefit our students. This is a complex issue with no single cause or solution and today's results confirm a trend showing that even though education funding has increased by more than $1 billion over the past decade, NAEP scores have remained largely flat.
"During my campaign, I called for a renewed emphasis on improving student performance in science, engineering, technology and math (STEM) disciplines. Today's results underscore the importance of those efforts. We will continue to work toward educational reform that includes the innovative programs, collaborations and strategic investments that best serve our Kansas students.
"While our Kansas schools remain above the national average, we can and should do more. We want our students to excel and have the skills they need to succeed in school and life in the 21st century. To do that, we must work to get more dollars into the classroom and into the infrastructure our teachers need to improve student performance, particularly in math. We need flexibility at the local level to address students' needs, and we should support the great efforts of the thousands of teachers who work every day to help give our students opportunity for a brighter future."
