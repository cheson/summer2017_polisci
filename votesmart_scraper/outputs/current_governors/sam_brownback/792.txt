BROWNBACK DISAPPOINTED THAT SENATE FAILED TO REINSTATE BAN ON FEDERAL FUNDING OF ABORTION
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today expressed disappointment with the Senate's failure to pass an amendment which would have reinstated the ban on federal funding for international groups that promote or perform abortions.
"I'm extremely disappointed in the Senate's failure to overturn an executive order that sanctions the use of taxpayers' money to fund abortions," said Brownback. "Last Thursday, I attended the annual March for Life and was overwhelmed by the hundreds of people who marched for the rights of the unborn. And I was greatly saddened the next day when President Obama signed an executive order to overturn the ban on taxpayer funding of overseas abortion. America should support nations in need by enacting policies that promote the sanctity of human life."
Last week, President Obama, by executive order, overturned the ban on federal funding for international groups that promote or perform abortions. The ban, commonly referred to as Mexico City Policy, was first implemented by President Reagan in the 1980's. The Senate this morning voted down an amendment offered by Sen. Martinez (R-FL) to reverse President Obama's executive order. Brownback was a co-sponsor of the amendment.
