U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the Federal Communications Commission's plans to regulate the Internet. On Thursday, the FCC commissioners will vote on a Notice of Inquiry to further advance Chairman Genachowski's plan to impose new regulations on broadband.

"I am disappointed that the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is ready to move forward with his effort to unnecessarily regulate the Internet," said Brownback. "A bipartisan majority of members of Congress have expressed strong opposition to Chairman Genachowski's proposal to reclassify broadband as a heavily regulated telecommunications service. Unfortunately the voices of the elected representatives of the people appear to have fallen on the deaf ears of the bureaucrats at the FCC. Rather than pursue a path of regulatory uncertainty that may lead to years of litigation, the FCC should await further guidance from Congress."
