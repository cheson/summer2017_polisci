Brownback, Wolf Decry Sudanese Violence

WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback and Congressman Frank Wolf are introducing legislation condemning increasing violence and the humanitarian crisis in Sudan.
"The situation in the Darfur region of Western Sudan is the most acute humanitarian catastrophe in the world today and Congress must speak out," Brownback stated. "The world can not continue to ignore the murder of unarmed civilians and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. We continue to hear daily reports that government-backed militias are carrying out savage attacks on innocent civilians and that they have engaged in the use of rape as a weapon, abducted children, destroyed food and water systems and burned villages. Nearly three million people are beyond the reach of aid agencies trying to provide assistance, and mortality rates in the Darfur region are catastrophic- possibly as high as one thousand per week. There is no question that the Sudanese government is complicit in these attacks and they must be held responsible. As we solemnly remember the tenth anniversary of the horrific genocide in Rwanda, let us not turn a blind eye to the millions suffering today in Sudan."
