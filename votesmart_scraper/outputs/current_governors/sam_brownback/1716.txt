MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003-CONFERENCE REPORT
Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the chairman, both for his commitment to this legislaiton and for keeping my staff and me informed throughout the drafting of these provisions. I would note that from the time he first spoke on this issue during consideration of the tax bill the chairman has expressed his intent to, "ensure that seniors and their caregivers have adequate payment for, and continued access to, important cancer therapies." I would ask of the chairman, is it his intent that the changes to outpatient drug reimbursement in Sections 303 and 304 of this bill will not have a significantly adverse impact on access to cancer treatment?
Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Kansas is correct. My commitment to cancer patients has not changed. Indeed, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, this bill is expected to actually increase net payments to oncologists in 2004. Also, CBO estimates that the new Average Sales Price Reimbursement model, when coupled with the changes in practice expense reimbursement, will amount to net reductions to cancer care of $4.2 billion over the next 10 years.
