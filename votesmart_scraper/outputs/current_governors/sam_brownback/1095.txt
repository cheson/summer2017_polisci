Brownback Objects to Iowa Same-Sex Marriage Court Ruling
Says we need to rebuild the family, not redefine marriage
DES MOINES - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, the nation's leading defender of traditional marriage, commented today on an Iowa judge's decision to redefine marriage to include same-sex unions:
"We should have the courage and conviction to speak out against this decision. The people of Iowa reject the redefinition of marriage, and I pledge to defend the bond of marriage, as I have consistently done in the past. This decision shows how important it is to elect leaders who will stand for marriage and who will appoint judges that will not legislate from the bench. We need to rebuild the family and renew the culture, not redefine marriage."
