Governor Issues Order Reorganizing the Kansas Health Policy Authority
Press Release
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Feb. 4, 2011
Location: Topeka, KS

Governor Sam Brownback issued an Executive Reorganization Order today that shifts the Kansas Health Policy Authority (KHPA) into the Division of Health Care Finance within the Department of Health and Environment (KDHE).
Governor Brownback said this reorganization order will save the State of Kansas $3 million in administrative costs in the next fiscal year.
"Kansans are looking for government to be more efficient," Brownback said. "Much of the $550 million budget deficit is related to increased caseloads in Medicaid. This reorganization not only saves millions of dollars, but also unifies the expertise in KHPA with the accountability of KDHE as we implement major reforms to our Medicaid delivery model."
Under the direction of Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer, M.D. and KDHE Secretary Dr. Bob Moser, the Division of Health Care Finance will be involved in redesigning Medicaid in the State of Kansas.
"As we look toward a future of balancing priorities within the confines of limited state resources, this reorganization will act as a cornerstone for major and long-lasting reforms," Brownback said.
This order is set to take effect July 1, 2011 unless the Kansas Legislature rejects it.
