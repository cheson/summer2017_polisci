Location: Topeka, KS

During a news conference this afternoon at the Kansas Capitol, Governor Sam Brownback renewed his call for the Kansas Legislature to address the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System's (KPERS) more than $8 billion shortfall.
"State employees, teachers and other KPERS members do important work and they deserve a fair and funded pension system. My administration is committed to stabilizing KPERS and honoring the state's commitment to its current and retired employees," Governor Brownback said. "Without taking action, KPERS will continue to be one of the least funded public pension plans in America. That's embarrassing and hurts our state's credit rating."
