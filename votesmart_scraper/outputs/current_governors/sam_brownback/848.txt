U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) and U.S. Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) today applauded the decision by the Department of Defense to terminate the flawed U.S. Air Force tanker competition in order to start over with a fair, objective process.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, in consultation with senior Defense and Air Force officials, has determined that the solicitation and award of a new aerial refueling tanker cannot be accomplished by January. In making this decision, it was concluded that the current KC-135 fleet can be adequately maintained to satisfy Air Force missions for the near future.
"I could not be happier that the recent biased competition has been cancelled in favor of a new, objective one," Senator Roberts said. "It's vital that we pick the right plane for our warfighter. We owe it to them, and to every American taxpayer to pick a plane that we can support for the next 50 years. With a fresh start, I believe the Boeing tanker will win on the merits."
Senator Brownback said, "I applaud the Department of Defense's decision to terminate the existing process and for giving itself the time to clarify the capabilities it needs in a new tanker. By restarting this competition next year, DoD can restore confidence that the ultimate winner of this competition will be providing the best platform for our warfighters and the best value for our taxpayers."
Senator Roberts, Senator Brownback and Congressman Todd Tiahrt worked across the aisle and in both chambers to ensure that the Air Force would get the best tanker for the warfighter and fair treatment for Boeing Kansas workers.
