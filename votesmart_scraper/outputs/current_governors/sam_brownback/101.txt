Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement after he signed House Substitute for Senate Bill 112, the budget bill.
I want to thank every member of the Kansas Legislature for their hard work during the 2015 session. I greatly appreciate their efforts to control spending by addressing our three major expenditure drivers: education, Medicaid, and KPERS.
This two-year budget will continue to fund the core services of state government to July 1, 2017. I will work to find efficiencies to limit the size of state government while protecting core services vital to the citizens of Kansas.
Pursuant to Article 2, Section 14 of the Constitution of the State of Kansas, I hereby return House Substitute for Senate Bill No. 112 with my signature approving the bill, except for the items enumerated below.
Kansas Board of Regents
SGF Transfer to Postsecondary Education Performance-Based Incentives Fund
The Board of Regents offered as a line-item veto -- and I have vetoed -- approximately $1.9 million in unspent funding in both FY 16 and 17 from a post-secondary education performance-based incentives fund.
Sections 142(f) and 143(f) are vetoed in their entirety.
This new program grants funds to postsecondary institutions for the GED Accelerator for students who wish to complete their GED and receive an educational accreditation. The FY 2015 transfer of $1.9 million from the State General Fund will finance the program for several years. Therefore, the transfer can be suspended in FY 2016 and FY 2017 to preserve State General Fund resources.
