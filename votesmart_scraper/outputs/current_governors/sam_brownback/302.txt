Governor: JJA Audit Highlights Decades of Failed Approach
Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: July 10, 2012
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback released the following statement today regarding the recent performance audit, Juvenile Justice Authority: Evaluating the Kansas Juvenile Correctional complex, Part 1, completed by the Legislative Division of Post Audit.
"By the end of last year it became evident to my Administration that the decades-old approach policy makers and previous administrations have taken to juvenile justice in Kansas has failed to provide the safety and security that juvenile offenders require and deserve.
"At that time, my Administration began to take preemptive steps to address these concerns. After a thorough review of the facilities by the state's top corrections officer in February, we moved aggressively to make changes, including substantial personnel changes in the leadership team at JJA.
"Today's Legislative Post Audit report highlights years of a failed social services approach to juvenile justice in Kansas. The audit clearly shows that for their safety, security, and well-being, juvenile offenders must be served by a professional corrections agency. My administration will thoroughly review the report and work with the Kansas Legislature on long term solutions to the issues at JJA."
