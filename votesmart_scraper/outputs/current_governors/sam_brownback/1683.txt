BODY:
SEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R-KS): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Ambassador Negroponte-very good to have you here. I'll forgo a formal statement, but I would just make note of the situation that you're going into which you note, and you know, of us handing over sovereignty to Iraq, and you will be the ambassador in the period of time when we're going from a role as an occupier into the role as a supporter of democracy in Iraq. It's going to be a critical transition. I think it's going to be difficult. It's going to be something we probably should have done months earlier, more along the design of what perhaps we could have taking place in Afghanistan, of having an Afghan face and an Afghan leadership at a very early stage. But we're getting there now, and we're going to do that. And it's important that we do that. That handoff and the transition and that handing of the sovereignty is going to be at such a critical phase. I stand ready to provide any assistance that I can and support.
Also, just on one point that's coming up now, I think we are going to have to bring back a lot more of the people that were in the government, even during Saddam Hussein. I know that's a tough thing to do, and you're going to have to ferret out who's worthy and who's somebody we can deal with? But we certainly saw that feature when the communist countries fell-the number of people that were communists yesterday and the next day are democracy advocate or free market advocates. And they made the transition-some better than others. But I think you're going to have to be one that's going to be a very shrewd judge of people and hearts, which is awful difficult to do. So I wish you well and godspeed, and I'll look forward to try to be of any assistance I can. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
