Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement today in response to the Kansas Senate's decision not to consider the latest tax reform compromise agreed to by the Tax Conference Committee.
"It is unfortunate that the Kansas Senate has refused even to debate a tax compromise bill that would have provided Kansans tax relief. However, strengthening the Kansas economy cannot wait. We will have pro-growth tax reform in Kansas this year that will create tens of thousands of jobs and will make our state the best place in America to start and grow a small business. I look forward to signing the bill on my desk and I call on legislators to finalize their work on the budget based on the enactment of Senate Sub. for HB 2117. The legislative session needs to conclude."
