U.S. Senator Sam Brownback yesterday spoke with United States Trade Representative Ambassador Susan Schwab and urged her to find a way to fully reopen the South Korean market to U.S. beef imports.
"Yesterday, I spoke with Ambassador Schwab and encouraged USTR to find a way to fully reopen the South Korean market for U.S. beef," said Brownback. "It is past time that our trading partners around the world realize that U.S. beef is the safest and of the highest quality in the world. I will continue fighting for a full resumption of U.S. beef shipments to South Korea."
In 2003, one Canadian cow in Washington State tested positive for BSE. Subsequently, South Korea closed its markets to the importation of U.S. beef. The U.S. beef industry loses $50 million a week due to South Korea's ban on U.S. beef. South Korea imported more than 199,000 tons of U.S. beef in 2003, valued at $880 million, making South Korea America's third largest beef export market.
