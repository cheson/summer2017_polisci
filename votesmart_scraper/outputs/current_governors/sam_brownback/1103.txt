Brownback to Romney: Facts are Facts
In new YouTube video, Brownback challenges Romney's troubled record
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, in a new video posted on YouTube, renewed his call for Mitt Romney to face the facts in the automated phone calls that Brownback's campaign has made to Iowa voters.
The video is available at: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PP76G-GsDjk
"At the debate yesterday, Mitt Romney said that a phone call that we had put out from our campaign was factually inaccurate about his position on abortion, and then he goes on and calls people names," says Brownback. "You can call somebody a name, but facts are more stubborn."
"This is the key moral issue of our day and we don't need people equivocating on it or rediscovering things. We need people leading."
Brownback asks viewers to visit his blog, www.brownbacker.com, to see the facts for themselves.
