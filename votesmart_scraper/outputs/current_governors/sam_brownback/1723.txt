SYRIA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT-CONTINUED
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, who does such an outstanding job on so many issues and really is a national treasure for us on international affairs and international issues, for allowing me recognition to speak on this bill. I thank the cosponsors, Senators SANTORUM and BOXER, for their work in bringing this issue in front of the body. I urge its passage.
I urge usage of the Syria Accountability Act by the President. Several of these issues have already been covered. I wish to address them with some specificity by saying 43 and counting-43 and counting. That is the number of dictatorships that are left in the world. There were 45 at the start of this year. Two have changed over. Dramatic changes are taking place in some other countries. But there are 43 dictatorships.
