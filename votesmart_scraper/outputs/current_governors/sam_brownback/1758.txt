WASHINGTON - As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space, U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today released the following statement in reaction to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board report.
"Over the past several months, through the preliminary recommendations, we have been given some insight into what the Investigation Board has been discovering," Brownback said. "Today all the details are revealed and we are tasked with moving forward in ensuring an American return to flight.
"Today's release of the report shows us that we have a lot of work to do before the shuttle can fly again. I am committed to authoring a reauthorization bill for NASA this Congress and will use this report to provide some of the guidelines for that bill. I have specifically waited until the release of this report before finalizing the bill because of the sensitive nature of the subject and the importance of the information provided in the report.
