Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement on the school finance bill passed by the Kansas legislature.
"The school finance bill passed by the Kansas legislature today fully complies with, and indeed exceeds, the requirements of the recent Kansas Supreme Court ruling for funding schools and providing equity.
"House Bill 2506 increases funding to Kansas schools by $73 million and includes $78 million of property tax relief. The bill ensures that taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently, putting money in the classrooms to help teachers teach and students learn.
"I appreciate the efforts of the legislature, and especially the hard work and leadership of Speaker Merrick and President Wagle."
