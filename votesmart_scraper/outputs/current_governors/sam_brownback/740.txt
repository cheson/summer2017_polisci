Brownback Concerned by Obama Budget Proposals
Says energy provisions would be harmful to Kansas oil and gas producers
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today expressed concern about President Obama's FY 2010 budget proposal which would repeal eight tax provisions affecting independent oil and gas producers.
"I am extremely concerned that the Administration's budget will be harmful to independent oil and gas producers in Kansas, and lead the nation further from energy security," said Brownback. "Eliminating these important tax provisions would discourage domestic energy production and would be devastating to independent oil and gas producers in Kansas. While we must encourage renewable energy development, we should also continue to explore and develop the natural resources available here in America."
Under the proposed FY10 budget, the tax provisions affecting independent oil and gas producers would cost more than $30 billion.
Brownback continued, "As the Congressional budget conference committee meets this week, I am hopeful that conference committee members will remove these harmful provisions from the final budget."
Small, independent producers supply more than 80 percent of the country's natural gas and more than 68 percent of the country's oil.
