Brownback Saddened by Murder of Israeli Students
Gunmen kill several youth in Jerusalem
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today expressed sadness over the murder of several Israeli students.
"I am shocked and saddened by the news that terrorist gunmen opened fire in an Israeli school," said Brownback. "While the exact number of victims is unknown, we can be sure that many friends and family members will be affected by this senseless act of violence. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and the people of Israel. This horrible attack, and the daily rocket attacks from Gaza, demonstrates why the global community must find solutions to guarantee Israel's security."
The shooting occurred earlier today at a school in Jerusalem. News reports indicate that at least eight people were killed.
