Brownback Discusses his Iraq Plan with the Iraqi President
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, Republican candidate for president, today discussed his bipartisan plan for a three-state solution in Iraq while meeting with the Iraqi President Jalal Talabani earlier today in Washington, DC.
"In my meeting with the Iraqi president, he indicated strong support for a federal Iraq," said Brownback. "Decentralizing power in Iraq offers the best chance for Iraqis to live in peaceful, united country where they can resolve their differences. The American people want to win in Iraq and this represents a viable way forward to stability and success."
Last week Senator Brownback played a leading role in creating a broad coalition of conservative and liberal senators who voted 75 to 23 to support a three-state political solution for Iraq, the only Iraq-related policy plan the Senate has adopted this year.
His bipartisan plan, co-authored with Senator Joe Biden (D-DE), calls for a loosely federated central government in Iraq with three semi-autonomous states for the Kurds, Sunni and Shia.
