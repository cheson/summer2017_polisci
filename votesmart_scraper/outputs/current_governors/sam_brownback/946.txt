Brownback Comments on California Court Decision to Rehear Homeschooling Case
Says parents should be allowed to home-school children
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, California, for its decision to rehear a case involving the rights of parents who choose to home-school their children.
"I firmly believe that parents have the right and responsibility to oversee the education of their children," said Brownback. "Homeschooling is a proven method of education, and has been for generations. Governmental bodies should not try to sweep away the options of parents to teach their children."
The 2nd District Court of Appeal last month ruled that parents had no right to home-school their children because they weren't credentialed as teachers by the state. The Court has decided to re-hear the case after facing broad opposition to its decision.
Brownback continued, "It is important for parents to feel confident in the education of their children and I am proud to be a supporter of homeschooling."
