Location: Omaha, NE

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback today met with Governors and representatives from the seven states on the Missouri River, along with representatives of the US Army Corps of Engineers to discuss flood control issues. The Missouri River experienced historic flooding in June and July this year.
"Today's meeting was historic to have so many governors come together on management of the Missouri River Basin," Governor Brownback said. "I'm confident that with our states working together, the US Army Corps of Engineers will make flood control the top priority, and keep our respective constituents on the Missouri River Basin from having to face the devastation that flooding can bring."
Governor Brownback joined Gov. Jack Dalrymple (ND), Gov. Dennis Daugaard (SD), Gov. Jay Nixon (MO), Gov. Brian Schweitzer (MT), Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds (IA) and a representative for Gov. Matthew Mead (WY) at the meeting hosted by Gov. Dave Heineman (NE).
In addition to the meeting held in Omaha today, the seven Governors also signed a letter to John McHugh, Secretary of the United States Army. Secretary McHugh has statutory responsibility for all matters relating to the Army, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The letter states, "There is clear consensus that flood control must be the highest priority in the operation of the Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir System."
Following the meeting, the governors took part in a news conference.
