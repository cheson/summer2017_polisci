Brownback Opposes Increasing Debt for Clunkers
Will not support provision in the Supplemental Conference as passed by the House
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today removed his support from the Cash for Clunkers legislation. He was the primary Republican sponsor of one of the Senate versions of this bill which was budget neutral.
"I can no longer support Cash for Clunkers because the House has decided to fund the legislation through deficit spending and has attached it to the war funding supplemental," Brownback said. "Our bill was a good plan and Senator Stabenow and I worked hard on the Drive America Forward Act to craft a bill that would be truly stimulative, directly benefit consumers, help a critical industry and dealers while not creating more spending but using existing stimulus funds. I will not support the plan if it creates new spending and increases the deficit to do it. I cannot understand why House leadership can't find a way to use any of the $455 billion left in stimulus funds to pay for the program."
