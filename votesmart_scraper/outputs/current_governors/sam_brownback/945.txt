Urges civilians, government officials to remain peaceful
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the presidential election in Zimbabwe.
"The eyes of the world are now on Zimbabwe as it has the opportunity to be a role model for other African nations holding democratic elections," said Brownback. "While I commend the Zimbabwean people and government for a peaceful election process so far, I urge caution as the elections results continue to be released."
The official results of the Zimbabwean elections still are unknown, but the opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, has declared sixty percent of votes based on results gathered by MDC polling agents. The current president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has held office for twenty-eight years.
Brownback continued, "During this crucial time, I strongly encourage the Zimbabwe Election Commission to honor the will of the Zimbabwean people by ensuring that all legitimate votes are counted, tallied, recorded and those results are released. The Zimbabwean people have peacefully demonstrated their desire for a democratic government by casting their ballots, and the international community stands behind the Zimbabweans."
