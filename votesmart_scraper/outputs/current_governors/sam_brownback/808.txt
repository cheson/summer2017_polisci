BROWNBACK APPLAUDS FINAL DECISION TO LOCATE NEW NBAF IN KANSAS
Says DHS made right choice, NBAF will be great for Kansas economy
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the Department of Homeland Security's final decision to locate the new National Bio and Agro Defense Facility in Manhattan, Kansas.
"NBAF is a great win for Kansas and Kansas is a great win for NBAF," said Brownback. "This is great news. I will continue to work hard in the Appropriations Committee to make sure NBAF is fully funded." Last June, Brownback met with Admiral Jay Cohen, Under Secretary for Science and Technology of the Department of Homeland Security, and head of the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility selection committee. During that meeting, Brownback encouraged Cohen to name Manhattan as the site for the new NBAF.
It is estimated that over a twenty year period, NBAF would have a $3.5 billion impact on the Kansas economy. The proposed site would be a $451 million, 500,000 square foot building and will create as many as 500 high-paying, scientific federal jobs in the state of Kansas and will bring additional jobs in research partnerships to the state.
