Governor Brownback today responded to indications that the Obama Administration is considering the use of executive action to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees to America. Fort Leavenworth remains on the list of potential transfer sites for detainees.
"This is the most egregious example yet of overreach by the Obama Administration, proposing to take executive action to bypass Congress in what would be an illegal transfer of Guantanamo detainees to American soil.
"The White House referred to the transfer of detainees as an "important national security objective.' President Obama seems to be more interested in addressing the concerns of the terrorists over the safety of Americans.
"Lt. Governor Colyer and I remain committed to protecting the safety of our citizens and communities. I will continue to fight against the transfer of any GITMO detainees to Kansas."
