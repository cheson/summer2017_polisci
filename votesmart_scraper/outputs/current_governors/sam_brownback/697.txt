Brownback Comments on Increased U.N. Sanctions for North Korea
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on the United Nations Security Council application of more sanctions to North Korea.
"I am pleased that the U.N. Security Council has once again acknowledged the grave threat that North Korea poses to the international community, but it's time to admit that these resolutions have not changed North Korea's behavior," said Brownback. "As North Korea prepares yet another round of nuclear testing and ballistic missile provocations, the United States should re-impose its sanctions that were lifted last year under Six Party Talk agreements."
The U.N.S.C. this morning voted unanimously for the new sanctions against North Korea. The new sanctions were imposed as a response to North Korea's recent nuclear and missile tests, which were in direct violation of international treaty.
Brownback continued, "I urge Senate leadership to allow a vote on re-listing North Korea as a state sponsor of terror. The Kim Jong Il regime has launched missiles in our direction; detonated nuclear weapons; kidnapped two American citizens and sentenced them to years of hard labor; proliferated nuclear and ballistic material to Syria and Iran; aided Hezbollah and other terrorist groups; and continues to imprison thousands of its own citizens in concentration camps. We have tried international sanctions, without effect, and we have tried buying off the regime with energy assistance, and that only made matters worse. Congress must take action that will have measurable results."
