Contains more than $2 billion for Kansas
Friday, July 29, 2005
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced final passage of the transportation appropriations bill. The legislation, known as the Transportation Equity Act, a Legacy for Users, passed 91-4 and now goes to the President's desk for his signature.
"Our nation is a vast land that needs a transportation infrastructure just as vast to meet the needs of its people and businesses," Brownback said. "This highway bill will ensure that the American transportation infrastructure continues to be the best in the world, and that Kansas continues to receive its fair share of federal transportation funds. I was pleased to vote for this bill that pays for the maintenance and improvements to our highways and does so in a fiscally responsible manner."
Kansas will receive approximately $1.915 billion in highway funds and approximately $123 million in transit funds for the life of the highway bill, for a total of over $2 billion for the state's transportation needs.
On an annual basis, Kansas will receive approximately $383.8 million in funding for highway projects.
