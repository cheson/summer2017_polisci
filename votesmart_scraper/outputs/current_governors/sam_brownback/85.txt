Governor Sam Brownback today responded to the Clean Power Plan rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. The rule, which sets national limits on power plant emissions, requires more extensive cuts than earlier versions of the rule.
"The EPA failed to adequately consider the negative impact this overreaching regulation has on Kansas rate payers, resulting in higher electricity rates and greater uncertainty in grid reliability. The final rule released today is twice as bad for Kansas as the proposed rule released last summer and requires us to review not only the rule itself but reconsider the state's overall approach to the Clean Power Plan."
