AMENDMENT NO. 1140, AS MODIFIED
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote in relation to amendment No. 1140, as modified, offered by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback.
The Senator from Kansas is recognized.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. I hope we can get everybody's support. I wish to read it because it is so short, simple, and straightforward:
It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense should consult with State and local government officials before making any decision about where detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, might be transferred, housed, or otherwise incarcerated as a result of the implementation of the Executive Order of the President to close the detention facilities at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.
We should all be for that. We put this as ``should'' instead of a requirement. In Leavenworth, KS, they are very concerned about this. They need to be consulted. In Alexandria, VA, the 20th hijacker, Moussaoui, was tried, and here is what the mayor of Alexandria said:
We would be absolutely opposed to relocating Guantanamo prisoners to Alexandria. We would do everything in our power to lobby the President, the Governor, Congress, and everybody else to stop it. We have had this experience and it was unpleasant. Let someone else have it.
I think we need to consult with the local communities and let them speak. That is why I urge a unanimous vote in favor of this sense-of-the-Senate amendment.
