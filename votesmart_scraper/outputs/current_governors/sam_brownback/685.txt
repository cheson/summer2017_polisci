COMMENDING NORM COLEMAN -- (Senate - July 16, 2009)
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I commend the extraordinary career of Norm Coleman. Norm began his public service as a prosecutor for the Minnesota State Attorney General's Office, working his way up to chief prosecutor before eventually serving as solicitor general of Minnesota. In 1993, he became mayor of St. Paul. During his tenure as mayor, Norm worked faithfully to revitalize the city, even securing a National Hockey League franchise for St. Paul. In 2002, at the urging of President Bush, Norm ran for U.S. Senate. He was the challenger in a close, hard-fought race, and his ultimate victory was an exciting one.
I am proud to have served alongside Norm in the Senate. He was an excellent comrade in the fight against partial birth abortion and worked hard to prevent waste and fraud at the United Nations. Known for his willingness to work with both parties, Norm fought for tax cuts, renewable energy, and prescription drug benefits for seniors. He worked for the passage of legislation improving rural health care, increasing funding for Pell Grants and securing our ports.
He leaves an impressive record as testament to his service in the Senate, but his presence here will be missed. Though the outcome of last fall's election ended differently than I had hoped, I know great things are in store for Norm. He has much more to offer our great country. I wish Norm, his wife Laurie, and their two children, Jacob and Sarah, all the best as they embrace the new and exciting opportunities before them.
