NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National Bible Week 2004. During the week of November 21-28, communities and churches across the United States will participate in this annual celebration by reading and reflecting on the teachings of the Bible. In doing so, they recognize the Bible's importance in our daily lives. I am thankful for the opportunity to serve as Senate Co-Chairman of National Bible Week this year, and I commend the National Bible Association for its sponsorship of this yearly tradition.
The first National Bible Week, organized in 1941, was created as a way to extend comfort and hope to our nation during the tumultuous days of World War II. Today, our country is again in a time of difficulty. As our brave men and women of the Armed Forces continue to fight the War on Terror, I call on my fellow Americans to look to God's Word for its great inspiration, spiritual guidance, and strength. I pray that all Americans, particularly our soldiers and their loved ones, would receive "the peace of God, which transcends all understanding" (Philippians 4:7).
I believe Americans of all religions and faith backgrounds can find wisdom and understanding in the Holy Scriptures. Indeed, the Bible and its teachings have greatly influenced my own life. I encourage all Americans to read the Bible and consider the wisdom, lessons, and traditions that have come to us from it. I congratulate the National Bible Association for its dedication to the celebration of the Holy Bible.
