APOLOGIZING FOR THE ENSLAVEMENT AND RACIAL SEGREGATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS -- (Senate - June 18, 2009)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, first, I start with acknowledging a couple of individuals. First and foremost, the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, has orchestrated and navigated this matter to bring it forward. I think everybody owes a deep debt of gratitude to him and his staff for getting this done.
This is a significant day and a significant event. It doesn't happen without a lot of effort. It is going to be one of those days and places and times that goes down in history in this body. It is important. It is important to us. It is important to the Nation, and it is important that it be clearly acknowledged, and it is going to get done. I thank my colleague from Iowa for getting this organized and moving it forward. I also thank, obviously, the majority leader for setting this time up, the Republican leader, and our colleagues, particularly Senator Levin, who is a sponsor, and on our side, Senator Cochran, Senator Bond, and many others.
I ask unanimous consent at this time that Senator Corker be added as a cosponsor to the resolution.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Also, our staffs worked very hard on this. I have to thank LaRochelle Young on my staff, who has worked hard on this issue. She has been dedicated to get this through and forward. I thank her for her great work.
