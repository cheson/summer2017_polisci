AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 -- (Senate - February 06, 2009)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as I was mentioning, we had a hearing in the Joint Economic Committee this morning on Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers for this past month of January. They are not good, obviously. There are nearly 600,000 job losses taking place. What has happened up until about 3 months ago--the crisis was centered in housing, primarily, as everybody knows. Then it spread out to the rest of the economy. Then we have seen that spread out, make more impact, now getting to unemployment rates that have been rising substantially during those past 3 months.
Obviously, the economy is ailing. Everybody knows that. American families are suffering. But there are two things I want to bring out from this study that I think are a little bit different, and I hope my colleagues are watching these particular items.
There are two sectors in the economy that are still producing jobs. It is in health care, and it is in education. Obviously, we wish they were producing more jobs in those sectors, but the point of the matter they were making and saying is that these two sectors are doing well without stimulus. They are continuing to move on forward.
It would be my hope that as people move forward on this process in the stimulus bill, we would say: Let's target in and focus on the areas that are not creating jobs, that have lost a huge number of jobs, and target much more of our effort there rather than in areas such as health care and education that have continued to produce jobs.
