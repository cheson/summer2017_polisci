In accordance with Article 2, Section 14 of the Constitution of the State of Kansas, Governor Sam Brownback today vetoed Senate Bill 250, which concerns the Docking State Office Building.
"At my direction, the Department of Administration terminated this contract for the energy center on Feb. 19, 2016," said Governor Brownback. "Because that contract had already been canceled, the provisions of Senate Bill 250 are no longer necessary.
The Governor has now signed five bills into law this session and vetoed one. By law, the Kansas governor has 10 calendar days to sign the bill into law, veto the bill or allow the bill to become law without his or her signature.
