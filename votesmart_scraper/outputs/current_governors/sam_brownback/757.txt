Senators Roberts and Lincoln Lead Charge Against Ag Program Cuts in President's Budget
Bipartisan Group of Senators Urges Budget Committee Against Cuts and Reopening of Farm Bill
In preparation for the upcoming budget debate, U.S. Senators Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) today led a group of bipartisan Senators in sending a letter to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Ranking Member Judd Gregg (R-NH) strongly opposing the agriculture program cuts included in the President's budget proposal and additional efforts to reopen the 2008 Farm Bill.
"We have seen tremendous participation gains in the crop insurance program over the last 30 years. More producers are properly managing their risks to the benefit of producers, consumers and taxpayers," Senator Roberts said. "In a time of economic uncertainty, it doesn't make sense to put 30 years of risk protection progress in further jeopardy."
"The Farm Bill is a completely paid for, bipartisan product representing two years of negotiations and tremendous sacrifice on the part of production agriculture," Sen. Lincoln said. "That agreement is not even one year old as the Administration proposes reopening those portions that affect producers. I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues in Congress on a responsible budget that cuts the deficit without jeopardizing the safe and abundant supply of food that is taken for granted all too often."
