Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued the following Independence Day message:
"The birth of the United States was a watershed moment in human history. Our founding fathers created this nation based on liberty, light and hope. As Americans, it remains our duty to be a beacon of hope for liberty-loving peoples across the globe," said Governor Brownback.
"236 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, we sometimes take for granted the enormous challenges that lay ahead of our founding fathers those summer days in 1776. Every generation since has faced, and overcome its challenges through the strength and courage of the American people. Today too we face enormous challenges, but the hard work, dedication and patriotism will make our country even stronger for our future generations."
"God Bless America. Have a happy and safe Fourth of July"
