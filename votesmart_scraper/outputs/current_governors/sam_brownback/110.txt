In accordance with Executive Order 10-12, Governor Sam Brownback has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff from sun-up to sun-down on Friday, May 15 in honor of National Peace Officers Memorial Day.
"Law enforcement officers across Kansas put their lives at risk every day to protect us," said Governor Brownback. "They choose a career of service to others and all too often we fail to recognize and celebrate their courage and sacrifice. I encourage all Kansans, on this National Peace Officers Memorial Day, to honor the men and women who work to keep our communities safe."
National Peace Officers Memorial Day was established in 1961 to recognize local, state and federal law enforcement and peace officials.
