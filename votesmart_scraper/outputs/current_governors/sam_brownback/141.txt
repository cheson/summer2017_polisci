Governor Sam Brownback today issued a statement on education following the decision of a three-member panel from the Shawnee County District Court:
"I am still digesting the full implication of the district court's 116-page ruling. I continue to believe that restructuring the school funding formula and implementing education policy reforms is critical not only to getting more money into our classrooms but also improving student achievement. I will be working with legislative leadership to address the best path forward."
