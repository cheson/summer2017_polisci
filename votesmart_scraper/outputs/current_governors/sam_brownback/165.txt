Governor Sam Brownback and Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer, M.D., issued the following statements following today's Supreme Court decision in the Burwell v Hobby Lobby case.
Statement from Governor Sam Brownback:
"The Supreme Court today affirmed the right of religious freedom, one of the bedrock principles enshrined in our constitution. It again rebuked a needless overreach of President Obama's administration. Kansans understand that President Obama's Washington approach, with its one-size-fits-all philosophy, coupled with the President's repeated abuses of power, are not good for America and are terrible for Kansas.
"Importantly, the Court's decision was based on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act; in 2013, I was proud to sign the Kansas version of this act into law. The Kansas Preservation of Religious Freedom Act provides another level of religious freedom protection to Kansans."
Statement from Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer, M.D.:
"Today the Justices of the Supreme Court had a chance to protect religious freedoms and take a stand against the continued federal intrusion into our private beliefs. In ruling in favor of Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court stood strong for those beliefs."
