Letter
By: Sam Brownback Claire McCaskill Lindsey Graham Maria Cantwell Debbie Stabenow Michael Bennet Chris Dodd Patty Murray
Date: March 31, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Sam Brownback (R-KS) sent a bi-partisan letter to President Obama urging him to protect against further U.S. aerospace job and market losses following the World Trade Organization's (WTO) final ruling that Airbus has received illegal, trade-distorting subsidies. The Senators also called on the Administration to move forward with the competition to replace the American military's aerial refueling tankers.
"For decades, U.S. aerospace workers have had to compete against a company that has benefitted from illegal subsidies across virtually every one of its commercial airplanes," the Senators wrote. "The impact of these subsidies on the U.S. aerospace industry has been devastating."
On March 23rd, the WTO released its final ruling that Airbus has been the beneficiary of billions of dollars in illegal subsidies and that those subsidies had hurt American aerospace interests.
Murray and Brownback were joined on the letter by Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), and Michael Bennet (D-CO).
