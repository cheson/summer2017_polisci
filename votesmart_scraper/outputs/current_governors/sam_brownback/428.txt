Press Release
By: Sam Brownback
Date: May 27, 2011
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback has issued an executive order to temporarily allow doctors, nurses and other medical professionals licensed to practice in Missouri to provide medical services in Kansas.
"Sunday's tornado in Joplin not only severely damaged the St. John's Regional Medical Center but also many of the town's medical offices and treatment facilities, putting a strain on the remaining medical community and leaving many medical professionals with nowhere to treat their patients," Governor Brownback said. "Allowing Missouri medical professionals to work at Kansas facilities will ensure their patients continue to have access to all necessary and essential services."
Executive Order 11-10 only applies to those who maintain a current, valid license in good standing to practice medicine in the State of Missouri; who at the time of the emergency disaster practiced healing arts in Jasper County, Missouri; and, who desire and intend to provide medical services or surgery in Labette County, Kansas or Cherokee County, Kansas.
For those who meet the order's qualifications, the Governor also temporarily waives:
* Licensing and permit fees;
* Certain licensing and permitting requirements;
* Annual insurance premium surcharge on each health care provider in the State of Kansas.
All other applicable state and federal regulations shall remain in effect, including the requirement for each health care provider to maintain a current and valid policy of professional liability insurance.
