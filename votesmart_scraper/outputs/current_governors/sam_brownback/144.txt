Kansas Governor Sam Brownback today issued a proclamation declaring Nov. 23-29 as "A Week of Reconciliation."
"The holiday season is a wonderful opportunity for families and friends to come together, reconcile their differences, and celebrate timeless traditions together," said Governor Brownback. "It may be difficult to forgive those we believe have hurt us, but I encourage all Kansans to use this week of Thanksgiving to build a bridge of reconciliation."
The proclamation recognizes the nation faces many challenges and trials and reminds us that the foundation of American history is built on reconciliation in times of discord.
"I hope we take to heart the words of Bishop Desmond Tutu who reminds us that 'forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning'," the Governor said.
