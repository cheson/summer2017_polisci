Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback expressed his appreciation today for the European airplane manufacturer EADS' announcement that it would not challenge the Air Force's decision to award a $35 billion dollar tanker contract to Boeing.
"I appreciate the decision by EADS to accept the clear outcome of the Air Force's contract award. It was a very thorough, robust and open competition. Now, we can focus on executing this program and delivering new tankers to our American war fighters. Again, congratulations to the Boeing Wichita and Spirit AeroSystems team!" Governor Brownback said.
The KC-46A airframe will be designed for air-refueling operations, which significantly extends the range of Air Force operations. The current fleet of refueling tankers were commissioned in the 1950's and 1960's.
