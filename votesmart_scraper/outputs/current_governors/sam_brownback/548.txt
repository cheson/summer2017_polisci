Brownback: Health Care Legislation Bad for America
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on the U.S. House of Representatives' passage of a one trillion dollar health care overhaul bill.
"The U.S. House of Representatives has spoken, after the Majority Leadership used every questionable tactic possible," said Brownback. "Next to speak will be the American people when they cast their ballots in November. The bill needs to be repealed: it cuts Medicare, raises taxes and costs a trillion dollars that the government does not have."
To operate the new programs outlined in this legislation, in the first ten years Congress will need to approve $114 billion in additional annual spending; this discretionary spending is excluded from the Congressional Budget Office's report. The legislation also proposes to cut $463 billion from Medicare spending and use it to finance insurance subsidies. The federal deficit is projected to be at least $700 billion each year over the next 10 years, accelerating the national debt to more than $20 trillion.
Brownback continued, "I question the constitutionality of this bill as to whether the federal government has the right to mandate that individual Americans purchase health care insurance."
