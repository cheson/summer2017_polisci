Brownback Receives National Health Association Award
Tuesday, March 25, 2003
WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback has received the 2003 Community Health Super Hero Award from the National Association of Community Health Centers, Inc. Brownback was honored in recognition of his strong and consistent support for health centers and the patients they serve in communities across the country throughout the Second Session of the 107th Congress.
"It is important to remember that without rural communities, this country couldn't function; without rural health care, our rural communities won't function," Brownback said. "I am proud to have helped secure a victory on J-1 Visas last year, which assist in maintaining vital health care to rural communities.
"Over fifty (50) physicians currently practicing in the state of Kansas are in the state as a result of a J-1 visa waiver. Twenty (20) counties in the state of Kansas are considered fully served as a result of physicians who received J-1 Visa waivers. Thanks to the reauthorization and expansion of the J-1 Visa State '30' program, Kansas has already filed for 12 new waivers.
"If anyone doubts the importance of these waivers - one of the waivers is for a perinatologist, and another is a pediatric critical care specialist. These two doctors will literally be caring for the most vulnerable patients in the most remote areas of the country.
"But this doesn't mean we have solved all of the problems facing rural health. Perhaps the single most pressing issue facing rural communities is out migration. I am convinced that one of the single most important issues we need to address is rural health care.
"I appreciate this recognition and will continue to support community health interests," Brownback said.
