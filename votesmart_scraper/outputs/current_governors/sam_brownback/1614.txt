Brownback Lauds Family Tax Relief Bill Passage
Extends child tax credit, 10% tax bracket, marriage penalty and AMT relief
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage of the Family Tax Relief Act. The bill extends several previously passed tax cuts and adds technical corrections to the tax code.
"I am very pleased and was happy to vote for the Family Tax Relief bill. Over 520,000 Kansans will benefit from the extension of marriage penalty tax relief," Brownback stated. "Along with the extension of the $1,000 child tax credit, the 10-percent income tax bracket and increases in the AMT extension, we have passed a bill that will continue meaningful tax relief for all Kansans and will help keep your money in your pocket. I have always fought for more tax relief and hope that down the road we can make these extensions permanent."
