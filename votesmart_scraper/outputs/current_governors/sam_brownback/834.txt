STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS -- (Senate - September 23, 2008)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
By Mr. BROWNBACK:
S. 3546. A bill to establish the National Center for Strategic Communication to advise the President regarding public diplomacy and international broadcasting to promote democracy and human rights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, one might conclude from the last 7 years without a successful al Qaeda attack in America either that we have crippled our enemies or that the terrorist threat is overstated. Unfortunately, neither is true: violence is rising in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere, and the ideas behind this violence continue to proliferate from Europe to Asia and across the World Wide Web. But while we spend a great deal of time discussing tactics and troop deployments, we rarely analyze the broader ideological struggle.
Military force may sometimes be necessary in the war on terrorism, but force alone cannot defeat the threat posed by violent Islamist extremism. Recognizing this fact, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates worries about the
state of the ``war of ideas'' and rightly points out that it is ``plain embarrassing'' that al Qaeda communicates more effectively than we do.
The answer to this problem is not more money. We have spent billions since 9/11 on a wide array of public diplomacy initiatives, international broadcasts and information and exchange programs. Some succeeded, others failed, but none were developed in accordance with a national strategy overseen by an official who is accountable for making strategic communications work.
