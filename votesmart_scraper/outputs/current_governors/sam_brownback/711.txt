Brownback Comments on Supreme Court Nomination of Sonia Sotomayor
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court of the United States. Earlier today, President Obama nominated Sotomayor to be an associate justice.
"While I celebrate Sonia Sotomayor's life story, I am troubled by some of her statements," said Brownback. "Now that the president has nominated her, it's up to the Senate. She deserves a fair and respectful hearing. I look forward to a thorough process and to hearing more from her. I do have serious questions about her record and her judicial philosophy regarding how she views the role of the Court. In my view, the role of a justice is as an umpire, not a policy maker."
Sotomayor is currently a judge on the 2nd Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Brownback voted against her nomination to that position.
