WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today made the following statement at a news conference with PBS' "Wide Angle" series, which addresses the human catastrophe known as human trafficking.
"Tomorrow evening, PBS' WIDE ANGLE will air the film Dying to Leave, a film about illicit migration and human trafficking. I would like to thank PBS and executive producer, Stephen Segaller, for their investment in raising public awareness of this scourge. This film deftly captures the context and contours of modern day slavery through the tragic stories of individuals from Iraq, Moldova, China, Mexico and Colombia.
"At the end of the 19th Century, the last major stronghold of human slavery was abolished. Many mistakenly believe that we have long since moved beyond this abominable episode in our history. Quite the opposite is true. As stated in the film itself, the fact of human migration is as old as humanity itself - so is the history of forcibly transferred people.
