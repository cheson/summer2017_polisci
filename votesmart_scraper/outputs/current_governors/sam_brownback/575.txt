Press Release

Location: Washington, DC

Month-long observance intended to enhance fight against human trafficking
The U.S. Senate has unanimously approved a resolution by Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Ben Cardin (D-MD) to observe "National Slavery and Trafficking Prevention Month," from January 1 to February 1.
S. RES. 382 is intended to raise awareness about human trafficking - a form of modern-day slavery. This Resolution recognizes the month of January as significant for modern slavery and human trafficking. January 1st is the anniversary of the effective date of the Emancipation Proclamation and February 1st is the anniversary of the date that President Abraham Lincoln signed the joint resolution sending the 13th Amendment to the States for ratification.
In addition, it recognizes that January 11th is a day that many have chosen to commemorate human trafficking. In the 110th Congress, Senator Feinstein sponsored a Concurrent Resolution that passed the Senate supporting January 11th as a "National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness."
Human trafficking is a pervasive global crime, with nearly 1 million people trafficked across international borders every year - roughly 80 percent of them are women and children -- according to the U.S. State Department.
Victims are forced to work in sweatshops, prostitution rings, farm labor, private homes and other enterprises. Traffickers use many techniques to keep their victims enslaved - including fear, isolation and threats of violence, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
