Brownback Comments on FTC Report Studying Food Marketing Tactics
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the release of a Federal Trade Commission report which studied the marketing of food and beverages to young people.
"I commend the Federal Trade Commission's analysis and hard work," said Brownback. "I am particularly pleased with the recommendations for companies to seek ways to self-regulate their industry regarding media directed at children. Specifically, I was pleased with the FTC's recommendation that the media industry should work with the Children's Food and Beverage Initiative, undertaken by the Council of Better Business Bureaus, in order to provide a healthier media landscape for children."
Concerned about the dramatic increase in childhood obesity, Congress in 2006 requested that the Federal Trade Commission conduct a study of food and beverage marketing to children and adolescents. The study analyzed 2006 expenditures and activities of 44 companies and took into account various types of media, including television, radio and the Internet. The FTC found that of the 44 reporting companies studied, approximately $1.6 billion was spent to promote food and beverages to children and adolescents. Approximately $870 million was spent on food marketing directed to children under the age of 12.
Brownback continued, "The time is now to act responsibly for the health of our nation's children. We all know that being overweight can lead to long term health problems, including an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes. Our children deserve better."
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 36% of people under 19 years old are overweight.
