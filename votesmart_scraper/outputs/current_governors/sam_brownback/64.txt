Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement in response to the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia:
"Justice Scalia was a great and faithful American who upheld the Constitution and brought true meaning to judicial restraint. He loved this nation and the Constitution's promise of a republic built on the rule of law. My thoughts and prayers are with Justice Scalia's family as we all mourn his loss.
"First appointed to the Supreme Court by President Reagan in 1986, Justice Scalia dedicated his life to public service. America benefited from his unparalleled intellect, sharp writing and unfailing defense of the Constitution."
