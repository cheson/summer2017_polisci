U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today introduced the General Aviation Depreciation bill, which would provide special depreciation allowance and recovery period for general aviation aircraft. The legislation is designed to boost sales of general aviation aircraft and encourage job growth in the industry.
"I am pleased to introduce common sense, pro-growth legislation which has a proven track record of spurring the purchase of general aviation aircraft and putting people in the industry back to work," said Brownback. "General aviation is a key industry in Kansas, and across the country, that has been heavily impacted by the economic downturn. My colleagues in Washington should focus on enacting legislation that will put fuel in the tank for economic growth and help general aviation, a key industry and source of highly skilled jobs, to soar again."
In the economic downturn, general aviation sales have significantly declined; as a result, thousands of general aviation workers have been laid off over the past year. In the Wichita area alone, 13,000 aviation-related jobs have been lost. Nationally, general aviation companies have laid off 19,000 workers. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, for every one general aviation worker on the production line, three jobs outside the immediate company are created, in manufacturing, engineering, supply, or support.
