CNN LARRY KING LIVE - Transcript
LARRY KING, CNN HOST: Tonight, North Korea's threat just how dangerous is it? The rogue nation has defied the world with seven missile tests. The president has spoken. The United Nations has weighed in. Now what?
We'll ask former secretary of state under President Clinton Madeleine Albright; Ambassador Wendy Sherman, special advisor on North Korea to President Clinton and Secretary Albright; representative Curt Weldon, he's led delegations to North Korea; Senator Sam Brownback, author of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004; and lots more.
And it's all next on LARRY KING LIVE.
Good evening. We'll have a panel with us throughout. They include Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state. She joins us from Aspen, Colorado. She's the first secretary of state, by the way, to visit North Korea there in October, 2000 where she met with Kim Jong-il.
Back for a second night is Ambassador Wendy Sherman, the former special advisor on North Korea at the State Department in the Clinton administration.
In Topeka, Kansas, the aforementioned Senator Sam Brownback.
In Philadelphia, Congressman Curt Weldon, who has led two bipartisan congressional delegations to North Korea.
And, here in Washington, John King, CNN's Chief National Correspondent and former White House Correspondent and Ed Henry CNN's current White House correspondent. They'll be with us all the way.
