Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement as the Senate discussed a possible override of his veto on House Substitute for Senate Bill 161 concerning STAR bonds.
"As I said in my veto message, no county should be singled out in the manner contained in the budget proviso. I am hereby informing the Legislature that the Department of Commerce will not approve any new STAR Bond projects in any other county. This policy would apply to any project not yet approved by the Department of Commerce, and is within my authority under Article 1, Section 3 of the state Constitution.
"I note that the vetoed provision would effectively be repealed by the enactment of other legislation containing certain STAR Bond reforms. My administration has been working with the Legislature on those reforms and will continue to do so. I look forward to receiving acceptable legislation before the end of the session. In my view, this approach to reform is much preferred over that taken in the budget."
