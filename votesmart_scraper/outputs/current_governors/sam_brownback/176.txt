Kansas Governor Sam Brownback on Wednesday signed 22 bills bringing the total number of bills signed into law to 140. Two bills have been vetoed and one passed into law without signature.
"I appreciate the work of the legislature and Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission in reviewing and updating the laws applicable to the electoral and governmental processes," said Governor Brownback. "Nevertheless, I believe that retaining the lobbyist and candidate reporting and disclosure requirements in current law serves to promote transparency and openness. I am supportive of the provisions of this bill that would permit unused campaign funds to be donated to charitable organizations. I invite the Legislature to send me a new piece of legislation that contains these provisions."
