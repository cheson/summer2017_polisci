Brownback Pleased with Strong Showing in Ames
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, Republican candidate for president, today spoke to supporters at the conclusion of the Ames Straw Poll.
"Today we leave Ames with a ticket to the Iowa caucuses," said Brownback. "Given that we were outspent by more than 10 to 1 and faced a multi-million dollar advertising blitz, we built a great foundation as we head into the caucuses."
Senator Brownback came in third, with 2,192 votes, and spent approximately $325,000 on the Straw Poll.
