Date: Sept. 6, 2013
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback today thanked thirty-six employees who have served the State of Kansas forty years, including two individuals with fifty years of service. During a ceremony held in the Capitol, the state's chief executive lauded the group for their collective accomplishments and emphasized that their service was more about contribution than passing time.
"While it is noteworthy in today's changing work environment that you have been able to keep a job this long, your true accomplishments are measured by the goals you have achieved, the positive impact you have had on your co-workers and the friends you have made," said Brownback. "The State of Kansas and the people of Kansas have benefitted from your dedication and commitment, and for that we are grateful."
Brownback and Secretary of Administration Jim Clark recognized the long-serving employees individually, with Brownback presenting a service medal to each of the honorees. The event comes a week after a reception Brownback hosted at Cedar Crest, where he recognized "Employees of the Quarter." Brownback has emphasized the importance of showing appreciation for State employees and their service to the state and communities.
