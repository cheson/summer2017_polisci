Brownback Votes for Committee Passage of FAA Reauthorization Act
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today voted in favor of Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee passage of the Federal Aviation Administration Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act. The bill extends the FAA's authorization and program authority for the next two years.
"The aviation industry remains one of the most important economic sectors in my home state of Kansas," said Brownback. "Passage of this bipartisan legislation will give aviation companies the necessary funding and regulatory certainty to move forward with a number of important initiatives."
The FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act includes provisions to maintain inspection procedures at foreign repair stations formulated through agreements between the United States and the European Union; increases funding for the Essential Air Service Program; expands passenger rights; and provides increased federal support for small airports.
Brownback continued, "Most importantly, the legislation does not include language imposing onerous user fees on the general aviation industry. General aviation is critical to the Kansas economy, so it is essential that any charges imposed on general aviation carriers are proportionate to their use of the National Aerospace System."
Brownback is a member of the Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security Subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
