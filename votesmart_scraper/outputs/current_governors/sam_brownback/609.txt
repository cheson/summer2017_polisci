Brownback Comments on Threat by European Bidder to Drop Out of Tanker Competition Before it Begins

U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on reports that Northrup Grumman and Airbus have threatened to drop out of the refueling tanker competition unless the Air Force revises the requirements to favor the European bid.
"Airbus should not expect to win a competition before it starts," stated Brownback. "They have tried this before, but they cannot expect to surrender every time and still win. Potential bidders should not dictate terms to the Air Force, and the Air Force should not worry about whether a potential bidder will submit a proposal."
Last year, the Government Accountability Office gave a vote of no-confidence in an Air Force decision to award the tanker contract to Airbus. The competition was restarted in September with Boeing and Airbus/EADS, along with their partner Northrup Grumman, competing for the contract.
Brownback continued, "The Air Force should stick to the usual comment process and then issue a final solicitation. It should not set the draft RFP process aside to accommodate the demands of a competitor. Under no circumstances should Airbus receive special privileges for attempting to win concessions outside of the established contract process. If anything, they should be penalized for offering an aircraft illegally subsidized by foreign countries to win a U.S. defense contract."
The Air Force will purchase 179 refueling tankers beginning in 2011 to replace the aging fleet. They are seeking to replace more than 500 Eisenhower-era KC-135s. In September, the WTO issued an interim ruling that the EU has illegally subsidized the development of numerous Airbus aircraft including the model Northrop Grumman offered during the last tanker competition.
