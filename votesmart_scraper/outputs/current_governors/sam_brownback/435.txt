Kansas Governor Sam Brownback said today he is pleased with the accomplishments his administration achieved during its first legislative session.
"We began the 2011 Legislative Session facing two main issues, a budget shortfall of more than $500 million and more than 100,000 Kansans out of work," Governor Brownback said. "We got right to work on balancing the state budget and in conjunction with the Kansas Legislature, took the more than $500 million deficit and turned it into a $50 million ending balance that prioritizes the core functions of government".
Brownback continued, "We also were able to get several legislative initiatives passed that set the stage for a return to private sector job growth -- workers' comp reform, 100% business expensing and the Rural Opportunity Zones. These initiatives will improve the environment for businesses of all sizes in Kansas and get unemployed Kansans back to work."
The Governor congratulated state lawmakers for their hard work on behalf of our state.
"They got their work done on time and under budget," Brownback said.
Other legislative accomplishments this session include six executive reorganization orders designed to restructure state government set to become law on July 1, 2011 to increase efficiency and cut overhead costs as well as the establishment of the Office of the Repealer to review and abolish burdensome regulations.
