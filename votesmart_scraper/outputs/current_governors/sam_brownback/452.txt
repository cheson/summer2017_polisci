Governor Balances Budget
Press Release

Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback announced today he will solve the state's current fiscal crisis by transferring $56.5 million dollars to balance the FY 2011 State General Fund budget to zero.
The transfer covers $49.3 million for the November 2010 estimated increase in human and health services caseload and $7.2 million for the difference between the November 2010 revenue estimate and the FY 2011 Approved Budget.
"The rescission bill I proposed offered us the opportunity to solve three budget problems at once. Now we will solve them one at a time," Gov. Brownback said. "I look forward to working with the Kansas Legislature to building a FY 2012 budget that gets our state back on the road of fiscal responsibility and stability."
Brownback continued, "There are more than 110,000 Kansans looking for a job right now. Our focus must be to grow the state's economy and get those folks back to work. We do that and we'll have additional funding for everyone's budget priorities."
