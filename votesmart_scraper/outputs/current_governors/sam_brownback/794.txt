BROWNBACK VOTES AGAINST COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF APPROPRIATIONS PORTION OF STIMULUS PACKAGE
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today voted against committee passage of the appropriations portion of the stimulus package.
"I voted against Appropriations Committee passage of the stimulus plan because I don't believe that we can spend our way to prosperity," said Brownback. "There's no doubt our economy needs a stimulus, but more government spending is not the right answer. We should be cutting taxes and we should give back to taxpayers more of their money."
As of right now, the stimulus plan will cost about $825 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee today marked up the appropriations portion of the Senate version of the stimulus plan. The appropriations portion accounts for about $365 billion in discretionary spending and $186 billion in mandatory spending. The Senate Finance Committee today marked up the tax portion of the plan. The tax portion and the appropriations portion will later be joined together.
Brownback continued, "Furthermore, it concerns me that the Senate has not held any hearings on how best to spend the taxpayers' money. Spending hundreds of billions of dollars without careful consideration will only lead to inefficient and wasteful spending. The Appropriations Committee took just two hours and fifteen minutes to consider a $365 billion spending bill, which means the committee spent more than $2.6 billion per minute."
