Brownback Comments on GAO Report on Air Force Tanker Contract
Urges Air Force to take immediate action
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on the report today released by the Government Accountability Office which gave a vote of no-confidence in the Air Force decision to award a tanker contract to Airbus/EADS. Boeing had competed with Airbus/Eads for the contract.
"I strongly urge the Air Force to take immediate action to correct the deficiencies associated with this procurement," said Brownback. "The Air Force should not require 60 days to review the GAO statement."
In its report, the GAO sustained nearly every major argument Boeing made against the Air Force award. The Air Force did not follow its own criteria in evaluating the two proposals and failed to give Boeing credit for meeting a number of key requirements. The Air Force also unfairly rewarded Northrop Grumman for producing a plane far bigger than the stated requirements. In addition, the Air Force did not reasonably calculate the military construction, life cycle and engineering costs associated with these proposals.
Brownback continued, "This contract should be overturned and awarded to Boeing. The GAO is not allowed to consider a number of other issues important in this procurement, including foreign subsidies, corruption, and domestic production and employment. These problems when combined with what the GAO found strongly suggest the Boeing 767 is the right tanker for our Armed Forces."
