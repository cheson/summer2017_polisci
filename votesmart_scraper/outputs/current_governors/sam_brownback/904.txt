Brownback Comments on Aftermath of Kansas Tornado
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback expressed his condolences for those affected by the tornado that last night hit several Kansas towns.
"My thoughts and prayers are with the people and communities that have been devastated by this tornado," said Brownback. "I hope the federal government moves quickly to declare a disaster and help the citizens of Kansas with recovery efforts. Over the past few years, Kansas has suffered more than its share of deadly weather, but Kansans are resilient and they will come back from this disaster stronger than ever."
According to weather reports, one tornado last night traveled from Salina to Manhattan, touching ground several times. Chapman, Kansas, a town of 1,400, was directly hit by a tornado. One person has been reported dead in Chapman, and 85% of the buildings and homes in the town sustained damage. One person has been reported dead in Solider, Kansas.
Several buildings on the northern part of Kansas State University's campus sustained damage. The Wind Erosion Laboratory, a federal facility, was destroyed.
Brownback continued, "My office and I have already been in contact with FEMA and state officials. I am hopeful that there will soon be a federal disaster declaration. Senator Pat Roberts and I are hopeful we can travel to Kansas to survey first-hand the storm damage to see the degree of federal aid residents will need."
