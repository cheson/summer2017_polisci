BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
SEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R-KS): Thank you.
I was at the ceremony as well, and it was quite moving to have two Nobel Peace Laureates in the same room and on the Capitol. It was quite a day.
Judge Mukasey, I want to go to a couple of topics, and the first one I want to go is I think the lead issue you're going to be wrestling with as attorney general -- presuming you're confirmed, and I believe you will be confirmed. I want to congratulate you in the hopes that that will take place. But I want to look at this particular area of the interaction between intelligence gathering and civil liberties in the United States, and that's the issue that this committee has been wrestling with some time about, and you've gotten different snippets and bytes of it.
And you have been a trial court judge on two of the lead cases and really looking in this -- looking at this area, and I think that's why you've been selected for this job -- is to help us sort through this junction -- this juncture of our need to gather intelligence as a country to protect our society and to protect ourselves, to provide for the common defense, which is the first role of the federal government, and our need and desire and requirement that we protect the civil liberties of the people of the United States.
