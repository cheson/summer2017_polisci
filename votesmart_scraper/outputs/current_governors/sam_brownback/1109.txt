Brownback Campaign Applauds Michigan GOP for Rejecting Rule Changes
The Brownback for President campaign today applauded the Policy Committee of the Michigan Republican State Committee for rejecting proposed rule changes that were advocated by supporters of the Romney campaign and the party chairman, Saul Anuzis. "The Michigan Republican Party did the right thing by rejecting proposed rule changes that would have unfairly benefited certain presidential campaigns at the expense of others," said Rob Wasinger, national campaign manager of Brownback for President. "It would have been wrong to change the rules in the midst of the campaign season."
