WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback (R-KS) today made the following statement at a news conference with cancer society leaders, addressing the proposed cuts in cancer care in the Medicare reform bill.
"The cancer cuts we've been hearing about from the conference are neither politically smart, nor are they sound policy," Brownback said. "I know of fifty-three Senators who've said as much in a letter to the conferees.
"The cuts proposed in the Medicare conference will severely weaken the financial health of community cancer centers. Private health insurers are almost certain to reduce their reimbursement rates to coincide with reductions in Medicare reimbursement. This lethal combination of cuts will likely force banks and other financial institutions to reduce their opinion of the credit worthiness of cancer providers. Such a change would make it harder for providers to obtain the financing they require to buy the drugs and technologies their patients need.
