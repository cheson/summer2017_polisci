U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement regarding the devastation caused by the tsunami in Southern Asia.
"This is a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of the hundreds of thousands who perished. We also offer our ready assistance to the governments of the stricken countries. The United States can, will and must do more to assist these nations in their recovery.
"The U.S. should send a high-level delegation to assess the damage and return to advocate for financial aid. As a member of the Senate, I have offered to travel to the region as a part of that delegation. The United States most certainly will step up to assist in the recovery efforts. We will respond to the calls for help from our brothers and sisters in Southern Asia, and our prayers are with them."
