Governor Sam Brownback today issued a statement in honor of Veterans Day.
"Veterans Day is the day we set aside solely to honor the men and women who served our nation with dignity, honor and courage.
"America's veterans have served in all corners of the world. The debt we owe them is one that can never be fully paid. Their sacrifices ensured the freedom and safety we enjoy and often take for granted.
"I ask you to take a moment to remember those who have fought for this nation and its commitment to preserving liberty and freedom for all.
"On this Veterans Day I encourage all Kansans to fly the flag proudly today. It is a visible testament and show of appreciation to those who have served, who serve today and who will serve in the future.
"To every veteran -- those who have served and those who are serving today -- on behalf of the people of Kansas, I thank you.
"God bless our vets and God America."
