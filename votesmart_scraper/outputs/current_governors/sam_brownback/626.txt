Facility will provide high quality health care for soldiers, veterans
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback applauded today's groundbreaking for the new hospital to be built at Fort Riley, Kansas.
"This new medical facility will improve the quality of life for soldiers, military families, and retirees," said Brownback. "My colleagues and I on the Appropriations Committee worked hard to ensure that the new Fort Riley hospital received the necessary funding, and I'm glad to see this important project get underway. We owe our soldiers and military families the best medical attention, and this hospital will help us provide superior care for decades to come. Fort Riley has undergone some major changes in the last few years, and is emerging as one of the Army's best places to live, work, and train."
The new hospital is being built to replace the current 50 year old hospital which is not equipped to handle the growing Fort Riley community. When construction of the new hospital is completed in the spring of 2012, the facility will support a population of 35,000 people. Funding for the project was provided in the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations bill.
Brownback sits on the Appropriations Committee, and is a member of the Military Construction Subcommittee.
