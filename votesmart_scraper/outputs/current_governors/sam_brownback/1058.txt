Fixing the Tax Code
The Optional Flat Tax

People often laugh when I say on the campaign trail that the tax code should be taken behind the barn and killed with a dull axe. In fact, one man in Iowa was so excited by this proposal that he presented me with an axe before I finished my remarks (fittingly, I was speaking in a barn).
There's a reason people welcome my proposal to kill the tax code  it's a monster of inscrutable complexity, and I say that as a former lawyer who took every tax law class I could.
Today's tax code  which is sixteen times longer than the Bible  is unpredictable, manipulative and hinders the economic growth that generates more prosperity for all Americans.
Past efforts at fundamental tax reform have hit a brick wall of political and institutional opposition. When you attack the tax code head  on, you're taking on every lobbyist in Washington. Everyone agrees that we need tax reform, but every industry and interest group has its hard  won and coveted part of the code.
