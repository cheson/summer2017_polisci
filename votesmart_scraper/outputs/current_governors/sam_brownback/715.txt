BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about amendment No. 1144, the Protecting America's Communities Act, which I am offering to H.R. 2346, the supplemental appropriation bill.
Before I begin my comments, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Coburn as an original cosponsor of S. 1071, which is a collateral stand-alone bill, as well as a cosponsor to amendment No. 1144.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this amendment amends immigration law to prohibit any detainee held at Guantanamo Bay Naval Facility from being transferred or released into the United States. It is a little bit different from the vote we are going to be taking at 11:30.
There are over 240 terrorists in U.S. custody at the military detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Let me just describe some of the individuals who reside at Guantanamo. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed--or KSM--is the self-proclaimed, and quite unapologetic, mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. KSM admitted he was the planner of 9/11 and other planned, but foiled attacks against the U.S. In his combatant status review board, he admitted he swore allegiance to Osama bin Ladin, was a member of al-Qaida, was the military operational commander for all foreign al-Qaida operations, and much more. KSM and four other detainees, who are charged with conspiring to commit the terrible 9/11 attacks, remain at Guantanamo.
