Brownback Mother's Day resolution passes
Senate honors mothers and Mother's Day
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded passage of his resolution honoring mothers and Mother's Day.
Brownback authored the resolution which was cosponsored by 24 Senators and passed the Senate last night by unanimous consent.
"Mothers play a unique and wonderful role in our society. Our mothers have a tough and rewarding job raising families and teaching our children; they are the bedrock of our society and our culture. I owe a great deal to my mother, and this resolution is a small sign of gratitude to her and all mothers for the wonderful work they do."
