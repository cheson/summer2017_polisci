Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: May 9, 2012
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback released the following statement this afternoon regarding the Kansas House of Representative's vote to concur with Senate Sub. For House Bill 2117:
"As with all bills approved by the Kansas Legislature, I will carefully review and consider HB 2117. It would create tens of thousands of new jobs, and combined with spending restraint, will help to reverse a lost decade of declining employment.
"I am prepared to sign the bill but I encourage Kansas Legislators to continue their work on reforming our state's tax policy and to consider some of the alternatives I proposed in my original pro-growth tax reform to off-set the cost.
"It is important to recognize that the debate in Kansas has changed from how we grow state government to about how we grow the state's economy. After a decade of lost jobs and people, Kansas is now on the path of economic growth and job creation."
