SEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R-KS): The hearing will come to order. We're going to have a fun hearing today on a great topic: hydrogen fueled automobiles and other vehicles and other uses of hydrogen fuel. I'd like to begin the hearing of Science, Space and Technology Subcommittee by thanking each of our witnesses. I appreciate you coming today. I want to thank you on behalf of the committee for joining us here today and sharing your testimony. Secondly, I want to thank you on behalf of my kids for your leadership in advancing the practical applications of hydrogen fuel cell research. This is an incredibly important issue for the future and it certainly has a lot of excitement and interest for now and for the next generation.
Perhaps a critical duty for any leader, whether you're a CEO, secretary of State, a principal of a high school, is to advance a vision of what we want our country and the world to look like. As did countless generations before we were born, we are charged to leave our children's life better than that which we inherited. I'd also urgeÂ—I'd also argue that this notion of the world we would like to leave our children is a vision that unites us. While we often disagree about how to get there, we just as often agree about where we would like to be heading towards.
