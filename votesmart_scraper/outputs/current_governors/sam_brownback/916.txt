Brownback Questions Air Force Tanker Decision Data
Air Force did not take into account cost of base upgrades for larger aircraft footprint
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today at a hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies questioned Air Force, Air Guard and Air Reserve officials about the tanker contract deal awarded to the European consortium led by Airbus.
"I find it hard to believe that the Air Force can accurately compare the costs of the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 767 without a formal study of related construction costs," said Brownback. "It concerns me that the Air Force glossed over a major factor driving up the price of new tankers."
Brownback was reacting to comments from Air Force officials regarding the construction costs associated with replacing the KC-135 aerial refueling tanker.
Brownback continued, "We know that bigger tankers require bigger hangers, longer runways and upgraded ramps and taxiways, but the Air Force apparently does not know the cost of reconfiguring our bases and airfields. This is unacceptable. The Government Accountability Office will have to decide whether the Air Force's source selection team made the right decision based on the data they had available. However, I am concerned that the procurement officials did not have the necessary data to begin with."
In February, the Air Force selected the Airbus A330 to replace its existing fleet of KC-135 tankers over the Boeing 767. Though both planes are bigger than the KC-135, the A330 has a 53% larger footprint than the 767. Boeing protested the Air Force contract award and expects a ruling from the Government Accountability Office in June.
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
