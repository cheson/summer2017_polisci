WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback tonight voted against the Highway Trust Fund bill, S.1072, which authorizes transportation projects over the next six years. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 76 to 21.
"This bill, as currently written, will increase the federal deficit by over $40 billion," Brownback stated. "At a time of record high deficits, we cannot do this to our children. It is true that the federal government certainly has a role to play in transportation infrastructure, but a highway bill is no excuse for excessive spending. Furthermore, I do not support taking money from the general fund to pay for this bill. A highway bill should be paid for by existing gas taxes, not general revenue funds."
"I support spending for highway programs, but this increases highway funding by 45% compared to the previous bill. That's too much. I hope we can get a highway bill I can support coming out of the Conference Committee with the House."
