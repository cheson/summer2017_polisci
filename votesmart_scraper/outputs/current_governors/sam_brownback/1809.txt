WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback lauded Senate passage late last night of the Jobs and Economic Growth Bill (S. 1054).
"This is a much-needed measure, which will create jobs and further strengthen the economy," Brownback said. "This economic stimulus package will have an immediate impact on the economy."
"The federal government has overtaxed Kansans for too long. By accelerating measures of the 2001 tax relief legislation, increasing the child credit, and providing marriage penalty relief, we will make positive strides to ease the tax burden on hard-working families. The bill also abolishes the double taxation of dividends, creating jobs for Kansas workers.
"By providing short and long-term economic growth, all Americans will benefit. The legislation increases the value of the market, creating new businesses and jobs, increasing take-home pay, and increasing savings and investment. This stimulus package is timely and will provide a needed boost to our economy," Brownback said.
