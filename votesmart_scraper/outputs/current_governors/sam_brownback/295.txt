Kansas Governor Sam Brownback announced today that the state ended Fiscal Year 2012 with a little more than a $466 million ending balance.
"Working with the Kansas Legislature, we have focused on fiscal responsibility and restraint in my first years of office," Gov. Brownback said. "We eliminated open positions and offered a voluntary employee buyout. We restructured and streamlined state agencies to make them more efficient and more responsive to their customers. We reformed KPERS and Medicaid, two of the state's largest fiscal responsibilities and worked to eliminate waste, fraud and other inefficiencies."
Brownback continued, "And during this time of fiscal restraint and responsibility; the state increased its spending on core responsibilities: K-12 schools, higher education, and Medicaid."
Brownback said the state has come a long way in getting its financial house in order. The state's ending balances during the last five years are:
FY 2009 $49.6 million
FY 2010: $876.05
FY 2011: $188.0 million
FY 2012: $466.3 million
FY 2013: $470.0 million
The governor recalled the state of the state's finances when he and Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer, M.D. first took office in January of 2011.
