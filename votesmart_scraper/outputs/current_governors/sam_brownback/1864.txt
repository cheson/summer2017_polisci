Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space Holds Hearing Aerospace Industry Research and Development
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Feb. 27, 2003
Location: Washington, DC

BROWNBACK:
Call the hearing to order. Thank you all for joining us here today on an opening hearing about U.S. involvement in the aerospace research area. We anticipate holding several hearings on this. And there could be some other members joining us throughout the hearing time. I'm pleased that those of you here could join us today.
One hundred years ago, a great journey with unlimited promise began in this country. And it was the journey of powered flight. Through this journey, America has led the world in amazing technological advances in the development of innovative products and services.
As we celebrate the great successes of the past 100 years, let us reflect on where we have been and turn to where we need to go. On December 17, 1903, the Wright Brothers made history with a 12-second flight over the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.
Since then, flight has gone through the plains of Kansas and out across America. In the 1920s and early '30s, some of the original aviation entrepreneursClyde Cessna, Walter H. Beech, Lloyd Stearmanformed the companies that continue to be the leaders in general aviation today.
The industry continued to soar over the plains with the addition of the Boeing Company through its purchase of Stearman Aircraft in 1929 in a major expansion of a Kansas presence during World War II. This journey encompassed the continued development of U.S. military, commercial and general aviation industries throughout the '30s, '40s and '50s that set the standard for the world.
The journey of flight continued as Americans continued to push the envelope. In 1947, Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier and established a leadership role in the infancy of the jet aircraft age that has propelled us to the next step that leads us to the stars with the establishment of NASA in 1958. And the journey continued, eventually taking us to the moon in the triumph of July 20th, 1969, with Neil Armstrong's steps on the surface of the moon.
These wonders of space flight continued through the space shuttle, its first flight in 1981, and our current involvement with the International Space Station. And while NASA has suffered a recent tragedy with the Columbia Shuttle accident, we will continue to be the leader in aeronautics and astronauts. We must not back down.
U.S. commercial and general aviation manufacturers have made the world open for business with unlimited opportunities for travel and commerce. This tells only a fraction of the wonderful success story of the U.S. aerospace industry and the significant role it plays in our leadership security posture, the strength of our economy and our leadership role in the world.
The current downturn in the U.S. aircraft industryand I've certainly felt it and my state has felt it with some 11,000 jobs lost in my state aloneand the increasingly competitive challenges we face in the global marketplace only elevates the importance of today's subject matter of aerospace research. Aerospace is a technology- driven industry. And U.S. leadership in the aerospace industry is a direct result in our preeminence in research and innovation.
Government policies and investments in long-term research are vital to the maintenance of the United States aerospace leadership. The relationship between industry, government and academia is crucial to the production of new products and services.
With a renewed focus and bold commitment by the government, industry and academia, we can help propel this industry to even greater heights during the next 100 years of this incredible journey. A new era of innovation lies ahead. The U.S. must continue to blaze the trail in the areas of developing advanced materials and propulsion systems for commercial and general aviation, new and innovative air traffic management systems that utilize network-centric systems of satellites and ground-based stations, as well as a new generation of space vehicles and propulsion.
I want to welcome our witnesses here today. And I'm excited to hear what they have to say.
Senator Chris Dodd has a proposal that he wants to put forward and will speak first. And we'll have Bob Walker and Ed Bolen who will share with us their thoughts from the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry. Dr. Creedon will enlighten us on the position of the administration.
And I'm also pleased to welcome Dennis Dietz and Bob Tomblin, here from my state of Kansas. Mr. Dietz will comment on the perspective of industry. And Mr. Tomblin will highlight the successful involvement of academia in the process.
I look forward to their input. And I look forward to this leading us towards legislative and some, hopefully, research solutions as to what we should be doing to keep the United States' leadership in this aerospace industry.
I thank my colleague from Virginia for joining us today. And I will turn the microphone to him for an opening statement.
Senator Allen?
BROWNBACK:
Thank you very much, Chris. And I appreciate your thoughts and your comments. And I would say, "Amen" to yours as well because I really think that is where we are.
And it might say, where we have so many of these manufacturing jobs in the aviation sector, these are the highest wage, highest skilled manufacturing jobs in the world. And so it's obvious why others would want them. And it's also obvious why we should do everything we can to protect them.
And I appreciate your last comment about basic research. We're going to hold some hearings with the head of NSF and other groups. And I've asked her about what's her real focus and interest. And she talked about nanotechnology and a number of areas.
But she said, you know, really we need to put money into physics, mathematics. And she was really digging at that same point as well, that there is a feeling like you're just not planting the seed corn that you need to in those areas.
We've moved forward in a lot of nice areas very strongly. NIH is doubling their budget over the last five years, great investment, producing great results. Human genome project, beautiful technology, beautiful information. Almost weekly, you're seeing something we've found the gene for this or for that.
I wonder how many of those bad genes I have. But I haven't asked yet. I don't know if I want to know.
But it's really going to help us a lot in the future. But I don't know that we have invested in the same sense in those basic physics, mathematics that we need to. So I appreciate your comments backing those up as well.
DODD:
Thank you both.
BROWNBACK:
Thank you very much for joining us.
The first panel we'll have up: the Honorable Robert S. Walker, Chairman, Wexler and Walker Public Policy Associates here in Washington, D.C. Bob Walker is former Congressman Bob Walker, who was chairman of the Science Committee in the House side for a number of years, a long-time advocate of research and specific research agendas to be able to help and build the strength and might of the United States; and also Dr. Jeremiah Creedon, associate administrator, Office of Aerospace Technology of NASA, here in Washington, D.C.
Gentlemen, thank you very much both for joining us. Your full statements will be put into the record, if you want to summarize. It's your choice. We're delighted you are here.
Mr. Walker, Congressman Walker, delighted to have you here.
BROWNBACK:
Thank you very much, Congressman Walker. Appreciate that very thoughtful and stimulating and poetic statement.
Dr. Creedon, delighted to have you here in the committee. And don't pay attention here to the clock. I guess we'll try to stymie that. Take whatever time you need to testify.
BROWNBACK:
Thank you very much, Dr. Creedon. Appreciate that.
Let's run the clock at seven minutes. And we can bounce back and forth here, if we have a series of questions. But I want to ask a few here.
Dr. Creedon, to start off, one of the things that really drew me to this hearing today was in December, I met with the leaders of the general aviation industry in Wichita. And as you know, a number of companies are headquartered there, major manufacturing facilities.
And the thing that really struck me was not that we were having a current downturn in the economic activity and the employmentas I noted to you, 11,000 lost jobs in my state alone. And this is in Cessna, Raytheon, Bombardier, Learjet, Boeing. I mean, it's across the board, all the companies.
That's there. That's a problem.
But what was really troubling me was they said, as you look out in the future, in developing the next wave of aeronautic products, the next wave of planes, they are being approached by various countries and saying that, "Okay, we will pay for the research on the development of a new wing, new engine, for general aviation. And we will help you develop that, as a country."
"Now if we do that, we want to build that product then in our country." So that they're saying, we've got a near-term problem.
We have a cyclical nature of the business. We understand that. But we're really concerned about his industry moving offshore, with the research pulling it offshore to other places or other parts.
One, are you familiar with that taking place? And if you would comment about what you feel like we should be doing as a country to stop it?
CREEDON:
Thank you for the question, senator. I would say two things.
In NASA, we have had a series of three programs aimed at the general aviation industry. The first was an AGATE program that was aimed at developing some technologies that would improve the capabilities of the general aviation vehicles, the kind of research of the nature that you were talking about.
In addition to that, we had a program that would develop engines specifically suited for general aviation aircraft. Within the budget constraints that we have had, we have directed the research funds that we have in this area now towards a small aircraft transportation system, which is dedicated towards coming up with the ability to operate these aircrafts and offload the hub and spoke system and provide greater access to smaller communities and more ability to people to make point to point travel plans and not have to go through the hubs by using the general aviation aircraft.
I think, as is evident in the commission's report and the statements of everyone that has spoken today, that if you do not do the requisite research to provide the capability to compete, that in a competitive world, you will soon not be able to compete. And our funds, we pride ourselves at NASA in coming up with a responsible and credible program.
And within the funds that we had available, we have dedicated them, at this time, to operation of the general aviation aircraft in the transportation system. And therefore, we are not funding the kind of research that you talk about.
BROWNBACK:
Chairman Walker, I'm sure this topic came up at the commission. What were the narrow recommendations that you think would most be befitting of the industry to try to address this topic of some of this research and then manufacturing moving offshore?
WALKER:
We were very fortunate on the commission to have able representation of the general aviation industry from Ed Bolen, who is going to testify here later on today. And a number of these topics did come up.
I will tell you that the one thing that we found to be very true is that, throughout the world, there are countries aggressively looking to develop aircraft manufacture capabilities. When we were in both Japan and China, we found there that they are really looking to move into building of regional jets.
Why do they want to do that? Is there really a global market for regional jets? No. The Chinese could point to at least some domestic market. The Japanese couldn't even point to that.
But they want the ability to do that kind of technological integration work because they know that that will have reverberative effects out into the future and will allow them to be competitive, not only in the aerospace area, but in lots of other areas. So it's a great challenge to us.
And so, what you will see in a number of the recommendations of the commission is our attempts to deal wit that kind of technological challenge and that kind of policy challenge. One of the reasons why we have to reform the export control policy of this country is because we have to do something that allows us to compete globally with our aerospace products.

At the present time, what's happening is, as a result of our control policy, many of our companies are unable to market beyond our own shores. And the export control policy recommendation was aimed at assuring that, as we develop good products here, they are marketable on a global scale. That assures not only that you keep the ability to manufacture, but also you keep the supplier base in this country that underpins that entire manufacturing capability.
We will lose both manufacturing capabilities and we will lose supplier base if we don't do something about an export control policy that simply is not working at the present time.
BROWNBACK:
I ran into that, particularly in India, who is a strong ally of the United States, and saying that we're getting all these dual-use requirements that are just keeping product from us that we would like to get from the United States. And they're saying, you know, we're working with you. What can we do to get those off?
And here is an economy that's growing. And it's quite vibrant.
Chairman Walker, have we lost the leadership in the aerospace industry, in your estimation?
WALKER:
No, we have not lost it. But we are on a slope where we could lose it in the future if we don't take the steps necessary to compete.
I mean, what we saw is, in the aeronautics area, particularly in commercial aviation, we are being heavily challenged from the Europeans who, as Senator Dodd pointed out, have laid out their vision of where they are headed in that area in their 2020 report and some subsequent reports since then. There is no doubt that they have an entire plan for challenging our supremacy there.
We are being challenged in space on the Pacific Rim. There is no doubt that the Chinese have an aggressive space program. They are willing to put substantial dollars into it.
And if you don't believe that, all you have to do is talk to the Japanese and the Indians, who believe thoroughly that the Chinese have a substantial program in that area. So the challenges are real. The question is whether or not we are willing to step up to the plate, do the R&D necessary to do transformational products and then move forward.
And that's the question of the development of resources that is throughout the report. It's resources not only of government funding but the ability for industries to attract more investment money because we revised the business model that allows them to have more capital flow into those businesses and, therefore, allows us to remain more competitive.
BROWNBACK:
When would you expect the Chinese to put an astronaut in space?
WALKER:
This year. This year.
BROWNBACK:
And you don't have much question about that?
WALKER:
We have no question that they will fly. It may be a "Spam in the can" kind of mission that they do. But the fact is that they will probably orbit someone this year.
I think the real challenge comes, I believeand this is strictly me speaking; it was not in the commission reportI believe that they plan to be on the moon within a decade and that they will announce that they are there to stay permanently.
And I will tell you a little anecdotal information. I had a Japanese parliamentarian into my office the other day. And I related to him that that was my belief, coming off this particular study that we had done.
And he looked at me. And he said, "No, you're wrong."
And I was kind of surprised because some of the information we had gathered about this, we had gathered in Japan. And then he smiled and said, "You're not wrong in your conclusion. You're wrong in your timing." He said, "They will be on the moon within three or four years."
Now I think that has huge implications for us as a country, if they truly have an aggressive program of that type. But I believe it is that aggressive. And I certainly think that they will fly humans inside this year.
BROWNBACK:
Dr. Creedon, do you agree with that assessment?
CREEDON:
I think that . . .
BROWNBACK:
Please speak into the microphone there, if you would?
CREEDON:
Across the board, it's very, very competitive. I don't have insight on the information that Chairman Walker has. But I have no reason to doubt the conclusions that he came to.
BROWNBACK:
Senator Allen?
BROWNBACK:
It seemed like to me, when you were talking about our superiority of military aircraft, that taking some of that technology that's developed there and getting it out to our private side would really be helpful.
Chairman Walker, you have been around government a good period of time. You have seen us lose market share to Airbus fromit wasn't probably five years ago, maybe seven, when we were at 73 percent. Now Airbus is passing us up or projected for the first time. And that's in a down market. They are expanding in a difficult market.
What are we going to have to do? Are we going to have to heavily subsidize, the way Airbus is, to get back into a stronger position? Are we going to have to do different business model plans to try to attract more investment dollars into the aircraft manufacturing business?
WALKER:
We certainly have to do some things about changing the business model. And some of that probably does involve at least being competitive with them in the favorable financing plans that they offer to airlines and the nations around the world as they're doing them.
I hope that we don't have to go to government subsidies to do that. But we certainly ought to have a financial plans that works, that allows Boeing to be competitive in those areas.
The other thing that we certainly found with Airbus is that they have an aggressive plan moving forward. The question that you have to ask yourselfand it's a worthwhile questionis whether or not they have bet right. I mean, they're betting on the A-380, which is a huge new airplane that's going to fly lots of passengers from hub to hub.
The question is whether or not the travel in the future is going to be hub to hub or whether it's going to be point to point. And one of the ways in which we can compete in this country is by developing the point to point airplanes that allow us to have a generation of aircraft that would be competitive because of a very different kind of business model.
And some of those will be very small airplanes. Some of those will be more general aviation type of airplanes than they will be even the regional jet capacities. But I can imagine the businesspeople of the future who will not want to fly hub to hub, who will want to get up in the town where they live and fly to the town where they are doing business and come right back, and do so in a timeframe that fits inside their business pattern.
That's a huge challenge for our airlines because that means a lot of the people that have flown in the front of their cabin and paid the big fees may be transferred off into some other mode of transportation in the future. And so that has to be taken into account.
But there is a changing business model that's already being observed. And in so far as we can get in front of that, we have a chance of being very competitive with the Europeans in the future.
BROWNBACK:
I can't resist asking you this. Bob, do we go back to the moon? What's your sense?
You chaired the commission. You have chaired the committee over on the House side. You have been involved in this business review, policy setting for some period of time. Should the United States be going back to the moon?
The conclusion I have come to is what I want us to do is have the technologies that give us all kinds of options. I want us to be able to go to the moon. I want us to be able to go to Mars. I want us to be able to go to Europa.
I want a lot of options out there and that we can pick and choose among those options. And I believe that what NASA is attempting to do with Project Prometheus, in giving us the ability to fly much faster, allows you then to look at a variety of options for the future, both robotic and human options.
And I think that there would be probably good reasons for people to design missions to the moon or to Mars or to Europa or to the asteroids, to a lot of other places. But what we have lacked up until now is the technological capabilities to explore those options realistically and in a timeframe that Congress is willing to fund.
And the new technologies will, in fact, permit us that kind of option. And it's where I think we should go in the near term.
BROWNBACK:
Anything else, Senator Allen?
BROWNBACK:
Thank you both very much for joining us. Chairman Walker and Dr. Creedon, it was very good. Appreciate that.
Our next panel will be: Mr. Ed Bolen, president and chief executive officer of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association; Mr. Dennis Dietz, director of manufacturing research and development, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, out of Wichita, Kansas; and Dr. John Tomblin, interim executive director of the National Institute for Aviation Research at Wichita State University.
Much of the aviation manufacturing business is headquartered in Wichita. And the university strives to serve them.
Gentlemen, thank you all very much for joining us. We will put your full written statements into the record, if you would like to summarize. It's your choice. We appreciate very much your being here.
Mr. Bolen?
BROWNBACK:
Thank you, Dr. Tomblin. Let me ask both you and Mr. Dietz at the outset here: are weand let's run the clock for 10 minutes this timeare we doing today what we need to on making the research to marketplace connections that we have in the past in the aviation industry? You mentioned that you worked the materials working group up untilI can't remember the date you said it ended. But are we doing today what we need to to make those transitions from the research to the marketplace?
TOMBLIN:
It's funny you ask that question because what we did in the AGATE program was kind of a paradigm shift of what usually is done. If you look at commercial, military and general aviation and you want to apply technology, most people would say start at military, then go to commercial and then go to general aviation, that it works down.
But what we found was that it was more effective to work fromessentially saying general aviation is the bottomgoing from the bottom up. Because I can get a new technology implemented faster on the general aviation models that turn over year after year after year, rather than commercial transports that have very few models. And military aircraft have greater models, but unfortunately some of that technology doesn't transfer into federal policies and regulations. So it can't be used cost effectively like the general aviation industry because then they have to go redo some of the research to actually get it into federal policy and regulation.
BROWNBACK:
So do you feel like we are doing what we need to in the match between federal research and getting this to the marketplace today? Or is itI mean, this is a model program that you're talking about and that one has worked well. Are we doing that enough? Are we doing it across the board sufficiently?
TOMBLIN:
I think we can do more. I think Mr. Bolen mentioned it is some of the certification methods. Currently, when I go to a general aviation manufacturer and we have a new technology that we want to implement, they have to consider cost, risk and certification time. And that new model, they have customers, 300 airplanes already sold. And unfortunately, the new technology has to earn its way on to the aircraft.
So that's unfortunate because a lot of times, that technology gets old and it's not implemented.
BROWNBACK:
What do you mean, it's got to earn its way on to the aircraft?
TOMBLIN:
Cost and risk reduction and certification time. So if I was going to implement, let's just say my expertise, a composite material technology like we did in the Raytheon Premier 1. We had various parts of that aircraft that we could have put on.
And only one part made it because of the new application and the technology, they wouldn'tthat's the whole aircraft technology on that specific technology.
BROWNBACK:
Mr. Dietz, same question. Are we doing the partnership right that we need between the government and the private sector to get this research utilized as rapidly and as well as possible?
DIETZ:
I'm in the transition business, so I understand that word. And that's a very, very important word in our business.
The problem, as both these gentlemen have alluded to, is the timing, the fact that it does have to make itself pay from a financial standpoint. And it goes back to the basic research. The basic research has to be out in front of the applied research and you actually transition on to the product, so you don't have to stop and consume the time of getting it on the product as part of it.
Furthermore, because of theparticularly on products that already exist, the difficulty to develop some of the fundamental basic research capability and those costs, when you try to apply that technology to existing products, it almost prohibits its transition. So you're almost limited to new products, new applications or derivatives of old products.
BROWNBACK:
Let me put it a little differently. Were we much better in the past at getting the information and the help and the research?
Or were we just much bigger investment from the government in this basic research to be able to use it in the private sector in the past than we are now?
DIETZ:
I think there are two answers to the question. I think one answer to the question is yes, there was, I think in some cases in the past, a more steady and predictable research activity that was out in front.
And then the other thing I think needs to be recognized, we're talking very significant material properties, material characterization and so forth. Historically, you've got to remember, we've been building airplanes out of the same materials for many, many years now.
We are now working with materials and matrixes of those materials that are whole new material systems that create all new challenges for the structures they are used in. And therefore, the ability to create the basic research that is substantial enough to transition to a product is a greater jump than it has been historically because of significant changes.
And it goes back again to changing that productivity model. We can't just make incremental improvements to the same old process. It's time we have to make step function improvements. And that's driving some of these new material changes.
BROWNBACK:
Ed, did you have some comment on this? Mr. Bolen?
BOLEN:
I think when we looked at this from the commission, one of the things that we saw as somewhat of a historical shift, I think we felt that 30 years ago, a lot of the goals of the space program, the military, the civil aviation were roughly the same. We wanted to fly a little farther. We wanted to fly higher. We wanted to fly faster.
I think what we've seen more recently is that the end goals of some of our different disciplines are different. The military, for example, is now very interested in stealth technology. That's not something that spins off well to the commercial side.
BROWNBACK:
Not particularly interested in that.
BOLEN:
No. I mean, the commercial side is very interested in flying quieter and flying cleaner. Well, it's not to say that the military doesn't care about it. But that's certainly not their first priority. That's not how we've set it up.
So I think we've had a divergence of goals, so they don'tnaturally, the technology doesn't naturally flow back and forth as well as it could. But I think we do have, certainly with the general aviation community and NASA, I think we learned through the programthe AGATE program that was discussed earlierwe did learn that collaboration and cost sharing was very, very helpful.
But I don't think you can ever have too much collaboration communication. What we need to do is have the industry talking to NASA about the type of basic researchpre-competitive level researchthat we need done. Then let the companies themselves try to take those products and make them marketable, but also working with the FAA to know that, hey, if we got this technology . . .
BROWNBACK:
Could it be certified?
BOLEN:
Could it be certified? And we don't know that. And so I think what we need is we've got better communication now. But we need to have all the federal agencies talking to each other. And we need to have industry involved.
And I think that's a fundamental part of the commission report at every level: better federal coordination, better industry involvement and interface with the government.
BROWNBACK:
Mr. Dietz and Dr. Tomblin, Mr. Bolen mentioned about propulsion systems. And I take it really from what you're saying is that, at the root of all this is the engine of it. And we need most to focus there.
Would that be correct, Mr. Bolen, in summarizing your comment on propulsion?
BOLEN:
Yeah, I think history is pretty clear on that from a civil aviation standpoint. If you go back to the comments that Chairman Walker made about space, the propulsion systems in space are there as well. It's figuring out how to get someplace reliably, quickly, cleanly. All of those things matter.
And I think propulsion research is at the heart of that. That is the engine. And we can certainly build the aerodynamic systems around that.
BROWNBACK:
Do you agree that that's really where we need to focus? That most of the effort will be in that propulsion system?
TOMBLIN:
I agree that, like Mr. Bolen said, the aircraft is usually built around the engine. If you look in the commission's report, they mention the number of aircraft companies and of new aircraft companies that hopefully will revolutionize the world with their cost and their speed. Those aircraft are essentially built around a new engine.
BROWNBACK:
Mr. Dietz?
DIETZ:
I don't know I would characterize that all the research needs to be focused around propulsion.
BROWNBACK:
And I'm not saying that either. But I'm just saying that your dominant area. You've obviously got a number of parts in that plane. But your dominant focus right now really needs to be that propulsion.
DIETZ:
Propulsion is certainly a key item, from the standpoint of we continue to need greater efficiencies, but at the same time, have to handle the noise, the emissions and the other aspects that go along with that. So yes, it creates some special challenges that certainly need to be addressed and will continue to make the products more competitive.
BROWNBACK:
Mr. Dietz, you mentioned too about the systems whereby air traffic systemsI think Boeing has done quite a bit of investment in the air traffic systems. Do you feel like the current system in this countryair traffic systemis an antiquated one that really needs to have a lot more focus? And if so, we will be able to have a much more efficient system, be able to land more aircraft, take off more aircraft per airport?
DIETZ:
I'll go back to what I said was our highest priority, and that's the door-to-door travel time for our citizens. If you can make it convenient and low cost for people to travel, and they feel safe and secure in doing that travel, you'll have more demand for travel. You'll have more requests for our products. And therefore, we feel it's a really critical element of this whole thing to provide that whole infrastructure of the transportation system that creates the environment for the transportation.
BROWNBACK:
Let me ask you this, and I've had some discussions with Boeing and some other people about now you have to go to a point A and then to B, to where your final destination is, so you're not going the most direct route. And there's issues of safety.
But if you could go directly from point A to B instead of point A to C and then to B in the process, how much travel time could we take off of flights going middle of the country, from East or West Coast to the middle of the country? How much time are you talking about, if we just used current technology and did it very safely though, in a safe way?
DIETZ:
The point-to-point obviously eliminates congestion of the hugs. So that, in and of itself, creates some opportunities to make a more manageable airspace. So that's certainly an element of the capacity.
But the other part of the capacity is managing that capacity as well, dealing with the human factors that air traffic controllers and others have to deal with in managing that and really linking all the elements of the system together to where it truly is a more centric type of operation.
BROWNBACK:
How much could we cut off of the travel time from Washington National to Kansas City if you had a more efficient air traffic system?
Just to make it personal . . .
(LAUGHTER)
. . . just for example, I'm calculating here my weekly commute.
DIETZ:
Well, obviously, if it's a direct flight, the whole issue with door-to-door time is how soon do you have to get to the airport ahead of time? What kind of security issues do you have to deal with at the airport? What kind of issues does congestion in the airport deal with? Leaving on time and arriving on time?
So it's a little difficult to speculate.
BROWNBACK:
Just the air travel from once we take off to once we land?
DIETZ:
I believe the air travel is relatively the same.
BROWNBACK:
Is that the case of most? It's point to point in the hubs?
DIETZ:
Obviously, as you talk about longer distances, the ability to go point-to-point versus through a hub now enables you to stop the whole landing-takeoff pattern, the whole wait time in the airport and everything else. So that's when you begin to really affect the travel time, is by eliminating that stop in between.
BROWNBACK:
Senator Allen?
BROWNBACK:
Thank you. Thank you, Senator Allen.
I want to thank the panelists. And I would just note that, as we conclude the hearing, we'll leave the record open for the requisite number of days so you can submit further statements if you'd like.
But I leave this hearing uneasy. It's like we're celebrating 100 years. One hundred years ago, the Wright Brothers took off Kitty Hawk. We had that short flight.
Lots of successes along the waybroke the sound barrier here, the first people on the moon, the space shuttle program, the things that we've done. And yet, I'm uneasy that we're losing the edge.
I guess that's the cumulative of what I'm hearing from everybody here is we haven't lost it yet. But if we're turning around and looking back, they're gaining on us. And we haven't developed necessarily the strategy that takes us on forward to the next century of American dominance in the aerospace industry, which I want to see it be.
And you have provided us good thoughts and good food for thought. We have several legislative vehicles that will be looked at. You mentionedor it was mentioned here todaythe Allen-Dodd bill. There will be some view towards funding for research efforts.
And please feel free to contact our office, others, the committee, about where you think the best placement of effort and sources would be so that we can be secure in moving forward and maintaining the lead in this very, very vital field for our economy, for our future, for our safety and our travel and also for our security.
Thank you for coming. Thank you for traveling here. Thank you all for attending. The hearing is adjourned.
