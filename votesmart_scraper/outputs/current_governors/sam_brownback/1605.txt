NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to recognize National Adoption Day which is this Saturday, November 20. National Adoption Day is a collaborative effort to raise awareness about the thousands of children in foster care waiting to be adopted. There are an estimated 542,000 children in foster care in the United States, and over 126,000 of them are waiting to be adopted.
This day is meant to celebrate and honor all those loving parents who adopt children and to bring attention to the children in foster care waiting to be adopted. On Saturday, an unprecedented number of courts throughout the nation will finalize the adoption of thousands of children from foster care. For the last 4 years, local adoption agencies, courts, and advocacy organizations have come together on National Adoption Day to help children in need of a permanent home.
The number of children in foster care has nearly doubled since 1987, and the average time a child remains in foster care is 3 years. Sadly, almost 20,000 children in foster care age out of the system each year without ever being placed with a permanent family. If only one out of every 500 Americans adopted, all foster children would be placed in homes.
As a father of two adopted children, I know the love and joy that comes from adoption. I commend the National Adoption Day partners for their efforts and their dedication in working toward a day when all children will have a permanent, loving family to call their own.
