WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement after the Senate passed the emergency supplemental appropriation for Iraq.
"We must now move forward. We must supply our troops with the equipment and supplies they need, and we must help Iraq to develop into a free, democratic society. While many had concerns with the President's initial proposal, these concerns have been adequately addressed. My colleagues in the Senate and I have been successful in our efforts to improve on the President's proposal.
"Since Congress began deliberating the President's request, I have said we must pass a supplemental appropriations bill. We must follow through on our commitment to make Iraq a free society. It is not an option for us to fail. Success in Iraq will have great impact on that region and the world, stifling terrorism, building open, democratic societies and making us safer here at home. We have also added provisions that will strengthen democracy and religious freedom in Afghanistan, Liberia, and Sudan.
"We saved taxpayers $1.7 billion compared to the President's original plan. The conference committee effectively removed some of the wasteful items contained in the original proposal. For example, while memorials to human rights abuses in Iraq serve a proper purpose, the American people should not be paying for them. We also should not be paying for new garbage trucks. Items like these were removed," Brownback said.
