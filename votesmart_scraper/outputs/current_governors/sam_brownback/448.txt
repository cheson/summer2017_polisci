Location: Wichita , KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback rallied with more than 2000 aviation industry workers and leaders in Wichita today. The Governor pledged he will continue to work to keep the industry's international competition level.
"As a U.S. Senator, I spoke often about the need for Congress to engage fully the competition and pursue all means necessary to ensure that this industry is not injured through the illegal actions of foreign governments and their treasuries," Governor Brownback told the crowd. "The American aerospace industry and its workers design and build the finest aircraft in the world and we welcome vigorous competition."
The Governor stressed the importance of providing a level playing field to encourage fair international competition during a rally this morning at Cessna Aircraft Company in Wichita. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray Lahood as well as Senator Jerry Moran and Congressman Mike Pompeo also attended and spoke at the event.
Brownback also emphasized the need for pro-business policy that encourages innovation, entrepreneurship and fair competition.
"Like the rest of the economy, the aviation industry has gone through a major downturn since the fall of 2008," Brownback said. "One of my administration's top priorities is to create a business environment that puts this industry on the road to recovery and creates jobs."
Last month, the U.S. Air Force awarded a multi-billion dollar contract to Boeing for construction of the new KC-46A Air Refueling Tanker. The USAF selected Boeing instead of European manufacturer EADS/Airbus who the World Trade Organization ruled had received $20 billion in illegal government subsidies.
