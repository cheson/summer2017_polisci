The Republican Lieutenant Governor Association (RLGA) announced today it has appointed Kansas Lieutenant Governor Jeff Colyer, M.D. to its Executive Committee.
"It's an honor to join my fellow Republican Lieutenant Governors from across the country to advocate for policies that are important to our states. I look forward to working with the rest of the RLGA Executive Committee to bring the principles of smaller government, lower taxes and increased freedom to our states," Lt. Gov. Colyer said.
45 states have Lieutenant Governors. Republicans currently hold 15 of the 19 independently-elected positions and 15 of the 26 team-elected/appointed seats.
"I'd like to congratulate Lt. Gov. Colyer for being named to the RLGA's Executive Committee," Gov. Brownback said. "He is a great partner in our efforts to grow our state's economy and create job opportunities in Kansas. He works hard every day on behalf of all Kansans."
The RLGA is part of the Republican State Leadership Committee, the largest caucus of Republican state leadership in the country.
