Sen. Cornyn: Administration Makes It Easier For Union Bosses To Take Advantage Of Rank And File Members
Leads effort in sending letter to Secretary Solis requesting labor law increasing transparency not be undone
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, today led an effort to send a letter to Department of Labor Secretary Hilda Solis requesting the administration not rescind a rule requiring increased transparency in labor organization annual financial reports, which is intended to help root out corruption and fraud. It has been reported that there have been many accounts of unions abusing the funds of its rank and file members, and the new rule called for more information from union leaders. Twenty-nine Senate Republicans joined Sen. Cornyn in urging the Administration to keep the important law in place.
"It is troubling that the Administration would decide that now, of all times, is a good time to eliminate investigations of financial corruption. I would hope that the American people can trust that their government would aggressively pursue financial fraud and corruption without regard to political constituency. It is my hope that the Administration will see the error of their ways and reconsider their decision to rescind such important regulations. If they do not, union bosses will be free to run roughshod over rank and file members who have no way of knowing how their hard-earned dues are being spent," Sen. Cornyn said.
