WASHINGTON, DC 20515-6460
The Honorable Vygaudas Usackas
Ambassador of the Republic of Lithuania to the United States
Embassy of the Republic of Lithuania

Washington, D.C. 20007
Dear Ambassador Usackas:
As Members of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, we recognize the important contribution that Lithuania is making toward European integration and to the development of democratic governance and civil society in the signatory states of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We also appreciate your country's strong support and cooperation in the war on terror.
In this connection, we would like to call your attention to an issue that has been brought to our attention by concerned members of the Jewish community in the United States. They report that the historic Snipiskis Cemetery in Vilnius has been desecrated by public projects and may suffer further desecration in the future. They also contend that Lithuanian authorities have resisted efforts to seek objective evidence regarding the cemetery, and are unwilling to address this issue in a forthright manner.
We urge you to convey our concerns to the appropriate authorities, and hope that this matter may be resolved in a manner consistent with justice and respect for the heritage and religious traditions of the Jewish people.
We look forward to your response and extend our best wishes.
Sincerely,
Sam Brownback, U.S.S.
Chairman Hillary Rodham Clinton, U.S.S.
Commissioner
