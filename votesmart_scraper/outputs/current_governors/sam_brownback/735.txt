Brownback Congratulates Airborne Laser Program on Achieving Flight Milestone
Modified Boeing 747 is first-ever plane to fly with weaponized high-energy
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated the Missile Defense Agency's Airborne Laser program on starting its first round of flight tests as a full weapons system.
"This week's flight test marked the first time in history that a plane flew with a fully integrated and weaponized high-energy laser on board," said Brownback. "The scientists and engineers who enabled this achievement should be congratulated for doing something that many people predicted would never happen."
The ABL is a modified Boeing 747 which carries a high energy laser designed to shoot down ballistic missiles during their initial, or boost, phase. Ballistic missiles are most vulnerable in the boost phase, before they can deploy decoys or countermeasures.
Brownback continued, "The Airborne Laser is critical to plans for a layered ballistic missile defense system. I look forward to the completion of ABL's flight tests and a full demonstration of its capabilities later this year. As North Korea's recent launch demonstrated, we need the capabilities that ABL brings to the fight."
In 2007, the ABL completed dozens of flight tests, including tests of the system's targeting and laser fire-control systems. Last year, engineers installed the high-energy laser and operated the full weapons system on the ground. Upcoming tests will involve firing the high-energy laser in flight, leading to a full system test against a short range ballistic missile target later this year.
