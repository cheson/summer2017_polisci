Brownback Urges Confirmation of Eric Melgren
Says U.S. Attorney is highly qualified for federal judgeship
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today urged his Senate colleagues to quickly confirm Eric Melgren as United States District Judge for the District of Kansas.
"Eric Melgren, a native of my home state of Kansas, is a highly qualified individual whose experience has proven he will do excellent work on the federal bench," said Brownback. "Over the course of his distinguished career, Eric Melgren has consistently upheld the United States Constitution and has proven that he is an outstanding nominee for U.S. District Judge. I ask that my Senate colleagues act quickly to confirm Eric Melgren's nomination."
The Senate Judiciary Committee today questioned five judicial nominees, including Melgren. In July of this year, Melgren was nominated to replace U.S. District Judge Monti Belot, who sits on the federal bench in Wichita. Melgren was unanimously rated "well qualified" by the American Bar Association, which is the highest rating the ABA can give judicial nominees.
