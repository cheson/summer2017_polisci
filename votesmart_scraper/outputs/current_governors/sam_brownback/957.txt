Brownback Supports Boeing Protest of Air Force Decision in Tanker Deal
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Boeing for its announcement to formally protest the decision by the United States Air Force to award a $40 billion contract for air-refueling tankers to European manufacturer EADS.
"Boeing has made the right decision to formally protest the Air Force's decision to grant such a large defense contract to a subsidized foreign company partially owned by the Russian government," said Brownback. "Several of my Congressional colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, have joined me in questioning the logic behind the Air Force's stunning decision. I hope Boeing's protest leads the Air Force to seriously reconsider its decision-making process and realize that Boeing is the most capable company to manufacture military air-refueling tankers."
Last month, the Air Force announced it will award a $40 billion contract to European Aeronautic Defense & Space to purchase 179 new KC-767 tankers over a ten year period. Boeing, which for fifty years has been supplying the Air Force with refueling tankers, had competed with EADS for the contract.
