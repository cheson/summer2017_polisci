Brownback Comments on EPA Decision
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to deny Texas Governor Rick Perry's request for halving the Renewable Fuels Standard schedule for renewable fuel production and usage.
"Fortunately, the EPA decided against the Texas request for a waiver of the RFS schedule," said Brownback. "Had the EPA approved the request, it would have been harmful to investments in alternative fuels and would have sent a signal that the government is backing away from its commitment to renewable energy."
Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, enacted on December 19, 2007, the RFS was accelerated such that U.S. transportation fuels are required to contain at least nine billion gallons of renewable fuels in 2008, growing to 36 billion gallons in 2022. The accelerated RFS in general, and ethanol production in particular, have worked to keep the price of gasoline lower by as much as $.50 than otherwise would be the case.
Brownback continued, "It's important that America commits to a diversified energy policy, especially given the increase in oil prices. We should expand domestic exploration and production of oil and increase our use of biofuels such as corn-based and cellulosic ethanol."
Last month, Brownback and a tri-partisan group of senators sponsored the Open Fuel Standard Act, legislation which seeks to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil.
