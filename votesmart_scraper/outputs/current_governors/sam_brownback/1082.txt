Brownback Applauds Senate Passage of Transportation/HUD Appropriations Bill
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage of the Transportation/HUD Appropriations bill. The bill passed by a vote of 88 to 7.
"It is absolutely vital that we properly fund our transportation infrastructure," said Brownback. "This bill includes one billion dollars in offset spending to repair structurally deficient bridges. I am glad that my colleagues were able to agree to a THUD Appropriations bill that balances priorities well."
