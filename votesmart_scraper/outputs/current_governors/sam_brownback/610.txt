Thune Requests Additional Funding to Fight Pine Beetles

Senator John Thune last week sent a letter along with seven other Senators to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack urging him to commit additional resources to the Rocky Mountain Region of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to fight the widespread bark beetle infestation. The Rocky Mountain Region has 17 national forests and seven national grasslands -- including the Black Hills which have been impacted by the devastating impact of the pine beetle.
The bark beetle infestation has grown to impact 2.5 million acres of national forest land in the Intermountain West. The letter asks Secretary Vilsack to reprogram Fiscal Year 2010 appropriations and unobligated funds appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to provide additional resources to this emergency situation.
"The pine beetle infestation is having a dramatic effect on the Black Hills National Forest and other forests in the region," said Thune. "The Rocky Mountain Region needs additional funding to address this issue before it gets worse. This infestation is leaving forests vulnerable to catastrophic fire and watershed degradation, which places local communities at-risk. Long term, if this situation is not addressed the infestation could impact wildlife habitats, threaten species, reduce recreation activities, and reduce water quality and quantity in this region."
In addition to Senator Thune, the letter was signed by Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Sam Brownback (R-KS), Michael Enzi (R-WY), Tim Johnson (D-SD), Ben Nelson (D-NE), and Mark Udall (D-CO).
