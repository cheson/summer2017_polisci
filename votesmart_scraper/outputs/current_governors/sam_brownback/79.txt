Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Court of Appeals ruling to stay nationwide enforcement of the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule.
"I was pleased to learn of this morning's decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals staying nationwide enforcement of EPA's "Waters of the United States' rule. My administration has opposed this onerous, overreaching federal rule since it was first proposed. This rule intruded into state jurisdiction over water quality and significantly expanded EPA's regulatory power. We will continue our fight to make certain that the Obama administration does not bring back this rule, and to protect the rights of Kansas landowners and businesses."
