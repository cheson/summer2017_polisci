Brownback Statement on Cambodia Elections

WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback released the following statement today regarding the recent elections in Cambodia.
"On Sunday, the Cambodian people were supposed to have the opportunity to affect political change to free this Southeast Asian nation of its haunted history and to secure a prosperous future," Brownback said. "However, Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) are again scheming to deny Cambodians of any prospect of living in an open, democratic society free from fear and intimidation.
"In the lead-up to the elections, human rights organizations, international observers and the media reported widespread, politically-motivated violence against political parties in Cambodia, including several dozen murders. The absence of the rule of law is underscored by the unwillingness of Cambodian authorities to credibly investigate and prosecute those implicated in the pre-election violence. As a result, the possibility for a free and fair election has significantly diminished under the weight of this environment of intimidation and violence.
"Now, the Cambodian opposition has coalesced around the undeniable fact that the elections did not meet international standards. The Royalist FUNCINPEC party, currently a member of the government coalition, and the Sam Rainsy Party, refuse to recognize the results as dictated by Hun Sen and the CPP. Based on his own statements, the intentions of Cambodian kleptocrat Hun Sen are clear - preservation of power at any cost.
"The United States should remain firm in its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in Cambodia and ensuring the safety and security of the opposition," Brownback said.
