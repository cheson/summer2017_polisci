Brownback Comments on Federal Deficit Increase
Calls on federal government to cease wasteful spending
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today expressed disappointment with federal deficit projections released by the White House increasing the estimate for next year's deficit to almost $490 billion.
"It is very important that we lower the federal deficit by reducing government spending and growing the economy," said Brownback. "Congress must become serious about cutting unnecessary and wasteful government spending. Tax payers should be encouraged to spend or invest their money in practical ways, not forced to subsidize redundant, out of date government programs."
