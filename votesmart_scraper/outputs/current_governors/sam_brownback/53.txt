Governor Sam Brownback's Veto of Senate Bill 338 Defends Individual Liberty and Property Rights
Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: April 11, 2016
Location: Topeka, KS

Defending the bedrock principles of individual liberty and private property rights, Governor Sam Brownback today vetoed Senate Bill 338 concerning municipal authority over blighted and abandoned properties.
The Governor issued the following statement:
"Government should protect property rights and ensure the less advantaged are not denied the liberty to which every citizen is entitled. Governmental authority to take property from one private citizen and give it to another private citizen should be limited, but this bill would have the effect of expanding such authority without adequate safeguards. The potential for abuse of this new statutory process cannot be ignored."
