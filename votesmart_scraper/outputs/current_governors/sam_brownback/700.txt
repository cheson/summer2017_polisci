Brownback Co-Sponsors Freedom from Government Competition Act
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback co-sponsored the Freedom from Government Competition Act, legislation which would provide a process to review every commercial activity in the government.
"The Freedom from Government Competition Act would streamline the federal government work force and save the taxpayer billions of dollars," said Brownback. "The legislation would save the American taxpayer up to $28 billion annually. Currently, we have a bloated government work force that is infringing on market forces and imposing on private enterprise. I will continue to fight to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, which is becoming more and more difficult lately, and this bill will go a long way to help streamline and reform government."
Currently, 850,000 executive branch employees are in jobs that are commercial in nature. The Freedom from Government Competition Act says if private firms provide products or services that the government also provides, then the service should be subject to market competition to ensure better value for the taxpayer. The bill allows for in-sourcing after a public-private competitive sourcing analysis concludes that the provision of such goods or services by federal employees provides the best value to the taxpayer.
