Kansas Governor Sam Brownback and Lieutenant Governor Dr. Jeff Colyer today issued statements on Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City's exit from the ObamaCare exchange.
Governor Sam Brownback --"Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City's exit from the ObamaCare marketplace leaves two of Kansas' three largest counties with only one vendor on the exchange. ObamaCare's death spiral is growing worse, and there is a better way. We urge Congress and the President to continue their work to repeal and replace ObamaCare and make healthcare more affordable for Kansans."
Lieutenant Governor Dr. Jeff Colyer -- "The decision by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City to exit the exchange is another nail in the coffin of ObamaCare. Congress must keep their promise to repeal this failing program and empower a competitive healthcare system that keeps costs low for Kansas families."
