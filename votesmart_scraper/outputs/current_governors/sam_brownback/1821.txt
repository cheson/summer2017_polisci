Dear Mr. President:
Governor Kathleen Sebelius will soon request a federal emergency declaration for seven Kansas counties. We encourage you to expedite this request.
The storms on May 4, 2003, that damaged communities throughout the Midwest killed at least seven people in our state. While Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) damage assessment reports are not yet available, we know that 80 homes were damaged or destroyed in Crawford County alone. Governor Sebelius has declared six other Kansas counties disaster areas, where countless families and businesses have been affected by these devastating tornadoes.
