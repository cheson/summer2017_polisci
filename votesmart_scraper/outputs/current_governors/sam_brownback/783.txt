AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 -- (Senate - February 09, 2009)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. I agree with my colleagues, Mr. Chairman, that the bill the Senator has brought before us addresses many impending needs. This
matter we are discussing not only addresses a critical matter of national security by creating the capability to develop enough medical countermeasures to treat the U.S. population in the event of a terrorist attack, but it would expand domestic jobs and domestic infrastructure in the biotechnology industry. Like Senator SPECTER addressed previously, this bill does not identify specific funding for these needs.
I conclude that the best way of addressing these threats is for partnerships between the academic, industry and government sectors. Academically affiliated, privately operated National Centers of Excellence for Flexible Manufacturing of Medical Counter Measures are the answer to developing, sustaining, and integrating our country's biodefense portfolio under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
