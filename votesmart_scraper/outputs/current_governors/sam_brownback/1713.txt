WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the U.S. Department of Transportation's selection of Air Midwest, Inc. to provide Essential Air Service to Manhattan and Salina, Kansas.
"I am pleased the Department of Transportation has recognized the importance of maintaining air service to the communities of Manhattan and Salina," Brownback said. "Our state's smaller communities need a way to remain closely connected with the region's transportation hubs, like Kansas City. The service of Air Midwest will ensure Kansans in these towns can easily get to where they need to be. I am confident Air Midwest will serve these communities well."
