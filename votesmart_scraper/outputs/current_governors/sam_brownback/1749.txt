WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback made the following statement after the U.S. signed a $2.7 billion wheat trade agreement with Taiwan on Capitol Hill yesterday.
"I am pleased the United States has signed this historic agreement with Taiwan," Brownback said. "Through the years, Taiwan has purchased more than one billion bushels of U.S. wheat. That wheat has been shipped 10,000 miles from our farmers' fields to Taiwan, where it is made into the noodles, breads and wheat foods of that country.
"Yesterday on Capitol Hill, Taiwan demonstrated their support and desire for U.S. wheat through an agreement that will allow the U.S. to export 15.1 million metric tons of our wheat to their country. For wheat farmers, that means 581 billion bushels of wheat will be sold, generating $2.7 billion in revenue for United States wheat farmers. Since Kansas is our country's largest producer of wheat, this will have an enormous positive impact for farmers in our state.
"Taiwan is the second largest purchaser of agricultural commodities in the world. I want to thank the people of Taiwan for their friendship with U.S. wheat producers. We are excited to continue building this strong alliance with them now and into the future," Brownback said.
