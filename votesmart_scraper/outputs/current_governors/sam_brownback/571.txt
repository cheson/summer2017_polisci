Says Washington needs fresh, common sense approach to nation's financial troubles
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced that he will vote against Ben Bernanke's reconfirmation as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
"The American people are frustrated with a government that they see as increasingly out of touch and unresponsive to their needs and problems," said Brownback. "For too long, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors has been dominated by the interests of Washington and New York.
"Because of this, I will be voting against Ben Bernanke for reappointment as the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Bernanke is a gentleman and has a powerful intellect, but we need a different perspective at the Fed.
"I want someone from outside the establishment to come in. Someone like Tom Hoenig who is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. He is a practical Midwesterner from outside the Beltway who would bring a common sense view to the Fed and to our monetary policy."
