Governor Sam Brownback today signed HB2506, ensuring continued funding for education throughout the state.
The Governor, joined by Senate President Susan Wagle, House Speaker Ray Merrick and other legislators, signed into law a bill passed by the legislature on April 6.
"This bill fully addresses the equity issue addressed in the Gannon court decision. Most important, it puts money in the classroom to benefit students and teachers and provides property tax relief for Kansans," said Governor Brownback. "It makes strategic investments in our institutions of higher education, recognizing the important role they play in creating our next generation of Kansas teachers, doctors, business people and community leaders."
The bill provides $126 million to correct the equity issue for Kansas schools. The bill directs money to the classrooms to benefit teachers and students and provides tax relief for property owners across the state.
"HB2506 contains good strong education reform in Kansas," said Governor Brownback. "It supports expansion of innovative school districts, alternate certification to allow experts in science, technology, engineering, math and finance and accounting to teach our high school students. And it provides bonuses to teachers who attain national certification."
Passage and signature of the bill also ensures there will not be an interruption in funding or local option budget authority that would have required layoff notices to be sent to teachers and administrators across the state.
"This bill returns control to the local school districts and communities," said President Wagle. "These reforms will benefit Kansas students. We have good schools in Kansas and this will make them even stronger."
