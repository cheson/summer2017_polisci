BROADCASTING BALANCE -- (Senate - December 21, 2005)
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's requirement to ensure ``strict adherence to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of programs of a controversial nature.'' CPB receives roughly $400 million from Congress as part of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations bill.
CPB's requirement to see that recipients like the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio uphold the objectivity and balance standard does not stem from congressional micro-management or partisan interference. Rather, it is a matter of complying with the law under which CPB dispenses taxpayers' money.
That law mandates CPB to see to both ``maximum freedom of the public telecommunications entities'' and their ``strict adherence to objectivity and balance.'' These mandates are not in conflict. Instead, they complement each other, and to maintain Americans' confidence in public broadcasting the Corporation for Public Broadcasting must see that both mandates are fulfilled. Congress and the taxpayers expect nothing less.
