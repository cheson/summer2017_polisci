Brownback Comments on National Auctioneers Day
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the Senate resolution designating tomorrow, April 18th, as National Auctioneers Day.
"By designating this Saturday as 'National Auctioneers Day,' I hope to raise awareness of the contributions of auctions and auctioneers to the economy, culture, and the American way of life," said Brownback. "As a former auctioneer, I know the important service that auctioneers nationwide provide; through competitive bidding, auctions demonstrate how the free enterprise system establishes fair market value."
Brownback earlier this month introduced a Senate resolution marking April 18th as National Auctioneers Day. The National Auctioneers Association has 5,000 members and is headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas. Auctioneers sold nearly $268.4 million in goods and assets in 2008 and in the same year raised $16 million for charity through benefit auctions.
