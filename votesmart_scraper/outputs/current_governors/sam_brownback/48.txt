Location: Topeka, KS

In accordance with Executive Order 10-12, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff from sun-up to sun-down on Friday, May 6 in honor of Kansas Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Day.
The 34th annual Kansas Law Enforcement Memorial Ceremony will be held beginning at noon Friday in the second floor rotunda of the Statehouse.
"Today provides an opportunity for us to remember the devotion and commitment of officers across our state and honor their sacrifices," said Governor Brownback. "We pay special tribute to those who have paid the ultimate price in helping to keep us safe."
The names of two Kansas law enforcement officers -- Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Kent Newport and Topeka Police Department Officer James Buffum -- will be added to the memorial and honored this year. Trooper Newport passed away in October 2014 from a heart attack after assisting in efforts to stop a vehicle fleeing at a high rate of speed. Officer Buffum passed away in September 1975 following a struggle with a juvenile offender.
With the addition of Trooper Newport and Officer Buffum, the names of 274 law enforcement officers are engraved on the Kansas Law Enforcement Officers Memorial located on the northeast corner of the capitol grounds.
