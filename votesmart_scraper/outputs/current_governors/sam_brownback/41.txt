Governor Sam Brownback issued a statement following the late-afternoon release of the Kansas Supreme Court ruling in the Gannon v State of Kansas "education equity" case.
"It is unfortunate that the Kansas Supreme Court has put at risk the education of Kansas students and livelihood of teachers across the state by threatening to close schools on June 30. The court is engaging in political brinksmanship with this ruling, and the cost will be borne by our students.
"We will carefully consider the implications of the Court's ruling and its disregard for the proper role of the Kansas legislature."
