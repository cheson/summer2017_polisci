S. 837. A bill to establish a commission to conduct a comprehensive review of Federal agencies and programs and to recommend the elimination or realignment of duplicative, wasteful, or outdated functions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the bipartisan Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies, CARFA, Act.
We need accountability in Federal spending. With our Nation at war and with a recovering economy, the Congress needs to take concrete steps to ensure that hard-earned taxpayer dollars are being efficiently used by the Federal Government.
Indeed, few things are more upsetting to my Kansas constituents than to see wasteful Federal spending. Kansans often say to me: "I do not mind paying my taxes, but it is infuriating to see my hard-earned money being poorly spent by the Federal Government. If I am going to work hard to earn this money, I want it spent wisely." These are real concerns that need to be addressed.
