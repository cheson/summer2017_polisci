Madam President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, who has been a sponsor of this bill that I put in amendment form and am calling up now as an amendment, as an official apology to Native Americans in the United States for past issues. It is an amendment with a lot of history to it.
The bill has been brought up this Congress, the last Congress, and it has passed the Indian Affairs Committee both Congresses. It is an amendment with an issue of a lot of history to it. The chairman and myself are from Plains States where there is a lot of Native American history, as there is throughout the United States. It is a history that is both beautiful, difficult, and sad at the same time.
I have four tribal lands in my State, four areas where there are tribal lands, some that are tribal but don't have a resident tribe in the State. This has been an issue that has been around for some time--the relationship between the Federal Government and the tribes.
What we have crafted in this amendment, a previous bill that is now in amendment form, is an official apology. It does not deal with property issues whatsoever, but it recognizes some of the past difficulty in the relationship.
It says that for those times the Federal Government was wrong, we acknowledge that and apologize for it. Apologies are difficult and tough to do, but I think this one is meritorious and, as I present my case, I hope my colleagues will agree and support this amendment.
I rise today to speak about this issue that I believe is important to the well-being of all who reside in the United States. It is an issue that has lain unresolved for far too long, an issue of the United States Government's relationship with the Native peoples of this land.
