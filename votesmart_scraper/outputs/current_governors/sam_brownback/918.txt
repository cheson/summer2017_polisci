Tankers: Washington, Kansas Senators Question Joint Chiefs on Why the Safest Tanker for the American Warfighter Was Not Chosen
In letter to Joint Chiefs, Murray, Roberts, Brownback, and Cantwell cite superior safety capabilities of Boeing KC-767
Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Sam Brownback (R-KS), and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) wrote to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to express their concern that the recent KC-X contract was not awarded to the refueling tanker that is "safest, most survivable, and most effective for the American warfighter."
In February, the Air Force chose the European-based company Airbus's A330 over the Boeing KC-767.The decision was made despite the Boeing KC-767 significantly outperforming the Airbus tanker in the area of survivability - the measure of the aircraft's ability to keep its crew safe.
"Tankers face threats from shoulder-fired missiles, gunfire, and many other dangers, and these dangers are not going away" the Senators wrote in their letter. "Why then would we not buy the tanker most capable of operating in these hostile environments while keeping U.S. tanker crews and U.S. pilots who depend on them as safe as possible?"
In the letter, the Senators pose a series of questions to the Joint Chiefs on whether they were consulted on the priority of survivability in the tanker decision, their assessments of the survivability of the proposed tankers, and the risks and impacts the choice to procure a less survivable tanker would have on their services.
