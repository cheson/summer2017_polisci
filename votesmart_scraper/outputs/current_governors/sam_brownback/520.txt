Statement

Location: Washington, DC

U.S. Senators Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts of Kansas today commented on the ongoing reports about possible college conference realignment and the effect on the Big XII Conference, home to Kansas State University and the University of Kansas. They released this joint statement in anticipation of an upcoming meeting this Friday of the University of Nebraska Board of Regents:
"We encourage our friends at the University of Nebraska to remain a strong and vibrant member of the Big XII Conference.
"Since 1928, the Kansas State University, the University of Kansas and the University of Nebraska have competed for conference championships in numerous sports including football, basketball, tennis, volleyball and golf. Each institution and every student-athlete, from the revenue generating to the non-revenue generating sports, desire to participate in a top tier athletic conference. Since the inception of the Big XII in 1996-1997, the Big XII has been a dominant conference second to none. In the past 14 years, the Big XII has been home to 34 team national champions as well as 400 individual NCAA Championships. Furthermore, over the past five seasons 13 NCAA championship trophies have been brought home to the 12 members of the Big XII Conference.
"The University of Nebraska has a long storied history within the Big 6, Big 7, Big 8, and Big XII Conferences earning 24 national titles in the last 40 years. Students, fans, and alumni on both sides of the Kansas-Nebraska state line take great pride in competing against Big XII Conference members within a three and a half hour drive from the home field, close enough for family, friends, and fellow students to be able to attend the game.
"We believe as charter members of the former Big 8 Conference and as current members of the Big XII Conference, it is important Kansas State University, the University of Kansas and the University of Nebraska continue to partner with the Big XII Conference. We remain hopeful the Nebraska Board of Regents will come to the same conclusion as the Kansas Board of Regents, that member institutions should join efforts to sustain and advance the Big XII."
