Brownback Lifts Hold on Stephens Nomination
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced that he will lift his hold on the nomination of Kathleen Stephens to serve as United States Ambassador to the Republic of Korea.
"At a hearing today of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Assistant Secretary Christopher Hill assured me that the U.S. will address North Korea's human rights abuses at the Six Party Talks," said Brownback. "Because of this, I have decided to lift my objection to Ms. Stephens' nomination."
Ambassador Hill specifically mentioned the following:
 The establishment of a separate human rights track as part of the bilateral Normalization Working Group between the U.S. and North Korea.
 A pledge to raise specific cases of abductions with North Korea, including that of Revered Kim Dong-shik.
 A guaranteed invitation extended to the US Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea for attendance at all future negotiations with North Korea, except those specifically dealing with nuclear disarmament.
