Brownback Announces Kansas Projects in Omnibus Spending Bill
Kansas to receive $105 million in needed funds
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced over $105 million in projects for Kansas. Brownback was instrumental in securing $47 million and voted for the entire funding package in committee and in the full Senate, for projects in Kansas within the Omnibus spending bill that passed the Senate last weekend.
"As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have worked hard to support these vital projects in our state," Brownback said. "This assistance will secure our state, grow our economy and renew our culture. Projects were targeted toward needed transportation infrastructure, the aerospace industry, law enforcement, water management, community development, family services, and agriculture."
