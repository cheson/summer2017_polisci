Brownback Talks to Several Health Officials about Swine Flu
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today discussed with several health officials his concerns over the recent outbreak of swine flu.
"I, along with many of my constituents, am concerned about the recent cases of swine flu," said Brownback. "However, after speaking with well-qualified health officials and hearing the safe-guards already enacted by the government, I am hopeful that the spread of the swine flu will be limited."
Brownback today spoke with Dr. Til Jolly, Office of Health Affairs, U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Dr. Jason Eberhart-Phillips, Director, Division of Health, Kansas Department of Health and Environment; and Dr. Joe Bresee, Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The DHS on Sunday declared a public-health emergency and is preparing to distribute to state and local agencies a quarter of the country's 50 million-dose supply of antiviral drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza. In the United States, there have been forty confirmed cases in five states of swine flu, including two cases in Dickinson County, Kansas. France, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Spain reported potential new cases in which people had been infected with swine flu and Canada confirmed several new cases. More than 80 people in Mexico have died of the flu.
