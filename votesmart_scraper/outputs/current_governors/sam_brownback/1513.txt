OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SAM BROWNBACK
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION,
CIVIL RIGHTS, AND PROPERTY RIGHTS
SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING: "THE CONSEQUENCES OF
ROE V. WADE AND DOE V. BOLTON"
I am pleased to call to order this Constitution Subcommittee hearing on the consequences of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, and thank Ranking Member Feingold, the witnesses, and those in attendance for their participation.
America was founded upon the "self-evident truth" that all humans are endowed with the unalienable right to life.
Yet the wisdom that flowed in 1776 from Jefferson's pen was rejected almost two centuries later, when a divided Supreme Court found a constitutional right to abortion. In Roe v. Wade, the Court shaped this right around the three trimesters of pregnancy, even prohibiting the states from regulating post-viability abortions if the "health" of the mother was involved. In Doe v. Bolton, the Court expounded on the meaning of "health," describing the term so broadly that several scholars believe this exception to state authority to regulate abortion actually is the rule.
In the years since Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton were decided, it is estimated that around 40 million abortions have taken place in the United States. The legally-sanctioned extinguishing of these millions of innocent lives is a gross injustice in itself.
