Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement after the Legislature passed Senate Substitute for House Bill 2109:
"I greatly appreciate the hard work of the Legislature in passing the budget and a tax bill that meets our Constitutional obligation to provide sufficient revenue to fund budget appropriations. I congratulate them on coming together in a spirit of cooperation and compromise to do what is right for Kansas.
"This bill keeps the state on a path of economic growth, creating well-paying jobs that benefit all Kansans. It continues our transition from taxes on productivity to consumption-based taxes and provides a mechanism for reducing income tax rates for all our citizens.
"I thank the Legislature for completing the final actions of this legislative session: passing a pro-growth tax policy and a balanced budget."
