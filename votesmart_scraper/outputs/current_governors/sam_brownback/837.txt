Brownback Applauds Passage of North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on last night's passage of the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008.
"I applaud Senate passage of this important piece of legislation, which ensures that the next Administration must focus on human rights when dealing with North Korea," said Brownback. "By expanding the role of the Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights to full-time ambassadorial rank, and placing the issue of refugees within the Envoy's mandate, this reauthorization improves upon the original North Korean Human Rights Act."
Kim Jung Il's regime remains one of the worst human rights abusers in the world, responsible for millions of deaths caused by famine, forced labor, and political executions. There are estimated to be up to 300,000 North Korean refugees in China, where the Chinese government denies them assistance and often repatriates the refugees, where they face torture and execution.
Brownback continued, "There is much more we can do to stand up for the brave North Koreans living under the horrific regime of Kim Jung Il and living as refugees across the border, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on additional measures to provide humanitarian relief."
The original North Korean Human Rights Act, signed into law in 2004, established the position of the Special Envoy, authorized money for democracy and human rights programs, and created a mechanism for assisting North Korean refugees.
