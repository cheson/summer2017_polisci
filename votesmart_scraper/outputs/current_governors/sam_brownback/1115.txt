Brownback Campaign Launches Iowa Pastors for Brownback
Faith leaders support Brownback's values and principles
The Brownback for President campaign today announced the Iowa Pastors for Brownback Advisory Council.
"As I have campaigned across Iowa, I have appreciated the input and support of pastors and ministry leaders across the state," said Brownback. "Faith leaders serve the day-to-day physical, emotional and spiritual needs of their community. I value their thoughts and prayers, and I feel privileged and humbled that pastors would find my campaign and issues to be worthy of their support. Our nation was founded on the fundamental principle of 'In God We Trust,' and I will continue to promote a government that respects life, family and the role of faith in the public square."
