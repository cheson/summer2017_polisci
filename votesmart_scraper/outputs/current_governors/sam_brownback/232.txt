Governor Sam Brownback today introduced a new education program designed to help Kansas students achieve success in high school and prepare for skilled careers.
"This program will help students create an environment for success," Gov. Brownback said. "By providing these students with the right tools and a strong support system, we can help them graduate from high school with the job training and skills they need to find meaningful employment."
The Governor and Education Commissioner Diane DeBacker met with students at four of the 25 Kansas schools participating in the "Jobs for America's Graduates" (JAG) program. The JAG program is a national educational and employment system designed to improve graduation rates and academic achievement to help students succeed in school and in the workplace.
"We really see JAG-Kansas as a way to decrease our dropout rate. While we have one of the highest graduation rates in the U.S., we need to identify ways to keep students engaged, to give them purpose," Commissioner DeBacker said. "JAG-Kansas will help us serve our students and help even more Kansas students graduate from high school and prepare for careers."
The nationwide JAG program has existed for 32 years and served more than 800,000 students in 33 states. The goal of the program is to help at-risk students graduate from high school, obtain a GED, encourage them to pursue post-secondary education and find entry-level jobs with growth potential.
"When these students earn a diploma or a GED, combined with job training, they will find career and life opportunities they may never have considered before," said Gov. Brownback.
