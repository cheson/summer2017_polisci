The State Finance Council today unanimously approved two agenda items under consideration. The Council approved the distribution of approximately $4.5 Million to implement a $250 per-employee bonus for eligible state employees. The Council also approved a certificate of indebtedness for Fiscal Year 2015.
A $250 payment for each eligible full-time state employee, who has been employed full-time by the state of Kansas for the previous 12 months, will be included in the Dec. 5, 2014 payroll. The state annually issues a certificate of indebtedness to help manage its cash flow during the fiscal year when expenditures and obligations outweigh revenue. The FY 2014 certificate of indebtedness was redeemed on June 18.
The council consists of Governor Sam Brownback, Senate President Susan Wagle, House Speaker Ray Merrick, Senate Majority Leader Terry Bruce, House Majority Leader Gene Vickery, Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, House Minority Leader Paul Davis, Senate Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sen. Ty Masterson and House Appropriations Chairman Rep. Gene Suellentrop.
"This certificate of indebtedness allows the state to continue to meet its obligations through FY 2015," said Governor Sam Brownback. "My administration, unlike some before it, is paying its bills on time and in full. All signs continue to point to a growing Kansas economy with more than 53,000 new jobs created and more Kansans in the workforce than ever before. I am also pleased that our state employees will receive this $250 bonus, as requested by the legislature."
