Brownback, Collins Applaud Introduction of Open Fuel Standards Act
U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today applauded the introduction of the Open Fuel Standards Act.
Brownback said, "The Open Fuel Standards Act is an important step toward making our nation energy independent. Giving drivers more choices at the gas pump will ultimately increase the supply of available transportation fuels, while at the same time lowering the overall cost to consumers."
Starting in 2012, the OFS Act will require 50 percent of new automobiles be flex fuel vehicles able to operate on gasoline, ethanol, and methanol or diesel or biodiesel. Starting in 2015, that number will be raised to 80 percent.
Collins said, "Reducing consumption of oil products for transportation purposes would go a long way toward reducing our reliance on foreign oil and decreasing overall energy prices for consumers. Flex fuel vehicles can be made to run on gasoline, ethanol, methanol or biodiesel for about $100 per vehicle. This bill will give consumers a choice of fuel and can help meet the challenge of achieving American energy independence."
The OFS Act is co-sponsored by Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Joseph Lieberman (I-CT), and John Thune (R-SD).
Senator Brownback is the Ranking Member on the Water and Power Subcommittee of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
