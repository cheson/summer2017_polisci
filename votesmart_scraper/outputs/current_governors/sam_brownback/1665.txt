VOTE EXPLANATION
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to vote yesterday afternoon on the very significant amendment offered by my colleague from Texas. As my colleagues know, yesterday marked the 50th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision Brown v. Topeka Board of Education. We in Kansas were very pleased that President Bush and Education Secretary Paige joined with us in Topeka to commemorate this important date. While I intended to arrive here in time for the vote following the special events of this day in Kansas, the plane I was riding was, unfortunately, delayed.
Truly, providing for the health needs of our military's cadets and midshipmen when they are placed in harm's way is a duty of this Nation. I am grateful to the Senator from Texas for raising this issue, and I am pleased that the Senate adopted this amendment to S. 2400, the fiscal year 2005 Department of Defense Authorization bill. Mr. President, I ask that the record reflect that, had I been here, I would have voted in favor of Senator HUTCHISON's amendment No. 3152 yesterday afternoon.
