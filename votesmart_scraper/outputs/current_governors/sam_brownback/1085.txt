Brownback Applauds Committee Passage of Defense Appropriations Bill
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the Senate Appropriations Committee's passage of the fiscal year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations bill.
"Our men and women in uniform make great sacrifices every day and deserve strong support from Congress," said Brownback. "I hope that the full Senate will take up and pass this crucial legislation before the end of the fiscal year and avoid any disruption in funding the Department of Defense."
The Defense Appropriations bill provides $459 billion for the United States military, distributing funds between personnel, maintenance, procurement, and research and development accounts.
Brownback continued, "I am particularly pleased that this legislation provides substantial resources for key priorities in Kansas, including equipment for the National Guard and full funding of the president's request for the Airborne Laser program, a key part of our national missile defense architecture."
