SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS: SENATE RESOLUTION 184CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY TO RELEASE DR. YANG JIANLI, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, after more than a year of suffering abuse and incommunicado detention, I urge this body to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Chinese democracy activist, Dr. Yang Jianli.
Dr. Yang, a permanent resident of the United States, a respected scholar, a pro-democracy advocate, president of the Foundation for China in the 21st Century, as well as a loving husband and father, is now a prisoner and victim of shameless abuse by the Chinese government.
Following his participation in the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy student protests, Dr. Yang was added to an unofficial blacklist of expatriate Chinese dissidents. Upon his return to the country in 2002, Dr. Yang was detained and has been denied access to his family, legal counsel and due process.
The resolution submitted today in the Senate coupled with H. Res. 199, strongly calls for the release of Dr. Yang Jianli and condemns the People's Republic of China for ongoing deplorable human rights abuses. Clearly, it is not in their interest to deny human rights to any United States citizen or U.S. permanent resident alien.
Let this also be an additional chance to voice our regret and deep concern for the continual abuse of the people in China. Dr. Yang Jianli understands this better than most. He has devoted his life to the cause of democracy and freedom for the people for China and has been, once again, silenced.
China must know and the world must know that denial of basic human rights will no longer be tolerated. Dr. Yang is just one of the many, who suffer daily under the harsh rule of those who refuse to embrace democracy. We must let his story and his voice be heard for the millions of others who can not speak out. Let us continue to pressure the People's Republic of China and let us continue to stand for what is right and just around the world.
