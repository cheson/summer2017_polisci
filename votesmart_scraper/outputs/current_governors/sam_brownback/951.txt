The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is a very direct and well-known process that I wish to take to the rest of Government and ask my colleagues to consider it.
I think we are all familiar with the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. It is a process by which we try to correct where our military bases are--where we have closed some, where we have put more resources in other places. I might note to my colleagues that it has saved us $65 billion since BRAC has been in place. It has worked. It is one of the things that has worked.
I wish to take that BRAC process to the rest of the Government programs and have a commission identified, just as the BRAC Commission, to review all of the Federal programs and recommend for elimination those that are duplicative or wasteful or have not accomplished their purposes and then give us one vote in a whole package--35 programs, 200 programs--eliminate them or keep them, deal or no deal, and put that on the line.
So I am asking for the yeas and nays.
