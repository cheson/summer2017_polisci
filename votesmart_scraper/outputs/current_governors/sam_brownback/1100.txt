Brownback Speaks at Ames Straw Poll
Calls to rebuild the family, renew the culture and revive the economy
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, Republican candidate for president, will speak today at the Ames Straw Poll at approximately 3:15 p.m. in the Hilton Coliseum.
The full text of his remarks, as prepared for delivery, are included below:
First, I want to thank the Republican Party of Iowa for putting together this wonderful event. In a very real way, the race for the White House in 2008 begins in Iowa and begins here today in Ames. You, the people of Iowa, know that elections and the future of our country are based on principles not on personalities.
Today, here in Ames, I have a message of hope. You, the people of Iowa, will send a message to our party and to our country: we win when we stand on principle not when we abandon it. Because of America's commitment to principles, the principles I carry can flourish. And the son of a Kansas farmer can still grow up to be President.
I want to make one point with this speech. We must rebuild our families, renew our culture and revive our economy if we are to sustain and grow ourselves during this long-term battle we are in with militant Islamists.
The first principle, upon which our entire vision is based, is the dignity of each and every human life. Every person, everywhere, is a beautiful, precious, unique, child of a loving God. It is message that will unite us and a message that we should not shy away from.
