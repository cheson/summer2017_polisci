U.S. Senator Sam Brownback this morning released the following statement regarding the passing of Senator Ted Kennedy who had been battling brain cancer for the last year.
"Senator Kennedy was a lion in the Senate," said Brownback. "He fought for what he believed in and did so with passion. I had the opportunity to work on several legislative issues with Senator Kennedy and despite our political differences, he was professional, courteous, and thoughtful and always looked for ways to find common ground. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends."
Brownback and Kennedy recently worked together on the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act of 2008 which was signed into law in October. Brownback is a co-chair of the Senate Cancer Caucus.
