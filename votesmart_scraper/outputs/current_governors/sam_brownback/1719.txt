WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage of H.R. 1588, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004. The bill authorizes the Air Force to lease 20 and buy 80 Boeing aircraft over the next ten years, all of which will be partially built in Wichita, Kansas.
"I am pleased that we have reached a deal that is good for all parties involved," Brownback said. "This tanker deal is good for Kansas, good for Boeing and good for the Air Force."
This bill authorizes the Air Force to lease 20 converted Boeing 767s for military use, starting in 2006. In 2008, the Air Force will start buying 80 more planes. The project would end in 2014. The funding mechanism is arranged as such that the Air Force will pay for the final 80 aircraft at the time of delivery. This new, modified plan cuts about $4 billion from the $21 billion all-lease proposal, by emphasizing the purchase of the aircraft rather than leasing.
Brownback continued, "We have been able to cut costs by $4 billion and meet the needs of the U.S. Air Force. This will help ensure the safety and security of our Air Force personnel and our nation in the years to come."
