Kansas Governor Sam Brownback has proclaimed Nov. 30 as "Small Business Saturday" in Kansas to highlight the importance of small businesses to the state's economy.
"Supporting small business in Kansas is good for our communities and our overall economy," said Governor Brownback. "Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and create a sense of pride in communities throughout the state. I encourage Kansans to support the small businesses in their communities this Saturday and throughout the holiday season."
Now in its fourth year, Small Business Saturday celebrates small businesses across the nation and encourages people to "shop small" on what is traditionally the busiest shopping weekend of the year.
"Shopping small and shopping local on Small Business Saturday and every other day of the year is a great way for people to help their friends and neighbors," said Dan Murray, the National Federation of Independent Business/ Kansas State Director. "Shopping local helps create jobs and opportunities in local communities."
