IRAQ -- (Senate - October 19, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to make a statement about the situation taking place in Darfur and to update my colleagues. But I wish to speak briefly to my colleagues and to others about the amazing trial of Saddam Hussein that has started.
This is a trial that is going to reveal a great deal about what took place, the carnage that happened under his rule, and what he did to the people of Iraq. I worked with a number of Iraqi dissidents over a period of time. The things they reported--the mass graves, the persecutions, the intimidation by this Government of Saddam Hussein--is something that has not been well revealed. Hopefully, that is going to come out in this trial. We will see change as it progresses.
