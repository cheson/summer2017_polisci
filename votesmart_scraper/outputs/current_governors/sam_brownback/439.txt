Kansas Governor Sam Brownback said today his priority for the remainder of the 2011 Legislative Session is to work with lawmakers to pass legislation that balances the budget, addresses KPERS and creates a pro-growth business environment.
"We have more than 100,000 unemployed Kansans looking for work. It is our responsibility as state leaders to make sure businesses have the tools to invest and create jobs," Governor Brownback said. "Our economy is slowly beginning to turn around but we need to remain focused on returning fiscal responsibility to our state. I look forward to working with Legislators on these priorities in the coming days."
