Governor Sam Brownback today issued a statement following a decision issued by the three-judge panel of the Shawnee County District Court.
"The three-judge panel has once again violated its Constitutional authority with this ruling. It has now taken upon itself the powers specifically and clearly assigned to the legislative and executive branches of government. In doing so, it has replaced the judgment of Kansas voters with the judgment of unelected activist judges.
"The state has never invested more in K-12 education. We will appeal this decision immediately to the Kansas Supreme Court."
