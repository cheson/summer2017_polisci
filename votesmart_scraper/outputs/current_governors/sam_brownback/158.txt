Governor Sam Brownback today met with local business owners and residents in Olathe and Topeka to discuss how recent reductions in property taxes are having a positive effect on their businesses.
The recently passed $129 million school finance legislation included $84 million in property tax relief for homeowners and businesses across Kansas, the largest property tax reduction in more than 15 years.
"One of my highest priorities as Governor is to help Kansans keep more of their hard-earned money so that they can spend it or reinvest in their businesses as they see fit," said Governor Brownback. "This legislation provides local authorities with the ability to lower mill levies and property taxes for their residents."
Hal Fallert, CEO of Canyon Stone, a stone product manufacturer headquartered in Olathe, said that the property tax reductions would benefit his company not only through direct savings, but also through increased business as other taxpayers use the savings to purchase goods and services.
"A strong business climate that includes a robust educational system, excellent infrastructure and a very competitive tax structure is key to a strong economy," Fallert said. "This legislation will improve our ability to compete locally, nationally and internationally. In addition to the direct benefit of lower taxes, which gives us additional opportunities to invest and grow, the economy benefits as individuals use the tax savings to purchase products and services from companies such as ours."
Over the next 30 days, a majority of the more than 280 local school boards across the state are expected to approve significant mill levy decreases in their districts as a result of the school finance bill.
