Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement following today's interfaith memorial at the Jewish Community Campus.
"Today we take the first steps toward healing as we celebrate the lives of Reat Griffin Underwood, William Corporon and Terri LaManno. An act of violence based on hatred cut those lives short, but today we choose to remember their joy, their commitment to their families, to their communities and to their faith.
"Kansans of all ages, faiths and race have united in the aftermath of this tragedy, inspired by the strength shown by the families of Reat, William and Terri. The greatest tribute we can offer them is through our own renewed commitment to understanding and compassion.
"Today, in a time of sorrow, we choose to celebrate three good people -- father, husband, son, grandson, wife and mother. We pray for them and for their families."
