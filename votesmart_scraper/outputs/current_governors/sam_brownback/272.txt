Gov. Brownback: Courts drastically increase property taxes on Kansans
Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Jan. 11, 2013
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement regarding Friday's school finance ruling by the Shawnee County District Court.
"The ruling by the district court is disappointing but not unexpected given the Kansas Supreme Court's previous ruling in the Montoy case in 2005. Through today's ruling, the courts are drastically increasing the property tax burden on every Kansan. The Kansas Legislature, not the courts, has the power of the purse and has, in fact, increased total state funding for schools every year during my administration. The legislative process is the appropriate venue for debating and resolving issues of taxation and spending."
