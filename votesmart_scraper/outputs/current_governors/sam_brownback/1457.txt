Brownback Speaks at Rosa Parks Service
Parks was a woman of faith, quiet strength, conviction and grace
Monday, October 31, 2005
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback spoke today at the memorial service honoring Rosa Parks. Following are his remarks as prepared for delivery.
"Rosa Parks has been described as a woman of faith, quiet strength, conviction, grace, and as the mother of the modern civil rights movement. Today we honor this noble and godly woman, who with unwavering faith in God, and a resolve that would no longer allow her to stay silent in the face of egregious bigotry and discrimination, made the bold and brave decision to stand against oppression by refusing to relinquish her seat to a white man. "Though at that moment she faced an uncertain fate by challenging the unjust segregation laws in 1955, Mrs. Parks said, I felt the Lord would give me the strength to endure whatever I had to faceIt was time for someone to stand upor in my case, sit down. I refused to move.'
"Mrs. Parks' actions awakened a country blind to its own injustice and oppression. She taught this nation the importance of dignity, freedom and equality. With this single act of civil disobedience rooted in her unwavering faith in God, Mrs. Parks shook the consciousness of this nation, galvanized the civil rights movement, and inspired one of our nation's most profound prophets, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Through her life, Mrs. Parks taught us righteousness and justice. Righteousness - the knowledge of right from wrongof good from evil; and justice - its application in our society. She saw the inherent evil in segregation and she had the courage to fight it in its common placeon a bus.
