Issue Position: Agriculture, Energy & Environment
The issues affecting agriculture, energy, and environment policy are of particular importance to Kansas. As one of the top 5 agriculture exporting states in the nation, the Kansas economy is directly connected to the agriculture industry. Kansas also has oil and gas reserves which make it an important part of our nation's energy policy. In the production of petroleum and biofuels, as well as power production through solar, wind, and nuclear facilities, the State has much to offer. Environmental integrity is also an important asset that Kansas enjoys. Clean air and water are a necessity - both for the public at large, and the agricultural production in the State. Water quality concerns in the State have become increasingly important. I constantly look for ways to promote the mutual benefit of cleaner energy and a better environment - through agricultural production and innovation, as well as conservation techniques.
