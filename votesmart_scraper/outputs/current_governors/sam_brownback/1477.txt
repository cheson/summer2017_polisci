TAIWAN-UNITED STATES AGRICULTURAL AGREEMENT -- (Senate - September 14, 2005)
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, every 2 years or so, an agricultural buying mission from Taiwan visits the United States, to sign letters of intent and contracts to buy billions of dollars worth of U.S. wheat, corn, soybeans and hides. As you can well imagine, this practice has helped to guaranty an income to farmers across the country, and helped to create jobs in communities throughout this Nation.
Between 1978 and 1993, Taiwan dispatched 18 of these missions to this country. Taiwan has an active ``buy American'' program, which has helped to shrink our trade deficit over the years. Hopefully, this robust trading relationship between Taiwan and the United States will continue for years to come. I know for a fact that our farmers and exporters, especially from my home State of Kansas, deeply appreciate Taiwan's business.
Our friends in Taiwan have helped this country in other ways as well. Whether it is full cooperation in the global war on terror, significant monetary contributions to the Twin Towers Fund, or their recent generous pledge of $2,000,000 in aid for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, we can always count on Taiwan to be there when we need them.
Mr. President, I rise today to thank our friends in Taiwan as they once again demonstrate their good will towards the United States through the visit of this agricultural buying mission to my State, as well as those of many of my colleagues.
