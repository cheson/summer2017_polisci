Governor Signs Order Establishing Citizens' Regulatory Review Board
Press Release
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Feb. 9, 2011
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed an Executive Order today establishing the Citizens' Regulatory Review Board (CRRB) to review new rules and regulations proposed by state agencies and then provide him feedback on any concerns raised by its board's review.
The Governor assigned oversight of the board to the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board (CURB).
"Rules and regulations are meant to protect our citizens, not unnecessarily intrude in their lives and negatively impact their businesses. The CRRB will play a critical role in making sure state government doesn't overstep its bounds while ensuring public safety," Gov. Brownback said.
Brownback thanked CURB for its willingness to expand the agency's role as a watchdog for Kansans.
"CURB has a strong history of making sure the interests of residential and small commercial utility ratepayers in Kansas are not overlooked. This new assignment is a natural fit for its citizen board members," Brownback said.
The Kansas Department of Administration will use existing resources to provide CURB with the support necessary to successfully carry out its new duties and responsibilities.
