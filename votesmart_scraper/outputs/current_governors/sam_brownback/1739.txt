WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today made the following statement in response to a Washington Post report that "NASA's decision to launch a fresh two-man crew to the International Space Station last weekend came over the strenuous objections of mid-level scientists and physicians who warned that deteriorating medical equipment and air and water monitoring devices aboard the orbiting laboratory posed increasing safety risks for the crew."
"I have become more and more concerned that the decision-making process at NASA has not changed sufficiently since the Columbia disaster," Brownback said. "It is my hope that safety issues regarding the International Space Station will be taken seriously by NASA and will play a significant role in the long-term decisions NASA makes.
"These reports draw our attention to the safety aboard the Space Station. Safety is job one even though space travel is an inherently dangerous operation. I will chair a hearing next Wednesday, October 29th in the Senate Subcommittee for Space, Science and Technology that will examine the International Space Station and the role it plays in building a sustainable vision for NASA and future space exploration. We will also look critically into the safety concerns surrounding the Station and the astronauts on board," Brownback said.
