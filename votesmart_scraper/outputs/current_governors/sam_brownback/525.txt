U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today called on the Obama Administration to take immediate action in response to North Korea's deadly attack on a South Korean warship.

"I have contacted Administration officials to express my conviction that the United States must take strong and unambiguous actions following North Korea's destruction of a South Korean warship," said Brownback. "In addition to reinstituting old sanctions, the U.S. must employ as many new tools as possible to isolate the North Korean regime and support our ally, South Korea."

The South Korean government yesterday issued a formal report about the attack on The Cheonan, a South Korean warship. The Cheonan in late March was torpedoed; the resulting explosion killed 46 sailors. The South Korean government had been investigating the incident and yesterday's report included evidence implicating North Korea in the attack.

Brownback continued, "The unprovoked destruction of The Cheonan warship is not an act of a confident and stable government. North Korea's increasingly brazen external behavior should be interpreted as an indication of a regime that is growing progressively more unstable at home. While dealing with the implications of this incident, South Korea, China and the United States should prepare for greater instability inside North Korea and consider the implications of a collapse of the North Korean government."
