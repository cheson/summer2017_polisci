NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006--CONFERENCE REPORT -- (Senate - December 21, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. If I might interrupt, I would like to add that I share the understanding of my colleagues from Arizona and South Carolina. I supported the McCain amendments--I think that it is important to ensure that detainees are treated humanely. But I would not support allowing those detainees to file lawsuits against our armed forces, and I wasn't aware that anyone had even suggested that the McCain amendments allow detainees to file Bivens-type actions.
