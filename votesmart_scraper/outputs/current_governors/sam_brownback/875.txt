Brownback Comments on Court Decision Overturning FCC Fines of CBS
Says indecent broadcasters should face appropriate penalty
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on the decision of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals overturning the Federal Communications Commission's issuance of fines after the incident of indecency during the Super Bowl X-X-XVIII halftime show featuring Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake.
"I am disappointed that this panel of federal judges apparently does not take seriously the viewpoint of many Americans," said Brownback. "These judges failed to acknowledge that Janet Jackson's so-called 'wardrobe malfunction' was distasteful and shocking for viewers, but based on all the calls and letters my office received in the days following the Super Bowl, I disagree."
Brownback authored the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which increased by a factor of ten fines for broadcasting obscene, indecent, or profane material. The Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act was signed into law in June 2006.
Brownback continued, "Radio and television waves are public property, and it is a privilege for broadcasters to use those public airwaves. We ask that broadcasters keep their content free from indecent, obscene, and profane speech during hours when children are likely to be watching. Broadcasters who do not abide by such guidelines should be held accountable and should face suitable fines."
