Brownback Advances Pro-Life Agenda with Ultrasound Bill
Bill would require ultrasound for women seeking an abortion
DES MOINES - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, Republican candidate for president, today advanced the pro-life agenda by introducing a Senate bill that would require doctors to perform an ultrasound and share the results with women before performing an abortion.
"We can reduce the number of abortions and help people reflect on the humanity of the unborn child by providing more information to women," said Senator Brownback.
The bill places the requirements on the doctor, not the woman, and is officially known as the Ultrasound Informed Consent Act. A doctor would be required to share the ultrasound results with the woman but the woman would not be required to view the images.
State legislatures in several states, including South Carolina and Texas, have pursued similar bills.
