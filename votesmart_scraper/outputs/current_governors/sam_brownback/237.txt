Statement on the Selection Process for Applicants for the Kansas Court of Appeals
Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: July 11, 2013
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback released the following statement concerning the selection process for the current Kansas Court of Appeals vacancy.
"I have given serious consideration to the subject of the selection process for the current vacancy on the Kansas Court of Appeals, and in particular releasing the names of individuals applying for the Court of Appeals. It is important that we have the strongest possible pool of qualified applicants to serve our citizens."
"In checking with those who have already expressed interest in applying, there is a strong preference for confidentiality which we will respect."
"It is clear that disclosing the names of potential nominees would hurt applicant pools for future selections and this is why the American Bar Association recommends this method of selection and why the Federal judicial selection process follows this same path."
The application period opened on July 1. All interested individuals must complete the required application package by July 31. The Governor has 60 days from the opening of the application period on July 1 through Aug. 29 to make an appointment, providing time for careful review and consideration of potential nominees.
