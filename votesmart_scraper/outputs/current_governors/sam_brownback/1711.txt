WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee on BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease.
"We must press to reopen our foreign markets for beef as aggressively as we can. We have completed a number of actions here in the U.S. to ensure our beef supply is healthy, safe and good. I ask those working on this issue and those testifying at this hearing to get the international markets back open as soon as possible.
"I recently went to Japan to speak with agriculture officials and last week hosted Japanese officials in Kansas at beef producing and packing operations. I impressed upon them the importance of the beef trade and how the American beef industry is stepping up aggressively to address their concerns.
"We must work with the Japanese and other foreign markets to address the issues they're putting forward. We worked very hard to open these markets initially ten years ago, and now we must re-open these markets before they are taken over by our competitors."
