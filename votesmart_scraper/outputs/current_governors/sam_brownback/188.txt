Kansas Governor Sam Brownback today vetoed Senate Bill 99 to promote continued transparency in government.
"While I understand the purpose and intent behind S.B. 99, I believe that retaining the lobbyist registration provisions in current law promotes transparency and openness," said Governor Brownback. "Although the amounts involved may seem small, there is no harm in continuing to require lobbyist registration at the lower level of reportable lobbying expenditures contained in the existing statute."
The Governor also signed 16 other bills into law on Thursday, bringing the total number of bills signed during the 2014 Legislative session to 40.
