U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the announcement that the Chinese government is to allow for more flexible exchange rates on the yuan.

"This is a positive step by China that ultimately will help Kansas manufacturers and farmers export more and import less, but it's still not nearly enough," said Brownback. "I have joined several of my colleagues to press the Chinese to allow their currency to float or face U.S. trade sanctions. I continue to hold this position; otherwise, China will not follow through or will do too little."
