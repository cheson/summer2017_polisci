Brownback Voices Support for Israel
Says captured soldier should be freed, Israel has right to defend itself
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today voiced his support for the State of Israel and expressed his desire to see Corporal Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier recently captured by Palestinian militants, freed from captivity.
"Israel has the right to defend itself and aggressively seek the return of Corporal Shalit," said Brownback. "As a beachhead of democracy and freedom in the Middle East, Israel needs the firm support of the American people. I am proud to stand by Israel, and my prayers are with Corporal Shalit and his family."
The Israeli government has called for the unconditional release of the soldier and has increased military operations in Gaza in response to his capture last Sunday.
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Judiciary Committee.
