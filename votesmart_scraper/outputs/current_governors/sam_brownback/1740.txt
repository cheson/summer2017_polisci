VOTE ON CLASS ACTION REFORM
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will speak briefly about this issue as well. I think as we bring this up, it is important, if we can, to move this forward and get it resolved. One of the things we need to be constantly focusing on is what can we do to grow jobs and create jobs.
We have been pressing forward. The Federal Reserve has been pressing forward, keeping interest rates low. We have been pressing forward in cutting taxes to try to stimulate. The early medicine seems to be working. We are starting to get some economic growth. We are starting to get some job creation taking place.
Another clear area of importance and need is this area of litigation reform. This is sapping a great deal of strength out of the economy and sapping strength from job creation. This is one of the areas we need to reform. I think there are ways that we can do this and still protect the rights of the individual, rights of those who are harmed in the system, but we are going to have to start to address this problem if we are going to be serious about job creation in the country and serious about what all we can do as a legislative body in creating an atmosphere and situation in the United States that can be the most growth oriented, and in a way that still protects all the rights of individuals in this country.
Those are the efforts that are taking place. That is what we are trying to do with this.
