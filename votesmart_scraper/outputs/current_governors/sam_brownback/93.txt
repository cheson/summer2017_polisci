Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement in response to the United States Army announcement of force strength reductions at Ft. Riley and Ft. Leavenworth:
"The U.S. Army today confirmed what Kansans already know: Ft. Riley and Ft. Leavenworth will continue to play a critical role in the training and development of our troops. Installation leadership, community support, and service members have worked tirelessly to ensure that both forts remain essential components of the Army.
"As expected, the Army is being forced to make difficult decisions due to federal budgetary constraints and today announced that Ft. Riley will face reductions of 615 active duty soldiers and Ft. Leavenworth reductions of 60 active duty soldiers.
"Although no cuts would be preferable, many other installations fared significantly worse. The limited reductions to the Kansas Army installations are a credit to the remarkable commitment of local communities and those serving on our Kansas installations.
"While today is an important step for Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth's communities as well as the state, we must remain vigilant in our support during this time of budget uncertainty. If sequestration is not corrected, the Army will be forced to make further substantial cuts, which could negatively affect Army bases in Kansas.
"Through my Governor's Military Council, I will continue to work with our Congressional Delegation and local communities to support our bases, installation leadership and the brave men and women along with their families stationed at Ft. Riley and Ft. Leavenworth."
