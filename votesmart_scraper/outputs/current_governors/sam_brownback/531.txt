Brownback Comments on Court Ruling Calling National Day of Prayer Unconstitutional
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on the District Court decision that the National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional.
"Today's court ruling is very disappointing, but I am hopeful that this decision will be overturned in the appeals process," said Brownback. "I fail to see how the National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional: the religious freedom amendment to the Constitution stipulates only that the government will not establish a state church nor will it impede an individual's right to observe his or her own religion."
The Western District Court of Wisconsin ruled the National Day of Prayer unconstitutional. The case now moves to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Brownback continued, "The ruling against the National Day of Prayer is the epitome of judicial activism, and reminds us that the Senate must seriously review the next Supreme Court nominee's record and standard for justice. Our judicial branch does not need an activist on the Supreme Court who values his or her own personal preferences above the United States Constitution."
Throughout American history, presidents have issued 164 proclamations for prayer. President James Madison, the author of the First Amendment and the Establishment Clause, issued four proclamations for prayer during his presidency.
