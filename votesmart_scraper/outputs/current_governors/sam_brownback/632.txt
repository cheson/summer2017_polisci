U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the health care bill sponsored by Senator Baucus (D-MT) that passed Senate Finance Committee today.
"I have very serious concerns about the bill that passed out of committee today," Brownback stated. "Health care reform is a critical issue today, and I support targeted incremental reforms. The president's initial goal was to lower health care costs. This hugely expensive bill will not lower costs and will not cover all uninsured. There is an outcry from my constituents in Kansas against this trillion dollar bill that amounts to a government takeover of health care and will take money from Medicare to do it while leaving 25 million people uninsured. I will be aggressively involved in this debate when it comes to the floor."
Brownback has previously proposed several ideas to lower health care costs and improve access to health care:
 Tort reform will help bring down costs for all patients. While patients should maintain a basic right to pursue legal action when medical malpractice occurs, there should be some limitations on pain and suffering damages. Doctors practicing defensive medicine to avoid lawsuits results in billions of dollars in unnecessary tests, referrals, and prescriptions. Malpractice insurance costs have skyrocketed, and those costs are passed on to patients in the form of more expensive care.
 Level the playing field for the self-employed and others who purchase their own plans. Currently, only employer-based benefits are exempt from personal income taxes. Allowing everyone the ability to purchase health insurance with pre-tax dollars will make insurance more affordable for millions of people. Additionally, this would put more power in the hands of the individual to choose his or her own coverage. Even those who have employer-based coverage could then shop around for a better deal, and still receive the same tax benefits they currently receive with their employer-based coverage.
 Allow consumers to purchase insurance across state lines to give them greater choice and the flexibility to choose a plan that best suits their specific needs and budget.
 Price transparency will give consumers the ability to know the costs of their care before they get the bill. This will allow them to shop around for the best prices for certain procedures.
 Tax-free health savings accounts put control back in the hands of patients to decide how best to spend their health care dollars.
 Fully refundable tax credits for health insurance premiums would provide support for those who are unable to afford insurance.
 Make it easier for those with pre-existing conditions to obtain insurance coverage through multi-state risk sharing pools.
