Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement in response to proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations on energy producers:
"A recent study conducted by the Kansas Corporation Commission has shown that Kansas homeowners, schools, and businesses are already paying an extra $227 million a year to pay for President Obama's over-regulation of energy producers, an increase of 9.4% since 2007.
"Today's news that the EPA will be imposing even more expensive regulations on Kansas utilities, and doing so without approval from Congress, is very troubling as it further disrupts the balance that must be achieved between protecting the environment and growing the economy.
"Furthermore, these regulations will continue to raise the cost of living for every Kansan, making the burden on those who are already struggling to pay their bills each month unnecessarily more difficult. Kansas has been working hard to do its part to protect the environment by supporting clean coal technologies at the new plant in Holcomb, as well as diversifying our energy portfolio with wind and natural gas.
"This is more of the Obama Administration's war against middle AmericaÂ…more cost and more regulation. We need Kansas solutions for Kansans."
