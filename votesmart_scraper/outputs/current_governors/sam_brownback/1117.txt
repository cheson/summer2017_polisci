Brownback Campaign Announces Homeschool Coalition
Parents praise Brownback's longstanding support for home educators
The Brownback for President campaign today announced the Homeschoolers for Brownback Coalition. Iowa home educators Mark and Marie Scherbaum of Marion will chair the coalition.
"Sam Brownback understands the unique role that parents play in the lives of their children and he believes that parents should have the freedom to homeschool their children," said Marie, a mother of five and member of the Marion Home School Assistance Program. "For years, Senator Brownback has been a consistent advocate of parent's rights and expanded access to educational opportunities for home educators, and there is no better champion than Sam Brownback for the fundamental family values we cherish so dearly."
"I appreciate the support of Mark and Marie Scherbaum and their leadership of the Homeschoolers for Brownback Coalition," said Brownback. "I will continue to stand up for the rights, values and opportunities of homeschooling families."
In recent weeks Senator Brownback has announced Iowa Catholics for Brownback and his Iowa Faith and Family Leadership Committee.
