Brownback Comments on 60th Anniversary of Israeli Independence
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated the Israeli people on the 60th anniversary of the independence of the State of Israel.
"Six decades ago, the Jewish people realized a 2,000 year old dream by regaining the right to live freely and independently in their ancient homeland," Brownback said. "In the years since independence, the State of Israel has achieved more than many thought possible, succeeded where others have failed, and advanced beyond anyone's imagination. The global community benefits from Israel's commitment to democratic freedom in the face of constant, existential threats. May the next 60 years bring only peace, happiness, and success to the citizens of Israel."
