Governor Sam Brownback today spoke with Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert O. Work opposing any attempt by the Obama Administration to transfer Guantanamo prisoners to Kansas.
"The idea of sending these terrorists, who hate America, to the Heartland of our nation is simply wrong," said Governor Brownback. "My priority is the safety of our citizens and communities and I will continue to fight against the transfer of any GITMO detainees to Kansas."
Senator Steve Fitzgerald (R), of Leavenworth, understands the communities in and around the correctional facilities in Leavenworth would be most affected by any transfer of GITMO detainees to the state, adding his strong opposition to any transfer of detainees.
"The transfer to Leavenworth would be against the wishes of the people and leaders of this community," Fitzgerald said. "Putting these prisoners in our community would be an abdication of the President's responsibility to defend American citizens and an invitation for such attacks in the vicinity of the prison. Those of us elected to represent the interests of the people of Kansas must do everything in our power to ensure this does not happen."
Governor Brownback blocked a similar plan to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees to Kansas in 2009 along with his Congressional colleagues.
