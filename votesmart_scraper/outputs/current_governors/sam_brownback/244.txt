Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: May 23, 2013
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement Thursday evening in response the Kansas Senate's approval of House Bill 2084.
"My administration is focused intensely on pro-growth reform, with a guiding philosophy that tax relief will increase private sector jobs and personal income for Kansas families and businesses. The tax proposal passed by the Kansas Senate Thursday night lowers the tax burden on all Kansans. I appreciate the work by the Kansas Legislature this session and will sign this pro-growth tax bill should lawmakers vote to send it to me."
