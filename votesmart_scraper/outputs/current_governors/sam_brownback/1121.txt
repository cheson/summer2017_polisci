Brownback Plan Would Revitalize Rural America
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, Republican candidate for President, today outlined his plan to revitalize rural America through a variety of tax credits and economic incentives that would encourage businesses and individuals to establish roots in the Heartland.
"Growing up on a farm in Parker, Kansas, I learned firsthand the importance of rural, Midwestern values," said Brownback. "Today, many rural communities struggle as their economies shrink, population declines and public and private investment slows to a trickle. Restoring the economic viability of the Heartland is vital to America's economic and cultural future."
Brownback's plan, introduced earlier this year in the Senate with several colleagues as the New Homestead Act, could benefit nearly 4 million households and would encourage homeownership and relocation to rural areas by offering several incentives to individuals and families:
* Repay up to 50 percent of college loan debt for recent graduates who live and work in rural areas for at least five years;
* Offer a tax credit for home buyers worth either $5,000 or 10 percent of the purchase price, whichever is lower, provided they live in the rural area for five years;
* Protect home values by creating a federal tax deduction for decreases in home values; and
* Establish Homestead Accounts to help individuals build savings and improve credit access.
Brownback's plan would also establish Rural Investment Tax Credits, which would draw new investment to counties with high levels of outmigration, and Small Business Tax Credits, which would help small businesses in high outmigration counties. Businesses could use accelerated depreciation rates for equipment purchases tied to these tax credits.
