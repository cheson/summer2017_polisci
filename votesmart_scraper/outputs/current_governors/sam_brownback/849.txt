Brownback Comments on Highway Trust Fund Shortfall
Calls for Senate action on deficit neutral solution
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the importance of immediately addressing the budget shortfall facing the Highway Trust Fund, a government account used to pay for federal transportation projects.
"I urge Senate leadership to immediately restore money to the Highway Trust Fund," said Brownback. "Projections indicate the HTF may be completely depleted as soon as by the end of this week. It would be irresponsible and unsafe for the Senate to delay ensuring adequate funding for the nation's transportation infrastructure."
Transportation Secretary Mary Peters recently announced that the HTF will likely run out of money by the end of this month. Fuel tax receipts, the primary source of revenue for the highway program, have been lower than expected. In addition to high spending during the peak of the highway construction season, the reduced receipts have caused the balance to decline by nearly $4 billion during the summer months. A shortfall in the HTF will lead to delays in payments to states for transportation projects the federal government has already agreed to help fund.
Brownback continued, "The solution is simple: restore money from the General Fund to the Highway Transportation Fund. This solution is deficit neutral because it would simply restore money to the account for which it was originally raised. Without this fix, a good portion of Kansas transportation projects, which improve the safety and quality of roads, will be postponed until further funding is available. This is an unacceptable option for commuters and transportation employees."
