Picture of a Border Patrol officer's badgesThe terrorist attacks of September 11th unsettled the public's confidence in our nation's security and raised concerns about whether our institutions are up to the task of intercepting and thwarting would-be terrorists. Given that the persons responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon came from abroad, our citizens understandably asked how these people entered the United States and what could be done to prevent their kind from doing so again. Clearly, our immigration laws and policies are instrumental to the war on terrorism. The Department of Homeland Security has made progress in securing our borders. While the battle may be waged on several fronts, for the man or woman on the street, immigration is in many ways the front line of our defense.
