Brownback Applauds Kansas National Guard for New Research and Development Activities
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced the transfer of three CQ-10A SnowGoose unmanned aerial vehicles from U.S. Special Operations Command to the Kansas Adjutant General's Department.
"I am pleased that the Kansas Adjutant General's Department has received these aircraft," said Brownback. "With this newly acquired federal surplus equipment, the Guard will be able to explore the use of UAV technology for homeland security and disaster response missions. I applaud the Guard, Kansas State University and the University of Kansas for their leadership and cooperation on this important project."
The Department of Defense's Special Operations Command is upgrading its fleet of UAVs and designated its CQ-10As as surplus items. Brownback worked with Kansas Adjutant General Tod Bunting to bring three of the UAV systems to Kansas.
"Getting these UAVs is a great deal for Kansas and the American taxpayer," said Bunting. "We're more than excited about working with our state partners to develop some new and much needed disaster response capabilities."
Research will be conducted as part of a cooperative effort between Kansas State University, the University of Kansas and the Kansas National Guard.
