BROWNBACK DISAPPOINTED BY NOMINATION OF CHRIS HILL TO SERVE AS AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the nomination of Assistant Secretary Chris Hill to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Iraq.
"I am deeply concerned about the possibility of Assistant Secretary Hill serving in the crucial post of Ambassador to Iraq," Brownback said. "While I commend Mr. Hill for his long and dedicated career in the Foreign Service, I believe that his lack of any Middle East experience, and his evasive and unprofessional dealings with Congress, make him a poor choice for leading our largest, and most important embassy in the world at a pivotal time for American diplomacy in Iraq. I urge the President to reconsider this nomination."
The White House today announced in a press release several nominations, including that of Chris Hill.
