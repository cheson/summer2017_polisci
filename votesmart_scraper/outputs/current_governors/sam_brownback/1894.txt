Issue Position: Culture of Life
Life is beautiful. A culture of life embodies the beauty of every human life from the moment of conception forward. Promoting and defending a culture of life is critical for our nation's social and economic health. A culture of life informs and impacts all reaches of society, though the degree of its impact is perhaps most realized through our national position on issues like abortion, bioethics, eugenics, euthanasia, and stem cell research. In particular, as individuals and as a culture we are currently facing great challenges in the field of bioethics. These challenges are forcing us to discuss the meaning of human life, as well as what it means to be a member of the human race. How we respond to these challenges will impact the entire future of humanity
