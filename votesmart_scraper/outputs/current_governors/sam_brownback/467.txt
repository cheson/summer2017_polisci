Press Release
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Feb. 4, 2011
Location: Topeka, KS

Governor Sam Brownback today signed an Executive Reorganization Order which would abolish Kansas, Inc. Kansas, Inc. is one of many economic development agencies within state government. The Kansas Department of Administration will become the holder of records for Kansas, Inc.
"Kansas has too many economic development agencies and programs, many of which focus on picking winners and losers instead of creating an environment for growth. As we retool for the 21st century economy, I'm looking to consolidate various functions and to make them more accountable to voters for their success or failure," Governor Brownback said.
The order will take effect on July 1st, 2011 if the Kansas Legislature does not reject it.
