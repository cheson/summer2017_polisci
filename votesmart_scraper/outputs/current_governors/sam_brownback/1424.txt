RETIREMENT OF DALLAS L. HAYDEN -- (Senate - February 09, 2006)
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on December 24, 2005, Dallas L. Hayden, a native son of Kansas retired from Federal service with 26 years with the Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General. Mr. Hayden retired as the Special Agent-in-Charge of the Great Plains Region of which Kansas is included.
Mr. Hayden exemplified all that a Federal law enforcement agent should: integrity, loyalty, and above all, the belief that the laws of the land are paramount. Politics never played a part in any investigation under his control. Only the facts mattered.
I want to publicly commend Mr. Hayden for his service and wish only the best for him and his family in the years to come.
