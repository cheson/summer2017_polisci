Governor Brownback Requests SBA Disaster Declaration
Press Release

Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback has requested a Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster declaration for Sedgwick County and adjacent counties for damages suffered from the EF-3 tornado and severe storms that impacted the area last Saturday and Sunday.
"If approved by the SBA, a disaster declaration would make low-interest, long-term loans available to homeowners, renters and businesses. This would be one way to help Kansans affected by the storms get on the path to rebuilding their lives," Gov. Brownback said.
To qualify for the SBA disaster declaration, the state of Kansas must show at least 25 homes or businesses suffered major damage with 40-percent in uninsured losses. Adjacent counties included in the request are Sumner, Butler, Harvey, Reno and Kingman counties.
The Governor issued a state declaration of disaster emergency for 39 counties early Sunday morning to activate the disaster response and recovery portions of the Kansas Response Plan, authorizing state resources to expedite emergency assistance statewide.
"We are working with all 39 counties impacted by last weekend's storms to finalize damage totals and determine if the state qualifies for any additional assistance," said Maj. Gen. (KS) Lee Tafanelli, adjutant general and director of Kansas Division of Emergency Management. "We will have a much better picture in a few weeks based on the information we receive from the damage assessments."
SBA's disaster loans are the primary form of federal assistance for the repair and rebuilding of non-farm, private sector disaster losses. For this reason, the disaster loan program is the only form of SBA assistance not limited to small businesses.
