Location: Harper, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback and Commerce Sec. Pat George joined representatives from BP Wind Energy and Sempra U.S. Gas & Power this afternoon at their Flat Ridge 2 wind farm in Harper County to mark the launch of the project's construction.
"The development of the Flat Ridge 2 Wind Farm is an important component to achieving balance in our country's energy production and revitalizing rural Kansas," Gov. Brownback said. "Our state has a rich abundance of this home-grown, renewable energy and we are happy to add it to our list of Kansas export commodities alongside oil and natural gas, beef and wheat."
Located on a 66,000-acre site about 40 miles southwest of Wichita, the wind farm represents a combined investment of more than $800 million and will have the capacity to produce 419 MW of electricity. The electricity produced will be sold under long-term power purchase agreements with Associated Electric Cooperative and Southwestern Electric Power Company, a unit of American Electric Power.
"It's been a year since I met with BP leaders about bringing this project to south central Kansas. On behalf of our great state, I congratulate BP and Sempra U.S. Gas and Power for their innovative thinking and planning in moving this project into full construction," Brownback said.
The Flat Ridge 2 project will create some 500 jobs during construction and roughly 30 permanent jobs once the wind farm begins commercial operation. Upon completion, it will be the largest wind project in Kansas
