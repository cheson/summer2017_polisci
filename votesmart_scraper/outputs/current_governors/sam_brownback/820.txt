WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Pat Roberts and U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today said the following regarding media reporting that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will indicate Manhattan, Kansas and Kansas State University is its top choice to be the new home of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF):
Senator Roberts said, "I remain optimistic regarding media reporting that DHS has selected the site with the proven merits - Kansas and Kansas State University. I have been working to establish Kansas as a leader in agriculture, animal health, and biosecurity since 2001. We are the best location for the NBAF."
Senator Brownback said, "If NBAF comes to Kansas, it is estimated that over a twenty year period, the facility would have a significant impact on the state's economy. I have worked diligently on behalf of Kansas' proposal at the federal level and am hopeful that Kansas will be NBAF's new home state."
Kansas put forth an aggressive cost share proposal that will allow the Department of Homeland Security to accelerate research to protect the American food supply and agriculture economy.
Kansas and Kansas State University offer internationally recognized animal health research expertise; strong research infrastructure; and an unmatched concentration of animal health companies.
