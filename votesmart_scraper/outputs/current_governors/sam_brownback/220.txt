Today the Kanas Corporation Commission approved a $3 per customer rate increase for Westar Energy customers due to increased costs from EPA regulations.
Westar's application requested a $31.7 million revenue increase. The increase is due to the actual capital improvement costs Westar incurred while meeting EPA regulations at its La Cygne power plant.
"Kansans are now feeling increased energy costs due to expensive regulations handed down by the Environmental Protection Agency," said Governor Sam Brownback. "Kansas homeowners, businesses, and schools are hurting to pay for the decisions being made in Washington, D.C."
