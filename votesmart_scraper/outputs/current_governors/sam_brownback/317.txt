Gov. Brownback Decides Not to Intervene in Redistricting Lawsuit

Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback released the following statement today regarding his decision not to intervene in the redistricting lawsuit filed in federal court.
"This is a very important case for Kansas. After seriously considering it, I made the decision not to intervene. The drawing of maps is primarily a legislative function. Throughout this process, I never submitted a map to the legislature, nor have I indicated a preference for any specific map. Consistent with this, I determined it would not be appropriate to join the case as a party and make arguments in support of a specific map.
"What I have maintained all along is that in the interests of all Kansans the new maps should contain districts that come as close as possible to the ideal district size and that all communities of interest should be represented. I communicated to the legislature that these would be the criteria by which any map would earn either my approval or my veto. These criteria are also consistent with the requirements of the Constitution of the United States and federal court precedent.
"I hope and trust that this panel of distinguished jurists will fairly and efficiently apply these criteria regardless of the parties before them. To that end, I may still have involvement in this case, not as a party, but as a friend of the court."
