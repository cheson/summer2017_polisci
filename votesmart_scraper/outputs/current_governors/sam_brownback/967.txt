Brownback Shocked at Air Force Decision
Calls on the Secretary of Defense to explain
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today released the following statement following the Air Force's initial decision to award the air refueling contract to a foreign company.
"I'm shocked at this decision and very disappointed," Brownback stated. "I'll be calling upon the Secretary of Defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by Boeing. I also expect Congress will take a very long look at the selection process and criteria. I hope the decision will be reversed.
"It's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to Europe instead of building them in America."
