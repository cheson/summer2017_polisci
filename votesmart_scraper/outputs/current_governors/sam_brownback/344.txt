Press Release
By: Sam Brownback
Date: April 9, 2012
Location: New York, NY

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback joined tax policy experts and elected leaders from across the country today for the "Tax Policies for 4% Growth Conference" hosted by the George W. Bush Presidential Center in New York City. The conference examined tax policies that encourage stronger and faster U.S. economic growth.
As part of the "Blitz Solutions" session in the afternoon, the Governor spoke about his pro-growth tax plan that is best described as a flat tax with a small business accelerator.
"Now is the time to propose bold public policy solutions," Governor Brownback told about 300 people attending the conference. "Americans are scared for the future of our country. They are willing to engage in the discussion - and are asking, where is the plan?"
Brownback also emphasized the importance of small businesses in the Kansas and country's economies.
"I believe we must focus on the just cause of pro-growth tax reform -- jobs and a brighter future for our children. In Kansas, we are one step closer to hitting the accelerator on our state's emerging economy," Brownback said.
The conference is part of The 4% Growth Project launched by the Bush Institute in 2011. Among the others who took part in the conference included President George W. Bush and Governors Chris Christie (NJ), Mary Fallin (OK), Bill Haslam (TN), and Paul LePage (ME) as well as numerous business leaders, journalists and economists.
While in New York, the governor and Kansas Commerce Secretary Pat George also met with several Fortune 500 businesses interested in doing business in Kansas.
