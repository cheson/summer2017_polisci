HONORING MISS DAISY ROSE BECK
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Miss Daisy Rose Beck who passed away on September 7, 2002, after losing a hard fought battle with leukemia. She retired from the U.S. Federal Service in 1995 after serving America for 54 consecutive years. She holds the record for length of employment as a female GS-level employee.
From the early 1960s through 1995, her duties included personal secretary for the four-star U.S. army generals who pulled tours of duty in the Republic of Korea, commanding the United Nations Command, ROK/U.S. Combined Forces Command, U.S. Forces Korea and the 8th U.S. Army. In addition, she was one of the workers at the German War Crimes Trial at Nuremberg.
Daisy Rose Beck was very quiet, friendly, efficient, respectful, and very much loved by all who met her. Daisy served for decades in places where most Americans only served a single year. She is a true American, hard working, efficient, intelligent, courteous, kind, and yet focused and dedicated to the success of a mission.
These days we face harsh enemies around the globe. We Americans have a proud tradition of doing what is right with fairness, kindness, and courage. Daisy Beck epitomizes these qualities. She is a wonderful, positive role model for all Americans in times of adversity.
