Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement in response to a lawsuit filed attempting to list the Lesser Prairie Chicken as an "endangered' species.
"It is not surprising that these extremist environmental organizations would file a lawsuit in Washington, D.C. that effectively attempts to shut down the energy and agriculture economies of western Kansas.
"Their previous litigation is what caused the threatened listing of the Lesser Prairie Chicken in the first place. But it appears they are not satisfied with the multi-million dollar costs already imposed on Kansans -- what they really seek is a level of economic devastation that would do nothing to enhance the species or its habitat.
"It is the Governor's job to protect the rights of Kansans and that is what I am doing. We will oppose this position and move forward with our own initiatives to reverse the unwarranted federal action."
