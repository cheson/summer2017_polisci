MR. CAVUTO: Well, first the sanctions, now the refugees. My next guest says the United States should step up and cover the cost of North Korean refugees likely to bolt there and come here. With us now is Republican Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas.
Senator, in an age where people are worried about illegal immigration and other things, that's a pretty bold offer to make. Why do you make it?
SEN. BROWNBACK: Well, I think it's one of the most elegant ways that we have of dealing with North Korea now. I mean, you've heard of the limitation of options that we really have in dealing with North Korea. They are developing, and now we know for sure they tested, a nuclear weapon. It was small, but it could clearly be a dirty bomb anywhere. And they -- and they have shown a propensity in the past to market these weapons once they develop them.
What if we said, similar to what we did when the Soviet Union was falling, that as North Koreans walk out into China, that third countries will take them -- South Korea, the United States, possibly Australia, other countries around the world? I think it would really, really be a key blow to that regime in North Korea.
MR. CAVUTO: What would the Chinese say?
SEN. BROWNBACK: Well, they're the key. They are the key. But all they have to do is live up to their international obligations. They have already signed the U.N. High Commissioner's refugee document that they're a part of that says when a refugee comes to their country they won't be sent back to harm's way, which they are when they're sent back to North Korea. So all China has to do is oblige by their international obligations -- which, to date, Neil, they have not been willing to do.
