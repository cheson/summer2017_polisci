Brownback Introduces CRP Tax Fairness Bill

WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today introduced the Conservation Reserve Program Tax Fairness Act of 2003. The bipartisan bill is cosponsored by Sens. Roberts, Dorgan, Grassley, Daschle, Baucus, Burns, Bond, Allard, Hagel, DeWine, Craig, Levin, Leahy, Conrad, Harkin, and Jeffords.
"Being a farmer today is not easy," Brownback said. "You really need to be an optimist - about the weather, about farm prices, about the rapidly changing economy. But the one thing farmers should not have to worry about is being additionally taxed for participating in a conservation program.
"The Conservation Reserve Program Tax Fairness Act of 2003 would simply correct the tax treatment of one of our nation's most valuable conservation programs so that there is not a disincentive for farmers to be good stewards of the land.
"This bill has the support of many here in the Senate across both sides of the aisle because it is common sense. In a time when conservation efforts are more important than ever, we should be doing everything possible to make these efforts more appealing, not less. I think we can all agree that we want more conservation, not less, and therefore we need to correct this
tax interpretation," Brownback said.
