Kansas Governor Sam Brownback announced today he has appointed Kingman County Counselor Francis Meisenheimer to the 30th District Court of the State of Kansas. Meisenheimer's appointment fills a vacancy created by the retirement of Judge Robert J. Schmisseur.
"Judge Meisenheimer has demonstrated his commitment to his community and to the Kansas judicial process during his years of service, both public and private. He will continue to serve the people of Kansas well in this new role for years to come," Governor Brownback said.
Meisenheimer has served as Kingman County Counselor since 2002, as well as serving as the Municipal Judge for the City of Kingman and the Attorney for the West Kingman County School District since 1993. Meisenheimer earned a degree in Business Administration from Kansas State University and Juris Doctorate from the University of Kansas.
The state's 105 counties are organized into 31 Judicial Districts. The district courts serve as the trial courts for the state, overseeing all civil and criminal cases.
