Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement calling for a special legislative session to address threats by the Kansas Supreme Court to close Kansas schools.
"After discussion with Legislative Leadership, I have decided to call a special session to keep Kansas schools open, despite the Court's threat to close them. It is distressing that the Kansas Supreme Court has put the schools and legislature of Kansas in this position over less than 1 percent of school funding.
"I will do everything I can to keep this session focused on education. I am working to arrange the particular dates of the session, which will occur later this month."
