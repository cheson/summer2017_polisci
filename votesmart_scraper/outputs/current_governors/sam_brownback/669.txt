Brownback Applauds Passage of Energy and Water Bill
Bill to fund research equipment for Kansas University cancer center
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage of the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. The bill passed by a vote of 85-9.
"I'm pleased my colleagues recognized the importance of passing the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill," said Brownback. "In addition to investments in water infrastructure and funding various research projects in energy like advanced nuclear and clean coal technology, this bill contains $4 million in scientific research equipment to further enhance Kansas University's application for a National Institute of Health cancer center designation. I'm fully committed to KU's effort as it will lead to better treatment for cancer patients and increased economic opportunities for our state."
The bill last night passed the Senate.
