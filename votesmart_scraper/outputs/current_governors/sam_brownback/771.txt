SHAHEEN URGES RECOVERY FUNDING FOR RURAL BROADBAND INITIATIVES
Shaheen, Senate colleagues call on administration officials to fund broadband service for currently unserved rural communities
U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen today led a bipartisan effort to urge Obama administration officials to make broadband access a priority for currently unserved rural communities as they allocate funding included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. Shaheen, along with nine Senate colleagues, sent letters to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, Acting Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Copps, and Acting Secretary of Commerce Otto Wolf.
"It is widely understood that high-speed broadband is a crucial driver of economic recovery, creating jobs and enhancing our global competitiveness," said the Senators in the letters. "Without access to broadband, many rural communities will be unable to realize the benefits of economic recovery as intended in the ARRA. We urge you to make deploying broadband to unserved areas your first priority in dispensing the considerable resources accorded to broadband by Congress in the ARRA."
"There are few services as basic to the life of a business as a fast internet connection," said Mary Ann Kristiansen, Executive Director of the Hannah Grimes Center in Keene. "Competitive small business is the economic engine of this country, even more so, of our rural economy. The U.S. cannot afford to let this important economic engine idle. Senator Shaheen understands this fully and we are thankful that she has so quickly made bringing basic broadband to unserved rural areas a priority."
