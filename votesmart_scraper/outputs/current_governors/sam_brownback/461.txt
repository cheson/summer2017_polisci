Governor Brownback Announces Major Road Projects
Press Release
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Feb. 11, 2011
Location: Overland Park, KS

Governor Sam Brownback announced three major transportation projects today in Overland Park. Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer, Kansas Department of Transportation Secretary Deb Miller and Overland Park Mayor Carl Gerlach joined the Governor at the announcement.
The three projects, which are the first major expansion projects to be announced under the T-WORKS transportation program, will have an estimated economic impact of more than one billion dollars. This is the first time KDOT has used economic impact analysis in selecting major Kansas transportation projects.
The announcement of these projects is in keeping with Governor Brownback's Road Map for Kansas, which made growing the economy the administration's top priority.
"Implementing T-WORKS will provide safety enhancements, improve commute times, and make the kind of infrastructure improvements that will help spur economic growth," Brownback said. "Not only will there be an excellent return on the state's investment, these projects also are ready to begin in the spring which means we can get right to work creating jobs."
The three projects include U.S. 69 and I-435 improvements in Overland Park, a four lane expansion of K-18 near Manhattan, and another four lane expansion on U.S. 50 at Hutchinson.
