Issue Position: Tax, Budget and Government Reform
Establishing fiscal responsibility in our federal government is one of the most pressing issues that we face, and it remains one of my top priorities. I believe that hard-working Americans continue to be overtaxed, and to address this situation, we need to enact more tax relief and measures of government reform and accountability. In so doing, we help ensure that the growth of the federal government is restrained, returning more power to the people at the local level.
