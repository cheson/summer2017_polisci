Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement concerning the Obama administration's efforts to force states into expanding Medicaid by cutting off Low Income Pool funding for states that do not expand Medicaid.
"The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has indicated that Low Income Pool funding to the states will be cut off unless they expand Medicaid.
"The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the federal government is prohibited from coercing the states to expand Medicaid.
"Kansas intends to join Texas through an amicus brief supporting Florida's effort to stop the Obama administration from cutting off health care dollars for the Low Income Pool in an effort to force Obamacare upon the states. In joining with Florida and Texas, Kansas is protecting the states' right to make their own determinations about these issues."
