Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued a statement today regarding President Obama's decision to reject the Keystone XL pipeline project.
"I am deeply disappointed in President Obama's decision to reject the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. This decision turned a critically important project into a missed opportunity. In a country that is struggling to boost its economy, create private sector jobs and meet its energy needs, approval of the Keystone project should have been a no-brainer. I hope the President reconsiders his decision. Our country needs the jobs. "
