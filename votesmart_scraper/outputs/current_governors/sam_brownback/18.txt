Governor Brownback Issues Statement on Medicaid Expansion
Statement

Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement on Medicaid expansion:
"Expanding ObamaCare is bad for Kansas. It moves able-bodied adults to the front of the line, ahead of truly vulnerable Kansans. It is not affordable, costing the state upwards of $100 million in the next two years. It does little to help our Critical Access Hospitals, sending more than 70 percent of new spending to urban hospitals.
President Trump was elected having declared his intention to do away with ObamaCare, and he has already taken action to alleviate its onerous regulatory and financial burden. Kansas should not tie itself to this failed program of the past just before its inevitable demise. The rest of the nation is moving towards a new state-driven model for improved health outcomes at a price Americans can afford; Kansas is well positioned to help lead the way."
