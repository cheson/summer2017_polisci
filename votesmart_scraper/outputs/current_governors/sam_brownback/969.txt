Brownback Mourns Death of William F. Buckley
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the death of William F. Buckley.
"William Buckley was as intelligent and eloquent a spokesman for conservatism as the movement has ever known. In many ways, he is the father of modern conservatism. His graceful presence in the public discussion will be sorely missed."
William F. Buckley, Jr., founder of National Review and author of over 50 books died at his home in Connecticut today. He was 82.
Brownback continued, "Bill Buckley is the modern embodiment of Edmund Burke. He defined what it means to be a conservative. Buckley helped to create and sustain the intellectual foundation of the conservative movement for more than a half century.
"Thanks in large part to Bill Buckley, belief in free market economics, traditional values, and a strong foreign policy keeping our national interests front and center became not only mainstream opinion but a winning political movement.
"His vision of American vitality as embodied in a moral culture and a strong international presence have together proven to be the best hope for America's future."
