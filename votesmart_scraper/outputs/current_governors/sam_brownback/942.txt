ersonal effect on my own faith, and I am still moved by the outpouring of support and prayer following his death in April 2005.
"Pope John Paul II was a witness to hope and a beacon of light for people of all faiths and all walks of life. We all still value his example of gentleness and courage. John Paul II fought for every life everywhere and encouraged us to do the same. History will look fondly on the simple priest from Poland who became Bishop of Rome. Karol Wojtyla was a gift from God who advanced a culture of life and civilization of love around the world. Today, we rightly remember him as Pope John Paul the Great."
In April 2000, Brownback authored the Senate legislation awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Pope John Paul II. Brownback traveled with a congressional delegation to Rome in January 2001 to present the medal to the pope.
