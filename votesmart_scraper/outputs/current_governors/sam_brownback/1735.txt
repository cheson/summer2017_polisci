WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback cited General Motors' announcement that it is increasing jobs per hour at its Kansas City assembly plant as another example of our nation's continuing economic recovery.
"The General Motors announcement of more production is great news for Kansas and is another signal that our improving economy is heading in the right direction," Brownback said.
"General Motors announced to their employees on Friday that they are increasing the jobs per hour at their Fairfax assembly plant from 47 to 56. I am encouraged by this report, which demonstrates economic improvement with increased production. This is very good news for all Kansans.
"The Jobs and Growth Tax Act, signed into law this past May, is helping the economy recover. Tax rates were too high and burdening our economy. Congress addressed the issue by passing this measure. We would be in much worse shape right now if Congress had failed to act.
"Most importantly, while the Jobs and Growth Tax Act is helping individuals immediately, it is also helping to create the necessary economic growth that will return hard-working Kansans back to their jobs.
The General Motors plant at Fairfax manufactures the Chevy Malibu and Chevy Malibu Maxx.
