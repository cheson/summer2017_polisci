Brownback Applauds Senate Passage of Vitter Amendment to Indian Health Care Bill
Co-sponsors Vitter amendment to ban federal funding of abortions
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on Senate passage of an amendment to the Indian Healthcare Improvement Act that would ban abortion funding at Indian health care service facilities.
"This is an important victory for the cause of life," said Brownback. "In the midst of the national debate about abortion, we have come to some fundamental agreements. We should not be using American tax dollars to fund abortion."
Today's amendment, sponsored by Senator David Vitter (R-LA) and co-sponsored by Brownback, codifies the Hyde amendment to ban abortion funding at Indian health care facilities. In 1976, federal funding of abortion was restricted by enactment of the Hyde Amendment to the annual HHS Appropriations Bill. However, because Indian health care is funded through the separate Interior Appropriations bill, which has never contained a Hyde Amendment, the IHS continued to pay for abortion on demand until 1982.
Brownback continued, "Regardless of how one feels about abortion, I am glad we can agree that tax dollars should not be used to fund abortion."
