Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed four bills into law Tuesday.
HB 2418 -- requires registration and imposes qualifications as to operators responsible for oversight of adult care homes.
HB 2578 -- regulation of firearms, including federal transfer certifications, concealed carry by municipal employees, penalties for possession of a firearm under the influence, preemption of city and county regulation and disposal of seized weapons.
S Sub HB2655 -- sentencing of veterans convicted of criminal offenses committed as a result of mental illness, including post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from service in a combat zone.
HB 2553 -- approves the Health Care Compact
"The Health Care Compact will allow states to restore and protect Medicare for generations to come," said Governor Brownback. "Obamacare is the most serious attack on Medicare and seniors since the program's inception. By cutting $700 million out of Medicare, President Obama and his allies made a policy statement that ideology is more important than protecting seniors. I oppose any effort at the state level to reduce Medicare benefits or coverage for Kansas seniors. I signed HB 2553 with this understanding and will work to make it a reality when the compact becomes effective."
By law, the Kansas governor has 10 calendar days to sign the bill into law, veto the bill or allow the bill to become law without his or her signature.
