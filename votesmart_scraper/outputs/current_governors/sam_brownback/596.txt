SERVICE MEMBERS HOME OWNERSHIP TAX ACT OF 2009 -- (Senate - December 09, 2009)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield myself 10 minutes to speak on the Dorgan amendment.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota is a strong, good, talented legislator. He has a good amendment, one I have looked at. It has been around for a long time. I have to rise in opposition to it.
I am ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is in the purview of our subcommittee, so I work on the issues of the FDA. If I may brag, the University of Kansas is one of the best pharmaceutical schools in the world and is often rated No. 1 as a pharmacy school. For anybody interested in that field of study or work, it is a good place to go. They are very concerned about what is in the Dorgan amendment.
The United States currently has one of the safest drug supply systems in the world that allows the Federal Food and Drug Administration to monitor and regulate the manufacture and distribution of approved medicines. The legal authority to import drugs already exists in this country. However, no HHS Secretary, Democrat or Republican, has been able to certify that the importation of prescription drugs from foreign nations is safe or will lead to cost savings. None have been able to.
