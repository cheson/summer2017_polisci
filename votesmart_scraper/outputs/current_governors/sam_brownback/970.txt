Brownback Urges House to Appoint Conferees to Reconcile House, Senate Farm Bills
Says House should act quickly before current farm bill expires
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today urged the House of Representatives to appoint conferees to the Farm Bill conference committee, which will reconcile differences in the House and Senate versions of the bill.
"The Farm Bill is a very important piece of legislation and many farmers in Kansas and nationwide are waiting for us in Washington to act," said Brownback. "The Senate has already appointed its conferees and I urge House Democratic leadership to appoint House conferees so we can move this legislation forward."
Both the House and Senate have passed versions of the Farm Bill, and the next step is for a conference committee to reconcile differences in the two bills. The current Farm Bill expires on March 15, 2008.
