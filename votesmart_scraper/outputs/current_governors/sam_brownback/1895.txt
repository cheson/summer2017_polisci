Issue Position: Cultural Policy
A strong and vibrant cultural policy is essential to a strong nation. There are cultural conditions which make democracy possible, markets open, and societies free. Our continued national wellbeing depends as much on the condition of our culture as our economy or federal policies.
Unfortunately, while most Americans are optimistic about the state of the economy, the state of the culture is another matter. Cultural trends are mixed: while we have made progress as a nation in reducing discrimination and opening the doors of opportunity to those historically denied entrance, there are many other areas where we have lost ground. Teen suicide and drug use are increasing. More families are breaking down, and marriages breaking up. We have become more accustomed to, and more tolerant of, tragedy, violence, and hate. We need a renewed culture. We need to honor the unsung heroes in our land, laud their works, and encourage their emulation. Similarly, we should work to discourage the glamorization of violence and vulgarity that pervades our entertainment and popular culture. There are many things that each of us can do to make our families, schools, neighborhoods, and ultimately, our culture more civil, compassionate, and uplifting. In the end, the most effective solutions to the problem of cultural decline will not come from Washington; they will come from the heartland.
