Press Release
By: Sam Brownback
Date: July 21, 2015
Location: Topeka, KS

In accordance with Executive Order 10-12, Governor Sam Brownback today ordered flags in Kansas to be flown at half-staff from sun-up to sun-down through Saturday, July 25, 2015. Flags in Kansas may be ordered to half-staff again on the date of the funeral for Navy Petty Officer Randall Smith if that occurs after July 25. Smith has family ties to Kansas.
The Governor also expressed his condolences to the families of the five military members killed during a July 16 attack on military recruiting stations.
"These five men served their nation as members of the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy. Their loss through an act of cowardice by one individual serves in stark contrast to the bravery of Navy Petty Officer Randall Smith, Marine Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Sullivan, Marine Sgt. Carson Holmquist, Marine Staff Sgt. David Wyatt and Marine Skip Wells.
"On behalf of all Kansans, we express our deepest sympathies to their families and friends. We will continue to honor their courage, and the courage of all who serve to protect our nation. I urge all Kansans to take a moment to pray for those we have lost, their families and their friends."
