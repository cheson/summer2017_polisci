Brownback Comments on Meeting with Sotomayor
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on his meeting with Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor. He met with her yesterday afternoon in the Capitol.
"I asked for and appreciated my meeting with Judge Sotomayor today," said Brownback. "I wanted to hear more from her as I have serious concerns about her philosophy as it relates to an activist judiciary. Unfortunately, I did not hear anything in our meeting that allayed those concerns. As Chief Justice Roberts said, a justice should be an impartial umpire, not a player in the game. I am afraid Judge Sotomayor wants to be more of a player than an umpire."
Senator Brownback will give a floor speech in the near future to more fully explain his concerns and his position with respect to Judge Sotomayor's nomination.
Brownback continued, "There are still questions about her rulings on the 2nd Circuit. The timeline for her hearing is too soon. To give this nominee proper consideration, senators from both sides of the aisle should be given ample time to effectively and completely review her record.
Sotomayor is currently a judge on the 2nd Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Brownback voted against her nomination to that position in 1998.
