RECOGNIZING THE DC COMMISSION FOR WOMEN -- (Senate - December 08, 2006)
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the contributions that the DC Commission for Women has made to the lives of the disenfranchised in our Nation's Capital. Of particular note has been the commission's focus on homeless women and children who are often forgotten and neglected in the District of Columbia.
I am particularly pleased that the commission will serve as a partner in the ``big read'' program, sponsored by the national endowment for the arts. This program provides books for low-income ``at-risk'' children. The DC Commission for Women is also a national model for educating the public on domestic violence prevention and women's health and safety issues.
My remarks are coming on the eve of Mayor Anthony Williams' transition from pubic service into private life. It is befitting that the commission is paying tribute to Mayor Williams' mother, Virginia E. Hayes Williams, a member of the commission and a strong advocate for children and women. It is not coincidental that the tribute will be held at the Saint Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church for Mrs. Williams, like Constantine the Great's mother, Helen, advised her son on religion and affairs of the state.
I would also like to acknowledge the commission's chair, Dr. Christine M. Warnke, whose leadership has brought international resources and visibility to the commission. She has expanded the commission's programs and forged global partnerships which promote religious and cultural tolerance.
As we move into the 110th Congress, I look forward to working with the Commission for Women on these important issues.
