Brownback Completes Whirlwind Tour of Iowa
U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Sam Brownback completed his campaign tour with Christian leader David Barton, addressing hundreds of Christian leaders in six Iowa cities.
Brownback and Barton spoke with over 750 Christian leaders at events in Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Des Moines, Ames, Davenport, and Cedar Rapids in the span of twenty-four hours.
The events featured David Barton, a noted American historian and Christian leader. Brownback and Barton focused on the 2008 presidential election and the importance of Christian leaders being active in defending core principles such as the sanctity of life, the preservation of marriage as a man and a woman, and keeping God in the nation's public square.
"Every human life is beautiful, unique, and was made by the Creator to serve a great purpose," Brownback said. "As a nation, it is our responsibility to protect human life at all stages, in all circumstances."
Brownback continued, "As Christian leaders, you have a great responsibility to ensure your voice and the voices of those you lead are heard in the public square. With your commitment today, we can continue to bring back the Christian principles and morals upon which our society and nation were founded."
Today, Brownback will address activists in West Des Moines for his "Iowa Headquarters Grand Opening" event at noon, CST.
