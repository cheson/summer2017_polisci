Kansas Governor Sam Brownback delivered his Governor's Budget Amendment (GBA) for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015 to the Kansas legislature today. The GBA includes $5,000,000 in state general fund and $5,700,000 all funds spending.
The Governor's budget amendment recommendations include additional funding to further reduce the physical disability and intellectual/developmental disability HCBS waiting lists as well as fund badly needed behavioral health services for the uninsured. The recently revised consensus caseload estimate decreased expected state general fund spending by $30,400,000.
"As the KanCare program and other reforms continue to hold our costs down, while continuing to provide quality services to the people of Kansas, it is important that we honor the commitment we made to use those additional savings to reduce the waiting lists," said Governor Brownback.
It also includes funding for two full-time attorney positions to fulfill new duties within the Attorney General's Office enacted by the legislature and funding to support auditors to calculate work required by new governmental accounting rules for reporting pension liabilities that will result in higher costs for KPERS.
Governor Brownback also encouraged legislators to wrap up work on remaining budget items not included in the recently signed Education Finance bill such as the FY 2015 Department of Corrections budget and funding for the Translational Chemical Biology Institute at the University of Kansas.
"I applaud the hard work of the Legislature this year and look forward to capping a successful session with an omnibus budget that funds waiting list reductions, the Department of Corrections, and important research on the next generation of cancer drugs."
