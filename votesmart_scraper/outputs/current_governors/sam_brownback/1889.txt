Issue Position: Native American Affairs
Long before 1776 and the establishment of the United States of America, this land was Sam with Native Americans inhabited by numerous nations. Like many Americans today, these peoples sowed the land, tilled it, journeyed it, and protected it. I am thankful for the rich history of Native Americans and the influence their cultures have had and continue to have on our present day society. I continue to work to address the social and economic challenges facing Native Americans and to establish a more harmonious Federal-Tribal relationship for the common good of our land today and in the future.
