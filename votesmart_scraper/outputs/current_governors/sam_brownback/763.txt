Brownback Outraged by $165 Million AIG Bonuses
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on news that AIG has recently paid its executives more than $165 million in bonuses. In the past several months, AIG has received $170 billion in taxpayer funds.
"I am outraged at the news that AIG, a company that has taken so much taxpayer money in the form of bailouts, is now paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in executive bonuses," said Brownback. "I will do everything I can to see that AIG returns its bonus money to taxpayers. Any AIG executive who received a bonus should return it or be fired."
