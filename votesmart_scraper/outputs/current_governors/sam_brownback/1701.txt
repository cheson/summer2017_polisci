SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS: SENATE RESOLUTION 324-EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING TO THE EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTIONS RESULTING FROM THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, AND TO THE NEED TO RECONSIDER FUTURE SERVICE MISSIONS TO THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I recognize the significant scientific accomplishments of the Hubble Space Telescope. Space telescopes such as Hubble are an important part of our future space program and the President's vision for revitalized human exploration of space.
Several months ago NASA made a decision to forego planned Space Shuttle servicing missions for the Hubble Space Telescope. This is a difficult and complicated issue and technical experts reasonably differ on the best approach. I believe that NASA might benefit from the counsel of the best experts the nation can muster inside and outside of the Government. Correspondingly, I've joined my colleague Senator MIKULSKI in urging NASA to sponsor a comprehensive study on the full range of options and risks associated with various approaches for maintaining the Hubble Space Telescope and its capabilities. I would also hope that this study would include imaginative new concepts for robotic servicing.
As we fulfill the promise of space exploration the President has outlined, the enormous success of the Hubble Space Telescope and other NASA successes such as the recent Mars Rover Program provide us with a sound basis upon which to build. NASA can count on my continued support of their endeavors to provide unlimited opportunity to future generations of Americans.
