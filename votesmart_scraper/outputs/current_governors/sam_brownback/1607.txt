Brownback Statement On Yasser Arafat
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement on the declining health of Yasser Arafat and continued peace efforts in the Middle East.
"Our prayers are with Chairman Arafat, his family and the Palestinian people in this difficult time. The following days and weeks will present many challenges as well as new opportunities for a lasting peace in the Middle East. All sides should rally around that goal and move quickly to ensure a peaceful transition for the benefit of all people in the region."
