Kansas Governor Sam Brownback announced today the Office of the Repealer has recommended 51 statutes, regulations, and executive orders for repeal. The Governor signed Executive Order 11-01 last year to establish the Office within the Kansas Department of Administration.
"The top priorities of my administration are to grow the state's economy and to create jobs to get unemployed Kansans back to work," Gov. Sam Brownback said. "With the help of Kansans, the Office of the Repealer has identified 51 laws, regulations and executive orders that are out of date, unreasonable, and burdensome. State laws and regulations shouldn't hinder opportunities for Kansans and Kansas businesses."
The 51 suggestions recommended for repeal deal with issues primarily related to:
* Agriculture
* Property Appraisal
* Corrections
* State agency organization
* County office administration and services
* State labor agency authority in labor disputes
"The list released today is just the first step. We continue to review and consider for repeal hundreds of suggestions received during 2011 and are prepared to consider new suggestions," Kansas Department of Administration Secretary Dennis Taylor said.
As of December 16, 2011, Taylor said the Office of the Repealer received 506 suggestions through the Repealer website, www.repealer.da.ks.gov or email repealer@ks.gov.
In addition, the Office conducted 26 meetings in 24 cities throughout the State of Kansas during October and November 2011 attended by more than 250 citizens and representatives or organizations and businesses. Some of the suggestions received during these meetings duplicated earlier suggestions received through the website while other suggestions were in addition to those previously received.
