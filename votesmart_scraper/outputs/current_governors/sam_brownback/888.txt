Brownback Applauds Supreme Court Decision Striking Down Washington, D.C., Gun Ban
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the United States Supreme Court's 5-4 decision striking down the District of Columbia's 32 year-old ban on handguns.
"This decision is a great victory for the rule of law and Constitutional rights," said Brownback. "The Court correctly decided that placing a ban on handgun ownership denied citizens their Second Amendment right. This closely divided decision underscores the importance of appointing judges who will not legislate from the bench, but instead will adhere to the words written in the Constitution."
The District of Columbia's law prohibiting handguns in 1976 was adopted by the city council and was one of the strictest gun laws in the nations. Citing violation of Second Amendment rights, the Supreme Court majority decision today overturned that ban.
