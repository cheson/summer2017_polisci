Kansas Governor Sam Brownback today issued a proclamation declaring Nov. 24-30 as "A Week of Reconciliation".
"As we enter the holiday season, a time when families and friends gather to celebrate traditions, I encourage Kansans to consider the importance of reconciliation and forgiveness," Governor Brownback said.
The Governor cited author M. Scott Peck's writings that "the overall purpose of human communication is - or should be - reconciliation. It should ultimately serve to lower or remove the walls of misunderstanding which unduly separate us human beings, one from another."
"Forgiveness is a sign of strength," Governor Brownback said. "It may be difficult to reach out to those who have hurt us or those whom we have hurt, but I encourage all Kansans to build a bridge of reconciliation."
