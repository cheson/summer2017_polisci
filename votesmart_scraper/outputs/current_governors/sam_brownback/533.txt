Brownback Applauds Kansas Auto Manufacturing Center
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the Fairfax, Kansas, General Motors manufacturing center following the announcement that GM is to expand the center.

"The GM expansion of the Fairfax plant will lead to the creation of Kansas jobs," said Brownback. "This announcement signifies that the value of Kansas workmanship is recognized and appreciated."

GM today announced its plans to expand the Fairfax manufacturing center and will invest $136 million in the plant. With this expansion, Fairfax will become the primary source for the Chevrolet Malibu.

Additionally, GM announced that it has paid back its loans from the federal government.

Brownback continued, "I am also happy to see that GM has responsibly paid off its loans. The auto industry is the source of millions of American jobs; it is good to see an auto company like GM on the road to economic recovery."
