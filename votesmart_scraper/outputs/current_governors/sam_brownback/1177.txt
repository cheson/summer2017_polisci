Interview
By: Ron Paul John McCain III Mitt Romney Duncan Hunter Tom Tancredo Sam Brownback
Date: May 3, 2007
Location: Simi Valley, CA

MODERATOR: In the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, just 22 percent believe this country is on the right track.
Mayor Giuliani, how do we get back to Ronald Reagan's morning in America?
GIULIANI: We get back to it with optimism. The same situation that I faced in New York City; when I became mayor of New York City, 65, 70 percent thought New York City was going on the wrong track.
And what I did was, I set policies and programs of growth, of moving people toward prosperity, security, safety.
And what we can borrow from Ronald Reagan, since we are in his library, is that great sense of optimism that he had. He led by building on the strengths of America, not running America down.
And we're a country that people love to come to, they want to come to this country with a shining city on the hill. So we should solve our immigration issue, including illegal immigration, from our strengths, not our weaknesses.
We're a country that has the greatest health care system in the world. It's flawed, it needs to be fixed, but we should fix it from our strengths. We shouldn't turn it into socialized medicine.
Those are the things that Ronald Reagan taught us: You lead from optimism.
GIULIANI: You will lead from hope, and we should never retreat in the face of terrorism. Terrible mistake.
