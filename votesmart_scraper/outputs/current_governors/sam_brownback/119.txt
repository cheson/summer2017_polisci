Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement after signing Senate Bill 7, the education block grant bill.
"For the first time ever, we will spend more than $4 billion to support K12 education in Kansas. At the same time we are providing those closest to the classroom - teachers and parents - direct control over the future of education by getting money into the classroom to immediately benefit Kansas students.
"In the 2014-2015 school year, funding was approximately $3.98 billion. For school year 2015-2016 that increases to $4.09 billion, increasing to $4.16 billion in school year 2016-2017.
"I want to thank the legislature for restoring the previous allotments through this block grant, as I requested. I further thank the legislature for its efforts in passing this critical first step in developing a new formula that recognizes the high quality of Kansas schools and provides a stable source of funding that makes them great for generations of Kansas students to come. Together we will build on our past success and not jeopardize funding because of flaws in the previous formula.
"I look forward to working with the legislature to develop an education funding plan that not only provides more money to the classroom but is sustainable, stable and predictable."
