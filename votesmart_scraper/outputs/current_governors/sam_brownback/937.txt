U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the Food and Drug Administration's meeting to discuss experimenting on humans with embryonic stem cells.
"I am deeply concerned that the Food and Drug Administration is discussing procedures for conducting experiments on humans with embryonic stem cells," said Brownback. "In March 2001, the New York Times reported devastating patient results from human experiments using fetal tissue cells. The problem was the cells were too immature and tended to form tumors or grow in uncontrolled ways that could not be reversed in the humans who underwent experimentation. I am astonished that the FDA is proceeding with human experimentation again, with even younger human cells that have shown an even greater propensity to form tumors. At best this is irresponsible; at worst this is criminal. Human beings are not guinea pigs.
"What makes this even more troubling is that there is a viable ethical alternative with adult stem cells that are currently being used in the treatment of well over 70 different diseases and conditions, including spinal cord injury, type-I diabetes, heart failure, and Parkinson's disease as validated by peer-reviewed, published results."
