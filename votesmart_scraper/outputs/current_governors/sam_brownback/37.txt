Kansas Governor Sam Brownback today signed Substitute for House Bill 2001, ensuring Kansas schools will remain open.
"I am pleased to sign this bill ensuring that Kansas schools remain open. As I said when I called the special session, our focus was on making sure the Kansas Supreme Court did not close schools over 1 percent of the $4 Billion spent on education in Kansas.
"I appreciate the hard work of legislators which began prior to the start of the session in a series of meetings. The effort to bring together legislators, educators and attorneys resulted in a bill supported by all parties and a stipulation by plaintiff's attorney that House Bill 2001 satisfies the equity portion of this litigation.
"This bill passed the House and Senate with strong majorities, showing the legislature's commitment to addressing the issue in a timely manner. I congratulate House Speaker Ray Merrick and Senate President Susan Wagle for an efficient and focused special session. I thank all the legislators who worked hard to protect our schools from the threat of closure, especially Representative Ron Ryckman, Jr., Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, and Senator Ty Masterson, Chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee."
