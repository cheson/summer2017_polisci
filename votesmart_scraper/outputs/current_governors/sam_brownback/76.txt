Governor Sam Brownback issues statement on Kansas joining lawsuit to fight Obamacare unconstitutional taxation
Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Oct. 22, 2015
Location: Topeka, KS

"The federal government is threatening to cut $1.6 billion of federal Medicaid funding affecting more than 400,000 Kansans in need unless Kansas pays millions of dollars in taxes to the federal government to support Obamacare. This is just one more instance of an overreaching federal regulation designed to coerce states into funding or participating in Obamacare. In 2015, Kansas paid more than $32 million to cover costs associated with the Health Insurance Provider Fee. This is a tax Kansans should not have to pay and is an unconstitutional overreach of federal authority."
