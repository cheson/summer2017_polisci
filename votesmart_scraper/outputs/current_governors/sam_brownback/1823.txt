Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to add another voice of support for the Naturalization and Family Protection for Military Members Act of 2003.
Earlier today, the President visited Bethesda Naval Hospital with his wife Laura and spent time with some of the courageous men and women who have been wounded while fighting both to secure the safety and freedom of all Americans, as well as on behalf of a people starving for access to our ideals of liberty and justice for all. After this visit, he was visibly moved by the bravery and patriotism he witnessed, and he noted a special moment for him. I'd like to quote his comments from the press conference now:
"I think the thing that stood out the most to me was seeing two wounded soldiers swear in as citizens of the United States. One man from Mexico, one man from the Philippines. People who had gone overseas. People who had risked their lives for peace and security and freedom. They wore the uniform of the United States military. And Laura and I got to see them sworn in as citizens. It was a very profound moment. We were both honored to have witnesses this.
"You know, we got an amazing country where so powerful, the values we believe, that people would be willing to risk their own life and become a citizen after being wounded. It's an amazing moment. Really proud of it."
The President's words speak to exactly why this legislation is so importantÂ—and so worthwhile. These men and women are willing to risk their own lives on our behalf, even though they are not yet citizens of this country. It is why I once again strongly encourage the Senate to lend its support to this bill.
