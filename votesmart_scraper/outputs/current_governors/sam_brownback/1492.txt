CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST: Will the fight come from the right on Roe v. Wade in the upcoming Senate confirmation hearings? And the first Iraq veteran runs for Congress, but is he in the battle for his life? Let's play HARDBALL. Good evening. I'm Chris Matthews.
Senate Democrats are on a collision course with the White House over access to John Roberts' documents when he was deputy solicitor general during the first Bush administration. And while most Republicans have fallen in line behind Roberts, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, a pro-life member of the Judiciary Committee, has expressed reservations about where Roberts stands on abortion and Roe v. Wade. Senator Brownback, thank you. You met with him, the nominee, earlier this week. Do you think he is sound on-on abortion rights? Where is he?
SEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R), KANSAS: I think that is yet to be seen. I'm in a trust-but-verify stage.
He doesn't have a long written record on this topic. The history has been typically that people, once they go on the courts, they frequently have moved left, if they're not well established on where they are on the positions on some of these key and core issues.
Our meeting was good. I think he sounds quite good. He talks about being more of a strict constructionist on the Constitution, which is something I'm certainly looking for. He talks about an appropriately modest court. But I think we need to see.
