Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback spoke at the 15th Annual Crime Victims' Rights Conference today in Topeka. The Governor spoke about his experiences fighting human trafficking, and the importance of mentoring children and families in need.
"Children are our most valuable resource, but they are also our most vulnerable," Governor Brownback said. "Responding to the needs of victims requires that we have the opportunity for dialogue, as this conference has provided. It takes the whole community to keep our children and families safe."
The Governor also thanked the law enforcement professionals, victim service providers, criminal justice personnel and others who assist victims of crime.
"You are mentoring people at a time that they need it most. Their hearts have been hurt, and their nerves have been exposed." Brownback said. "At that point in their lives, it is vitally important for them to have someone there to touch them in a positive way. The help you offer to victims is done not only with your minds, but also with your hearts. Thank you for doing such an important job."
The group of more than 500 discussed the needs of crime victims, the criminal justice system and advocacy for victims. The conference included presentations on human trafficking in Kansas, child abuse issues and cyber bullying.
