Governor Sam Brownback Issues Statement After Signing Bill to Keep Kansas Schools Open
Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: April 7, 2016
Location: Topeka, KS

The Governor issued the following statement:
"The legislature has acted to keep Kansas schools open and I agree with its choice. I have signed Senate Substitute for House Bill 2655 because I want to keep our schools open and ensure our students continue to have access to a quality education. I would remind those who criticized this bill as a "product of politics,' that it is indeed the job of the legislature to address these issues. The legislature consists of 165 elected representatives of the people. I do not take their judgment lightly. This bill is the result of a delicate legislative compromise -- one that I respectfully endorse and that the Court should review with appropriate deference."
This bill adopts the capital outlay equalization formula previously approved by the Court itself. It includes a "hold harmless" provision so that no school district will see a reduction from its current funding level.
