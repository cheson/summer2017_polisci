HONORING THE MEMORY OF DR. WILLIAM R. BRIGHT
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of one of the great spiritual leaders of the twentieth century, Dr. William R. Bright. Dr. Bright, or Bill, as a number of us in this Chamber knew him, was a man of great faith, great heart, and great strength. Bill Bright's passing on Saturday, July 19, 2003, leaves a hole in my heart and the hearts of the many individual lives he touched. For this reason, I would like to take a few moments to remember the life and work of Dr. Bright.
Bill was born in Coweta, Oklahoma, in 1921. He graduated from Northeastern State University in Oklahoma with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and a minor in sociology. While a student, Bill already showed promise as an energetic community leader. He served as editor of the university yearbook, was elected student body president, was chosen as a member of Who's Who in American Colleges and Universities, and was selected by students and faculty as the year's outstanding graduate. After graduation, he joined the extension faculty of Oklahoma State University for a time, and then moved to Los Angeles to launch a business career.
