Today, Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement in response to a media release announcing the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence will file a lawsuit challenging the Kansas "Second Amendment Protection Act" which the Governor signed into law in April 2013.
"As I have said previously, the right to keep and bear arms is a right that Kansans hold dear. It is a right enshrined not only in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also protected by the Kansas Bill of Rights. The people of Kansas have repeatedly and overwhelmingly reaffirmed their commitment to protecting this fundamental right. The people of Kansas are likewise committed to defending the sovereignty of the State of Kansas as guaranteed in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
"The Obama administration attacked this legislation when I signed it more than one year ago. It now appears that they have found some Washington DC lawyers to do their bidding. We will vigorously defend the rights of Kansans in this litigation."
