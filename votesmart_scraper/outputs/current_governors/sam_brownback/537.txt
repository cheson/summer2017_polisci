U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the announcement from Justice John Paul Stevens that he will retire from the Supreme Court.

"I thank Justice Stevens for his service on the Supreme Court and wish him all the best in his retirement," said Brownback. "Moving forward, I encourage President Obama to nominate a replacement who will be faithful to the United States Constitution, and not a political ideology. I hope President Obama consults with senators on both sides of the aisle before selecting a nominee."

Justice Stevens, who announced his retirement today, has served on the Supreme Court since 1975.
