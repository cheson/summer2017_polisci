SENATE RESOLUTION 65--CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF CAMBODIA TO RELEASE CHEAM CHANNY FROM PRISON, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES -- (Senate - February 17, 2005)
Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. MCCONNELL) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:
S. Res. 65
Whereas, on February 3, 2005, the Cambodian National Assembly voted in a closed-door session to strip the immunity of Sam Rainsy Party opposition parliamentarians Sam Rainsy, Cheam Channy, and Chea Poch;
Whereas local and national press, foreign diplomats, and other observers were refused entry into the National Assembly during the vote;
Whereas the stripping of the parliamentary immunity of Sam Rainsy, Cheam Channy, and Chea Poch places the fate of these opposition parliamentarians in the hands of a notoriously corrupt and politicized judicial system;
Whereas Sam Rainsy, Cheam Channy, and Chea Poch face trumped-up charges of a highly political nature that are intended to silence the democratic opposition;
Whereas Cheam Channy is currently imprisoned in a military jail and, in contravention of Cambodia law, is subject to the jurisdiction of the Military Court in Cambodia;
Whereas the National Assembly vote is yet another attempt to intimidate the democratic opposition in Cambodia, attempts which include the unsolved killing of political activists, including Chea Vichea and Om Radsady, and unsolved attacks against peaceful and legal demonstrations, including the grenade attack against the Khmer Nation Party in March 1997 during which an American citizen was injured;
Whereas the United States, United Nations, and other organizations and individuals have strongly condemned the National Assembly vote as a blow to the democratic development of Cambodia;
Whereas international donors acknowledged during a consultative group meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, last month that accountability and transparency are vital to the country's economic and social development;
Whereas the National Assembly vote underscores the lack of commitment of Prime Minster Hun Sen and National Assembly President Norodom Ranariddh to democracy, accountability, transparency, and the rule of law in Cambodia; and
Whereas President George W. Bush issued a proclamation on January 12, 2004, that entry into the United States should be denied to former and current corrupt public officials and their families: Now therefore be it
Resolved, That the Senate-
(1) calls upon the Government of Cambodia to immediately and unconditionally release Cheam Channy;
(2) calls upon the Cambodian National Assembly to reverse its recent action to strip the immunity of opposition parliamentarians Sam Rainsy, Cheam Channy, and Chea Poch;
(3) urges the Secretary of State, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, international financial institutions, and democracies around the world to continue to publicly and forcefully condemn the Cambodian National Assembly vote;
(4) urges international donors to consider imposing appropriate sanctions against the National Assembly and the Government of Cambodia unless and until it reverses its recent action;
(5) calls upon the Secretary of State to impose visa restrictions on members of the Cambodian National Assembly and their families who voted to strip the immunity of Sam Rainsy, Cheam Channy, and Chea Pok, consistent with the President's Proclamation of January 12, 2004, regarding the denial of visas to corrupt public officials and their families; and
(6) calls upon Prime Minister Hun Sen and Cambodian National Assembly President Norodom Ranariddh to cease and desist their efforts to undermine democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Cambodia.
