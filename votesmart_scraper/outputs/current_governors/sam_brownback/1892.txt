Issue Position: Education
Our Kansas youth are our greatest resource. We must strive to ensure that our young people are prepared to lead our State and nation in the future. In order to prepare our next generation of leaders, it is imperative that we provide our State, local school districts, and schools with the tools necessary to educate our most precious citizens. I believe it is essential that we do not pass laws that burden local schools and school districts with unnecessary red tape. Kansas remains a leader in the education of our nation's children. I will continue to promote policies that empower our state to continue to address the needs of our students.
