Brownback Calls for Sanctions if North Korea Launches
Says a missile launch violates UN rules and warrants a return to list of terrorist states
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the upcoming North Korean missile launch.
"If the North Korean regime proceeds with this ballistic missile launch, in clear violation UN Security Council Resolution 1718, the Obama Administration should immediately re-impose U.S. sanctions that were lifted during the course of the Six Party Talks, including designating North Korea a terrorist state," Brownback said.
UN Security Council Resolution 1718 was adopted unanimously on October 14, 2006 and imposes sanctions on North Korea. The resolution demands that North Korea must "not conduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic missile" and "suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile programme." In October 2008, North Korea was removed from the list of state sponsors of terror as a part of the Six Party negotiations.
Brownback continued, "The President should also respond to this provocation by focusing on the plight of the North Korean people, who continue to suffer unspeakable oppression at the hands of Kim Jong-Il's regime."
The North Korean regime remains one of the worst human rights abusers in the world, responsible for millions of deaths caused by famine, forced labor, and political executions. There are estimated to be up to 200,000 political prisoners in forced labor camps throughout North Korea.
