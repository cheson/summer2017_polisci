Location: Washington, DC

U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today joined his Republican colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee calling for a federal spending freeze.
"I am proud to join my colleagues to tackle out of control government spending, and I hope this is just the beginning," said Brownback. "A spending freeze is a positive step, but it is important that Congress actually cuts spending. Across the country, families are making tough choices and cutting their budgets; it is past time for the federal government to do likewise. I am hopeful that my Democrat colleagues agree to the spending freeze proposed by the Republican appropriators."
Brownback and the other eleven Republicans on the Senate Appropriations Committee today sent a letter to the Democrat Appropriators calling for the Committee to agree to freeze the budget at last year's level.
