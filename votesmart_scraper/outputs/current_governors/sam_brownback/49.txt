Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer visited with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders during a recent week-long trip to Israel. In addition to talks with Netanyahu on shared security concerns, Colyer engaged in discussions intended to grow existing business relationships and foster new ones between Kansas and Israel. During a week-long visit to Israel, the Lt. Governor met with Israeli government, military and business leaders.
"Kansas and Israel have an existing business relationship and this trip provided an opportunity to build on those relationships while creating new opportunities for growth," said the Lt. Governor. "Discussions with leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were very positive."
In 2015, Kansas exported approximately $75 million worth of goods to Israel and almost 60 Kansas companies do business with Israel.
"The visit was very productive for all of us and an opportunity to reinforce the strength of our relationship with Israel," said the Lt. Governor.

The delegation was sponsored by the State Government Leadership Foundation (SGLF)--the Republican State Leadership Committee's (RSLC) strategic policy partner.
