Governor requests filings in school finance litigation case

At the request of Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, Attorney General Derek Schmidt filed two motions with the Kansas Supreme Court Thursday requesting mediation of the dispute in the school finance litigation as well as a stay of the district court's decision issued last month.
"While the fact remains that the Kansas Legislature should determine a suitable provision for finance of our schools, I believe we owe it to Kansas taxpayers, parents, teachers and students to examine every available avenue to resolve this dispute to the satisfaction of all involved," Governor Brownback said. "It is my hope that through staying the decision and allowing all interested parties to give input on how to best fund our schools and get more money into the classroom, our state will maintain its reputation of having great schools and great educational opportunities for our children."
