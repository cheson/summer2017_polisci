SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS: SENATE RESOLUTION 198Â—EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE THAT STRUCK ALGERIA ON MAY 21, 2003
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution expressing sympathy for the victims of the devastating earthquake that struck Algeria on May 21, 2003.
Algeria, a North African nation and former colony of France, was rocked by an enormous earthquake registering 6.8 on the Richter scale on May 21 killing more than 2,000 people, injuring 10,000 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.
I rise to extend my heartfelt sympathy to the Algerian people and to encourage the United States to commit itself to help Algerians pick up their lives and move past this tragedy.
President Bush committed funds to the Algerian Red Crescent Society, and the U.S. airlifted disaster supplies, including blankets, tents, medical supply kits.
It is important that in Algeria's hour of need that we act as a humane Nation. The kindness of a compassionate America can help heal the wounds of Algeria.
We must define ourselves as a nation by the goodness and compassion we extend to our fellow human beings who inhabit this world with us.
Though it is not simply in our self-interest, we should be careful to view our compassionate acts as instruments of goodwill presenting the case for American leadership to the world. These acts of compassion can serve to further our interests while reinforcing the American ideal as something other nations would want to attain.
Thomas Jefferson stated that America "should have an Empire for Liberty," meeting a moral obligation to defend and promote freedom throughout the world. That remains for any American foreign policy, but is only buttressed by our willingness to serve our fellow man.
It would be a tragedy in this case if we were to wait for our ship to come in; we should swim out to meet it. Algeria can be the mark where America as a leading moral nation can greet his fellow suffering man with open arms and mercy.
