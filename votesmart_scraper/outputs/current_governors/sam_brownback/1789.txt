WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today made the following statement after learning of a growing protest in Tehran against the Iranian regime.
"My office has been receiving numerous reports of a growing protest in Iran taking place right now," Brownback said. "It is estimated that between 5-8,000 students have joined in and are protesting against the government's crackdown on student democracy dissidents.
"Recently, five student leaders were arrested in advance of the July 9th anniversary of the original mass student protests in 1999. Even though it is almost 2:00 a.m. in Tehran now (5:00 p.m. here), the protests are growing in size according to Persian media accounts.
"We have also received reports that Iranian government forces are beating up the protesters and firing warning shots at them.
"To the brave Iranian people protesting this night - I offer my strong support, admiration and assistance. I will share this news with my colleagues in the U.S. Congress and the American media so that America will know of your bravery.
"I call on the Iranian government to stop beating and harrassing their own people. The students are shouting, "Khatemi, Khatemi, Go Away!" These are the same students that gave President Khatemi his start. They are disillusioned because there has not been reform, there has not been real democracy and there has not been respect for the rule of law and human rights.
"This is how history is made - one brave act at a time. The world is watching how the regime treats you and will hold them accountable. Iran-AA Ahh-zad! [Free Iran!]," Brownback said.
