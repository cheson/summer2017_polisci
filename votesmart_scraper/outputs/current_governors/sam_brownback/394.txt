Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback toured oil and natural gas facilities located in Barber County today to learn about the economic growth opportunities in this energy sector. Kansas Cooperation Commission Chairman Mark Sievers, KCC Commissioner Ward Loyd, KCC Commissioner Tom Wright as well as KCC Conservation Director Doug Louis and Kansas Geological Survey Director Rex Buchanan joined the Governor for the tour.
"Southern Kansas is seeing a lot of interest in the Mississippi Limestone formation from major oil and gas companies. It's important for the state to understand and prepare for the horizontal drilling operation," Governor Brownback said. "The state currently doesn't have specific rules and regulations for horizontal drilling. We want to ensure we have a common sense approach that encourages development and protects our state's environment."
The tour included five stops at wells owned and operated by Wayne Woolsey, owner of the Woolsey Petroleum Management Corporation. They observed in action a horizontal well, a vertical Mississippi well, a vacuum well, a modern slick water frac treatment and a gas lift horizontal Mississippi producer.
"This investment by oil and gas companies is very good for Kansas. It will make us a true energy state and we need to see ourselves as an energy state," Brownback said.
The Kansas Independent Oil and Gas Association organized the tour.
