Issue Position: Criminal Justice & the Courts
gavelWe are winning the war against crime. Measured against the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, this decade has witnessed more vigorous prosecution of and a general reduction in crimes across the country and among all categories of crime. But while we take some comfort in the progress that we've made, there is still much work to do, including terrorist crimes related to homeland and border security. Each of us as citizens and neighbors can and should help in combating crime. Here in Congress, that means passing legislation that gives our law enforcement officers the resources and tools they need to do their jobs. For our federal judiciary, it means that the Senate should hold balanced and prompt hearings and votes on judges of the highest intellectual and personal qualities who will follow the law. In our communities, it means setting up neighborhood patrols and other volunteer activities to supplement the work of our law enforcement officials. In schools, we must support prevention programs for troubled youth. And as parents, we must send a clear message that crime and violence will not be tolerated, especially in the context of cyber crimes.
