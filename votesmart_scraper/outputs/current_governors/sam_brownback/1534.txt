CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST: Are the Republicans dictating surrender terms in the filibuster fight? Let play HARDBALL.
Good evening. I'm Chris Matthews.
The top Senate Democrat accuses President Bush of trying to rewrite the constitution. A Republican leader charges Democrats with obstructionism, and blacks in Congress reversed history and now defend the filibuster. And some in the GOP Congress are urging people to cancel their "Newsweek" subscriptions, calling the magazine's report on the Koran criminal.
But first we begin with Sam Brownback and Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat who's been trying to broker a deal that would preserve filibusters for extraordinary circumstances.
I want to go right now to Senator Nelson. Do you believe there could be a compromise that would allow some use of the filibuster in judicial nomination case?
SEN. BEN NELSON, (D) NEBRASKA: I think it's possible. We're talking right now, a group of Republicans and Democrats, looking for a way to be able to do this so that judges can get up or down votes but at the same time, extraordinary circumstances could still involve the use of the filibuster.
MATTHEWS: What would be an extraordinary circumstance? Give me an example if you can, senator.
