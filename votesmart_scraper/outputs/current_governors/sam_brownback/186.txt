Governor Sam Brownback today signed HB 2744, a bill that defines what autism means in terms of insurance coverage and requires health plans to provide coverage for families dealing with autism.
The Governor signed the bill at the University of Kansas, Edwards Campus in Overland Park. He was joined by Representative John Rubin, several members of the legislature and representatives of autism support groups as he signed the bill today. The co-directors of the Kansas Center for Autism Research & Training (KCART) and Vice Chancellor of the Edwards Campus also were present to discuss their work in support of autism treatment and outreach.
"I am pleased to sign this bill today expanding coverage for autism spectrum disorder," said Governor Brownback. "This is an important moment for families dealing with the challenges of an autistic family member."
HB 2744 will require non-grandfathered group health plans for companies with more than 51 employees to add coverage for treating autism disorder for children under the age of 12 years, beginning Jan. 1, 2015. In January 2016, other health plans will have to add the same coverage.
