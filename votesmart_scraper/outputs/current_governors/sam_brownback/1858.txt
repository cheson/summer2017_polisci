Location: Washington, DC

SEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R-KS): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for holding the hearing. Thank you, our witnesses, for presenting. I am going to have to slip out to another hearing on North Korea shortly, so I apologize for not being able to hear all of your comments.
Mr. Chairman, I am encouraged by some of the things that have been happening recently, particularly the FCC Spectrum Management Task Force report to the degree management breakdowns have occurred due to neglect. I feel at this time, that the FCC is finally looking forward in innovative -- in management policy. And I'm interested in working with Chairman Powell to provide him with the tools he needs to get the ball rolling forward in this regard.
While some of the concepts in the FCC report are more long term in nature, I think there is some legislative items we can move right off the bat. The administration has requested that we create government user auction revenue trust fund. I think that's very appropriate. I also think we can take action to do away with statutory barriers to the development of real secondary markets for spectrum. Secondary markets are especially important for rural communities where spectrum, all too often, does lie dormant or fallow.
Later today I'll be joining my colleagues, Senators Burns, Dorgan and Hagel on the floor, to introduce a bill called the New Homestead Act, which would help to revitalize rural communities that have experienced significant out migration for the last 20 years. Spectrum can play an important role in helping to revitalize these rural communities. In that regard I hope that we can move forward, at least with that limited legislative concept to help in their redevelopment.
Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding the hearing and I look forward to working with my colleagues on some of these concepts.
