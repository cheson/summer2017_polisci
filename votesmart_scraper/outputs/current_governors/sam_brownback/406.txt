Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement regarding the loss of four Kansas military members last week, three of them in the weekend helicopter crash that killed 30 U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Saturday:
"Our hearts are heavy with sorrow over the loss of 30 American lives in the crash of a Chinook helicopter this weekend in Afghanistan, including 3 Kansas soldiers. Kansans also suffered the loss of Private First Class Cody Glen Baker, of Holton, killed last week in Afghanistan while on patrol.
The sacrifices these men made for our state and nation will never be forgotten. They are, and will forever be our heroes, along with those who have gone before them. We are praying for all of the families and, as a state and nation, we will be there for them in this challenging and difficult time. We also take this opportunity to remember the families of all of those in Kansas and the nation who have lost loved ones since the war in Afghanistan and Iraq began. God Bless you for your sacrifices and for your service to the state of Kansas and the nation."
