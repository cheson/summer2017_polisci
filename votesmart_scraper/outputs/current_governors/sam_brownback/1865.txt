FBLA-PBL WEEK
Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise today to acknowledge Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda, (FBLA-PBL), and its work to improve the America in which we live.
Over the past 60 years, FBLA-PBL has been training America's business leaders. This weekFebruary 9-15over a quarter million FBLA-PBL members observe FBLA-PBL Week in their local chapters and communities all over America. Through partnering with businesses and performing community service projects, FBLA-PBL members gain an understanding of the rights and responsibilities in becoming tomorrow's business leaders.
Certainly, in light of recent corporate scandals, FBLA-PBL's dedication to promoting business ethics is of great importance.
Business cannot advance without such virtues as cooperation, courage, honesty, industry, innovation, practicality, and realism. It needs the rule of law, respect for the truth, and an educated populace. No matter how strong the business model, a loss of confidence in these basic values can be catastrophicnot just to individual investors, but to the company or institution. This is exactly what happened in the collapse of Enron and problems with WorldCom and others. Now, more than ever, America needs strong, moral leaders.
I wish FBLA-PBL well as they continue in the effort of helping to train and instill the values of corporate citizenship for America's Future Business Leaders.
