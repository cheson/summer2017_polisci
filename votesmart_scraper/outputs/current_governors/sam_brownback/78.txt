Governor Sam Brownback today discussed the success of his economic policy in making Kansas the best place in the nation to start a small business and raise a family.
"Kansas continues to perform as an economy of opportunity as small job creators' income growth is faster than the national rate and exceeds that of our neighboring states Colorado, Missouri and Nebraska," said Governor Brownback. "This business growth is evidence that eliminating income taxes on small businesses has encouraged Kansas entrepreneurs to start their own businesses and has attracted businesses to locate in Kansas."
