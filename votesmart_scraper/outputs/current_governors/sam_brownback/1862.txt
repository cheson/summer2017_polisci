Senate Foreign Relations Committee Holds Hearing on Public Diplomacy and Islam
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Feb. 27, 2003
Location: Washington, DC

BROWNBACK:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much and thanks for holding the hearing. I think it's an important one, an important topic and thank you both for being here to brief us and testify and answer questions.
I'd like to direct your focus right now to Iran. We've had some discussions on that and pardon me for not being able to be here for all the questioning thus far but I really want to ask you a little bit about Iran and the public diplomacy efforts in Iran and I think they're critical, crucial for what's taking place as I look and observe and have held a number of hearings in the subcommittee in previous Congresses on Iran.
You've got a real fomenting that's taking place there as one of the countries of the axis of evil. It's one the United States is certainly not going to invade or use a military option but it seems like the most positive, the best option in dealing with Iran is the public diplomacy option where you have a very ready population there that wants to hear what's taking place.
You have an enormous Diaspora in the United States that has lots of personal contacts back and forth with Iran because there is a communication that can take place back and forth and that the mixture is there for public diplomacy to be the enormous tool to really change a society that needs changing and a government that needs changing.
I draw your attention, and I'm sorry I don't have this blown up but it's a map of funding of terrorism and spread of fundamentalism by the Iranian government around the world, a lot of it in Central Asia, that's taking place in a number of other different places. But this is a government in Iran that's really attempting to spread a message and a difficulty for us in a lot of places.
The public diplomacy efforts in Iran, some have been critical of as not being robust enough, not being targeted and supportive of the student protest movements that are taking place there, of the overall protest movements. I want to applaud some of your efforts. I want to ask you do you think you're hitting the target for the need, and you're clearly the very point in dealing with Iran and the change of that society that we most need to exercise in a robust, wise, targeted fashion? What's your estimate of your actions in Iran?
BEERS:
Well, we are doing careful and I'd say modest efforts and part of that is because of the implication that we do not want to go in as the U.S. government being pro a group of people who are trying to work out their own history. So, I would say that we need to be subtle about our support and try to make available the pieces of information and the processes that they need to learn from.
We do now just have coming up a Persian website. We also know that, you know, there are a number of difficulties into getting into Iran with the Internet and so on. When we did this "Muslim Life in America" story, we tracked the fact that some of the Pan-Arab television and some of the others had overlapped into Iran but we were not able to go in and research it or do any formal assessment of it.
BROWNBACK:
Ms. Beers, could I ask you because my time is going to be very limited here, how well are you networked into the Iranian- American community here in communications and to Iran on public diplomacy?
BEERS:
Well, I would say we just have occasional, at least those of us here in public diplomacy, have occasional meetings with them. Throughout the government, I think they have quite a ready dialog going but it brings a suggestion up that maybe we need to activate them in the same way that we did the Muslim-American group that helped us do "Muslim Life in America" where we pulled together a whole team and they took up the advocacy.
BROWNBACK:
Yes, because...
BEERS:
Maybe that's a parallel.
BROWNBACK:
Well, and I think it is a good parallel and you've got a ready population. They want to do this. They have in some cases owned television stations up and going or radio and you can do webcasting now, some opportunities or possibilities, and they really want to work and work closely with us. You got to pick, obviously, the right groups who would be credible.
BEERS:
Yes.
BROWNBACK:
And ones that would work well with you, but it may be the absolutely best option because this is Iranians speaking to Iranians.
BEERS:
Yes. The counsel we get is that these people who have good dialog are the way to work at this point and pick the right moves but thank you for that point because the Muslim-American, the Council on American Muslims' understanding has proven to be a very powerful relationship and I think we could see doing the same.
BROWNBACK:
that got several radio stations in California that would be good possibilities of broadcasting.
BEERS:
Right.
BROWNBACK:
Just taking programming even on into Iran.
BEERS:
Yes and what they will say to us is we don't need any U.S. government rubber stamps but we could use help and support and that's what we can offer.
BROWNBACK:
That's great. I've met with a number of the groups over times and I've been impressed with their abilities, their desires, their passion in a country that is extremely important.
BEERS:
Yes, timely.
BROWNBACK:
And the way we will be dealing with Iran, I think, over the future is primarily through public diplomacy.
BEERS:
And you have communications.
TOMLINSON:
I'll give you for the record what we've done in this area but I very much agree with your challenge that within the bounds of journalistic integrity that we focus more on the government of Iran and we focus more on the record of the clerics and that's what we've been doing in recent weeks and we have had extensive relations through some members of Congress with leaders of the Persian community in the United States.
But when we went 24/7 with Farda, we literally got thousands, tens of thousands or e-mails from Iran with people enthusiastically embracing what we try to do. We've been increasing the seriousness of our programming in Farda. This weekend we'll have the first "Democracy in Human Rights" roundtable. We began last week, the weekly Iran this week.
It's also important to recognize, and I'll bring over to your office later today a copy of this "New York Times" piece on the U.S. powerful weapon in Iran VOA television. VOA television has been absolutely outstanding in Persian in the work they've done and they can do more. They have two programs each week. We could do more.
Both VOA and Farda have active websites. You just would not believe, in fact we'll send you copies, would not believe the copies of the e-mails that come in from young people of Iran urging us to continue what we're doing. I think you'll be proud of that.
BROWNBECK:
Well, the people of Iran clearly want to come our way and I think we really just need to provide information and I appreciate your great work. One total sidebar, but I just got back from there, I was there at the swearing in of the new president of South Korea and met with a number of North Korean dissidents or people that had left North Korea.
That's going to be another challenge for you in public diplomacy that has some interesting opportunities now that we haven't had I think for some period of time and I'd like to engage on a total separate topic. I'd like to engage you on that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
