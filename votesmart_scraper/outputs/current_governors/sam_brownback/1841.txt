WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback applauded Senate passage today of H.R. 1307, the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003.
"I am pleased that the Senate passed legislation to provide tax relief to military personnel and their families," Brownback said. "This is absolutely the right thing to do.
"Our soldiers and their families sacrifice so much so that we can enjoy the liberties that we have in this country. We need to do a better job of showing those in the armed forces that we are a grateful nation. By providing the tax-relief provisions contained in this bill, the Senate is making a positive statement in support of our troops.
"With our nation now at war, we are made keenly aware of the great sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform. The war rightfully highlights the urgency of this legislation, but let us not forget that guarding our freedoms is a full time job. Whether we are at war or peace, this is legislation that should enjoy the full support of the Congress.
"I continue to urge our troops onward, and I ask all Kansansand all freedom-loving people around the worldto join me in praying for a speedy victory, and for the safe return of our troops to their loved ones," Brownback said.
