Statement

Location: Topeka, KS

Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement as the Legislature passed House Substitute for SB 11, designating all state employees as "essential" through Sine Die.
"Today the Legislature passed, and I will sign, House Substitute for SB 11, a bill that designates all state workers as "essential" and therefore exempt from any emergency or administrative furlough through Sine Die.
"Every state employee is essential to our success and provides needed services to the citizens of our state. All state employees should report to work as normal beginning Sunday, June 7, even though the Legislature has not yet passed a bill authorizing expenditures.
"The solution is for the Legislature to continue its work, and bring to my desk a balanced budget with sufficient revenues to pay state obligations and do so now.
"It is past time for the Legislature to act.
"If the Legislature does not pass a budget and tax policy, it leaves the state with no authority to disburse funds, including salaries. SB 11 means that employees will work without the guarantee of being paid for that work. That is potentially in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
"The circumstances creating the potential for a furlough still exist: "an immediate or imminent lack of funding to continue agency operations,' as defined by K.A.R. 1-14-11 (a)(1). Article 11, Section 4 of the Kansas Constitution requires the Legislature to provide "sufficient revenue to defray the current expenses of the state for two years and further in section 24 states that "no money shall be drawn from the treasury except in pursuance of a specific appropriation made by law'."
