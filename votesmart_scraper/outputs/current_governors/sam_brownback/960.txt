Boxer Leads Call to Restore Bush Cuts to Urban Indian Health Programs
U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and John Thune (R-SD) led a bipartisan group of their colleagues today in sending a letter to the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, urging them to restore funding for the Urban Indian Health Programs. President Bush's Fiscal Year 2009 budget eliminates funding for the program - leaving 430,000 eligible Indian users in 41 cities, including nine cities in California, without direct access to health care.
