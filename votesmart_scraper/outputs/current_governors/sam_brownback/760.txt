Brownback Cautions against Administration Plan to Shift Veterans' Health Care Costs
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback expressed deep concern over President Obama's proposal to shift health care costs from the VA to private insurance companies for veterans with service-connected disabilities.
"When service members are wounded in the line of duty, we have an obligation to pay for their health care in its entirety," said Brownback. "Wounded veterans have already paid their premiums with their blood, sweat, and tears; we shouldn't ask them to pay again."
Under the administration's proposal, the VA would be authorized to bill private insurance companies for the treatment of injuries and conditions related to military service. Brownback is concerned that this shift would increase private insurance premiums for veterans, making insurance less affordable for the veteran and his or her family. Additionally, any increase in insurance rates could discourage employers from hiring veterans.
Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.
