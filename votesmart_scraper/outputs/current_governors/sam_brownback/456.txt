Governor Brownback: New Census Data Shows Need for Rural Opportunity Zones
Press Release

Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback reacted to population data released today by the U.S. Census Bureau. The report shows overall Kansas population up 6.1% since 2000. However, many rural areas of the state saw a significant decline in population.
"It's always good to see growth but I'd like to see more balanced growth across more of the state," Governor Brownback said. "The census data shows the importance of creating Rural Opportunity Zones. We need to incentivize population growth in Kansas communities that are losing population."
The Governor's proposed Rural Opportunity Zones would focus on the areas of the state that have seen a substantial decline in population. The program would provide a 5 year income tax credit for anybody who moves from out of state into a qualified county.
"My number one priority is to get our state's economy growing again," Governor Brownback said. "Rural Opportunity Zones give rural communities economic tools to attract people and business. We need to make Kansas an attractive place to do business and raise a family."
