Most Kansans are familiar with the iconic mural in the Statehouse east wing painted by Kansas artist John Steuart Curry. Curry depicts another Kansan, the abolitionist John Brown, his arms spread wide with a Bible and a rifle in his hands as he presides over the conflagration of the Civil War.
The scene is a constant visual reminder of the role Kansas played at the headwaters of our nation's painful struggle to define America's promise of freedom and equality for all. Our great state stands fiercely for the notion that no person should ever be subjected to mastery by another.
Less well known is Curry's majestic mural in the Statehouse west wing. As Paul Harvey would say, it tells the rest of the story. It gives Kansas' answer to the unstated question, "Freedom, yes, but to what end?"
The west wing mural depicts a Kansas farmer and his wife standing straight and tall, surrounded by their children, surveying the fruits of their labor -- a barnyard full of livestock, a bountiful garden and grain gathered in the fields. In their bearing is the satisfaction of free people that is tempered with a quiet humility and gratefulness for all they have been given. In the distance, thunderclouds gather, perhaps as a testament to nature and to nature's God, which graciously gives life and yet may test our unity in times of trouble and scarcity.
These are the two stories of our state's founding. As Kansans, we hold dear the stories and images of liberty and self-determination on the one hand and responsibility and self-sufficiency on the other. Only as we continue to see our lives as rooted in both of these stories will our experiment in self-government endure over many generations.
