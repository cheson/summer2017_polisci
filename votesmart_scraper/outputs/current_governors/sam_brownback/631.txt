From the Philadelphia Inquirer:
"President Obama recently announced that Iran has been secretly constructing a nuclear facility south of Tehran. Sadly, this revelation was not surprising, given that the Iranian regime has spent years lying about its nuclear program, sponsoring terrorism, and oppressing its own citizens. Whatever one thinks about the prospects of diplomacy, it's time for tougher measures to constrain the regime's ability to acquire weapons of mass destruction before it's too late.
One promising approach is targeted divestment from Iran's energy sector. Analysts have estimated that the country requires $20 billion a year in investments in its oil and natural gas sector, which is increasingly dominated by the innermost operatives of the regime. Currently, dozens of corporations around the world cover these investments, which provide crucial funding streams for Iran's nuclear program and its support for terrorism. Furthermore, the regime's recent bloody postelection crackdown and widespread censorship suggest a massive - and costly - apparatus for domestic repression.
Because of the regime's stubborn commitment to these dangerous and belligerent activities, doing business in Iran is an increasingly risky proposition. Due to existing sanctions, credit restrictions, and other international efforts, pension-fund managers are taking extraordinarily high risks with people's money if they invest it in Iran. Moreover, there can be little doubt that the regime will cease its destructive behavior only when it is compelled to pay an economic price for it.
