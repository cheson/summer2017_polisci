Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback has signed Senate Substitute for House Bill 2014, the state's budget bill for Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012. In his budget message to the Kansas Legislature, the Governor congratulated state lawmakers on putting together a fair budget in the midst of a down economy.
"Filling a $500 million budget hole without raising taxes is a difficult task, but the Committees on Appropriations and Ways and Means and the entire House and Senate took on the challenge and produced a budget that funds state priorities while maintaining a responsible $50 million real ending balance. I am proud of everyone's hard work," Governor Brownback said.
Pursuant to Article 2, Section 14 of the Constitution of the State of Kansas, the Governor returned the HB 2014 with the following line item vetoes:
* Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation
o Veto eliminates funding for Pipeline in FY 2011 (Section 26)
* Department of Health & Environment--Division of Health Care Finance
o Veto reestablishes Preferred Mental Health Drug List (Section 108(e))
o Veto eliminates Employee Health Benefits Program 2.5% surcharge (Section 108(f))
* Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services
o Veto eliminates quarterly reporting requirement (Portion of Section 111(a))
* Kansas Arts Commission
o Veto eliminates agency operations in FY 2012 (Section 115(a) and aportion of Section 143(a))
* Across the Board Reduction
o Veto removes across the board reductions requirement to allow Governor to target the $5.9 million in spending cuts (A portion of Section 175)
The net effect of these line item vetoes will be an increase in the State General Fund ending balance of $498,000. In his message, the Governor told lawmakers he looked forward to working with them in the coming months and years as they get our state's budget and economy back on track.
"As we look toward more challenges ahead, I encourage the Legislature to join me in thoroughly reviewing areas where we can reduce the reach of state government. One of these areas is state subsidization of public broadcasting. I intend again to include no funding for public broadcasting operations grants in my FY 2013 budget, so I encourage recipients of these grants to make appropriate preparations," Brownback said.
Governor Brownback pointed out in the time period between passage of HB 2014 earlier in May and today, it is estimated that KPERS will show $4 million in additional savings in FY 2011 and $11 million in FY 2012. FY 2011 ends June 30th. FY 2012 begins July 1st.
