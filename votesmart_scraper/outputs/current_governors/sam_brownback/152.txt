Today, Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement in response to a petition for a writ of mandamus filed with the Kansas Supreme Court by Attorney General Derek Schmidt.
"I swore an oath to support the Constitution of the State of Kansas. An overwhelming majority of Kansas voters amended the Constitution to include a definition of marriage as one man and one woman. Activist judges should not overrule the people of Kansas.
"I support the action taken by the Attorney General to ensure an orderly judicial process in determining this issue and to avoid the confusion created by inconsistent judicial rulings."
