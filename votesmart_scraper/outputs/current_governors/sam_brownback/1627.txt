Brownback Reacts to Ron Reagan Jr.'s Convention Speech
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today reacted to Ron Reagan's speech supporting human cloning and destructive human embryo research yesterday at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.
"To date, 45 diseases and medical conditions have been treated with adult stems cells, while there is not one successful treatment or trial for humans using embryonic stem cells," Brownback stated. "Everyone supports stem cell research and I fully support adult and non-embryonic stem cell research, which is currently providing the cures that proponents of human cloning can only hope to provide.
"However, last night's speech was deeply misleading. Ron Reagan Jr. made a point to describe his support for human cloning which is both immoral and almost universally opposed. It is wrong to create human life just to destroy it; yet that is exactly what is being proposed by those who support human cloning for research purposes. The fact that Ron Reagan Jr. did not even mention adult stem cell research, with all its recent successes, proves that despite his comments to the contrary, his was a purely political speech supporting human cloning."
