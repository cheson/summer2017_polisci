Brownback Touts Strong Conservative Credentials in South Carolina
Addressing the Palmetto Family Council via teleconference, the Senator highlights his unmatched record as a defender of life, family values and traditional marriage
COLUMBIA, SC - Although Senate votes on Iraq and crucial national security matters forced Senator Sam Brownback to address the Palmetto Family Council via teleconference instead of in person, Senator Brownback thanked the attendees for their work advancing conservative principles and highlighted his record of leadership on the values of faith, family, life and marriage.
"I am very sorry that Senate votes on Iraq, military and national security matters have prevented me from addressing you in person, as I originally hoped to do," said Senator Brownback. "I applaud your efforts advancing the conservative principles that we know are best for our nation, and I am proud to have a strong, consistent record of leadership defending the role of faith, family, life and marriage."
Senator Brownback is an unmatched champion when it comes to fighting for the values of faith, family, life and marriage:
* Just today, Senator Brownback introduced a bill that requires an ultrasound for women seeking an abortion.
* Norma McCorvey, the "Roe" of Roe v. Wade, endorsed Senator Brownback because he is "the right person, in the right place at the right time for our nation as we seek to embrace a culture of life."
* Senator Brownback showed true leadership when he convinced Ted Kennedy--yes, that Ted Kennedy--to co-sponsor a bill that would address the alarming number of babies who are aborted after being diagnosed in the womb with Down Syndrome.
* Bobby Schindler, brother of the late Terri Schiavo, endorsed Senator Brownback in recognition of his leadership and consistency, even when it was politically unpopular in Washington, to fight for his sister's life.
* Senator Brownback has no peer when it comes to advancing stem cell research and treatments that would not clone or kill human embryos, and he persuaded the Senate to pass his Fetal Farming Prohibition Act.
* In 2006, Senator Brownback's committee passed the Marriage Amendment that would protect traditional marriage from being redefined, and Senator Brownback took the lead role debating and promoting the Marriage Amendment on the national stage.
* Senator Brownback has pushed tirelessly to improve the quality of our culture and protect our children from indecent media. In 2006, when President Bush signed into law a tenfold increase in broadcast indecency fines, it was Senator Brownback's bill that made it to the president's desk. In 2005, he chaired hearings to examine pornography's impact on marriage, families and children and to strengthen the government's ability to prosecute pornographers.
* A few weeks ago, when Democrats in the U.S. Senate moved to overturn the Mexico City Policy--which prevents American taxpayer dollars from supporting overseas organizations that provide abortions--Senator Brownback lead the pro-life fight and introduced the amendment that would have kept this key pro-life policy intact.
