MR. CAVUTO: Fed boss Ben Bernanke says the economy is doing just fine, but risky mortgages bear watching, which had Wall Street badly selling. The Dow off triple digits -- close to it. So, a question: If the economy could be sputtering, is this a time for tax hiking? Well, yes, if those tax hikes are limited, says Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, and limited to just the super rich. But Republican Kansas Senator Sam Brownback says that is just super bunk, that first it's the top 1 percent then a whole lot of other percenters before you know it.
All right, Senator Klobuchar, is that true?
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Neil, I think the middle class needs help in this country. That's why a number of Democrats are proposing tax relief for middle-class people. With college tuition, with health care, it's tough on them, and these last six years have been tough on them. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent -- people making over $336,000 a year -- they've been doing just fine.
MR. CAVUTO: So, your proposal, to get it straight, is hike taxes for those making over $336,000 a year -- back to the old Clinton --
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: My proposal is to roll back the tax cuts for the people making over $336,000 in the top bracket so we can help middle- class people, the other 99 percent of us, with college tuition, with affordable health care, with gas prices. What's been happening is --
MR. CAVUTO: But your point is the 1 percent -- $336,000. Because you know, your party's kind of all over the map.
