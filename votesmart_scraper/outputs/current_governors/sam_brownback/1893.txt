Issue Position: Disabilities
two blind women crossing the street"Life, liberty and happiness" is the prominent phrase we all learn as children from the United States Constitution. We must ensure individuals with disabilities have these opportunities; this will be to the benefit of future generations. Individuals with disabilities have priceless gifts to offer society and we are a better people as a result. One of my top priorities in Congress is addressing the needs of this vital community of individuals:
Prevent discrimination: Recognize disability as a natural part of the human experience; work to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.
Promote appreciation: Individuals with disabilities so often have a perspective the rest of us don't have. We learn compassion, heroism, humility, courage, and self-sacrifice from these special individualsÂ—and their gift to us is to inspire us, by their example, to achieve these virtues ourselves.
Change individual attitudes: While we can change public policy to reflect the ideas embodied in the Americans with Disabilities Act, it is just as important to seek change at the individual level. Every human being has the ability to change ideas and action in their daily life, and every person should be treated as an individual with intrinsic human dignity and demanding of respect.
