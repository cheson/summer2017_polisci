Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement on the school finance bill passed by the Kansas House of Representatives.
"The school finance bill that passed the Kansas House today with bipartisan support increases funding to Kansas schools by $83 million and includes $74 million of property tax relief. I am pleased with the broad bipartisan support for a plan that puts money into the classrooms where it best benefits students and teachers.
"Legislation offered in February by House Democrats would have cost taxpayers more while sending only a very small portion of the additional funding to the classroom. This is unacceptable. We can and will do better. We will send the money to the classroom to help teachers teach and students learn.
"I, along with the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate, am committed to providing a solution that satisfies the court order by the end of the regular session. We will fix this. And we will do so in a way that ensures every taxpayer dollar is spent as effectively and efficiently as possible.
"I appreciate the efforts of the legislature, and especially the hard work and leadership of Speaker Merrick and President Wagle. We have an opportunity for progress.
"I will continue to work with legislative leadership until a bill reaches my desk."
