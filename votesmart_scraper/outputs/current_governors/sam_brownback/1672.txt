Brownback commends FDA decision to deny OTC status to Barr Labs morning after pill
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback this morning commended the Food and Drug Administration and the acting commissioner for yesterday's decision to deny Barr Laboratories the ability to sell Plan B, or the morning after pill, without prescription.
"I commend the FDA and Acting Commissioner Dr. Crawford for their principled decision to deny over-the-counter sales of the morning after pill," Brownback stated. "This is the right decision and is common sense. The morning after pill is an overdose of birth control. It makes no sense to offer a drug over-the-counter that is 50 times stronger than a drug that currently requires annual consults with doctors."
