Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement regarding St. Francis Hospital:
"Yesterday, I had a meeting with Mike Slubowski, the CEO of SCL Health, about the status of St. Francis Hospital. He committed to me that they would not announce a closure of St. Francis on Tuesday, and that they would work with us to find a solution that keeps St. Francis open.
"I intend to hold Mr. Slubowski to his commitment and anticipate further negotiations in the coming days and weeks. As I have said previously, St. Francis is an important local and regional health care provider, and a significant Kansas charitable asset that has long served its stated mission of improving the health of those who are poor and vulnerable."
