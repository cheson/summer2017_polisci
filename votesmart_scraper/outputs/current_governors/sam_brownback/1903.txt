K-12 Education: As a product of Kansas public schools, Sam Brownback is a strong supporter of quality schools and believes that decisions regarding our schools are, wherever possible, best left in the hands of those closest to the students.
Local school boards and the citizens to whom they are accountable know best what their students need. The priority should be on getting decisions down to the local level and dollars into the classroom where learning happens. Additionally, teachers need to know that their reasonable efforts to enforce discipline in the classroom will be supported. Our professionals deserve nothing less.
Higher Education: As a US Senator, Sam Brownback has garnered significant federal support for Kansas colleges and universities.
In addition to their powerfully important research missions which support high-value long-term job creation in Kansas, our colleges and universities need to be at the forefront in providing the professional skills and certifications demanded by employers. Kansas' system of community colleges is particularly well-positioned to help grow the size and productivity of the Kansas workforce in the 21st Century.
