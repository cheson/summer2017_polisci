Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. This is well-plowed ground. We have been around this issue since 1984, with Ronald Reagan putting this policy in place. The Boxer amendment overturns that policy. This is about taxpayer funding of abortion overseas.
We can separate the issue of abortion here altogether and say we are not going to talk about that, but this is taxpayer dollars used to support organizations supporting abortion overseas. We talk about different semantics. That is what it does. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. Clearly, 70-plus percent of the American public would be against that. Let's work on foreign policy issues and funding of things on which we have great unity, not ones on which we are divided.
I respectfully urge a vote against the amendment of my colleague, Senator Boxer.
