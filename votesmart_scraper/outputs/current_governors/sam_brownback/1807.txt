WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today held a news conference to discuss the positive findings of a recently-released analysis of the television industry by the Parents Television Council.
"Today, the children of our country have great access to many different forms of entertainment media - exposing them to a lot of sex and violence at an age when their values are still being formed. Very young children watch a stunning amount of television - averaging upwards of 3-4 hours per day," Brownback said.
"After participating in a number of press conferences like this one to announce the findings of new studies that have shown declining standards and rising levels of violence and vulgarity on television, it can be very discouraging. The media plays a significant role in shaping our attitudes and assumptions, especially among the young. Children today are being fed a steady diet of vulgar and obscene television programming that is systematically robbing them of their innocence.
