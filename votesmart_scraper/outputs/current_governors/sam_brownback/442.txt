Kansas Governor Sam Brownback released the following statement today regarding the March Labor Report released by Kansas Labor Secretary Karin Brownlee.
"The March Labor Report shows positive signs towards private sector job growth, but there are still many Kansas families feeling the effects of the Great Recession. Turning this economy around will take time, but I'm encouraged by the fact that we are trending in the right direction," Governor Brownback said.
Brownback continued, "Even still, there is a lot of work left to do in getting every Kansan who wants a job back to work. My Administration's work to create a pro-growth environment and create jobs in Kansas includes a series of "Governor's Economic Summits" as well as working with the Kansas Legislature to put in place key legislation like workers' compensation reform and allowing businesses of all sizes to expense their investments."
The March 2011 unemployment rate in Kansas was 7.1 percent, down from 7.2 percent in February 2011 and down from 7.5 percent in March 2010.
