Brownback Comments on Tanker Timeline Extension
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on conversations he, along with U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) and U.S. Representative Todd Tiahrt (R-Goddard), had with Pentagon officials about the KC-X tanker replacement schedule.
"I am concerned that the Department of Defense's 'bigger-is-better' mentality poses substantial costs to tax payers without clearly defined benefits to the warfighter," said Brownback. "Nevertheless, if DoD proceeds with a request for proposal that favors a large tanker, it must provide adequate time for competitors to offer bids."
Brownback, Roberts and Tiahrt recently held discussions with Pentagon officials about the timeline for the Air Force KC-X tanker replacement bid. It is clear there have been significant changes made in the bidding evaluation that favor a French aircraft.
Brownback continued, "The original competition included numerous delays to accommodate the bidders' proposals. DoD should not attempt to rush the completion of this award after substantially changing the way it will score the proposals. This contract is too big and too important to sole source. There must be a full and fair competition, which should include a reasonable amount of time for the competitors to offer their proposals."
In a bi-partisan letter sent last week, the lawmakers asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates to allow more time for the revised RFP to be understood by the bidders.
