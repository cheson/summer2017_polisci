BURMESE WAR CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues in the Senate to a new report by a credible organization based on the Thailand-Burma border. In "Shattering Silences," the Karen Women's Organization has carefully investigated and recorded the Burmese military regime's use of rape as a weapon of war against ethnic minority women, revealing a shockingly brutal and callous practice.
The report documents that both young and old women are being raped, and usually very brutally. Forty percent of the rapes committed by the regime's soldiers were gang rapes, and over one-quarter of the women were killed after being raped.
This horrifying evidence, which echoes previous documentation conducted by our own State Department, suggests that Burma's regime is deliberately using rape as a weapon to terrorize and subjugate the Burmese people. Fifty percent of the rapes were committed by officers in the military regime.
Many of us hoped that after the exposure of the use of rape as a weapon in Bosnia, the practice would come to an end. Sadly, our hopes have not been fulfilled, and Burma is the new Bosnia. To be a woman in Burma's ethnic states is to live in constant fear of sexual violence and murder.
Ever since the United States imposed economic sanctions on Burma last year, the ruling regime has made repeated promises of a so-called transition to democracy. The rapes documented in this report show what many of us have known for a very long time; that promises by this regime are meaningless. Our State Department must take a lead in condemning these horrific acts and move to rally support for international sanctions on Burma. We cannot wait any longer, while more women face the war crimes committed by Burma's dictators.
