Governor Sam Brownback today signed Executive Order 15-03 establishing the Governor's Social Services Policy Council to help improve social service policies and continue the decrease in poverty levels in the state.
In establishing the Council, Governor Brownback cited three main goals focused on obtaining an education, finding a job and building a family for reducing poverty and providing a path to prosperity. A 2012 Heritage Foundation study found that poverty can almost entirely be avoided through these three factors and that marriage further reduces the probability of poverty by 82 percent.
The primary goals of the Council are to:
Increase the number of young Kansans who graduate from high school, pursue higher education and develop technical skills needed in the workforce.
Expand opportunities to help Kansans receiving food stamps and cash assistance to develop skills and find gainful employment as a path to prosperity.
Create policies that encourage healthy marriage and strong families, or which at a minimum do not provide disincentives to marriage.
"I remain focused on helping Kansans in need and making our state the best one in which to raise a family," the Governor said. "We must break the cycle of poverty and ensure our social service programs help all Kansans to be self-sufficient."
The EO takes effect immediately and will sunset in January 2019. The Council will consist of seven to 13 members appointed by the Governor and meet at the request of the Governor but no less than twice per year. The Department for Children and Families will provide support to the council on request.
