Governor Reorganizes Kansas Agriculture Agencies
Press Release
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Feb. 8, 2011
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed Executive Reorganization Order No. 40 today to consolidate various agriculture-related state agencies under the Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA).
"My number one priority is to get our state's economy growing again. As a key member of my Growth Team, the KDA oversees a very important part of our economy. Bringing our agriculture-related agencies under its direction will make state government leaner, more responsive to the needs of Kansans, and better to react in our challenging economy," said Governor Brownback.
The following changes would occur under the order:
· The Agriculture Products Development Division within the Department of Commerce will be transferred to the KDA and renamed the Marketing and Promotions Program.
· The Kansas Animal Health Department and the Livestock Commissioner will be consolidated within the KDA as the Animal Health Division headed by the Animal Health Commissioner.
· The State Conservation Commission and the Commission Executive Director will be consolidated within the KDA as the Conservation Division headed by the Conservation Executive Director.
"The Governor's consolidation of agriculture-related agencies will make KDA a stronger leader and advocate for the agricultural industry. The collaboration and cooperation created by being in one agency will provide improved service to Kansas' farmers, ranchers, and consumers," KDA Secretary Dale Rodman said.
The order would be official on July 1, 2011 if the Kansas Legislature does not reject it.
