Press Release

Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback said today Friday's meeting in Omaha of the governors whose states border along the Missouri River system will focus on them having one voice.
"The top priority for every governor along the Missouri River system is flood control and I certainly support that view. Governor Brownback said. "There are other issues that are important. Particularly in Kansas, we have concerns about water supply for our communities who depend on the Missouri River as their water resource."
Brownback continued, "Tomorrow's meeting with my fellow governors is an opportunity for us to stand together and deliver a clear message that from Montana to Missouri, flood control should be the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' number one priority when it comes to management of the river."
Governor Brownback will join Gov. Jack Dalrymple (ND), Gov. Dennis Daugaard (SD), Gov. Jay Nixon (MO), Gov. Brian Schweitzer (MT), Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds (IA) and a representative for Gov. Matthew Mead (WY) at the meeting hosted by Gov. Dave Heineman (NE).
