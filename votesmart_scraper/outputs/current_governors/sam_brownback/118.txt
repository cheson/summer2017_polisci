I am pleased to sign Senate Bill 45 bill today. I have been -- and continue to be -- a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights.
Responsible gun ownership -- for protection and sport -- is a right inherent in our Constitution. It is a right that Kansans hold dear and have repeatedly and overwhelmingly reaffirmed a commitment to protecting.
I will continue to fight for and protect the Second Amendment rights of all Kansans.
Let me clarify a few points. This bill does not eliminate our existing concealed carry permit process. It simply removes an administrative process for those Kansans who want a firearm for use within the state.
Kansans who take their firearm out of the state still must have a concealed carry permit and businesses can still post "no concealed carry" requirements if they choose to do so.
I strongly encourage anyone who has a gun -- for protection or sport -- to take advantage of existing safety training courses, whether for hunter safety or general gun safety.
Five other states have this law on their books - Alaska, Arizona, Vermont, Arkansas and Wyoming -- and nine other state legislatures are currently considering similar bills.
This law supports the Constitutional right of Kansans to keep and bear arms. As a supporter of the Second Amendment, I am pleased to sign SB 45 today.
