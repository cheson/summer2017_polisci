Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement on the April revenue report:
"What we are seeing today is the effect of tax increases implemented by the Obama administration that resulted in lower income tax payments and a depressed business environment.
"Many taxpayers took advantage of capital gains and other income in the 2012 tax year to take advantage of favorable tax rates set to expire Jan. 1, 2013. The failed economic policies of the Obama administration are affecting states throughout the nation. It is more important than ever that we continue our focus on growing jobs and creating a business-friendly environment that benefits Kansans.
"Our pro-growth economic policies have resulted in one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation and the creation of more than 50,000 new jobs since January 2011."
