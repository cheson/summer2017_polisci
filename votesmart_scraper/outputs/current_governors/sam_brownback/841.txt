THE VETERANS BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (Senate - September 18, 2008)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Minnesota. I have a map that shows the wind energy capital of the world, the Saudi Arabia of wind, right in the middle of our country. I have a nice corner here in Minnesota with some good wind power. We have a lot right here in the middle of the country in Kansas and we want to harvest it. I am delighted to see that the wind energy piece in the production tax credits is in the bill, the tax extenders bill. That is what I wanted to come to the floor, because it is critical to the investment taking place for wind power generation. We are doing that in this particular bill.
I, as well as my colleague from Minnesota, wish to see these production tax credits extended for a series of years rather than one; planning that arrives in a 3 to 5-year window would give a lot better opportunity for capital to come into the business. I think this is a critical piece we have to get done.
I met with my Kansas wind energy associates yesterday, people putting in these units on a big scale, and small scale. They are saying we need to have these credits in place.
I was at Pratt Community College about a month ago. They have put in three midsize wind turbines that are cutting down the community college's electric bill about $1,000 a week. They are looking at it and saying this credit is a great one, it has a nice payoff. It is right in this zone where we have high wind electric generation. It is working and working well.
