HEARING STATEMENT
SUBCOMMITTEE ON
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS
EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF A FLAT FEDERAL INCOMETAX IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
CHAIRMAN SAM BROWNBACK
MARCH 8, 2006
Good morning. This hearing will come to order. Today we will begin to explore how we might test a fairer, simpler tax system in the District of Columbia.
I believe that a voluntary flat federal income tax for District of Columbia residents would give us real-world, valuable information about whether a flat tax is actually better than the current cumbersome system.
I believe most taxpayers in the District of Columbia would welcome this opportunity. But since I do not believe that we should merely impose a new system on DC taxpayers overnight, I would suggest that those who want to stay under the current system should feel free to do so. I think, however, that if people are given a chance, they will abandon the current burdensome system.
Every year, taxpayers in the District of Columbia suffer like all Americans from the burden of our complex and complicated tax code, confused by over 800 different IRS tax forms, perplexed by hundreds of pages of IRS instruction books, and nervous that they will make a mistake trying to calculate how much of their own money they have to hand over to the federal government.
