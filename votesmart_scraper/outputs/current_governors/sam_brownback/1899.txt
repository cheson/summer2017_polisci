Kansas has played a significant role in a great journey of unlimited promise that began in this country 100 years ago - The Journey of Powered Flight.
We have led the world in amazing technological advances and the development of innovative products throughout this journey. This journey flew through the "Plains of Kansas" in the 1920's and early 30's where some of the original aviation entrepreneurs (Clyde Cessna, Walter & Olive Ann Beech, and Lloyd Stearman) formed the companies that continue to be leaders in general aviation today.
The Boeing Company established its presence during this timeframe and experienced a major expansion in its Kansas operations during WWII. Bill Lear brought the development and first flight of the original business jet - Learjet 23 - which occurred at Wichita's Mid-Continent in 1963. These fine companies and many more like them are why Wichita, Kansas is known throughout the global industry as the "Air Capital of the World." The wonderful success of the Kansas and United States aerospace industry during this time period has had a direct impact on the strength of our economy, national security posture, and our leadership role in the world.
In aviation, I am a strong advocate for increased funding of basic aviation research, opening international markets for aviation products and services, as well as tax and regulatory reform to increase the international competitiveness of the aircraft industry.
