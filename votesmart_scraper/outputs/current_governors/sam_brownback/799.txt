BROWNBACK DISMAYED WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S REVERSAL OF MEXICO CITY POLICY
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today expressed concern that President Obama, by executive order, overturned the ban on federal funding for international groups that promote or perform abortions. The ban, commonly referred to as Mexico City Policy, was first implemented by President Regan in the 1980s.
"Today America took a big step away from the goal of promoting respect for every human life," said Brownback. "It is especially disconcerting that President Obama signed this executive order the day after the March for Life, when so many people marched in support of protecting the lives of the unborn. Our message to developing nations should not be one that encourages abortion; it should instead be a message that embraces a culture of life. It is just plain wrong to use American taxpayers' dollars to help fund or promote abortions at home or abroad."
