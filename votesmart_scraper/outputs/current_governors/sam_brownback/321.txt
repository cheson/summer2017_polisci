Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement today regarding the Kansas Legislature approving HB 2333, KPERS Reform Legislation.
"For decades, state government shifted the burden of providing for state employees' retirement to future Legislatures. As a result, Kansas has one of the most underfunded pension plans in the country. The KPERS reform legislation on its way to my desk will ensure state employees have a retirement system that is stable. State employees work hard to deliver services important to Kansans and they deserve a fair and funded pension system."
