Brownback Comments on 9/11 Commission Report
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the release of the 9/11 Commission Report.
"Yesterday, the 9/11 Commission released its report, which highlights the need for our nation to look to protecting our future rather than looking for blame in the past," Brownback stated. "Many of the recommendations in the report are already being implemented, and I strongly urge my colleagues in Congress to work quickly to turn the effective recommendations in the report into a cohesive legislative package."
The 9/11 Commission, made up of five Republicans and five Democrats, released the report on Thursday after a 20 month investigation into the deadliest terror attack in American history.
Brownback continued, "It is clear that we must improve both our collective emergency response capabilities as well significantly increase and coordinate our intelligence operations. We must be vigilant as a nation to avoid complacency. I would like to thank the Commission for its diligent work and I look forward to working with my colleagues in protecting our nation and winning the war on terror."
