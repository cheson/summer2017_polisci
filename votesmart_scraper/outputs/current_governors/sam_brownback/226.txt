Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement on today's shutdown of the federal government:
"A federal government shutdown has loomed as a possibility for some time now. We are focused on problem-solving and are taking steps to help minimize the effects of a federal government shutdown. We have built up a healthy cash reserve with more than $400 million in the bank and are actively working with our state agencies to minimize any disruptions to services. We are as prepared as we can be for it, and we expect that it will eventually be resolved."
