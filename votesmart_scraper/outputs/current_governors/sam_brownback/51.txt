Governor Sam Brownback today issued a statement outlining his plan to balance the state's budget.
Budget Director Shawn Sullivan presented the Governor's three options for balancing the budget following the Consensus Revenue Estimating Group's adjusted anticipated revenue numbers for Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017.
Expected revenues for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2016 were adjusted downward by $93.9 million. For Fiscal Year 2017, revenue is expected to be $134.7 million less than previously estimated.
The Governor announced three budget balancing options for the Legislature to consider. In the first option, the Governor would use his special allotment authority to reduce most of the remaining sales tax going into the State Highway Fund, transferring $70 million to the State General Fund in FY 2016 and $115 million in FY 2017. The Governor would also carry forward into FY 2017 the 3 percent reduction made to universities in FY 2016. Also included is the securitization of future tobacco settlement payments in excess of $42 million for an estimated one-time infusion of approximately $158 million in Fiscal Year 2017. The securitization requires legislative approval. The Children's Initiative Fund programs would continue to receive funding at their current appropriation level of $42 million per year.
In the second option, in addition to transferring sales tax from the State Highway Fund the Governor, with legislative approval through a budget proviso, would delay the Fiscal Year 2016 fourth quarter KPERS payment and delay its repayment until Fiscal Year 2018. Through special allotment authority from the legislature the Governor also would find an additional $25 million in targeted efficiency savings.
The final option also includes the transfer of sales tax from the State Highway Fund through the Governor's special allotment authority. The Legislature would pass a budget with expenditure reductions of 3 percent to 5 percent for most state agencies, for Fiscal Year 2017.
