Brownback Offers Condolences, Sympathy to Victims of Earthquake in China
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback offered condolences to the people struggling in the aftermath of the earthquake that hit China early this week.
"I join all of those around the world whose thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the devastating earthquake that hit China this week," said Brownback. "My deepest sympathies are with the families who have lost loved ones. The Chinese people face an overwhelming task now as they attempt to put their lives back together, and the global community is united in helping them to rebuild."
According to recent news report, the Chinese government today put the death toll at just over 22,000 but has said it expects deaths to exceed 50,000. About 4.8 million people are now homeless as a result of the earthquake.
