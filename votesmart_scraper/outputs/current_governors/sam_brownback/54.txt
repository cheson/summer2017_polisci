Budget Director Shawn Sullivan today notified KPERS executive director Alan Conroy that the scheduled April 15 fund transfer would be temporarily delayed.
"A delay in the payment does not affect benefits to any KPERS members," Sullivan said. "No decision has been made as to whether this will be used as a budget balancing tool for this fiscal year, but this action allows us to maintain the flexibility provided by the legislature through the budget bill as we wait for the Consensus Revenue Estimating (CRE) group to provide new revenue numbers later this month."
Since taking office Governor Sam Brownback, with the support of the legislature, has significantly increased the State's investment in KPERS. The average State General Fund contribution to KPERS from fiscal years 2001 to 2010 was $181.5 million per year. This has increased to an average contribution of $387.8 million per year from fiscal years 2012 to 2015.
State contributions to KPERS in the past five years far exceed those made by previous administrations in the preceding 10 years. The KPERS funded balance has increased from 54 percent in 2012 to 67 percent as of Dec. 15, 2015.
The CRE is scheduled to meet on April 20. Sullivan will hold a press conference that afternoon to discuss the revenue projections and options for balancing the budget.
