Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, along with Adjutant General Lee Tafanelli, today met with civic leaders and emergency response personnel in Barber County as efforts to control the grass wildfire continue.
The Governor and Adjutant General viewed the fire damage from the air and then met with community leaders, fire fighters and incident management teams working out of the Barber County emergency operations center. In the field, they met with firefighters from numerous Kansas counties who had deployed to assist in controlling the fire which has consumed an estimated 300,000 acres.
"The local response system is working as it should, supported through mutual aid agreements and state resources," said Governor Brownback. "Local communities are our first responders in the event of an emergency. The investment that has been made in ensuring those communities have the equipment and training they need is critical to an effective comprehensive emergency management system. That system is working well."
Since 2004, much of the homeland security emergency strategy has focused on providing training, equipment and planning exercises at the local level. The state's role is to be ready to coordinate state and federal actions as requested.
The Kansas Division of Emergency Management continues to monitor the grass fires and is coordinating resources. The State Emergency Operations Center continues to operate at a 24-hour "watch level."
