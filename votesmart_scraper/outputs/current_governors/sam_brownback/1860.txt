PAKISTAN'S COOPERATION IN THE WAR ON TERRORISM
Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I draw the attention of my colleagues to an event that happened yesterday which was very impressiveÂ—catching a key terrorist in Pakistan. It was the front page top story in virtually all of our newspapers around the country, probably around the world, with his picture. This is a person we have sought for some period of time. This was a big catch.
I do not want to focus on the individual. What I want to focus on is the cooperation we received from Pakistan and from the Pakistani authorities in making this possible. This capture could lead us to many more terrorists in the al-Qaida network who plague us, and it is very important for us.
I particularly want to thank the Pakistani authorities, the Pakistani Government, President Musharraf, and others who helped in this cooperation to get this done.
President Musharraf and his government, in facing a population in Pakistan that is frequently not pro United States, has worked very closely and very carefully with us in dealing with terrorists and now has yielded one of the largest, if not the largest, terrorist captures we have had in recent times, if not in recent memory altogether. That is something we should take note of, and we should be appreciative of those who have cooperated with us. Not all governments around the world cooperate with the United States. Not all are in as difficult a situation as Pakistan is where a substantial portion of the population does not want their government to be working with the United States, and yet we had the two come together taking on the issue of terrorism, even though it is difficult in their own country to do it, and we netted a major terrorist capture. We still want and we are still looking for, if he is alive, which he apparently probably is, Osama bin Laden, but second to him, this is probably the largest capture we could ask to have taken place.
I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. I do say thank you to the Government of Pakistan for its help in this capture of a major operative in the war on terrorism.
