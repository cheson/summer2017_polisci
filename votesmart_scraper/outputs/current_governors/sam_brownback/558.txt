Brownback Applauds Senate Passage of Bill Calling for Full Implementation of Comprehensive Peace Agreement
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback applauded Senate passage of S. Res. 404, a bipartisan resolution calling for full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan.
"Senate passage of this bipartisan resolution sends a clear signal to the government of Khartoum that the United States remains steadfast in its commitment to help foster peace and stability in Sudan," said Brownback. "As important Comprehensive Peace Agreement milestones approach in Sudan, it is critical that the U.S. and international community support full implementation of the agreement and be in a position to respond to all possible outcomes of the April elections and the 2011 referendum."
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed in 2005, ending a 21-year long civil war between North and South Sudan. Among other provisions, the agreement established a six-year interim period to implement democratic reforms. At the end of the six years, in 2011, the South is to hold a referendum on self-determination, with the option to become an independent state.
