Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed eight bills into law Thursday, bringing the total number of bills signed by the governor during the 2013 Legislative Session to 76. He also vetoed one bill, Senate Bill 37.
SB 37 would have repealed the sunset of the Kansas Home Inspectors Professional Competence and Financial Responsibility Act that is set to expire on July 1, 2013.
In his veto message to the Kansas Legislature, Governor Brownback shared his concerns about whether the potential harm inflicted upon the citizens of Kansas by unscrupulous home inspectors warrants the expansion of government and increased regulation that was applied in 2008 to this segment of the private sector.
"Upon review of the materials provided by the proponents of this legislation, both in 2008 and 2013, I see little evidence of large numbers of Kansas citizens being economically harmed by home inspectors. In fact, even the proponents believe the vast majority of Kansans who provide this service are honest people. Therefore, it appears the legislation passed in 2008 may simply add unnecessary fees and regulations to law abiding citizens," Gov. Brownback wrote.
The Governor also noted that it appears the board lacks the resources and expertise to effectively regulate home inspectors in Kansas and that the Kansas Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division is better equipped with its professional staff experienced in conducting investigations and assisting Kansans seeking reimbursement.
In his veto message, Governor Brownback acknowledged the Legislature's support of the board and told lawmakers he would sign a similar bill that extended the sunset for two years so there would be time for further consideration and discussion whether to continue the board.
