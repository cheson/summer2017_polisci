SEN. BROWNBACK: Thanks a bunch, Alcee. Thank you, Alcee.
Welcome to Washington. Delighted to have you here. Sorry the weather isn't better. This is Washington, and it's summer, and this is the way the place is.
I want to congratulate Congressman Hastings for the great job that he's doing in organizing and hosting this. Would you join me in giving him a round of applause in recognition? (Applause.) Good show. Good job.
We had an opportunity to work and serve together in the House before I went to the Senate, and he's an outstanding and dynamic congressman and a leader in very -- a number of fields.
We're delighted to have you in our young country. We're only 229 years old. We hope you can get a chance to see some of the sights, get to our Capitol, which the British burned down in 1812. But we've built it back since that period of time. Nobody's counting or I'm not reminding people of things that happened in the past, but we hope you can get around and see some of the famous places and the sights that are taking place here.
