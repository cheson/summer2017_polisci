Brownback Comments on Latest Version of Health Care Overhaul Legislation
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the White House's latest version of health care overhaul legislation and called on Democrats to forgo using reconciliation to pass their bill.
"I urge the Democrats in Congress not to use reconciliation to force through health care reform," said Brownback. "This won't work and will anger the nation even more. Congressional leaders need to take a step back go through the normal committee process and engage all the members of Congress, not just their party."
The White House today outlined President Obama's new plan for health care overhaul legislation. The White House estimated that the plan would cost $950 billion. A White House aide alluded to plans to encourage Democrat Leadership to pass the legislation using a procedural move known as "budget reconciliation." If this option is pursued, the bill could pass without a single Republican vote in support of the bill.
