U.S. Senators Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts of Kansas today commented on the announcement that the Big 12 will continue as a strong and vibrant academic and athletic conference.

Roberts said, "I am pleased the Big 12 is largely preserved for our Universities, the state and the fans who have enjoyed the rivalry, and the benefits of membership in this conference. This effort was not just about sports, but was also about preserving the economic benefit the Big 12 has brought to Kansas communities, and to those up and down the heartland."

Last night it was reported that the ten remaining schools of the Big 12 Conference would not leave the conference and continue to work together to strengthen the conference.

Brownback stated, "This is great news for everyone in Big 12 country and preserves over 100 years of friendly rivalries. Congratulations to the Big 12 and thanks to everyone who worked together to keep the conference strong. This was a clear example of what can be accomplished when everyone works together for a common goal and how much stronger Kansas is when KU and K-State work together. This is good news for research and academic pursuits, and good economic news for areas like Kansas City which create good jobs and grow the economy hosting conference events."
