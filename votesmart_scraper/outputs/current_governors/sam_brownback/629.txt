U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the signing into law of the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act. The legislation secures funding for veterans' health care one year in advance of the regular appropriations process. "Veterans service organizations have asked for a budget that is timely and predictable," said Brownback. "I am proud to have co-sponsored a bill that removes the threat of late-funding of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Our veterans deserve nothing less than reliable, quality health care."
The Veterans Administration is currently funded year-by-year, which has resulted in late funding for twenty of the past twenty-three years. Advance funding will be provided to three Veterans Health Administration accounts - medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities - and takes effect with the fiscal year 2011 budget. The bill will ensure transparency in the funding process by requiring public reports and Government Accountability Office audits on VA's funding forecasting.
