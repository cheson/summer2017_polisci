Brownback, Roberts, Congressman Tiahrt: Air Force to Re-Compete Tanker Contract
U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS), Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Congressman Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) today announced the Department of Defense acknowledged mistakes in the procurement process that selected Airbus over the Boeing Company to build the nation's new aerial refueling tanker and that the Department of Defense will re-compete the contract in an expedited process.
"I am pleased that Secretary Gates is actively involved in this process now and has made a commitment to get it right," Brownback said. "The issues identified in the GAO report were so significant that nothing short of a re-compete will meet the standard required by the American people to have an appropriate level of confidence in this decision and move the program forward.
"We will continue to monitor this process very closely until the ultimate contract award. We believe that the Boeing KC-767 Advanced Tanker is the right platform for the mission and look forward to the day when the first one is delivered to the Air Force on the Boeing Ramp in Wichita."
"I am pleased to see that the Department of Defense and the Air Force have moved to restore the confidence of the Congress and the American people with this decision to re-compete the contract," Roberts said. "There have been critical errors in the procurement of this tanker, and we will work to ensure that this does not happen again so that the best possible tanker is selected for the warfighter. We will need to see the details of the next request for proposal, but this is certainly the right step forward."
