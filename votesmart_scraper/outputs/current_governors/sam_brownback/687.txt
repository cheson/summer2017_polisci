Brownback Announces NBAF Funding
Senate passes Homeland Security funding bill with $36.3 million for new Kansas facility
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced Senate passage of funding for the new National Bio and Agro Defense Facility to be located in Manhattan, Kansas. The Kansas delegation has been working hard to win the selection process and fund the project. This year's request for NBAF was fully funded in the Senate bill.
"I am very pleased the Senate recognizes the importance of funding the construction of the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility contained in the Department of Homeland Security's appropriations bill," Brownback said. "We fought hard for this funding and I'm glad my colleagues in the Senate realized the significant role this facility will play in researching emerging diseases that could endanger our food supply. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House that are on the conference committee in helping them recognize the importance of this facility, as well."
NBAF funding is currently only included in the Senate Appropriations bill. A conference committee will reconcile the two appropriations bills before final passage by both chambers of Congress. The Kansas delegation will fight to keep NBAF funding in the final report.
Brownback continued, "DHS Secretary Napolitano has indicated her strong support and the administration's intentions to move forward with the decision to build NBAF in Kansas. This is important for Kansas and for the country."
