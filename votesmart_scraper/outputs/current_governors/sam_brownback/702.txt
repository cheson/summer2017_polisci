Brownback Lauds Successful Airborne Laser Test
Congratulates Missile Defense Agency, industry team on successful in-flight test of laser tracking system
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on successful tests of the Airborne Laser tracking system over the weekend.
"The ABL continues to make history," Brownback said. "Last Saturday, for the first time, a boosting missile was tracked by lasers able to compensate for atmospheric conditions and remain locked on target for an extended period of time."
The Airborne Laser is a modified Boeing 747 that carries laser systems designed to track and destroy ballistic missiles during the early, or boost, stages of flight. The ABL consists of three lasers, a tracking laser, an environmental laser that compensates for atmospheric variables, and a weaponized laser, all working in conjunction to track and destroy missiles in their boost phase. The successful test was conducted this weekend while the plane was in flight and was able to continuously track a launched missile.
Brownback continued, "I want to congratulate the Missile Defense Agency and its industry partners on this test. Every day, their hard work brings us a step closer to having a boost phase defense against ballistic missile threats. Especially with North Korea's recent provocative behavior, ABL's progress is more important than ever."
The Airborne Laser is scheduled to undergo a series of tests this summer, culminating in a full system test to shoot down a missile this fall.
