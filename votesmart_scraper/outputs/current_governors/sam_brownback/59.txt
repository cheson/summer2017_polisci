In accordance with Executive Order 10-12, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff from sun-up to sun-down starting Monday, March 7 through Friday, March 11 to honor the passing of First Lady Nancy Reagan.
The White House issued a proclamation ordering flags across the nation to be lowered in First Lady Nancy Reagan's memory. Her funeral has been scheduled for Friday, March 11 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.
"First Lady Nancy Reagan was devoted to both her nation and her husband," said Governor Brownback. "She led with strength, poise, and dignity during her time as First Lady. Mary and I send our prayers and condolences to the Reagan family."
Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer, M.D. served as a Reagan White House fellow from 1988 through 1989.
"I've always admired Nancy Reagan for her conviction, her gracious leadership, and her steadfast support of her husband," Colyer said. "She was Ronnie's true love and confidante. She served our nation faithfully and will be greatly missed."
