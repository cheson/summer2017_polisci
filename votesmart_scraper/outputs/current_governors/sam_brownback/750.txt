CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010--Continued -- (Senate - April 02, 2009)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, to briefly respond to the Senator from Massachusetts, the chairman of the distinguished Foreign Relations Committee has raised a serious issue about Ambassador Hill.
A number of us on our side have serious questions about Ambassador Hill and how he conducted himself in the last assignment. I would like to see what some of those instructions were from that assignment.
I recognize the seriousness of the situation we are in in Iraq, no question about that. But I have serious reservations about his position in going to that. I think this will be a good period of time for us to get some of these questions answered from the State Department.
I have proffered a letter to them. I have some serious questions about what took place during the negotiations with North Korea and a possible missile launch that will take place even in this interim, and this was our lead negotiator there.
For those reasons, I, amongst others, am raising questions at this time. I think they need to be answered before he is approved for such an important spot for the United States.
