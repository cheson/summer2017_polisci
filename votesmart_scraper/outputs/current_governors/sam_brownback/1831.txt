Brownback Chairs Hearing on Trafficking in Women and Children
Wednesday, April 9, 2003
WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today chaired a hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, entitled "Trafficking in Women and Children in East Asia and Beyond: A Review of U.S. Policy."
"My personal involvement on the issue of human trafficking goes back to two areas," Brownback said. "The first, a harrowing, but not uncommon tale of girls from a place like Kansas culled, conned and coerced into being prostitutes. Promised with an opportunity for a new life, employment in a legitimate occupation, education or passage to a more prosperous place like the United States, these girls soon find that their enticers have no intention of fulfilling their promises. Maybe chained or imprisoned and almost always threatened with violence, they become a commodity for exploitation by criminal elements.
"Second, comes from my experience with Sudan and the realization that slavery, as Kevin Bales and many others will tell you, is still prevalent in some dark corners of the world. Perhaps the most personally degrading practice is slavery, which, incredibly, still exists in the Sudan. It is tolerated, if not accommodated, by the national government against its own people. Tens of thousands of Sudanese presently exist as chattel property, owned by masters who force their captives into hard labor and sexual concubinage.
"The president has commitment to vigorously enforcing U.S. laws against traffickers, raising awareness in the U.S. and abroad about trafficking and identifying, protecting and assisting victims. More importantly, the president emphasized the importance of using the full range of our diplomatic and foreign policy arsenal to work with other nations, the UN and other multilateral arenas to draft and enforce laws against trafficking.
"I would like to note the absence of a particularly remarkable individual who I worked with closely for many years and with whom I developed a fond relationshipÂ—Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. As you all know, Paul was tragically killed in a plane crash last year. We worked together on the trafficking issue very successfully for many years on the Near East/South Asia subcommittee. He was a good friend, a tireless advocate and a great colleague. I think Senator Kerry will be a fine person to work with in this subcommittee, but I wanted to just take a moment to remember Paul," Brownback said.
