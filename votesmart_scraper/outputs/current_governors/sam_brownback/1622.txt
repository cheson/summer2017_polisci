Brownback Commends Powell Declaration of Genocide in Sudan
Committee hearing examines State Department report
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commended Secretary of State Colin Powell's declaration that genocide is taking place in Sudan, and praised the leadership of President Bush on the Sudan issue. Powell spoke at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in which he presented an official State Department report on the atrocities occurring in Sudan.
"Today Secretary Powell and the State Department reaffirmed the conclusion of the U.S. Congress that genocide is taking place in Sudan," Brownback said. "It is now clear that the Bush Administration and Congress officially recognize the situation in Sudan for what it is: the killing of tens of thousands of innocent people, simply because of their race. President Bush's personal leadership on this issue began with the naming of Jack Danforth as a special envoy to the Sudan in 2001.
"I applaud and thank Secretary Powell for taking such a strong and principled step. The United States cannot and should not resolve this crisis alone. The international community must step up. Given the overwhelming facts regarding the Khartoum regime, how long can the international community continue to turn a blind eye and say that they see no evil? How many more people will have to die before the international community takes action as soon as possible beyond just setting another deadline for better behavior?"
