From the time we took office in 2011, our mission has been to make Kansas the best state in which to raise a family and start a business. We focused on five measurable goals:
Increasing net personal income
Increasing private sector employment
Increasing the percentage of 4th graders reading at grade level
Increasing the percentage of high school graduates who are career- or college-ready
Decreasing the percentage of Kansas children who live in poverty
Read how we've reached these goals here.
The Next Four Years
Our Road Map for Kansas is working. But we can't stop now.
