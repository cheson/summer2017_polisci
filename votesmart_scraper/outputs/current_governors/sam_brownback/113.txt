On April 20, Governor Sam Brownback vetoed House Substitute for SB 117, The Creation of Kansas Transportation Network Company Services Act, more commonly referred to as the "Uber bill." The Governor issued the following statement in response to today's override of that veto.
"As I said when I vetoed this bill, Kansas should be known as a state that welcomes and embraces innovation and the economic growth that comes with it. Over-regulation of businesses discourages investment and harms the open and free marketplace. Uber, and other innovative businesses, should be encouraged to operate, grow and create jobs here in Kansas."
