Brownback Votes In Favor of Highway Trust Fund Act
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today voted in favor of H.R. 3357, the Highway Trust Fund Act, legislation that will transfer $7 billion from the General Fund to the Highway Trust Fund.
"With the Highway Trust Fund set to expire at the end of next month, it was critical to pass legislation to ensure the Kansas Department of Transportation has the necessary funding to continue work on important highway and infrastructure projects," said Brownback. "While this funding is important, it is only a temporary fix. It is essential for Congress to work on a comprehensive transportation bill to address many of the funding shortfalls that have burdened state transportation departments across the nation."
Last week, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee reported out an 18 month extension of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A legacy for Users. This extension was necessary to allow funds within the Highway Trust Fund to be expended after September 30, 2009.
Brownback is a member of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
