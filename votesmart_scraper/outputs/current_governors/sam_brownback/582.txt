Grassley urges Senate leader to open up health care negotiations
Senator Chuck Grassley was one of 40 senators who signed a letter sent today to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid urging him to open the doors to on-going closed-door negotiations among lawmakers over health care reform legislation.
On December 30, C-SPAN requested that all important negotiations during the conference to reconcile differences between the health care bills passed by the House and Senate be open to electronic media coverage. http://www.politico.com/static/PPM116_cspan.html President Obama promised televised negotiations during his 2008 campaign.
Grassley said that the impact of pending health care reform legislation is so massive that transparency is more important than ever. "The people's business sould be public," he said.
