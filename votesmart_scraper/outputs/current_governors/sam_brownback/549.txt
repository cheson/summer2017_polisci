U.S. Senator Sam Brownback tonight released the following statement regarding efforts in the House to pass their health care bill and the White House's plans to use an Executive Order to bypass the legislative process.

"Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats keep coming up with more and more creative ways to get their health care bill signed into law at all costs. The latest attempt is to force the House to vote on a bill that requires taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions, even though it goes against almost 35 years of law through the Hyde Amendment and goes against the already approved House bill which included the Stupak language.

"The latest shell game is to have the White House issue an Executive Order declaring the Hyde Language will be honored with respect to the health care bill. Executive Orders do not have the force of law and are not by any means binding. Executive Orders are added and removed constantly and change within an administration and with successive presidents.

"If the Democrats were serious about avoiding federal funding of abortion, they would put it in the bill and subject it to a vote as opposed to using sleight of hand to cobble together a one-party coalition to pass a government takeover of over 1/6th of our economy costing over $938 billion while not lowering insurance premiums at all. All this maneuvering proves that the bill in its current form does use taxpayer funds to pay for abortion, which has been illegal since 1976.
