Brownback Applauds Senate Passage of CARFA Amendment to Budget Resolution
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage of the Brownback amendment to S.Con.Res.70, the Senate Budget Resolution. Brownback's amendment provides funds for a Commission on Budgetary Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies, which would seek to reduce unnecessary federal spending on redundant or outdated federal programs.
"I am pleased by Senate passage of my CARFA amendment which will help eliminate waste, fraud and abuse by funding through a government reform commission," said Brownback. "Now that the Senate is on record, in a bipartisan manner, supporting the need for and funding of CARFA, it is my hope that the Senate will advance the authorization language to make this commission a reality."
Over a four year period, CARFA would review all federal agencies and programs, recommending to Congress ways to eliminate waste, fraud and abuses in federal spending by realigning duplicative programs and eliminating programs that are outdated, failed, or have successfully completed their purpose. Before going into effect, the commission's recommendations would have to receive Congressional approval. A commission similar to CARFA used by the Department of Defense, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, has saved taxpayers an estimated $65 billion.
Brownback continued, "The Department of Defense successfully implemented BRAC, which has saved the taxpayers a substantial amount of money. The CARFA commission potentially offers greater savings for taxpayers because CARFA would review all federally funded programs and agencies."
Brownback introduced CARFA legislation as a stand-alone bill in 2007.
