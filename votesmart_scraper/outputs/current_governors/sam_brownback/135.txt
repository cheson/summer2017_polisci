Governor Sam Brownback today joined 24 other state governors in signing a letter to Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urging them to restore balance between states and the federal government.
As the 114th session of Congress begins, Governors across the nation expressed their mutual concern about an ongoing pattern of federal overreach and the effects of outdated and cumbersome federal regulations. As the Congress undertakes the work of regulatory reform and budget appropriations, it provides an opportunity to provide greater flexibility and control of funds, and regulatory authority, to the states.
"States should have the flexibility to manage their own affairs and serve their citizens more effectively," said Governor Brownback. "We have seen too many instances of federal intrusion into the rights and lives of everyday Kansans. We must have the flexibility and autonomy needed to make Kansas the best place in the nation to raise a family and grow a business."
