Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed a proclamation designating the week of May 5 -11, 2013 as Public Service Recognition Week.
"Teachers, firefighters, custodians, filing clerks, members of our National Guard and so many other dedicated public servants enrich, simplify and protect our lives on a daily basis, and it is an honor to recognize that service at all levels of government by designating May 5-11, 2013 as Public Service Recognition Week in Kansas," Governor Brownback said.
Public Service Recognition Week has been celebrated nationally since 1985 and each year the President and Congress designate the first full week of May to celebrate public employees who put service above self.
