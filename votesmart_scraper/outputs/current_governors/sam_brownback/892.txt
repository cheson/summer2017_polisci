U.S. Representative Todd Tiahrt (R-KS), U.S. Senators Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Sam Brownback (R-KS) today introduced the KC-X Tanker Recompete Act in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The legislation would prohibit use of any funds by the Department of Defense (DoD) on the KC-Tanker unless the DoD chooses to outright award the KC-X tanker to Boeing or decides to fairly recompete the KC-X contract using the KC-135 criteria.
"The Air Force used a flawed and incompetent process to evaluate the original KC-X tanker proposal," said Tiahrt. "There is no way to get around this fact. My bill offers two choices. The Air Force can either award the contract to Boeing, the company that meets all the requirements set forth by the Air Force. Or, the Air Force can rebid the tanker contract on a fair and level playing fieldÂ—the way it should have been done the first time. I urge the Air Force to respond quickly and not delay awarding the contract to Boeing, which represents the best tanker for the Air Force and the American taxpayer."
"The full GAO report is in and it is now clear that the Air Force made critical mistakes and chose the wrong plane for our men and women in uniform, for our nation and for our Kansas workers," Senator Roberts said. "It is time to get this contract awarded fair and square. Our bill will keep the Department of Defense from spending one dollar on the tanker unless it goes to the group that best meets the Air Force's criteria. The GAO report indicates that this should be an easy decision for the Air Force."
The fastest way for the Air Force to get a new tanker is to award the contract to Boeing," said Senator Brownback. "If the Air Force instead chooses to rebid the contract, this legislation would ensure a new competition assesses all of the relevant factors, including subsidies and foreign corruption. Only a thorough and complete assessment of tanker proposals will prevent further delays in the tanker replacement program."
Under the new competition rules set forth by the legislation, the DoD must consider national security and industrial base concerns. It would also expand the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to foreign companies, require an independent cost estimate, and ensure the DoD considers the impact of additional regulatory burdens placed on American companies whose foreign competitors do not face such burdens.
Tiahrt is the lead sponsor of the tanker legislation in the House. Senator Roberts is the lead sponsor for the companion legislation in the Senate.
Original co-sponsors of the House bill include: Reps. Jerry Moran (R-KS), John Shimkus (R-IL), Dave Reichert (R-WA), Ray LaHood (R-IL).
