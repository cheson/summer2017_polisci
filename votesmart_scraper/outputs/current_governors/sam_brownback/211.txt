Statement

"As 2013 comes to a close, it offers us an opportunity to reflect on the past year and look forward to the start of a new year. For Kansas and Kansans, 2013 has been a good year.
"While the economy continues to recover nationwide, Kansas is seeing its lowest unemployment rate since December 2008. Our November unemployment rate of 5.1 represents a decrease by half a percentage point from October. It is a positive sign that we are moving in the right direction, creating jobs that keep our citizens here in this great state.
"In the past year, we have seen more than 20,000 new jobs in Kansas and a total of 45,600 new jobs created from January 2011 through October 2013. We are moving in the right direction to ensure Kansas is the best place in the U.S. to live, work and raise a family.
"Individuals and businesses are feeling confident about the Kansas economy as across-the-board tax relief leaves them with more of their money in their pockets. A reflection of that success is in the record revenue of more than $6.3 billion we have seen this year.
"Our record job and revenue growth, declining unemployment and sound fiscal management ensure that we have the resources to make the strategic investments in education and public safety that benefit all Kansans.
"Kansas is leading the way. 2013 has been a good year and the future looks bright."
