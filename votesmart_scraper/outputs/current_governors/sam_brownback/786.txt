BROWNBACK APPLAUDS KANSAS LEGISLATURE RESOLUTION OPPOSING TRANSFER OF DETAINEES TO LEAVENWORTH
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the Kansas State Legislature's passage of a resolution which opposes the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
"By passing this resolution, the Kansas State Legislature has officially voiced its disapproval with suggestions that Fort Leavenworth should house enemy combatants currently located at Guantanamo Bay," said Brownback. "My office worked closely with State Representative Lee Tafanelli as he drafted the resolution, and the leadership of both chambers acted quickly to make sure this important resolution passed because we all know that Fort Leavenworth is no place for enemy combatants or terrorists."
President Obama recently signed an executive order calling for the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to be closed within one year. In response, Brownback, with Senators Kit Bond and Pat Roberts, introduced the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility Safe Closure Act of 2009 requiring the President to provide Congress with notice and a feasibility study relating to moving detainees.
Brownback has repeatedly stated that Fort Leavenworth is not an appropriate location to house enemy combatants and has suggested that if the holding facility at Guantanamo Bay is closed, a new facility should be built, designed specifically to handle detainees. He has also expressed that Fort Leavenworth is not a suitable location for enemy combatants because the disciplinary barracks are primarily a medium security facility; the base is primarily focused in training officers at the Command General Staff College; the proximity of the base to a community airport, farms and the surrounding community; and the lack of medical facilities on site, which would require transporting combatants through town to be treated in community hospitals.
