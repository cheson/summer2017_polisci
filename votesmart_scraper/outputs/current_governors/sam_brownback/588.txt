U.S. Senator Sam Brownback co-sponsored the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Act, introduced today. The legislation would establish a bipartisan task force that would review federal government spending and make recommendations for cutting programs that are redundant or unsustainable.
"Federal spending is out of control, and it is past time that Congress takes steps to rein it in," said Brownback. "The Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Act is a common sense approach to making better decisions about where and how tax payer money is spent. In these tough economic times, it should be a no-brainer that the government should now, more than ever, take action to end unnecessary spending."
Gross debt is likely to exceed 100 percent of GDP within the next few years. Under the legislation introduced today, the bipartisan task force would include members of Congress and Administration officials. To be enacted into law, the task force recommendations would require expedited consideration in the Congressional committees of jurisdiction, a super-majority vote in the House and the Senate before the end of 2010, and Presidential approval.
Brownback continued, "For years I have championed similar legislation that would establish better oversight of government spending; I recognize the importance of making sure the government is exercising fiscal restraint. I am therefore hopeful that this legislation will be passed quickly by my colleagues."
Brownback has in the past introduced legislation that would establish a Commission on Budgetary Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies, which would work to reduce unnecessary spending on redundant or outdated federal programs.
