BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak about Senator Byrd, as many of my colleagues have, and make a few comments about an extraordinary individual. Just the sheer numbers are very impressive. He was married for 68 years, elected to 9 terms, had more than 20,000 days of service in the Senate, approaching 19,000 rollcall votes cast, and had a 97-percent attendance record.
Senator Byrd was the majority leader from 1977 to 1981, and again from 1987 to 1989. He was President pro tempore four different times when his party was in the majority. The Senator from West Virginia was known for his defense of the Constitution and the institutional prerogatives of the Senate. He was the author of five books, and he was an avid fiddler. The first place I ever saw Senator Byrd was playing the fiddle on television. Boy, he could play. It was impressive to see somebody of his stature playing an instrument so brilliantly.
In his biographical statement on his Web site, I found a statement that I want to expand and build off of. It says:
In every corner of West Virginia, the people of the Mountain State know that there is one man on whom they can always depend: U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd. He has always remained true to his faith and his family, while working to build a better future for his state and his country.
His remaining true to his faith and family was at the core of Senator Byrd and his longevity, and at the core of his service.
While he spoke often and wrote well about the institutional prerogatives of the Senate better than anybody in the history of this body, it is that his life centered around his core, remaining true to his faith and his family. He was married for 68 years to his spouse, Erma, who stayed by his side constantly, and of whom he would speak often.
