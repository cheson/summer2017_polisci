Brownback Meets with National Bio and Agro Defense Facility Selection Committee Member: Tells Admiral Cohen that Kansas is the Best Place for NBAF
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today met with Admiral Jay Cohen, Under Secretary for Science and Technology of the Department of Homeland Security, and head of the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility selection committee member.
"I was very pleased to meet again with Admiral Cohen to promote the state of Kansas for the new National Bio and Agro Defense Facility," said Brownback. "Kansas has offered an exceptional proposal to the NBAF selection committee. The strong community support, along with the outstanding veterinarian and agricultural research done at Kansas State University gives Kansas a great shot to win this competition."
The selection committee is to decide by October or November of this year which state is to host the new facility. The five finalists are Kansas, North Carolina, Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia.
Brownback continued, "NBAF is important to Kansas. I will continue to work diligently on behalf of Kansas' proposal at the federal level. I'm pleased with our efforts so far and am hopeful that Kansas will be NBAF's new home state."
It is estimated that over a twenty year period, NBAF would have a $3.5 billion impact on the Kansas economy. The proposed site would be a $451 million, 500,000 square foot building and will create as many as 500 high-paying, scientific federal jobs in the state of Kansas and will bring additional jobs in research partnerships to the state.
