Governor Signs KPERS Omnibus Bill
Press Release
By: Sam Brownback
Date: June 7, 2013
Location: Topeka, KS

Governor Sam Brownback signed House Bill 2213 Friday while attending the Kansas State Council of Fire Fighters 67th Annual Conference & Educational Workshop at the Ramada Inn in Topeka.
Known as the 2013 KPERS Omnibus bill, House Bill 2213 modifies the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System, the Retirement System for Judges, and the Kansas Police and Fireman's Retirement System.
In particular, this new law raises the cap on maximum retirement benefits from 80% to 90% of final average salary and increases the employee contribution rate from 7% to 7.15% for all years of service to self-fund the benefit increase from the active KP&F employees. It also makes firefighters and police officers who have at least 32 years of service eligible for these changes. Prior to this new law, once a KP&F member reached 32 years of service, their allowed contribution rate dropped to 2%
Firefighters at the conference told the Governor they had been working ten years to get the changes made.
"Firefighters and police officers risk their lives every day for the betterment and safety of our Kansas communities. They deserve a retirement benefit that is fair to all who serve, no matter how long they serve," Governor Brownback said.
Governor Brownback also signed Senate Bill 246, which reconciles amendment to statutes that have been amended more than once during the 2013 Legislative Session and previous sessions.
Friday's signings bring the total number of bills signed this session to 133.
