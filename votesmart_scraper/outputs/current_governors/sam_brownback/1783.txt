STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Mr. Nickles):
S. 1303. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act and otherwise revise the Medicare Program to reform the method of paying for covered drugs, drug administration services, and chemotherapy support services; to the Committee on Finance.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today for the purpose of introducing the Quality Cancer Care Preservation Act. This bill is aimed at sending reinforcements to those on the front lines of the war on cancer. While there are millions of researchers, policy makers, and advocates fighting against cancer around the country, we cannot forget that the real battles are won in the cancer center, where the care is delivered. The war on cancer will be won by nurses, patients, and physiciansÂ—one survivor at a time.
For years, bureaucrats at Medicare have overpaid for cancer drugs, but underpaid for cost of administering the therapy.
Unfortunately, many in Washington have advocated fixing the overpayment for the drugs and ignored the underpayment for administering the drug. Well, as any cancer patient knows, while cancer therapies may be a miracle, it is the oncology nurses that are the angels. That is why my colleagues and I are offering this legislation, which we believe will bring about fair reimbursement for chemotherapy drugs and administration.
I know that the managers of this bill have committed to work with, and are working with the cancer community to find a reasonable solution to this issue in the context of the Medicare bill that is on the floor. On behalf of cancer patients around the country, I thank my colleague for their dedication. I also thank my friend from Oklahoma for his comments during the markup of S. 1 and for his dedication to ensure proper reimbursement for cancer treatment.
My hope in introducing this bill at this time is that it can serve to help my colleagues in their pursuit of fair reimbursement.
With that, I thank my colleagues.
