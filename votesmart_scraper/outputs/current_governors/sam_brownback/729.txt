STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS -- (Senate - April 30, 2009)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Tester):
S.J. Res. 14. A joint resolution to acknowledge a long history of official depredations and ill-conceived policies by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes and offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution that in many ways is long overdue, a resolution to officially apologize for the past ill-conceived policies by the US Government toward the Native Peoples of this land and re-affirm our commitment toward healing our nation's wounds and working toward establishing better relationships rooted in reconciliation.
Apologies are often-times difficult, but like treaties, go beyond mere words and usher in a true spirit of reconciling past difficulties and help to pave the way toward a united future. Perhaps Dr. King said it best when he stated, ``The end is reconciliation, the end is redemption, the end is the creation of the beloved community.'' This is our goal, with this resolution today.
Native Americans have a vast and proud legacy on this continent. Long before 1776 and the establishment of the United States of America, Native peoples inhabited this land and maintained a powerful physical and spiritual connection to it. In service to the Creator, Native peoples sowed the land, journeyed it, and protected it. The people from my State of Kansas have a similar strong attachment to the land.
