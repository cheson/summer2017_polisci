Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement outlining his priorities for balancing the state's budget. Earlier today the Kansas Department of Revenue announced that February revenue numbers were approximately $50 million below estimates, the result of lower than expected corporate, sales and individual income taxes.
"This is an economic problem, not a tax policy problem. Our tax policy has been instrumental in creating more than 80,000 jobs since we took office and has resulted in a record number of Kansans working.
"These numbers reflect a declining national and regional economy. There has not been a single year of national GDP growth above 2.5 percent since 2006, and in the final quarter of 2015 the U.S. economy grew less than 1 percent. Across the Midwest, states are being affected by falling commodity prices, contracting sales growth and declining agricultural exports.
"In balancing the budget, I will not support or call for a tax increase on small business in Kansas. My focus is on managing spending, not on raising taxes. Our goal is not to fund the growth of state government; it is to help the Kansas economy grow.
"There are difficult decisions to be made and we will be working with the Legislature over the next few weeks to address these spending issues. In the meantime, I have notified the Regents of a 3 percent, or approximately $17 million, allotment for Kansas universities in the current year."
