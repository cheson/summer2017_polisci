U.S. Senators Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran, along with Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, today issued the following joint statement on the release of the National Academies of Science's (NAS) report An Analysis of the Requirements and Alternatives for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory Capabilities:
"The NAS findings are crystal clear: without the capabilities NBAF provides, our country is at risk from foreign animal disease threats. The NAS fittingly recognizes that the need for a centralized laboratory focused on research, diagnostics and surveillance is imperative. That laboratory should be NBAF -- and it starts with construction of the central utility plant. We are pleased this promising review concludes any outstanding evaluations of NBAF. Because the NAS study shows that the need for a facility like NBAF has increased over time, we call on DHS to move forward with the land transfer and for construction to begin immediately."
The NBAF, a state-of-the-art biosecurity lab, is to be built adjacent to Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas. The facility will replace the antiquated foreign animal disease research facility at Plum Island, NY, which has a limited capacity to respond to animal disease threats.
