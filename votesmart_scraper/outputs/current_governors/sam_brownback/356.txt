Governor Brownback: Pro-Growth Policies are Working
Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: March 13, 2012
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement today regarding the January 2012 Kansas Labor Report. The report found Kansas gained 12,200 nonfarm jobs and 22,200 private sector jobs during 2011.
"The creation of more than 22,000 private sector jobs last year shows that our pro-growth policies are working. Even more, creating new jobs is the best way to fund the state's core responsibilities.
"Last year the Kansas Legislature passed important legislation that spurred investments and returned business confidence in our state. The next step we must take to ensure Kansas continues on this upward trajectory is to reduce the tax burden on our families and small businesses. What we're doing is working -- now is the time to hit the accelerator."
