ABSENCE EXPLANATION
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to participate in many of the important votes that took place on Wednesday, June 23, 2004. I was necessarily absent from the Senate yesterday as I was attending the funeral of a family member. Nevertheless, I believe it is important for my constituents in Kansas to know how I would have voted had I been here; thus, I indicated to the Majority Leader my position for each of the votes throughout the day.
