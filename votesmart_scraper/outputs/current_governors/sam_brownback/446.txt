Kansas Governor Sam Brownback offered his congratulations to the city of Kansas City, Kansas on its selection as the first "Google Fiber" Community during a surprise assembly today at Wyandotte High School in KCK.
"This is a wonderful economic growth opportunity for the city of Kansas City, Kansas," Governor Brownback said. "Expanding access to broadband Internet is a priority for my administration. It is key to attracting new businesses and entrepreneurs to areas they might not otherwise consider. It is key to improving the quality of life in communities across Kansas and the country. I applaud Google for its commitment to help make Internet access better and faster for everyone."
Google announced in February 2010 its intentions to build experimental, ultra high-speed broadband networks that reach a total of at least 50,000 and potentially up to 500,000 people. Pending City Board of Commissioners' approval, the company intends to break ground by the end of this year and hopes to offer service beginning in 2012.
Nearly 1,100 communities across the country applied to be a Google Fiber Community. Other Kansas communities who applied include Arma, Baldwin, Bird, Chanute, Coffeyville, Enterprise, Fort Scott, Galena, Lawrence, Leawood, Lenexa, Lindsborg, Manhattan, Mission, Olathe, Overland Park, Pittsburg, Salina, Shawnee County, Topeka, and Wichita.
