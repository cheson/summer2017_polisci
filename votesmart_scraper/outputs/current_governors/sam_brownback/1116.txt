"Moms for Brownback" Coalition Launched by Brownback Campaign
Iowa mothers applaud Brownback's work to renew the culture
The Brownback for President campaign today announced the Moms for Brownback Leadership Team at a luncheon hosted by Mary Brownback, wife of U.S. Senator Sam Brownback.
"Sam Brownback understand the importance of strong families to America's well-being," said Maria Maher, who will chair Moms for Brownback. "For years, Senator Brownback has been on the leading edge of the fight to renew and rebuild the culture and to help parents raise children in an environment that reinforces their values. Sam's values are the values I hope my own children will share."
"If we don't get the basics right, and raise healthy children in healthy families, we face more problems down the road," said Brownback. "Helping my wife Mary raise our five children, I deeply appreciate the critical role that mothers play in raising sons and daughters that will contribute to a prosperous society."
Mary and Senator Sam Brownback are the parents of five children and will be celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary this August.
