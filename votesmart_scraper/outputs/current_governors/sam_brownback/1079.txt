BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
SEN. BROWNBACK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. Thank you for holding the hearing. I just will put my full statement in the record, if that would be acceptable.
Gentlemen, I want to ask this from a basis of experience and then -- I apologize I missed your testimony; I had another engagement that I was at -- but ask then, if I can, some ways to -- maybe we can get at this. I went through the farm crisis in the early '80s from the position of being a lawyer, from the position of being secretary of Agriculture in an agricultural state and from seeing government policies did to exacerbate it. And my experience in looking back on that and applying it to this situation -- and you tell me if it's the wrong way to look at it -- was that we ended up having a situation where you had a lot of people that got overly financed because the land was inflating at 10 percent a year. People were borrowing off of that. I remember being offered to allow to buy some land at 100 percent financing because next year it was going to be worth 10 percent more, and so this was all going to work out. I had that personal offer to me. So I know those sort of things happen.
