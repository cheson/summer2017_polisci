Brownback Introduces Detainee Legislation
Bill would prohibit transferring detainees to Fort Leavenworth
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today introduced legislation which would prohibit the use of federal funds to transfer detainees currently being held at Guantanamo Bay to the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
"The Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth are not equipped to handle the transfer of Guantanamo detainees," said Brownback. "Such a transfer would be not only unwise, but also unsafe. If the holding facility at Guantanamo Bay is closed, a new facility should be built, designed specifically to handle detainees."
Brownback has several times toured the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth and, in consultation with officials at the Defense Department, concluded Fort Leavenworth is not equipped to handle those currently held at Guantanamo Bay.
Brownback continued, "For good reasons, federal law prohibits the co-mingling of military prisoners with a detainee population. Additionally, transferring detainees to Fort Leavenworth would disrupt the Fort's primary mission as the intellectual center of the Army."
Brownback has repeatedly stated that Fort Leavenworth is not a suitable location for enemy combatants because the disciplinary barracks are primarily a medium security facility; the base is primarily focused in training officers at the Command General Staff College; the proximity of the base to a community airport, farms and the surrounding community; and the lack of medical facilities on site, which would require transporting combatants through town to be treated in community hospitals.
