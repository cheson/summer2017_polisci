WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today recognized the prominent role Emporia, Kansas has played in the history of Veterans Day. The Senate today passed a resolution declaring Emporia to be the founding city of Veterans Day, and recognizing the contributions of Alvin J. King and U.S. Rep. Ed Rees to the creation of this holiday.
"The City of Emporia, Kansas has played a significant role in the establishment of Veterans Day," Brownback said. "The people of Emporia take great pride in their city's contribution to the founding of this national holiday, and while they may be modest, I would like to trumpet the work of my fellow Kansans.
"Veterans Day was once called Armistice Day, a day set apart by Congress to commemorate the end of World War I, which our nation once hoped would be 'the war to end all wars.' Just a few years after Armistice Day was made a legal holiday, our nation was engulfed in the Second World War. Shortly thereafter, our soldiers were fighting bravely to repel the communist advance on the Korean Peninsula. These two conflicts added millions to the number of war veterans in the United States. Certainly, it seemed appropriate that these new veterans, like the veterans of World War I, should be honored for their service to our country.
