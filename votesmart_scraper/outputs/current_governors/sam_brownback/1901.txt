Family Stability: The best school, the best social welfare agency, the best institution anywhere for the effective rearing of healthy children is a stable family.
Too often government policy punishes traditional two-parent families and rewards instability in a household. Sam Brownback believes we should end that bias and support stable nurturing environments for children. As a former city attorney for the municipalities of Ogden and Leonardville in Riley County, Sam Brownback has seen first-hand the positive and negative effects that government policy can have on Kansas families.
Health Care: Sam Brownback supports market-based solutions to address the cost and accessibility of health insurance. These include allowing small businesses and self-employed individuals to form voluntary purchasing groups, expanded deductibility for health benefits, malpractice reform and the application of new information technologies to cut down on wasteful duplication while improving the quality of care.
Life: Sam Brownback is pro-life. As a member of the US Senate he has helped to pass into law the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act and worked with the late Senator Ted Kennedy to enact protections for unborn children with Downs Syndrome and similar conditions.
