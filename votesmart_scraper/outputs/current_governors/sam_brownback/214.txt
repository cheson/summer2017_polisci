Location: Topeka, KS

Today, the FBI, Kansas Highway Patrol and numerous other law enforcement agencies arrested an individual who has now been charged by the U.S. Attorney's office in relation to a terror threat involving Mid-Continent Airport.
Governor Brownback issued the following statement:
"I would like to thank the federal, state, and local agencies that collaborated in this investigation of a potential terrorist threat here in Kansas.
"In our ongoing war on terrorism, the good guys won one today. A joint operation with federal, state, and local components captured a would-be terrorist before he could cause harm. This is the way your government should work -- united and effective.
"Congratulations to all involved in this successful operation.
"The FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, Kansas Highway Patrol, Sedgwick County Sheriff, Wichita Airport Police, Wichita Police Department and other law enforcement agencies collaborated in an intensive six-month investigation that resulted in the arrest of Terry Loewen this morning.
"It is important to remember that our dedicated law enforcement personnel are committed to our safety every day. Even here in the Heartland we must remain vigilant and remember the motto "if you see something, say something'."
