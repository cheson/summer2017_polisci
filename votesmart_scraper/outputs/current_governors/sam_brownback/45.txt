In accordance with Article 2, Section 14 of the Constitution of the State of Kansas, Governor Sam Brownback today vetoed Senate Bill 280 which pertains to the litigation of tax cases.
"All Kansas taxpayers should have a fair and impartial system of justice," said Governor Brownback. "Tax obligations should be contested before the Board of Tax Appeals and not by seeking special treatment through the legislative process."
The Governor has now signed 92 bills into law this session and vetoed three. By law, the Kansas governor has 10 calendar days to sign the bill into law, veto the bill or allow the bill to become law without his or her signature.
