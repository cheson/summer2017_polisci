SEN. BROWNBACK: Hi, ladies and gentlemen. Senator Johanns is going to join us shortly and Senator Ensign, Senator Barrasso and Senator Johanns went to Guantanamo Bay to the detention facility last Friday and we've got a statement we'd like to make about that and I'd be happy to open it up for questions.
This past Friday, we visited the detainee facility at Guantanamo Bay and after seeing firsthand the facility, I have a much greater appreciation for the detainee mission there.
I am not aware of anyplace in the world that has the capabilities we have developed at Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo has a highly specialized detention system for hundreds of terrorists and replicating it anywhere would be enormously difficult, expensive and, I believe, unnecessary.
