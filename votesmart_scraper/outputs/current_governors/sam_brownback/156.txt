Governor Sam Brownback today issued the following statement in response to a lawsuit filed by the KNEA.
"Today's lawsuit by the KNEA is little more than an exercise in labor union politics. Kansas has high quality, well-funded schools and I signed HB 2506 to keep it that way. I am concerned this misdirected lawsuit may cast doubt on, or unwittingly endanger, school funding just as classrooms are convening all across Kansas."
