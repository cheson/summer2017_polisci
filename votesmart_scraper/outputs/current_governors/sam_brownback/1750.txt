WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today made the following statement in response to the withdrawal of a recording industry lawsuit against a Massachusetts woman.
"Today it was reported in the Boston Globe that the Recording Industry Association of America had obtained the identifying information of an ISP subscriber, whom the association had accused of massive online piracy of digital music using peer-to-peer file sharing software. As it turns out, the alleged copyright infringer had not only not committed such acts of piracy, but the ISP subscriber had never even downloaded peer-to-peer software onto her computer. The RIAA has withdrawn a lawsuit filed against this ISP subscriber.
"Last week I chaired a hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee that reviewed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's so-called 'information subpoena,' and its substantial consequences for consumer privacy and safety. This revelation challenges the testimony of the RIAA at the hearing, and shows that the subpoena process includes no due process for ISP subscribers' accused of digital piracy. Due process, if it existed within the DMCA subpoena process, would provide accused pirates identified through the subpoena with the critical opportunity to rebut accusations of piracy and prevent the release of their identifying information to accusers.
"I call on my colleagues in the Senate to join with me in working to correct this threat to privacy and personal safety before we witness the use of non-judicially reviewed information subpoenas to more severe effect than an improper lawsuit, and to cosponsor S. 1621, the Consumers, Schools, and Libraries Digital Rights Management Awareness Act of 2003."
