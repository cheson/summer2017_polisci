FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted to speak for a minute and thank the managers of this bill, if I may. I thank the chairman and ranking member. They have done an outstanding job on a broad set of topical issues, from Sudan to Darfur to the Global Fund to HIV, malaria issues, food aid programs that we have been able to plus up in a tight budget. This is a bill people can be quite proud of, on which people have done good work. They have done it well within the resources that were available to us.
There will be things we will continue to work on in conference that are important, but I think they have done an outstanding job. It is something this Nation can be proud of, that we are investing in other people who are in difficult circumstances in a lot of places around the world. There are not many votes there from this country, but there are a lot of hearts and souls that need to be touched.
The chairman and ranking member have done an outstanding job. I wanted to recognize them. This is certainly a vote I will be pleased to make at this time.
I yield the floor.
