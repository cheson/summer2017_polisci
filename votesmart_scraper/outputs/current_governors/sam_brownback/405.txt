Kansas Governor Sam Brownback and Lieutenant Governor Dr. Jeff Colyer released the following statement regarding the decision announced by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in favor of 26 states, including Kansas, that the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. Governor Brownback said:
"I applaud the decision announced today by the 11th Circuit and I congratulate Attorney General Derek Schmidt and thank him for representing Kansas in this fight. The decision confirms what I have believed all along, that Congress does not have the power to compel Kansans to participate in healthcare finance schemes against their will. This is why I voted against the Affordable Care Act as a United States Senator, this is why I signed the Kansas Healthcare Freedom Act into law protecting the freedom of Kansans to make their own healthcare decisions, and this is part of why just this week Kansas became the second state to opt out of federal early innovator money designed to implement provisions of the ACA dictated from Washington. As I have consistently said, healthcare policy for Kansas must be guided by the elected representatives of Kansans in the Legislature and in the Executive. In this way, the wellbeing and protection of Kansans' health, pocketbooks, and sovereignty will remain the top priority of any healthcare reform."
Lt. Governor Colyer added, "As a doctor, I can tell you that President Obama's health care law will not improve the health of Kansans. We applaud the Appeals Court decision and we will continue to look for Kansas solutions for Kansas citizens."
