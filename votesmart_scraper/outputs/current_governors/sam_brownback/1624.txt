Brownback Calls for Providing Spectrum to Public Safety Organizations
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today participated in a hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation committee examining methods to implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that public safety organizations be expeditiously provided additional broadcast spectrum for wireless emergency communications. The committee also discussed the current state of public safety interoperability.
"One of the chief complaints made by the public safety officials who rushed to the twin towers on September 11th 2001 was that their communication equipment was so obsolete they could not communicate effectively," Brownback said.
"When it became apparent that the towers were about to collapse, police and fire and rescue personnel were on different radio systems and received conflicting information. This resulted in hundreds of needless, tragic deaths. Discussions about the problem of interoperability began all the way back in 1982. Yet three years after 9/11, we still have yet to address this issue.
"In today's dangerous world, first responders must have the ability to communicate with each other and other departments. Unfortunately, achieving interoperability will be an extremely difficult and complex task. It will take coordination, planning, reorganization of spectrum, and dedication of funds to bring public safety up to the level that it needs to be to protect our nation. We must remain committed to our first responders and to solving this serious communications problem as soon as possible."
