Kansas Governor Sam Brownback today announced the grant recipients of the 2015 Federal Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program. JAG program funding helps strengthen partnerships for safe communities and enhance the state's capacity to prevent, solve, and control crime. More than $1.8 Million will be awarded to local and statewide criminal justice agencies and support organizations for their criminal justice projects.
"Kansas has an extraordinary network of agencies and organizations that contribute to the safety and well-being of our citizens," said Governor Brownback. "These grants strengthen partnerships and engage our communities in preventing crime and protecting Kansans."
The Kansas Criminal Justice Coordinating Council (KCJCC) oversees the criminal justice federal funding made available to Kansas through the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance. The KCJCC includes the Governor, Attorney General, Supreme Court Chief Justice, Corrections Secretary, Superintendent of the Kansas Highway Patrol, and Kansas Bureau of Investigation Director.
"Providing the best public safety services requires dedicated local officials and access to modern technology," said KCJCC Chair, Attorney General Derek Schmidt. "These grants will help advance local priorities for improving public safety."
