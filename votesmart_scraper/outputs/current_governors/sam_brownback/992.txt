Location: Washington, DC

U.S. Senator Sam Brownback made the following comments on the State of the Union address and the special recognition shown to Greensburg City Administrator Steve Hewitt by the president and first lady:
"I am thrilled that Steve attended tonight's speech as an honored guest of the president and first lady. Kansans in Greensburg and across the state came together during that difficult time and looked forward to rebuilding for the future. I will continue to work with Steve to see that the federal government does everything it can to help Greensburg and the other parts of Kansas affected by the storms."
Brownback also commented on other aspects of the speech:
"The time to act is now to stimulate the economy. Let's show the American people that their government can come together to work for them.
"I call on all Americans to give President Bush, General Petraeus, and the troops in Iraq the room they need to operate. The surge is working, but we must remain vigilant against Iran's influence in Iraq and any resurgence of the Sadr militia.
"I appreciate President Bush's focus on trade with South Korea, one of the last steps to finally restoring our international beef trade."
Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Judiciary Committee.
