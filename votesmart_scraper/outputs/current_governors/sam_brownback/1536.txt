Desire to Withdraw S.J. Res. 13
By: Sam Brownback
Date: May 18, 2005
Location: Washington, DC - Senate


Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, several weeks ago I introduced a joint resolution which has been given the number S.J. Res. 13. This resolution is a one sentence amendment to the Constitution declaring that marriage is between a man and a woman. I would like the RECORD to reflect at this point that I would like to withdraw this resolution.
I understand that under the Senate rules, a unanimous consent withdrawing a joint resolution would not be in order. Thus, copies S.J. Res. 13 will remain available from the Government Printing Office. However, while it is my intent to continue to hold hearings on the important issue of traditional marriage, it is not my intent to advance S.J. Res. 13 through the legislative process.
