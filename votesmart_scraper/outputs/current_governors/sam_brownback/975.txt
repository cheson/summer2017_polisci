Brownback Applauds Senate Reauthorization of Indian Health Care Improvement Act
Bill includes Brownback's Native American apology amendment
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, legislation which improves Native Americans' access to health care.
"Passage of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act is a great step toward improving the quality of life for Native Americans," said Brownback. "This legislation makes much needed improvements to Indian Health Service facilities and delivers a message to Native peoples that their health and well-being is a priority."
This is the first time in eight years that the Health Care Improvement Act has been reauthorized. The bill includes Brownback's Native American apology amendment and an amendment that prohibits federally funded abortions performed within Indian Health Service facilities.
Brownback continued, "I am particularly pleased that the Native American apology amendment is included in the final version of the legislation. With this apology, the federal government can begin to repair and improve our relationship with Native Americans. I am also pleased that my colleagues and I were able to agree to the Vitter amendment, which bans the use of tax dollars for abortions under the provisions of the Indian Health Care Improvements Act. Regardless of where someone stands on the abortion issue, we should all be able to agree tax dollars should not be used for abortions."
Currently, the Native American mortality rate from diabetes is approximately three times higher than the rest of Americans. Mortality rates from tuberculosis and alcoholism are approximately six times higher than for the rest of Americans.
