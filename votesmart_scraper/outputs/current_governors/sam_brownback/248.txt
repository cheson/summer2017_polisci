Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: April 29, 2013
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback delivered his second Governor's Budget Amendment (GBA) for Fiscal Years 2013, 2014 and 2015 to the Kansas Legislature Monday. Total adjustments reduce spending approximately $102 million.
"The budget adjustments recommended in this GBA reflect new issues that have arisen or changes based on new information, such as the KanCare Dividend," Gov. Brownback said. "I look forward to working with the Legislature to craft tax and budget plans that support a balanced budget that funds our state's core responsibilities, provides the state a strong ending balance and continues our state on the glide path to a zero state income tax."
The Governor's second GBA includes recommendations to increase the state's investment for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) being built in Manhattan; increased funding to reduce the state's waiting lists for home and community-based services and funding for startup costs for the Midwest Stem Cell Center.
Governor Brownback also renewed his call for the Legislature to support his proposed budget for the state's universities, community colleges and technical schools -- including the funding of the University of Kansas Medical Center's expansion to train additional doctors and nurses.
"Higher education is a core responsibility of the state. My proposed budget holds our Regents schools harmless and includes targeted funding important to our state's economic growth. I have challenged education leaders to focus their schools on improving student results. It is important we keep state funding level for our universities, community colleges and technical schools," Brownback said.
