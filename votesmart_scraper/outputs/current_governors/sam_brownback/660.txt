Brownback Applauds Committee Passage of Native American Apology Resolution
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded passage out of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee of the Native American Apology Resolution.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have decided to move forward with a formal apology from the federal government to Native Americans," said Brownback. "This is a resolution of apology and reconciliation, and is a step toward healing divisive wounds. With this resolution we have the potential to start a new era of positive relations between tribal governments and the federal government. For too much of our history, federal-tribal relations have been marked by broken treaties, mistreatment and dishonorable dealings. With this resolution, we can acknowledge past failures, express sincere regrets and establish a brighter future for all Americans."
The Native American Apology Resolution will not authorize or serve as a settlement of any claim against the United State. The resolution does not denigrate the bravery and self-sacrifice of Americans who have honorably served the nation in the military throughout our history. Rather, this resolution is intended to be the beginning of a much-needed reconciliation.
