Brownback Statement on Iraq
Tuesday, March 18, 2003
WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today released the following statement in reaction to President Bush's address to the nation on Iraq.
"Last night, the president again addressed the nation on the difficult issue of Iraq. It seems clear that we are on the verge of war with Iraq. President Bush has turned over every stone in pursuit of a diplomatic solution. However, with France vowing to veto any resolution that might authorize force, and Saddam seizing on this division- continuing to violate the unanimously passed U.N. resolution 1441, it became clear that a diplomatic solution is no longer possible.
"No one wants war. But there is a clear and present danger that we must face. Delaying action against Saddam increases the likelihood of catastrophic loss in the future. We cannot allow that to happen. Our prayers are with our soldiers. I commend them and thank them for their tremendous service in pursuit of liberty."
