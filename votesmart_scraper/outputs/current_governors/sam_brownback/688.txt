Brownback Dismayed at Abortion Funding Votes Today
Committee passed bill allowing federal funding of abortions overseas and for abortions in DC
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on two votes during the mark up of several bills in the Senate Appropriations Committee. Today the committee passed a bill that reinstates the Mexico City policy which allows for taxpayer funds to be used to pay for abortions in foreign countries. The committee also revised a law that previously did not allow for District of Columbia funds to be used to fund abortions and has been the law since 1996.
"Over 41 percent of pregnancies in DC end in abortion which is the highest rate in the nation by a long shot," Brownback said. "That's why I am outraged that the committee passed this amendment. The last thing we need in DC is more abortions.
"On top of that, we are running over a trillion dollar per year deficit and now the Democrat majority wants U.S. taxpayer money to pay for abortions in foreign countries. This is ridiculous and offensive. This will create a huge opposition to this appropriations bill."
The Mexico City amendment was brought up without warning today and was designed to make it more difficult to reverse the policy in the future since it has already been overturned by executive order.
