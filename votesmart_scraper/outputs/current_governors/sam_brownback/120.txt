Updated numbers released earlier this month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirm strong private sector job growth in Kansas.
These most-current numbers are revised and benchmarked for calendar year 2014 and show Kansas second in the region for private sector job growth, trailing only Colorado.
"Private sector jobs help grow our economy, providing employment for Kansans and contributing to the quality of life in their communities," said Governor Brownback. "These corrected numbers show that our tax policy is working, bringing jobs and people to Kansas. We also see this confirmed in the record number of new business filings for the past year."
The initial estimates for private sector job growth in Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma were overestimated for most of 2014, while Kansas job growth was underestimated. The benchmarked figures, shown in the chart above, correct this showing Kansas with private sector job growth at 1.9 percent compared to 1.2 percent for Missouri, 1.4 percent for Nebraska and 1.5 percent for Oklahoma.
