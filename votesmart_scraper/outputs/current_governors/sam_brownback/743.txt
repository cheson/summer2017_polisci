Letter

Date: April 16, 2009
Location: Washington, DC

U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a Senior Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today joined Senators Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), David Vitter (R-La.), Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to send a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano expressing serious concerns about the release of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report entitled "Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment."
"I was shocked to learn that this report classifies the brave men and women returning home from combat and operational deployments around the globe, who have been honorably defending our country, as potential terrorists," Senator Inhofe said. "As a Senior Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am especially proud of our soldiers returning home and I find it extremely regretful that they have been subjected to such an insult by this report. Furthermore, I find it reprehensible that within this report Americans who hold certain beliefs regarding issues such as immigration, the Second Amendment, and abortion fall under the report's broad generalization of rightwing extremists, and are therefore considered a potential threat. I believe this report to be very offensive to many Americans."
Full Text of the Letter:
