Governor Sam Brownback and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley today sent a joint letter to Secretary of Defense Ash Carter stating their intent to fight any attempt by the Obama Administration to place Guantanamo Bay detainees in Kansas or South Carolina.
The Department of Defense recently sent teams to assess the possibility of these detainees being moved to the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., or the U.S. Naval Consolidated Brig in South Carolina.
In the letter, Governor Brownback and Governor Haley said they "will not be part of any illegal and ill-advised action by the Administration, especially when that action relates to importing terrorists into our states."
"To even discuss bringing these terrorists to the United States is an insult to those who perished in the September 11 attacks and those who have served in America's war on terror," said Governor Brownback. "Governor Haley and I are committed to protecting the citizens of our states."
