Press Release

Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed an executive order today extending temporary relief from the state's motor carrier rules and regulations for those helping with flood assistance and recovery in Atchison, Doniphan, Leavenworth and Wyandotte Counties.
"Although the flood waters from the Missouri River system are beginning to retreat, the impact on the communities will be ongoing for quite some time. Continuing this temporary relief from our state's motor carrier laws will help expedite the transportation of supplies and other necessities as well as assist in the clean-up and reconstruction," Governor Brownback said.
Executive Order 11-26 only applies to those who are providing direct assistance to state and local efforts in the restoration of services and relief in the four designated counties. It includes temporary suspension of registration and fuel tax permits as enforced by the Kansas Department of Revenue and of licensing, certification and permitting rules and regulations as required by the Kansas Corporation Commission.
Additionally, motor carriers and persons participating in restoration and recovery efforts will receive priority service and may operate during low visibility, night, holiday and curfew hours if the carriers and/or driver use clearance lights and/or escort vehicles.
However, participating motor carriers must still obtain the requisite over dimension/overweight permits as required by the Kansas Department of Transportation prior to operating; but the fees associated with these permits are temporarily waived.
This order is in effect until August 31, 2011.
