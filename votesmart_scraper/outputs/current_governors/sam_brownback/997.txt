Brownback Commends Economic Stimulus Plan, Calls for Incentives for Reinvestment in U.S.
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commended President Bush on his economic stimulus plan and recommended providing incentives to U.S. multi-national companies to bring money back to the U.S. from abroad. President Bush recommended today a series of "shot in the arm" programs including an $800 rebate per taxpayer as well as corporate capital investment incentives.
"I support tax rebates to families and incentives for businesses to invest and increase employment," Brownback stated. "Quick action to enact an economic stimulus package is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into recession. The stimulus package should also include provisions to encourage American businesses to repatriate earnings from abroad."
In addition to the president's plan, Brownback recommended enacting incentives for U.S. companies to bring money back to the U.S. from abroad. This would allow multi-national corporations to bring funds into the U.S. at a reduced tax rate for a period of time. The combined package will hopefully increase consumer spending and create long-term growth in the economy.
Brownback continued, "Providing tax incentives to repatriate dividends into the United States can bring billions of dollars into the economy quickly and provide a much-needed boost and economic growth."
Brownback is the Senior Republican Senator on the Joint Economic Committee.
