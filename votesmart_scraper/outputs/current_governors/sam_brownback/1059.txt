Brownback Applauds Senate Passage of Defense Appropriations Bill
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage of the fiscal year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations bill. The bill passed the Senate late Wednesday night.
"I am very pleased that the Senate moved in quick, bipartisan fashion to approve funds critical to the men and women of the Armed Forces," said Brownback. "I am also pleased that this legislation includes additional funding for border security."
The Defense Appropriations bill provides $459 billion for the United States military, distributing funds between personnel, maintenance, procurement, and research and development accounts.
Brownback continued, "This bill provides money for several key programs that will directly benefit Kansas, including equipment for the National Guard, and full funding of the Airborne Laser system."
