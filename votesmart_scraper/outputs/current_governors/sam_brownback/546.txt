Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator.
I rise to support my colleague from Idaho on this motion. I think this makes sense. The Senator from Idaho is helping the President fulfill a campaign promise. It made sense to everybody across the country. I have looked at it, and I do not think we should raise taxes, period. I think it is taking money out of the economy. But he said: I want to raise some taxes on people making over $200,000. Everybody heard it and thought: OK, that is not me, so I will vote for that. I like that idea.
I want to take a particularly narrow piece of this that is in the bill that we have wrestled with in this body for some period of time, and that is the issue of the alternative minimum tax. That was passed years ago. It was supposed to be a tax on wealthy people who were avoiding paying income tax. So we put it in place and said: Well, people who are wealthy should not be able to plan their way out of paying income tax, so we are going to put this alternative minimum tax in, and it is going to be on a set amount of money.
It was not indexed for inflation over time. So now, 10 years later, all of a sudden, there are a number of people--because of inflation happening over a period of time--who get brought in under the alternative minimum tax, to where we then fight about it in this body as to how we are going to do the AMT fix. That is an annual debate we have here.
Well, this tax on Medicare plans, or on the health care reform plans, where, OK, it is not supposed to tax people who make below $200,000--which I agree with, even though there are pieces in here that do--with inflation, over a period of time, you are going to see a large number of people, in 2009 dollars, making $200,000 or below who get taxed because of inflation and its value. We are looking at a situation in the country now, with the monetary policy--lots of money out in the money supply, with the Federal Government's excessive spending, huge amounts: $1.5 trillion in deficit spending--that the likelihood of inflation coming along is pretty high. Maybe it does not come this year, but it does next year.
We normally run somewhere around a 3-percent inflation rate anyway. You get that stoking up. Here is a chart the Joint Economic Committee staff has done about what happens over a period of time when you do not index for inflation, and this bill is not indexed for inflation.
So all of a sudden you end up having the middle class, and even people currently determined as poor, actually paying the wealthy tax, and it is because of the lack of indexing for inflation over time. So you end up over a period of time having people currently classified as poor paying a wealthy tax--unless you adopt something such as the Crapo motion that says if you are making below this figure, you do not get taxed, you are not going to get taxed.
This actually ends up being pretty substantial and hitting a large number of people over time, to the point where you are going to have a large group--again, this is from the Joint Economic Committee: For every low to middle-income family with a tax cut, three low to middle-income families have a tax increase.
The President said: That is not what I am going to do. I am not going to raise taxes on people who are low or middle income. Unless you adopt the Crapo motion, you are going to have this taking place. So I think this makes sense overall to fix the bill. It certainly does not kill the bill. The bill is signed into law, as Senator Crapo pointed out. You cannot kill the bill now. I think it should be repealed, but I certainly think we should not be having people taxed who are making below $200,000. We should not be having them taxed now. We should not be having them taxed into the future, even though that is actually now built into the bill and part of its pay-for provision.
But let's be sincere with the American public. Let's fulfill this piece. Unless you adopt the Crapo motion, we are not going to be able to guarantee that to the American public.
I think this is a very commonsense amendment. I think this is one that helps deal with the problems in the underlying bill. I think it is one that is honest with the American public, and it is certainly one I hope we can pass.
I would ask my good friend from Idaho to address this issue from, as you put this forward, has the administration said: Yes, we agree with you because this is what we said on the campaign trail and this only fulfills the promise. Maybe they have offered you an Executive order, that you could get this by Executive order.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I do. If we are going to grow the economy of the United States, we need to provide some sort of tax certainty. We have learned over our history that when we deal with taxes, people don't react if they think things are up in the air--if they look at it and they say: I don't know, my taxes may go up or down, I will sit on the sideline.
One of the things the Crapo amendment does that provides some certainty to it is to say: OK, if you are in this category, this is what your taxes are going to be. It isn't going to go up on you. When people can provide a level of certainty on tax policy, typically, then people are more willing to act. Because they say: Yes, maybe I will go out and I can invest and I will do this as a small business. This will help investment. We have a climate right now where people are not willing to invest because they don't know what the rules are. They don't know what their tax rates are going to be, so they are sitting back. This will help provide that level of certainty. So I hope we will do this as a way to help the economy, as a way to fulfill the President's promise, as a way to help fix the bill and do what the President said he wanted to see done and to help grow the economy and give some certainty on our tax policy.
With that, I yield back to my colleague from Idaho.
