BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
SEN. BROWNBACK: Well, number one, we don't know how they're going to rule on this case. I raised it at the confirmation hearings on Alito and Roberts. And as the process is anymore, you rarely know how a judge is going to rule on any case that's likely to come in front of the court. And we don't know how they're going to rule on this one. I hope they rule in favor of marriage as the union of a man and a woman, but we don't know. And you've got the Lawrence case that sits there, that's a flip of precedence of what it had been 20 years ago. So you just -- you don't know. I take some comfort that they're there, but we don't know.
And now you have courts that have acted to overturn this. You have had your first federal court in Nebraska has acted to overturn a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of a man and a woman. That's why Ben Nelson joined us this time and didn't last time. He told me, "Look, as soon as the courts start ruling against this, I'm with you." The courts started ruling against this, he voted with us. And I think you'll see this, as it moves through, courts keep voting -- turning against this -- that we will grow our margin even further on it.
