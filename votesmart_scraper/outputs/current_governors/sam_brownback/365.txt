Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback will take part this weekend in the winter meeting of the National Governors Association (NGA) in Washington, D.C.
As chairman of the NGA Economic Development and Commerce Committee, he will lead the governors' discussion Saturday afternoon on how states can lead efforts to create environments to help entrepreneurs thrive and achieve economic success.
"Our nation's success in the global economy starts in the states. States foster and encourage innovation, support industry sector clusters, and champion linkages between private firms, academic institutions, federal research labs, and the public sector," Governor Brownback said. "Opportunities exist for governors to help increase the attractiveness of our states and, in particular, support our entrepreneurs who create innovative new technologies and systems."
The committee will hear presentations from Amy Wilkinson, a visiting scholar with a joint appointment at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and Harvard University, and Jeff Weedman, Vice President of Global Business Development at The Procter & Gamble Company. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon is vice-chair of the committee.
The Governors also will meet with President Obama on Monday.
