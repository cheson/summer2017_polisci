Hearing of the Joint Economic Committee - The Economic Outlook
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
SEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R-KS): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, appreciate that.
And Chairman Bernanke, a pleasure to have you here.
The American economy has demonstrated, I believe, amazing resilience in the face of a variety of challenges, witnessed 24 consecutive quarters of positive, real economic growth, near 4 percent growth this last quarter, 50 consecutive months of payroll employment growth -- that's the longest on record -- significant expansion in our exports. And yet, my perception and I think that of my colleagues up here is that our economy is at a crossroads. And that's why I think we're all so interested in your testimony here today, and I think the markets are so interested in your testimony.
We have had a nice, long run, but it looks as if there are some really troubling signs out there. We've all talked about oil prices. We've all talked about the subprime market. I know you're going to address those. One thing certainly seems clear to me on our part as legislators that the idea of raising taxes as this point in time would be a terrible idea and a terrible thing for the economy. If we were either to raise them purposely or to allow them to be raised because we didn't vote to extend the tax cuts that have been put in place would be the exact wrong signal and the exact wrong thing to do in an economy that is at a crossroads. So from our stance of fiscal policy and what we can do for economic growth on our side, I would certainly hope that we would set aside all sorts of ideas of that nature and say no, we're going to cut taxes, and we're going to keep them low to try to keep the economy going.
