The Kansas African American Affairs commission has developed a project called "A New Black Friday" to encourage African-American families to start a new tradition of talking about family stories the day or weekend after Thanksgiving.
"Much is known about the history of our Great State," said Dr. Mildred Edwards. "Gathering African-American family histories will help us gather even more knowledge on the history of Kansas and our rich heritage."
