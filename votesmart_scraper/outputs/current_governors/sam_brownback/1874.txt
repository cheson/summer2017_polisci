GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS
(Off Camera) And joining us now from Topeka, Kansas, Senator Sam Brownback, chairman of the Senate sub-committee on science, space, and technology. And from Utica, New York, Congressman Sherwood Boehlert who chairs the House Science Committee. And Congressman Boehlert, let me begin with you on that last fact that Brian Ross brings up, engineers going to Ebay for spare parts. How can that happen?
REPRESENTATIVE SHERWOOD BOEHLERT,
REPUBLICAN, NEW YORK
Well, a lot of things can happen. They're trying to get the best bang for the buck, but keep in mind, when people have talked in the past about Draconian cuts for NASA, that just has not occurred. As a matter of fact, last year we had $600 million more for NASA than the previous year. The previous year was $600 million more than the previous year. In every instance what we have continued to do, no matter what we've appropriated from Congress, is to focus on safety. Congress has driven the safety issue, constantly reminding and focusing on the importance of safety.
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS
(Off Camera) But Senator Brownback, that was your colleague, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who raised the prospects of Draconian cuts compromising the safety of the shuttle mission. Do you share her view or are you with Congressman Boehlert?
SENATOR SAM BROWNBACK, REPUBLICAN, KANSAS
Well, safety has always been job one at NASA. They've conducted themselves that way from the very outset. And I think their totality of their record bears that out, that they have conducted a very safe program. There have been realignments of different things and in different areas within the overall space program, but never is safety compromised from what I've seen of what NASA does. I think what you raise in the program here, what we're seeing, seeing yesterday, the horrible tragedy, this is going to raise, I think, a great deal of focus within the Congress about, what do we need to do to make sure that we continue into space exploration, that, and that we do so in an absolutely the safest way we possibly can?
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS
(Off Camera) But this isn't the first time those questions have been raised. Congressman Boehlert, I want to show some something up on the screen for our viewers, some testimony that came before your committee last year. It was by Richard Bloomberg, the former chairman of NASA's aerospace safety advisory panel. And he said last year, "in all of the years of my involvement, I have never been as concerned for space shuttle safety as I am right now. That concern is not for the present flight or the next or perhaps the one after that. In fact, one of the roots of my concern is that nobody will know for sure when the safety margin has been eroded too far. All of my instincts, however, suggest that the current approach is planting the seeds for future danger." So, Congressman Boehlert, there were some warning signs out there.
REPRESENTATIVE SHERWOOD BOEHLERT
That's exactly right and the chairman, Mr. Bloomberg, pointed that out to us and we had a very spirited discussion. And our concern was evidenced by the fact that we have provided more money this year than last year. But let me point out what Bloomberg was saying, he was saying not on current missions, he was focusing on the longer-range deterioration for future missions. And so, he was saying that we have to do something about that and we did and we provided the extra resources, NASA was prompted to ask for more money, we provided more money and the current budget.
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS
(Off Camera) So where do we go from here? Let me ask you both. Congressman Boehlert, you announced yesterday that you were, in addition to the official government investigations, you were also going to launch a Congressional investigation into the Columbia tragedy.
REPRESENTATIVE SHERWOOD BOEHLERT
Yeah, well, it's too early to draw any conclusions. We're now in a fact-finding mode and what we're going to do is have the inquiry on the science committee in the House. We will cooperate fully with our counterparts in the Senate, and both of us will cooperate fully with NASA, both the internal investigation and the external investigation. But we have to go forward and get the facts and we have to be in a position to make the appropriate policy decisions for the future. The NASA investigation will focus more on the technical aspects. We have to be concerned about the policy aspects and what is the future of human space flight?
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS
(Off Camera) Senator Brownback, will you have an investigation in the Senate?
SENATOR SAM BROWNBACK
We will have hearings in the Senate. I think it's too early to say that we'll have a full-scale investigation. We will work cooperatively with NASA on their internal and external reviews that they have taking place. We are going to continue with manned space flight. I think it would be an enormous tragedy, as well, if we discontinued manned space flight. Yesterday we suffered a huge tragedy as a nation, a very humbling, very difficult experience for us as a country. But we're going to proceed forward. I think the key issue for us in Congress, why did it happen? How did it happen? How do we fix it? And then, how do we project on forward with manned space flight? We need to continue that for the vision of the country and the vision of the world.
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS
(Off Camera) Congressman Boehlert, I see you nodding your head to that, but yesterday I was speaking to a member, another member of your committee, Dana Rohrabacher of California, who made an interesting point. He said, basically, unless we as a nation are willing to invest many more billions of dollars to make sure you get to the next generation of engine technology, of manned space technology, then perhaps we should consider giving up the whole thing and just go to robots. Do you think Congress is committed to providing that funding? And where is it going to come from?
REPRESENTATIVE SHERWOOD BOEHLERT
I do think Congress is committed to providing that funding. But that's an open question at this juncture. We have to complete this investigation. We have to draw some conclusions. And then we have to present the policy options to our colleagues in the Congress and the American people.
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS
(Off Camera) Senator Brownback, you get the last word.
SENATOR SAM BROWNBACK
Well, I think we have to move forward with this. For us to say that this is going to end manned space exploration would be the totally wrong answer to come up with. We have to move forward with this. We need to sow that vision for our people and for the people around the world, and that these lives not be lost in vain. It's a terrible tragedy but we need to learn and we need to move forward, we need to continue that space exploration and do it safely.
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS
(Off Camera) Senator Brownback, Congressmen Boehlert, thank you very much.
