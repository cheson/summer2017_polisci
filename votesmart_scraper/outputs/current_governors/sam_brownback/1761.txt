WASHINGTON U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback yesterday met with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on Capitol Hill and expressed his solidarity with Israel and hope for peace in the Middle East.
This morning's meeting with Prime Minister Sharon was a positive reminder for all of us that our greatest ally in the Middle East is Israel, Brownback said. We are fighting a common threat in the worldwide war against terrorism, and we have an interest in seeing peace in the region.
I told the prime minister that the United States stands beside Israel as her biggest ally and supporter, and that we will work together to defeat terrorism. The murder of innocent life cannot stand. We cannot allow evil to go unchecked. As President Bush has said about the war on terrorism, you are either with us or you are with the terrorists.
I am concerned that for the 'road map' for peace in the Middle East to be successful, it must be based on performance, and not arbitrary dates. The Palestinian people must show that they want peace and that they will coexist with Israel. If actions do not follow words promising peace, there cannot be progress. If the terrorism continues, there cannot be rewards in 2005 for the Palestinians.
Sadly, those who do not want peace, those who hate Israel, are trying to scuttle peace negotiations. The Palestinian leadership must move against these anti-peace members of their community and prove to the world that there is a true desire for peace.
The United States must also press for the international recognition that Jerusalem is the undivided, eternal capitol of Israel," Brownback said.
