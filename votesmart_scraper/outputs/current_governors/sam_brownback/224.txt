Kansas Governor Sam Brownback honored 46 State employees Wednesday as "Employees of the Quarter" for the third quarter of 2013. Governor Brownback hosted the employees at a reception at Cedar Crest, the Governor's official residence. Brownback implemented the recognition program earlier this year with his cabinet agencies and has encouraged other state agencies to participate.
"Today's reception is a small way to thank just a few of our outstanding State employees," said Governor Brownback. "They are working every day in an effort to make Kansas a great place in which to live and work."
The State Employee Award and Recognition Program was created by the State Legislature to recognize employees with monetary and non-monetary awards worth up to $3,500 per employee, per year. The funds must come from the agency's existing budget. Employees recognized by Brownback Wednesday received a variety of different awards from their respective agencies but all were designated as "Employee of the Quarter" and received a certificate signed by the Governor.
