ENERGY -- (Senate - June 11, 2008)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues' comments, from both Missouri and Georgia, and I agree on the energy issues. I have been traveling across all of Kansas, going to all 105 counties. I have been in nearly 70 so far, and the dominant issue by far is the price of energy. People want to get these prices down.
The key to supply and demand is to get more supply as fast as we can. Work on demand as far as being conservation-minded but not to increase taxes. Increasing taxes--things such as a windfall profits tax--does not get you another drop of fuel. It only raises the price. I do not know of anything we have increased taxes on where you end up getting it for less price. It just does not work that way.
So I support my colleagues' statements on that, and I hope the American people are looking at that issue and seeing that here is a way of increasing production but not raising taxes. What the Republicans have put forward is an increase-energy-production bill, and what the Democrats have put forward is an increase-energy-tax bill. I hope people can decide which of these will likely get them lower prices. It is production, it is not increasing taxes.
