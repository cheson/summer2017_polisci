U.S. Senator Sam Brownback applauded the Department of Energy's decision to award a grant to ICM Inc., headquartered in Colwich, Kansas, to fund a small-scale biorefinery project.
"I am very pleased that ICM, a Kansas-based company, has received this important Department of Energy grant," said Brownback. "I share President Bush's goal to make cellulosic ethanol cost-competitive in the near future with grain-based ethanol, and companies like ICM will help us achieve that goal."
The Department of Energy announced that it will invest up to $114 million, over four years, in four different small-scale biorefinery projects. In addition to the ICM project, the grant will benefit small-scale biorefineries in three other cities. ICM is headquartered in Colwich, but the grant will be used for ICM's plant located in St. Joseph, Missouri.
On average, commercial-scale biorefineries input 700 tons of feedstock daily, with an output of approximately 20 to 30 million gallons a year. The small-scale facilities will input approximately 70 tons of feedstock daily, with an estimated 2.5 million gallons a year. Building on President Bush's goal of making cellulosic ethanol cost-competitive by 2012, these small-scale biorefineries will use a wide variety of feedstocks and test novel conversion technologies to provide data necessary to bring online full-size, commercial-scale biorefineries.
Brownback continued, "I strongly supported ICM's grant application to Energy Secretary Bodman, and I look forward to helping ICM and others make cellulosic ethanol a reality. I am proud that Kansas is leading the way in this effort, as it should be."
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
