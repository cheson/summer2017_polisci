Brownback to Introduce Legislation to Address North Korea Illegal Missile Launch
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced that when the Senate reconvenes he will introduce legislation to re-impose U.S. sanctions that were lifted during the Six Party Talks, including designating North Korea a terrorist state. Brownback's proposed legislation also will call for the United States to confront the North Korean regime for its human rights abuses. "The United States, and the entire global community, must take bold action against the North Korean regime," said Brownback. "When the Senate reconvenes later this month, I will introduce legislation urging the return of North Korea to the terrorism list and addressing the North Korean regime's deplorable human rights abuses."
The North Korean regime on Sunday launched a ballistic missile which passed over Japan and fell into the Pacific Ocean, in violation of international agreements and United Nations Security Council sanctions. The North Korean regime remains one of the worst human rights abusers in the world, responsible for millions of deaths caused by famine, forced labor, and political executions. There are estimated to be up to 200,000 political prisoners in forced labor camps throughout North Korea.
Brownback continued, "As we have rolled back sanctions through the Six Party Talks, North Korea has responded by firing this missile towards the western United States and kidnapping two of our citizens, proliferated nuclear and missile technology to other terrorist states, and continued as one of the worst human rights violators in the world. The Administration and Congress must work together towards a policy that confronts these threats and protects our national security."
