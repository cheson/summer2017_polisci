BROWNBACK CALLS FOR ARREST OF SUDANESE PRESIDENT BASHIR
Says International Criminal Court should take action
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback supports the actions by the International Criminal Court toward Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir.
"I support the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for Omar Bashir, a president who has sanctioned two genocides in his own country in the past 20 years," said Brownback. "The current atrocities in Darfur are part of the second genocide led by the Bashir-run regime. In the course of the six year genocide, as many as 300,000 people in Darfur have died; as many as 3 million have been forced to flee their homes. The situation worsens, with innocent civilians being terrorized by government-sponsored militia groups."
Earlier this week, it was reported that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for Bashir, but the Court on Thursday announced it had not issued such a warrant. The Court did not, however, rule out the possibility of issuing a warrant for Bashir's arrest at a later date. If the ICC does issue the warrant, Bashir will be the first sitting head of state sought for detention since the ICC's establishment in 2002.
Brownback continued, "It has recently been reported that international organizations have been denied access by the government of Sudan after a month of fighting in the Darfur region. I urge the government of Sudan to refrain from any attacks against civilians or international organizations, specifically in Darfur. Bashir's regime should not deny entry to international humanitarian organizations that are in Darfur to provide much-needed assistance to civilians."
