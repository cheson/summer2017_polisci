SNOWE URGES LEADER FRIST TO REQUEST A VOTE ON SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH PLANS
Letter Encourages HELP Committee Action
Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and Senator Jim Talent today released a letter signed by twelve United States Senators to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist urging him to encourage Senator Mike Enzi to report Association Health Plan legislation out of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee as soon as possible next month. The Senators are cosponsors of "The Small Business Health Fairness Act", legislation that provides small business owners with the freedom to band together to buy affordable health insurance through Association Health Plans.
In addition to Senators Snowe and Talent, the letter was signed by Senators Christopher Bond, Sam Brownback, Robert C. Byrd, Norm Coleman, Chuck Hagel, Kay Bailey Hutchison, John McCain, Mel Martinez, John Thune, and David Vitter.
The text of the letter follows:
"Small businesses face a crisis when it comes to securing affordable, quality health insurance. They are trapped in stagnant, dysfunctional insurance markets that are controlled by a handful of large insurers, leaving few, if any, coverage options. In four of the past five years, health insurance premiums have increased at double digit percentage levels.
"As cosponsors of the Small Business Health Fairness Act (S. 406), we believe that Association Health Plans ('AHPs') are a critical solution to the small business health insurance crisis. Our bill mirrors the House version of AHP legislation (H.R. 525), which passed the House overwhelmingly and on a bipartisan basis, 263-165, for the eighth time. Still, AHPs have never received a vote on the Senate floor.
