Brownback Calls on FEMA to Review Rebuilding Policy
Says residents affected by storm should be allowed to build basements in homes
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today spoke with Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator David Paulison about the rebuilding efforts in Chapman, Kansas, and FEMA regulations which will not allow federal funds to be used toward houses with basements.
"I find it absurd that red tape is preventing Chapman residents from building homes that will keep them safe from tornadoes," said Brownback. "While I understand that FEMA has reasons for its regulations, in this case it seems unreasonable to bar citizens from constructing basements in their own houses."
Early in June, the town of Chapman was hit by a tornado which caused an estimated $70 million in damage and destroyed dozens of homes, three schools and two churches. Under current regulations, FEMA will not allow residents whose homes were destroyed by the tornado to rebuild their houses with basements. FEMA rules prohibit reconstruction funds from being used to rebuild houses in flood planes with basements; 95% of Chapman is in a flood plane.
