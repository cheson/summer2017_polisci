Press Release

Date: June 23, 2011
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback met this afternoon with Maj. General (KS) Lee Tafanelli, Kansas Adjutant General and Emergency Management Director and KDEM staff for an update on the potential flooding impact in Northeast Kansas along the Missouri River. The briefing was in response to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decision to again increase outflow from the Gavins Point Dam and media reports of water being released from Canadian reservoirs and flooding towns in North Dakota.
"We are already experiencing some flooding in Kansas and there is the potential for it to get much worse in a hurry. The increased outflows will make their way down the Missouri River to our state in four days. I encourage Kansans living near the river to heed the warning if their local emergency responders ask them to evacuate," Governor Brownback said. "We are carefully monitoring the levees along the river and so far, there are no confirmed breaches. I am pleased with the level of cooperation between KDEM, local emergency responders and federal officials. We have had time to review the response plans, identify potential gaps and address those gaps."
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers increased the outflow at Gavins Point Dam from 150,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) to 155,000 cfs today and will increase it to 160,000 cfs on Thursday because of the heavy rainfall happening upstream from the dam.
Governor Brownback and Maj. General (KS) Tafanelli also held a conference call with Wyandotte County government leaders and emergency responders to learn about their areas of concern and the action plans they have in place should their county experience any flooding.
