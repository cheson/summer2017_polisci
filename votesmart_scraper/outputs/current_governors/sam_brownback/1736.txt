FAIR COMPETITIVE BID PROCEDURE
Mr. BROWNBACK. The House passed FY04 Transportation bill contains a provision to assist the States in initiating a Fair Competitive Bid Procedure for State-assisted intercity rail passenger operations. The objective of the provision is to allow States the option of providing competitive intercity passenger rail. The House provision provides limited funding that will permit the Secretary of Transportation to initiate a new Fair Competitive Bid Procedure that the States can utilize. The Secretary will then monitor the progress of this demonstration and make monthly reports to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
I believe this is an excellent idea and was considering offering a similar amendment to this bill. However, I do not wish to delay the proceeding today, and this is already an item to be considered in conference.
I would like to know if the chairman has an opinion on the House State-assisted intercity rail service provision.
Mr. SHELBY. I share my colleague's support of a procedure that will encourage the States to initiate passenger service through a competitive bid process. I believe it is important that Congress examine whether a competitive process can preserve and expand intercity rail passenger service at reasonable prices. I pledge to the Senator from Kansas that I will work with the House conferees to pursue a provision that would introduce a uniform procedure to allow the States the option of providing competitive rail passenger service.
Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the distinguished chairman and look forward to working with him on a fair bid proposal.
