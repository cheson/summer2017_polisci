NOBEL PEACE PRIZE TO SHIRIN EBADI OF IRAN
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to draw the attention of my colleagues to a topic that is of significant importance in the world.
On October 10, the Nobel Peace Prize, the peace prize that was granted to the Dalai Lama in the past, to Martin Luther King, Jr., and to Nelson Mandela, was granted to Shirin Ebadi, not a household name. This lady is a prominent human rights activist in Iran. She was awarded the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize.
I want to draw the attention of my colleagues to her because Iran is one of those countries that is a state sponsor of terrorism. They are as a country on the very low end of recognition of human rights. The ruling clerics do not let participation in the society take place.
She has been fighting for the rights of students and activists to peacefully meet and speak out. She has done it from inside Iran. For that, she has paid for it in jail time and in harassment. She should now receive a reward from us in recognition.
Naturally, the regime in Tehran did not kindly meet upon her recognition as a Nobel Peace Prize winner. The regime actually went on to say there are other Nobel Prizes that are more important, like literature. I looked at that and I thought how would one deny their own countryman the peace prize, the highest of these? They are saying there is something else that is higher. But it is because she has been going at this regime that is illegitimate and does not recognize the people.
I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Ms. Ebadi and to the Iranian people for their continued struggle for freedom, for democracy, and for human rights, against the clerics who have stripped them of every ounce of human dignity.
The Economist described Ms. Ebadi as this: Assertive, severe, and frighteningly well versed in Islamic and Western law, characteristics that challenge the status quo of Iran and the religious ruling clique.
Since being barred from serving as a judge, Ms. Ebadi has fought for the rights of homeless children under the repressive regime which treats the children like common criminals. In addition, she has spent the last 4 years investigating the attacks on student protestors by Iranian security forces during the massive July 9, 1999, protest. Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad was one of those protesters killed during the 1999 protest. Ms. Ebadi represented his family in tracking down the thugs who attacked the students and their paymasters within the Ayatollah's regime. Her devotion to this case and many others landed her a 15-month jail sentence.
This year Ms. Ebadi established a nonprofit organization, a legal defense center for the families of Iranian dissidents and activists. This is challenging work that all Iranians can celebrate, and I am confident she will use the prestige that comes with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to continue the struggle in Iran.
There are dissidents in Iran who I think deserve highlighting, who are being held without reason. Hassan Zarezadeh, a 25-year-old student, is one. He is being held because of participation in a July 9, 1999, protest. He has been in prison since July 6, 2003, in preparation of the anniversary recognition of that protest. There are reports he is enduring torture during his detention.
Dr. Farzad Hamidi disappeared on June 18, 2003, in Tehran, barely 1 year after being released from jail. His whereabouts is unknown, but friends and family believe his disappearance is connected to his role in the student protest.
Shirin Ebadi's struggles continue for these and many other individuals and activists inside Iran, and dissidentsÂ—and all they want to do is be able to peacefully meet and to be able to communicate their message to people within Iran. All they are getting for that is jail, harassment, and, unfortunately, death.
Systematic change is needed to take place. A number of people are calling for that inside Iran. The student protesters and others are calling for an internationally monitored referendum on the Government in Iran. That is, indeed, what should take place.
I wanted to draw Shirin Ebadi's name and her recognition and her award to the notice of my colleagues. This is an important step in the recognition and movement toward human rights in Iran. We need to celebrate it.
I yield the floor.
