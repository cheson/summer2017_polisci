Governor Brownback and Rep. Yoder Respond to Antitrust Suit
Statement

Location: Topeka, KS

Today, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit in an attempt to halt the proposed merger of wireless companies AT&T and T-Mobile. Governor Sam Brownback and Rep. Kevin Yoder issued a joint statement in response:
"We believe that in Kansas, the merger could threaten telecom related jobs, potentially having a negative impact on the local economy of the KC Metro region. In principle, we believe it is important that companies adjust to market forces, and constantly strive to remain competitive. We realize that this means that mergers will, and probably should occur in order to keep a vibrant and competitive marketplace.
"However, based on today's action by the Justice Department, we are requesting a regulatory "time-out" on the part of the F.C.C. while the federal courts hear this case."
Governor Brownback and Rep. Yoder plan to send a formal letter to FCC Chairman Genachowski in the coming days.
