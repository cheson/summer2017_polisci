Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued an executive order to grant conditional and temporary relief from motor carrier rules and regulations for those assisting with disaster recovery in Joplin, MO.
"The recovery efforts for Joplin will be ongoing for quite some time. This temporary relief from our state's motor carrier laws will help expedite clean-up efforts and the transportation of food, supplies, medicine and other necessities from Kansas to our Missouri neighbors in need as well as assist in the removal of debris and reconstruction," Governor Brownback said.
Executive Order 11-09 temporarily suspends the following rules and regulations as they apply to motor vehicles in the support of the recovery efforts in Joplin:
* Participating motor carriers must still obtain the requisite over-dimension/overweight permits as required by the Kansas Department of Transportation prior to operating; however, the fees associated with these permits are temporarily waived. Additionally, motor carriers and persons participating in restoration and recovery efforts will receive priority service and may operate during low visibility, night, holiday and curfew hours if the carriers and/or driver use clearance lights and/or escort vehicles.
* In accordance with Title 49 C.F.R. ยง 390.23, the requirements contained in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, Title 49 C.F.R. Parts 390-399 are hereby suspended through the duration of the motor carrier's assistance in the disaster relief effort not to exceed a period of thirty (30) days from the date of the initial declaration unless the order is rescinded or expanded by executive order or concurrent resolution of the legislature; and
* The registration and fuel tax permits as enforced by the Kansas Department of Revenue are temporarily suspended; and
* May benefit from the waiver while under load and when returning either empty or with loads directly related to the emergency.
