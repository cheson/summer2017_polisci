Brownback Comments on General Motors Bankruptcy
Fairfax, Kansas, plant will remain open
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on General Motors declaring bankruptcy.
"It is hard to hear the news that General Motors, an American industrial giant, has filed for bankruptcy," said Brownback. "I hope the bankruptcy process moves forward in a timely and orderly manner; I am concerned that the heavy hand of the federal government will negatively impact the restructuring and future viability of the company. I am hopeful that the government role and taxpayer dollars will be rapidly replaced by market forces and private investment capital."
General Motors yesterday filed for bankruptcy. The Fairfax, Kansas, GM plant will remain open.
Brownback continued, "I know that the employees at the Fairfax plant will lead the way for a restructured General Motors and will continue to manufacture world-class, market-leading automobiles."
