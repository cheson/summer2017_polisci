Brownback Votes Against Senate Immigration Bill
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today voted against the Senate immigration bill.
"I voted against the Senate immigration bill because I am not convinced it would fix our broken immigration system and it would most likely repeat the mistakes of the 1986 reform," said Brownback.
The immigration bill failed earlier today on a 46-53 procedural vote that required 60 votes for the bill to advance to a final vote.
