Kansas Governor Sam Brownback continues to monitor damage caused by severe weather across the state earlier this week as the Kansas Division of Emergency Management tracks the potential for additional severe weather this weekend. The Governor issued the following statement:
"Several Kansas counties experienced severe weather over the past few days, resulting in damage to homes and businesses. We are fortunate there were no fatalities from these storms. To those whose homes were lost, whose businesses were damaged or who lost livestock and crops as a result of the storm, we understand the challenges you are facing. The Kansas Division of Emergency Management is working closely with county emergency management departments as they assist their residents and make damage assessments."
"We are closely watching the potential for severe weather again this weekend and are prepared to assist our neighbors across the state if storms bring more damage this weekend. I encourage everyone to watch weather conditions as you plan your activities to help keep you and your families safe."
