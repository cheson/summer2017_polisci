SENATE RESOLUTION 483--RECOGNIZING THE FIRST WEEKEND OF MAY 2008 AS "TEN COMMANDMENTS WEEKEND'' -- (Senate - March 13, 2008)
Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:
S. Res. 483
Whereas the Ten Commandments are precepts foundational to the faith of millions of Americans;
Whereas the Ten Commandments are a declaration of fundamental principles for a fair and just society;
Whereas, from the founding of the United States, the Ten Commandments have been part of America's basic cultural fabric;
Whereas the national hero and first President, George Washington, proclaimed in his first inaugural address in 1789: ``[I]t would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and the happiness of the people of the United States a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge.'';
Whereas one of the great leaders of the United States, President John Quincy Adams, declared in a letter to his son, ``The law given from Sinai was a civil and municipal as well as a moral and religious code ..... [many] were of universal application--laws essential to the existence of men in society, and most of which have been enacted by every nation, which ever professed any code of laws.'';
Whereas President Harry S Truman affirmed, ``The fundamental basis of this Nation's law was given to Moses on the Mount. The fundamental basis of our Bill of Rights comes from the teachings which we get from Exodus and St. Matthew, from Isaiah and St. Paul. I don't think we emphasize that enough these days. If we don't have the proper fundamental moral background, we will finally wind up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state.'';
Whereas, in addition to being understood as an elemental source for American law, the Ten Commandments have become a recognized symbol of law in our Nation's culture;
Whereas a marble relief portrait of Moses, the Hebrew prophet and bearer of the Ten Commandments, is located prominently in the United States Capitol over the gallery doors of the chamber of the House of Representatives in honor of his work in establishing the principles that underlie American law;
Whereas images of the Ten Commandments are prominently displayed in many Federal buildings, including the United States Supreme Court, the National Archives, and the Library of Congress;
Whereas the first weekends of May in 2006 and 2007 were celebrated by many Americans as ``Ten Commandments Weekend'' in recognition of the importance of the Ten Commandments in their faith and the history and culture of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate--
(1) recognizes the first weekend of May 2008 as ``Ten Commandments Weekend'';
(2) celebrates the Ten Commandments as a significant aspect of the national life of the United States; and
(3) encourages citizens of the United States to reflect on the integral role that the Ten Commandments have played in the life of the Nation.
