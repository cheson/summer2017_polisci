Kansas Governor Sam Brownback today responded to President Obama's statements on his ongoing efforts to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and transfer detainees to facilities in the U.S.
"The President is once again putting his personal agenda ahead of the safety and security of Americans by threatening to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and transfer dangerous detainees to U.S. soil. As I have said before, this was a bad idea when it was proposed and it remains a bad idea today. The President does not have the authority to transfer these terrorists to America and the plan he is submitting to Congress appears to be seriously lacking in any detail or substance.
"Even as President Obama was describing his ill-advised GITMO closure plan this morning, we learned a former detainee was arrested for planning an act of terrorism in Spain. His continued pursuit of this political objective is putting Americans and people around the world at greater risk. I call on Congress to loudly and clearly reject his plan to set free some of the world's most dangerous terrorists. We will pursue all actions available to fight the transfer of terrorists to U.S. soil."
