Brownback, Others Call on Defense Department to Consider Recent WTO Ruling
Press Release

Location: Washington, DC

U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today was joined by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and representatives from policy organizations calling on the Defense Department to level the playing field in its defense procurement policy.
"The WTO ruling confirms what we have long suspected: Europe illegally subsidizes the development of large aircraft, forcing U.S. competitors out of business and putting Americans out of work," said Brownback. "DoD should not feign ignorance of the policies defended by our trade representative, especially when the WTO has ruled in our favor. It's odd that although the WTO agrees with the U.S. Trade Representative that European aircraft subsidies are illegal, DoD disagrees with USTR. It's disconcerting that such an incongruity can exist within the federal government."
At today's press conference, Brownback encouraged the Air Force to revise its defense procurement policy in light of September's World Trade Organization rulings that the European Union has illegally subsidized development costs of aircraft. In September, the WTO issued an interim ruling that the EU has illegally subsidized the development of numerous Airbus aircraft. Airbus is currently competing for an Air Force contract to replace aerial refueling tankers.
