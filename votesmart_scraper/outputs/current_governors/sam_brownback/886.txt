Senator Roberts Sends Letter To President Bush Urging Support For Dickinson and Riley Counties
U.S. Senator Pat Roberts today sent a letter to President Bush, urging the President to make Federal funds available for areas affected by the June 11 tornado. Senator Sam Brownback and Congressman Jerry Moran co-signed the letter. Below is the full text.
"Dear President Bush:
We write on behalf of the Kansas counties affected by severe storms on June 11. Dickinson and Riley counties were hit especially hard by a tornado which destroyed homes and public property. The preliminary damage assessments were completed and the request for Mitigation and Public Assistance was made on June 26. We now ask for your consideration in expediting the request.
Chapman in Dickinson County was hit particularly hard during this storm. Every school in Chapman was demolished in the storm. In order to rebuild in time for the coming school year, funds are needed immediately to begin construction. We ask that particular attention be paid to the needs of our youth who are affected most directly by this destruction. Timeliness is of particular importance as the regular school year is little more than six weeks away.
We understand Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance was not requested because, in the judgment of the state, the uninsured damage did not rise above the state and local ability to assist. However, the Public Assistance for Dickinson County and its affected schools is of paramount concern. We thank you in advance for your consideration."
