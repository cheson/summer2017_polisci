Governor Sam Brownback Calls for Inspections of Planned Parenthood and Abortion Facilities in Kansas
Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: July 21, 2015
Location: Unknown

Governor Sam Brownback today called on the Kansas Board of Healing Arts to investigate, as part of its inspection of office-based surgical practices, whether any Kansas facility is engaged in the inhumane practice of selling tissue and organs from unborn children who are aborted. He also called upon the Kansas Department of Health and Environment to cooperate in any investigation.
The Governor issued the following statement:
"Kansas remains committed to a culture that respects the dignity of life at all stages. Recent videos show Planned Parenthood employees treating the unborn as commodities as they discuss the sale of tissue and organs. This does not reflect the culture of life most Kansans want.
"We now call upon the Kansas Board of Healing Arts to address the issue of sale of tissue and organs from the unborn in its inspections of Kansas medical offices.
"Human life has dignity at all stages of life. Senate Bill 95, banning dismemberment abortion in Kansas, prevents the barbaric procedure of dismembering an unborn child.
"We must remind ourselves and others that unborn children are just that -- children -- with certain inalienable rights that we must respect and protect."
