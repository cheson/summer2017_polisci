Brownback Dismayed by Decision to Lift Sanctions Against North Korea
Says Administration should carefully reconsider its actions
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today expressed extreme disapproval with the Bush Administration's decision to lift provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act with respect to North Korea, and to rescind North Korea's designation as a state sponsor of terror. The Administration's actions are in response to the North Korean government turning over documents describing its plutonium-related activities.
Brownback made the following statement:
"The lifting of key sanctions in exchange for a tardy and insufficient North Korean declaration will do little to keep the world safe from a nuclear-armed North Korea, and absolutely nothing to keep the innocent North Korean people safe from Kim Jong Il's barbaric, totalitarian regime.
"While the Administration heralded today's developments as a significant diplomatic victory, North Korea's declaration, which was more than six months overdue, does not include any information on uranium enrichment and does not address North Korea's illegal and dangerous nuclear proliferation to Syria, another state sponsor of terrorism. Yet in return for this, the United States has agreed to legitimize the world's most ruthless regime through a series of significant concessions.
"I am particularly disheartened that the Administration failed to link our country's concessions to the improvement in human rights for the North Korean people. It is unconscionable to ignore clear evidence of massive concentration camps, systematic starvation, and official oppression, and instead to lift sanctions against the regime of Kim Jong Il."
"By giving Kim Jung Il a free pass, by abandoning key allies like Japan, and by giving up crucial sanctions that provide leverage, today's events have only moved us closer to conflict and turmoil on the Korean peninsula."
