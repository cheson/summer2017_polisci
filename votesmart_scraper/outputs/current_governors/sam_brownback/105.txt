Governor Sam Brownback and Lieutenant Governor Jeff Colyer, M.D. today issued the following statements in response to rising costs of health insurance premiums related to the Affordable Care Act. A report issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shows an increase of 11 percent to 39 percent in health insurance costs for Kansans.
Statement from Governor Sam Brownback:
"The best way to help keep health care and insurance costs affordable is to return control of insurance markets to the state, allowing for free market competition and the implementation of innovative reforms to existing law.
"We will continue working with Insurance Commissioner Ken Selzer to keep consumer health insurance increases as low as possible and allow the companies to offer the federally required products and services."
Statement from Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer, M.D.
"Health insurance premiums across the country are skyrocketing. These are some of the largest increases in the history of the state and demonstrate the failure of Obamacare. I encourage Congress to address the fundamental flaws of the Affordable Care Act."
