Brownback Applauds Passage of Freedoms Frontier National Heritage Area
Bleeding Kansas Heritage Area celebrated
U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Jim Talent (R-MO) today applauded Senate passage of legislation designating 29 counties in eastern Kansas and 12 counties in western Missouri as a National Heritage Area, showcasing the region's contributions to the struggle for equality in the nation.
"This legislation will not only preserve and showcase the pivotal history of our state and the subsequent contribution Kansas made to the nation, but it will also serve as a tool to promote economic development through travel and tourism for our state," Brownback said.
"I am pleased the Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area will now have this national designation," said Talent. "The events that transpired along the Missouri-Kansas border were critical conflicts that led up to the Civil War, and we have a responsibility to protect and document the historic significance of this unique piece of American history."
The legislation creates the Freedoms Frontier National Heritage Area by joining communities throughout eastern Kansas and western Missouri to document, preserve and celebrate the significant role Kansas and Missouri played in the political struggle that led to the Civil War and in other historic struggles for equality in the state.
Brownback continued, "I would like to thank Senator Jim Talent and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for their unwavering support of this bill and for moving this bill so quickly. I would also like to commend the steadfast commitment of the Territorial Kansas Heritage Alliance, whose work helped make this bill possible."
