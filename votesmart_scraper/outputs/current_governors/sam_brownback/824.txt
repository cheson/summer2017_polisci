Brownback Congratulates President-Elect Obama
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated President-elect Barak Obama and acknowledged the historic significance of his election.
"This was an historic election. To go from Rosa Parks and Linda Brown to President-elect Barack Obama in one generation proves that anything is possible in America. I congratulate President-elect Obama and his family. We should all savor and celebrate this moment in history.
"I am also thankful to John McCain, whom I supported, as an American hero who even in defeat put his country first and sought to heal our division.
"Now the daily work of America continues, and hopefully the message has been clearly said and forever believed that in America, everybody can achieve their dream."
