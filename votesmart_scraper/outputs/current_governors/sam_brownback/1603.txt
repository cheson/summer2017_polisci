U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded new funding for the National Museum of African American History and Culture included in the recently-passed Omnibus appropriations bill. Brownback was the lead Senate sponsor of legislation creating the museum and has been actively working toward its passage for over three years.
"This museum will reflect the breadth and depth of African American history, and will capture the essence of freedom and liberty," Brownback said. "It will serve as a catalyst for racial reconciliation in this country. I am pleased to help provide the funding to get this important museum started."
The National Museum of African American History and Culture will receive $3.9 million that will be used for site selection and start-up costs. The Omnibus bill, officially known as H.R. 4818, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, is a combined appropriations bill to fund specific federal agencies and institutions for the 2005 fiscal year.
The Museum will be a part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
