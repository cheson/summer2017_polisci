BROWNBACK SECURES FUNDS FOR KANSAS
Votes against overall omnibus bill
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback last night voted against the FY2009 omnibus appropriations bill, which passed the Senate by voice vote. The bill now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law.
"I'm disappointed Congress passed another bloated spending bill," said Brownback. "While my home state of Kansas will see important projects funded in this bill, including roads, hospital upgrades, aviation technology, and critical research at our universities, Congress must practice more responsible spending. If we could spend our way to prosperity, we'd already be there. I strongly support a balanced budget and reforming our earmark and appropriations process, but until we get there, I will continue to fight for worthwhile Kansas projects under the current system."
