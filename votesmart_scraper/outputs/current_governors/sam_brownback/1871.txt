Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on January 16 the crew of STS-107 launched from Cape Canaveral, FL through the skies to space. They were sent on a mission to further space exploration and had the work of more than 70 international scientists onboard. The Columbia crew of seven had a research mission in the space, physical, and life sciences. After a nearly flawless mission, the world witnessed their tragic death as the Columbia Space shuttle shattered above the Earth upon its return on February 1.
As is well known now, this crew, doing the work of international scientists, were quite international themselves. The diverse group of human researchers spanned the globe, hailing home to the United States, India, and Israel. Each country celebrated in their own way their national heroes upon the launch of Columbia. But now, these countries join together in sharing our sorrows with each other in the aftermath of such a heartbreaking tragedy.
These people each brought something special to the mission of NASA. CDR Rick Husband first dreamed of being an astronaut at the age of 4 and worked throughout his life to become an astronaut, fulfilling his dream in 1994 when he was selected by NASA. Pilot Willie McCool was the most steady and dependable of men; his friends considered themselves blessed to know him. Payload CDR Michael Anderson always wanted to fly and along the way of achieving his goals, he became a role model for African-American children across the United States. David Brown, mission specialist, probably most accurately said what we believe now, that, "This program will go on," no matter what happens. Kalpana Chawla traveled an arduous path to becoming an astronaut and represents so well the diversity aboard the Columbia. Born in India, she moved to the United States to fulfill her dream of reaching the stars. She has now done that and more. Laurel Clark was a physician and a flight surgeon who loved her work and her family. From aboard the shuttle Laurel said, "Life continues in a lot of places and life is a magical thing." She could not have captured the feelings of so many any more accurately. Ilan Ramon, who brought so much attention and pride to this mission, was the first Israeli astronaut. The son of a Holocaust survivor, he brought with him aboard the shuttle a picture that a Jewish boy had drawn before he died in the Holocaust.
The diversity of this crew so accurately represents the diversity in the missions of NASA. Even through the cold war era and into today aboard the International Space Station, NASA has been a leader in international relations. Taking giant steps for mankind, NASA often times set the example for the rest of the world to follow. It is in that spirit that we sent the Columbia crew to do their work, and it is in that spirit that we will continue their work.
NASA has, from its inception, been charged with making the impossible possible. From the early days of the Mercury Program, through the advancements in Gemini and the triumphant successes of Apollo, NASA has given us a sense of national pride. Yet we mustn't let our pride fool us into thinking that NASA's work is commonplace. Each time a shuttle launches and a mission is accomplished, it is a miraculous, humbling event.
The mission of these seven astronauts did not end when the Columbia went down. No. Their mission will go on. Space exploration is in our blood, a part of our national heritage. Manned space flight will continue, and these heroes would want it to. We will move on with space exploration and we will do so with pride, ensuring that these seven lives were not lost in vain.
America is strong. She is steadfast. And she is brave. God has called these mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters, but we will not forget them. We will never forget the inspiration they gave to so many hopeful citizens on Earth. We must persevere and we must move on, for the honor of these seven fallen heroes.
As chairman of the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee here in the Senate, I plan to take an active role in ensuring that the dreams of these seven astronauts are not forgotten. As NASA determines what went so terribly wrong, we will be diligent in doing everything we can in the Congress to give NASA the support it needs to make sure we press forward with scientific advances, and that nothing like this happens again.
Our next step will be to determine what the future of space exploration holds for AmericansÂ—what our goal is and how we get there. The tragedy that NASA is enduring will not dissuade or discourage America from venturing into space. Our commitment to space exploration is firm.
For the families of the seven, I send my prayers. As Psalm 19 states, "The heavens declare the glory of God .    .    .". The heavens are now declaring the glory of these seven heroes. There are seven more stars in the heavens tonight, and with each setting of the sun, the spirits of our seven heroes will shine brighter. Every time we look up into the starry night, we can remember the lives of the seven cherished heroes aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia and be proud, proud of their dedication, their diversity, and their dream.
I express my heartfelt sorrow and condolences to the families and friends of these seven astronauts. I will never forget the sacrifices they made in the name of exploration. May God bless them and their families.
