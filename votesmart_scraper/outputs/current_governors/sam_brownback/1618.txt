DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005-CONTINUED
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly in favor of the Baucus amendment because of the situation in my home State. Parts of my State have had the worst drought in a century. It is being compared by some veteran farmers to what they witnessed in the Dust Bowl era-crops withering and dying in the fields before the farmers' eyes without any ability to address it.
