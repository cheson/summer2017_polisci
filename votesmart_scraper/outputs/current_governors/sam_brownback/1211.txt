CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (Senate - March 23, 2007)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the bill that creates a BRAC-type process for the rest of Government. I think this is one where we have a lot of priorities that people are interested in, yet nobody is for wasteful spending. So here is a process where we can actually reduce Federal spending in low-performing areas and be able to get the resources to spend in places we want to. It would be a BRAC-type system, which we are familiar with, and it would apply it to the rest of Government.
The commission of reports gives us one vote, up or down, without amendment, limited timeframe. This is a way we can responsibly, both parties, look at ways we can fund priorities in the future without raising taxes, and I hope that is what we are all about.
We are familiar with how that BRAC process works. A lot of people aren't particularly happy when the report comes out, but it has worked and eliminated some $50 billion worth of lower priority military base spending. I don't know anybody who runs for Federal office or public office anywhere who is for wasteful Government spending. Here is a way of getting at it. Because the system is built to spend, this would actually change that system to give us a process that can be fair to both sides of the aisle, and ongoing in its effort to be able to get this allocation on a more appropriate basis.
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote for the amendment, and I call up amendment No. 581 and ask for the yeas and nays.
