Brownback Praises President Bush for Taking Action on Darfur
United States Senator Sam Brownback praised President Bush today for imposing new economic sanctions on Sudanese businesses and individuals aiding the on-going genocide in Darfur.
"It is our moral responsibility as a nation to make every effort we can to stop the innocent bloodshed in the Darfur region," Brownback said. "The moral conscience of America cannot peacefully rest until the innocent are protected and those who have killed over 200,000 human beings are brought to justice."
The economic sanctions target Sudan's lucrative oil industry, and several individuals suspected of being directly involved in the genocide in Darfur.
"I will continue to fight for those who do not have a voice in the Darfur region, Brownback continued. "I applaud President Bush for his leadership and urge the international community to come together and fight this humanitarian crisis before more lives are lost."
Brownback has been a leading advocate for action in the Darfur region, sponsoring the "Darfur Peace and Accountability Act" and the "Sudan Divestment Authorization Act of 2007."
