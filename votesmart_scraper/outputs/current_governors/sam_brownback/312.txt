Press Release
By: Sam Brownback
Date: June 1, 2012
Location: Topeka, KS

After careful review and consideration, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed House Substitute for Senate Bill 294 and delivered to the Kansas Legislature . With the line-item vetoes made by the Governor, the state's projected ending balance in Fiscal Year 2013 will be approximately $468.5 million, giving the state approximately a 7.6% ending balance.
The following is his message to the Kansas Senate, where the bill originated:
Message to the Senate of the State of Kansas:
I want to thank all Kansas legislators and particularly, the members of the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Ways and Means Committee, for producing a budget that for the first time in many years meets the statutory requirement of maintaining a 7.5% ending balance. Our state has gone through an incredible transition in just two years: from a projected $500 million deficit to putting nearly half a billion dollars in the bank. A $1 billion swing can only occur when we commit ourselves to shrinking the footprint of state government and pursuing policies that grow the economy. I look forward to continuing this prosperous path in the fiscal years to come.
Pursuant to Article 2, Section 14 of the Constitution of the State of Kansas, I hereby return House Substitute for Senate Bill No. 294 with my signature approving the bill, except for the items enumerated below.
