Governor Presents Budgets to Kansas Legislature
Press Release

Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback delivered his proposed budgets for Fiscal Year 2011 and Fiscal Year 2012 to the Kansas Legislature today. The governor's Policy Director Landon Fulmer presented details of the budgets to the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Ways and Means Committee.
"Governor Brownback's proposed budgets take some preliminary steps in restructuring our state government and balances the budget, despite the financial challenges we face," Fulmer told committee members.
Fulmer said the immediate task facing the governor was to balance the demands placed on both fiscal years.
"Over the longer term, the governor recognizes that solutions must be found to address our state's expenses for Medicaid, the KPERS pension system and school finance. He invites the Legislature to join him in tackling these enormous policy issues," Fulmer said.
While tax receipts are projected to increase by $240.6 million in the next year, human service caseload estimates, the statutory KPERS rate increase, and replacement of stimulus and other federal monies used to balance the budget in previous years, all combine to require $448.2 million more.
