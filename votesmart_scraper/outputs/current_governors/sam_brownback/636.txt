U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND) today applauded Senate passage of the Native American Apology Resolution, which offers an apology from the United States government to American Indians.
"The Senate's action today is a big step for the relationship between the federal government and Native Americans," said Brownback. "The resolution seeks reconciliation and offers an official apology to Native Americans for the hurtful choices the federal government made in the past. With this resolution we acknowledge previous failures and express sincere regrets."
Dorgan, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, joined Brownback as co-sponsor of the amendment.
Dorgan said, "It is difficult to know the history of the First Americans and the destructive policies our government has too often followed regarding them, and not be filled with both sadness and regret. It is appropriate that we, as a nation, express that sorrow and regret with this apology resolution."
The Native American Apology Resolution today passed as an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill. The resolution extends a formal apology from the United States to tribal governments and Native American people nationwide. The resolution of apology does not authorize or serve as a settlement of any claim against the United States and does not resolve many challenges still facing Native Americans. The Native American Apology Resolution has been introduced in previous Congresses, and passed the Senate in 2008, but was not signed into law.
