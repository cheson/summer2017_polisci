Stem Cell Research
SEN. BROWNBACK: Thank you all for joining us today. We've got a beautiful story to tell, and we want to see the -- and we want you to see the faces of the story.
The young girls I just walked in with were three snowflake babies, all were adopted out of IBF clinics, all are beautiful clinics. And they'll get to tell their stories here today, and I'll introduce them as well.
And then, we also have a couple of success stories using cord blood stem cells. No ethical issues, no ethical problems. The only thing we have that cures; I should say, rather, treatments. These are in the treatment stage. They're being reviewed, they're being studied by scientists, by the FDA and being used around the world. That's 72 to nothing; we have 72 different clinical human trials using adult stem cells cord blood. We have zero using embryonic stem cell research.
We have spent $500 million, nearly half a billion dollars, over the last five years funding embryonic in animals and humans, and we've got -- we have zero human clinical applications or human applications at all. I -- if we had used that half a billion dollars the last five years to fund adult stem cell research or cord blood research, we would have many more treatments. We would have more people probably alive today had that half a billion dollars been used in the adult stem cell and the cord blood area.
C.S. Lewis wrote about 60 years ago, "If man chooses to treat himself as raw material, raw material he will be."
