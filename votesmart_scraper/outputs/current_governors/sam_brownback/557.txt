Brownback Comments on Northrop Grumman's Withdrawal from Air Force Tanker Competition
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on Northrop Grumman's announcement that it has withdrawn from the refueling tanker competition.
"I urge the Air Force to move forward with the tanker acquisition process, using existing sole source guidelines in working with Boeing to develop the best tanker for the best possible value," said Brownback. "Throughout this entire competition, Boeing has been focused on meeting the requirements for the warfighter, and I have no doubt that Boeing will continue to meet the guidelines throughout a sole source negotiation process."
Northrop Grumman announced on Monday that it will withdraw from the tanker competition. While Boeing is now the only competitor bidding, federal acquisition guidelines permit sole source awards. The request for proposal contained a fixed price structure designed to contain costs even in a sole source situation.

In 2008, the Air Force awarded the tanker contract to Northrop Grumman's partner, Airbus, but the Government Accountability Office gave a vote of no-confidence to the Air Force's decision. The competition was restarted in September with Boeing and Airbus/EADS, along with their partner Northrop Grumman, competing for the contract. The Air Force will purchase 179 refueling tankers beginning in 2011 to replace the aging fleet. They are seeking to replace more than 500 Eisenhower-era KC-135s. In September, the WTO issued an interim ruling that the EU has illegally subsidized the development of numerous Airbus aircraft including the model Northrop Grumman offered during the last tanker competition.
