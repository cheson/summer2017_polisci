Unborn Victims of Violence Act Introduced
By: Sam Brownback
Date: May 7, 2003
Location: Washington, DC

WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback today participated in a news conference to introduce the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. This legislation would allow for the prosecution of a person responsible for the death of an unborn child during the commission of an already-defined federal crime of violence. "Was there one victim or two in the Peterson case?," Brownback said. "The double murder of Laci and her son, Conner, was a brutal act of violence that left two human beings dead.
"California law allows for the prosecution of the person responsible for these deaths, and it is time that federal law reflected this common sense approach to criminal law.
"Under the legislation introduced today we will close a gap in current law.
"Our legislation says that if an unborn child is injured or killed during the commission of an already-defined federal crime of violence, then the assailant could be charged with a separate offense on behalf of the unborn child.
"This bill recognizes that when a criminal attacks a pregnant woman, and injures or kills her unborn child, he has claimed two human victims - not just one. This principle would be applied to over 60 existing federal laws dealing with acts of violence.
"It is an important piece of legislation that the Senate must consider. The House has already passed this bill twice; now it is time for the Senate to follow suit," Brownback said.
Brownback is a cosponsor of the bill.
