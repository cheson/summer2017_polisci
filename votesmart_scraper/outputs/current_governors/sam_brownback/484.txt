U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the announcement that the Environmental Protection Agency will allow a higher blend of ethanol in gasoline in flex fuel vehicles.
"This announcement is welcome news as we look for ways to increase America's energy independence," said Brownback. "Now more than ever it is important that we expand the use of renewable, domestically produced energy sources. Kansas is a top ethanol producer, and I know that the state will continue to be a leader in ethanol production."
The EPA today announced that it is increasing by five percent the amount of ethanol allowed in vehicles, from ten percent to fifteen percent, for vehicles manufactured beginning in 2007.
