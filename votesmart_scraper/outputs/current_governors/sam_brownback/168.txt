Today Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement on waiting lists and lengths of waits for veterans to receive services at Kansas VA facilities. The VA today released data on the delays in receiving services after requesting an appointment for all Veterans' Affairs facilities.
"It is unacceptable that any veteran who has served the nation, and who qualifies for treatment at a Veterans' Affairs medical facility, is forced to wait for an extended period before receiving services.
"This is an issue that requires immediate action by the federal government. I, along with five other Republican governors, have asked that our states be granted the authority to review Veterans Affairs medical facilities. We could then partner with the Veterans' Health Administration to ensure there is accountability and that changes are implemented.
"I continue to advocate for veterans and believe that any veteran who is unable to get an appointment at the VA within 30 days, should receive federal vouchers to seek treatment from other healthcare providers in the state."
