Brownback Amendment to Supplemental Appropriations Bill Passes Unanimously
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage of his amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations bill. The amendment, which was agreed to 94-0, encourages the federal government to consult with state and local governments prior to transferring the Guantanamo detainees to the United States.
"I am pleased that my Senate colleagues agree that detainee transfer is a very serious issue and that all parties involved should be in full consultation with each other," said Brownback. "I think it is unwise to transfer detainees to the United States. However, if this option remains on the table, the Department of Defense should consult with state and local officials before deciding where to transfer detainees. The transfer of 240 detainees into an American community will have an enormous impact on that community. The Defense Department, therefore, needs to be up front with community officials about the impact."
Brownback last week visited the detainee facility at Guantanamo Bay and has said he will continue to oppose appropriating any funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States.
