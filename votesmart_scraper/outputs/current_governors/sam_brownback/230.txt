Statement
By: Sam Brownback
Date: Sept. 4, 2013
Location: Topeka, KS

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback issued the following statement following today's conclusion of the Special Legislative Session:
"I congratulate the legislature, and especially House Speaker Ray Merrick and Senate President Susan Wagle, on thoughtfully addressing the issue of public safety and repairing Kansas's "Hard 50" sentence.
The Legislature acted quickly, with resolve and narrow focus, to protect the safety of all Kansans and I appreciate their service. The broad bipartisan support for the "Hard 50" sentencing guidelines can be seen in the unanimous votes in both the House and Senate.
Kansas legislators demonstrated their commitment to all Kansans with their quick and decisive actions.
Several appointments were confirmed during this Special Session, including Jim Clark as Secretary of Administration, Josh Ney as Securities Commissioner and Caleb Stegall to the Court of Appeals. A total of 19 Kansans were approved to serve on boards and commissions. I appreciate the diligence of the review committees and Senate in confirming them, and I thank these Kansans for their willingness to serve their fellow citizens.
I join my fellow Kansans in thanking the Legislature for its commitment and service, and especially for the collaboration shown throughout this special session"
