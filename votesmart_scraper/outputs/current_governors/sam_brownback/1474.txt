SEN. BROWNBACK: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations.
This is a big day. It's a big day for the country, it's a big day for John Roberts, new chief justice of the Supreme Court, new chief justice of the United States. It's a big day for the process, too. And I say that in that we were allowed an up-or-down vote on a qualified nominee. That's the way it should be, and that's the way I believe it needs to be for all judicial nominees, including the next person that comes forward. And I hope we can get that through and move forward, we can continue the civility and continue the process of our advise and consent being a majority vote, not a supermajority vote, on this next position. And certainly our hopes and our prayers go with Judge Roberts as he assumes this critical position in our country.
