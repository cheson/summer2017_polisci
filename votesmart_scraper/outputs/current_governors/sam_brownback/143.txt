Governor Sam Brownback today outlined the initial actions to address a projected budget shortfall in fiscal year 2015.
Based on a recommendation from Budget Director Shawn Sullivan, the Governor will implement an allotment plan as provided in K.S.A. 75-3722. Sullivan subsequently notified Secretary of Administration Jim Clark to notify state agencies of the allotment.
"I appreciate Shawn's hard work in identifying efficiencies and cost savings across state government," said Governor Brownback. "These first steps are a down payment in resolving the immediate budget issue. I look forward to presenting a full budget proposal and policy recommendations to the legislature in January. Our job now is to address this situation through good fiscal governance while maintaining our investment in education, sustaining funding for public safety and allowing T-WORKS to be completed."

"It is important for us to take these actions now to address the projected shortfall and minimize the effect of budget reductions to state agencies in this fiscal year," Sullivan said.
