Today, Governor Rick Scott will travel to Washington, D.C. to meet with Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell tomorrow to discuss the importance of the federal government granting Florida Low Income Pool (LIP) funding.
Governor Rick Scott said, "I look forward to meeting with HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell tomorrow to discuss the importance of funding the federal Low Income Pool (LIP) program in Florida. We hope HHS will reconsider LIP funding in Florida, and it's critical for us to get that information immediately so the Legislature can construct a budget that best meets the needs of low income families during a special session."
