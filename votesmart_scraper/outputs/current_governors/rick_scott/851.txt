Governor Scott said, "The hearts and prayers of Ann and I go out to families in Winter Park who were impacted by today's tragic events at Kindercare daycare center. This afternoon, I spoke with Department of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles Executive Director Julie Jones who notified me that of the victims, 11 young children were taken to area hospitals, and one has died. As a grandfather of three young children, I can't imagine losing such a precious life at such a young age. Today's hit-and-run was an act of cowardice, and members of the Florida Highway Patrol are working closely with local law enforcement to bring those who caused this crash to justice. We'll continue to monitor the situation and provide any assistance that may be required by local authorities."
