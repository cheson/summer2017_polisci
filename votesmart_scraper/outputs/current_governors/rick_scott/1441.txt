I am so grateful today to announce that Representative Jennifer Carroll of Fleming Island Hill is my pick for Lieutenant Governor.
She is the House Representative for District 13, which is in Jacksonville.
Even more importantly, I am honored that Jennifer is the first African American Republican woman to be part of a statewide ticket in Florida.
We are launching today a new website to share with you my outstanding running mate and the remarkable story of Jennifer Carroll. She is the embodiment of the American Dream. She came to America as a young girl, decided to serve her country with the United States Navy, pursued a higher education, started a small business, and then was elected the first African American female Republican in the Florida State Legislature. Take a moment, if you don't already know her to meet Jennifer by visiting www.ScottCarrollforFlorida.com.
Her conservative principles are in line with mine, and this fall we will present a clear choice between conservatives with business experience and a plan to create 700,000 jobs and liberal Obamacrats who want to bring the failed Obama agenda to Florida.
Make sure you also connect with Jennifer on Facebook and Twitter to get the latest as we campaign together against Alex Sink, Rod Smith and their liberal agenda.
Let's get to work!
Rick
