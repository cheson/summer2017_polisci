Gov. Scott: The Corps will Reduce Flows Without Compromising Lake-O Dike System
Statement

Location: Palm Beach, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement following the Corps of Engineers' decision to significantly reduce flows from Lake Okeechobee into South Florida estuaries. According to the Corps, a 33 percent reduction of flow from Lake Okeechobee into the C-44 canal is expected today, and by week's end, the release is expected to be further reduced up to approximately 57 percent. The announcement comes a day after the Governor's tour of the S-80 control structure in Martin County, where he announced a $40 million commitment to the completion of the C-44 Storm Water Treatment Area project.
Governor Scott said, "Yesterday, I expressed my concern to Col. Dodd about how families in South Florida were being impacted by the Corps' release of water from Lake Okeechobee into regional estuaries. Now the Corps has determined it can significantly reduce these flows without compromising the Lake Okeechobee Dike system. While today is a good step forward, there's much more to be done. Any amount of water from the lake that's dumped into the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee rivers impacts families in the area. With more than $2.5 billion already invested, Florida families will continue to do their part in restoring area waterways, but we need the federal government to step up and fulfill their obligations."
