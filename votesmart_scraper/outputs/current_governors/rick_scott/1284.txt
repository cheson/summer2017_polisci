"The Christmas season is a time to celebrate with friends and family. It is also a time to celebrate the blessings that are bestowed upon us and the birth of our Lord. In the spirit of this joyous season, Ann and I want to wish all Floridians a Merry Christmas.
"We would also like to offer our sincere thanks to America's servicemen and women. Because of the sacrifice of our Armed Forces and their families, the United States continues to be the greatest country in the world. Everyone involved in our country's defense is in our prayers this Christmas.
"As Floridians celebrate, we must also remember the many families that are still experiencing unemployment. We remain focused on ensuring that everyone in Florida who wants a job, has the opportunity to get one, and that our children have access to good quality education. The love and compassion that Florida's citizens display toward one another during this time of year is an inspiration. It is truly a reminder that we live in the greatest state in the nation."
