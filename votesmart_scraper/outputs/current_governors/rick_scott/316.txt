Governor Rick Scott announced today that Florida's private-sector job growth rate of 3.4 percent in October was the highest among the ten most populous states, including Texas, California, and New York. October marks the eighth consecutive month that Florida's growth rate has been first among large states. Florida's job growth rate is also significantly higher than the nation's, which is at 2.2 percent.
Governor Scott said, "For eight consecutive months, Florida has led all other large states in job growth, including our number one competitor Texas. I look forward to working with the Legislature to cut $1 billion in taxes and create the Florida Enterprise Fund this year to diversify our economy so Florida can become first for job growth."
