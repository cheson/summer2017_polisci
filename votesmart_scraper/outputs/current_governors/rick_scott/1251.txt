Governor's Weekly Address : 2012 Jobs and Economic Development Agenda
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: March 23, 2012
Location: Tallahassee, FL

During the recent legislative session, the Florida House and Senate passed my 2012 Jobs and Economic Development Package. This is a huge victory for all Floridians and will ensure that our unemployment rate continues to drop. My agenda is designed to get Floridians back to work and is based on the principle that private companies, not government, create jobs.
By eliminating burdensome regulation and lowering taxes, Florida will be in a better position to create, attract and retain jobs. Since I became governor, this has been my primary focus. I continue to work every day to make sure that every Floridian who wants a job has the opportunity to get one.
This plan, coupled with $1 billion in additional education funding, will have a tremendous impact on the lives of Floridians.
