Hi. This is Governor Rick Scott.
As you know, my campaign involved a very specific plan: Seven steps to 700,00 jobs. None of us can predict the future, including economists. Data tells us that during the last 6 months of last year, Florida lost 20,000 jobs, and over the last 3.5 years before that, we lost another 800,000 jobs. My 7-7-7 plan is going to get our state back to work, and so far, the plan is working. We've reduced taxes and job-killing regulation. We are focused on ensuring that Florida's private sector does well.
So far this year, unemployment has dropped from 12 percent (which was a record high the month before I came to office), down to 10.7 percent. We have bucked the national trend. We have generated 87,200 private-sector jobs.
Just to be clear, my focus every day is how to get our state back to work. I'm going to follow my 7-step plan to 700, 000 jobs, regardless of what happens with the economy.
I appreciate all of your support. I look forward to making sure everyone in Florida has the opportunity to get a great job.
