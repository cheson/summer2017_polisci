Today Rick Scott, candidate for Governor, made the following statement on the occasion of Rosh Hashanah, which begins at sundown on Wednesday:
"Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the Jewish New Year, a celebration of what is to come and a reflection on the past. It is important now more than ever that we continue to celebrate America's unbreakable bond with Israel.
"As our friends in the Jewish community move into the year 5771 let us join them in celebrating their unwavering faith that has guided them throughout history.
"Please join Ann and I in wishing all of our friends "Shana Tova,' and may everyone in your family have health and success in the coming year."
