Today Governor Rick Scott announced that almost three million Floridians have saved a collective minimum of nearly $50 million dollars since the state reduced its motor vehicle registration fees at the beginning of September. The fee reduction was included in the "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget" earlier this year and approved by the Florida Legislature.
Governor Scott said, "This is $50 million dollars that will stay in the pockets of hardworking Floridians across the state. Whenever we can find ways to reduce fees, we have the obligation to Florida families to do so. I am glad that so many Floridians have already benefited from the lower vehicle registration fees, and will be able to keep more of their hard earned money."
Since the fees were reduced at the beginning of September, 2.9 million Floridians have saved money on their vehicle registrations, 1.6 million in the first month alone.
