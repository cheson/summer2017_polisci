Today, Governor Scott called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works Review Board to immediately reconvene and adopt the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP), following their refusal to approve the plan at yesterday's meeting in Washington, D.C. Prior to the vote, the Governor sent the U.S. Army Corps a letter urging the Board to adopt CEPP.
Governor Scott said, "We are extremely disappointed that Corps officials in Washington refused to approve CEPP at yesterday's meeting. Day-by-day the rainy season approaches, and that's why we are asking the Board to immediately reconvene to discuss and approve CEPP. Just this month, the South Florida Water Management District took historic action in approving CEPP, and yesterday the federal government added more bureaucratic hurdles in our efforts to restore water quality, and send the water south. We've worked closely with our federal and local partners, and we need officials in Washington to act with more urgency in adopting these projects. The federal government must make CEPP a priority. We must do everything it takes to protect the natural treasures that Florida families rely on."
