Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that the state's Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) has filed a lawsuit seeking to establish AHCA's authority to inspect federal VA hospitals in Florida, and to stop the federal veterans affairs agency from obstructing state actions.
Governor Scott said, "I am committed to righting the wrongs experienced by Florida's veterans at the hands of the federal VA, that has repeatedly failed to comply with minimum standards of patient safety. The suit outlines why AHCA should be afforded access to inspect VA hospitals.
"The VA has failed to provide necessary and timely care to those who have fought and defended America's freedoms. This is why I called on AHCA to shine a light on this tragic situation."
