Press Release

Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott is urging Floridians who have fallen victim to price gouging at hospitals in Florida to contact the Governor's Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding to share their stories. Last month, Governor Scott announced that he will work with the Florida Legislature to increase transparency for Florida hospitals and empower patients to fight against hospital price gouging during the upcoming 2016 legislative session.
Governor Scott said, "In order to better understand the hardship placed on Floridians when they are presented with inflated hospital bills, we are asking those who believe they are a victim of hospital price gouging to share their stories with our Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding. We want to hear directly from Floridians who have suffered from this unfair practice so we can better empower patients to fight against price gouging at Florida hospitals.
"Last month, we announced major reforms to increase transparency and accountability so we can better empower patients. By requiring hospitals to post pricing information online, we will give patients the tools necessary to prevent and report the deceptive practice of price gouging. I look forward to hearing from Floridians and working with the Florida Legislature to increase transparency at Florida hospitals."
