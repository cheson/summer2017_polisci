Today, Governor Rick Scott awarded 132 Florida veterans with the Governor's Veterans Service Award for their service to Florida and the nation.
Governor Scott said, "As a Navy veteran myself, I was honored to recognize 132 Florida veterans today for their courage and commitment to our nation. Florida is home to the third largest population of veterans in the nation, and as our veteran population grows we must continue to support them and their families. That is why our "KEEP FLORIDA WORKING' budget proposes funding for three new state veteran's nursing homes this year."
The ceremony was held at the Panama City National Guard Armory. During the ceremony, Governor Scott highlighted the service of Florida veteran Master Sergeant John Milam.
