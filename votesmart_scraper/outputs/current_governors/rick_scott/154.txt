Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: July 22, 2016
Location: Tampa, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida businesses have added 102,600 new jobs since January 2016, bringing the total number of jobs created since December 2010 to 1,127,400 jobs. Florida's annual job growth rate, 3.2 percent, is also exceeding the nation's, 1.9 percent, for the 51st consecutive month. The state's unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent in June, the lowest rate since November 2007.
Governor Rick Scott said, "I am proud to announce that Florida businesses have created more than 102,000 new jobs in the first half of 2016. Our annual job growth rate has outpaced the nation for more than 50 consecutive months, and since 2010, more than 1,127,000 Floridians have found new opportunities to get a job and provide for their families. We will continue to work each day to cut taxes, encourage business growth, and make important investments in economic strongholds like our port system so Florida can become a global leader for job creation."
Governor Scott made the announcement at Port Tampa Bay during the commission of two new post-Panamax gantry cranes which will help the port accommodate some of the largest container vessels in the world. Under Governor Scott's leadership, Florida has invested more than $1 billion into the state's port system since 2011 in order to increase capacity, compete with top ports across the nation, and expand Florida's role as a global hub for trade. According to the Florida Ports Council, Florida's seaports generate more than 680,000 direct and indirect jobs and contribute $96 billion in economic value to the state through cargo and cruise activities.
Cissy Proctor, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said, "Florida added another solid chapter to our economic story in June. Our unemployment rate is below the national rate even while nearly 1,000 people are moving into Florida each day and searching for new jobs."
Other positive economic indicators include:
Private-sector industries gaining the most jobs over the month in June were trade, transportation and utilities with 6,000 jobs; professional and business services with 3,800 new jobs; and education and health services with 2,600 new jobs.
Florida job postings showed 243,950 openings in June 2016.
In June, Florida's 24 regional workforce boards reported more than 31,841 Floridians, including 1,580 veterans, were placed in jobs.
