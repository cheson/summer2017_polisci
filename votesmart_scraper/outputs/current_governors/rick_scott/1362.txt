This week, I signed House Bill 7095 into law. It will crack down on illegal prescription drug abuse in Florida.
Tragically, Florida has an alarming seven deaths a day due to drug overdoses.
These deaths have been fueled by an unprecedented amount of illegal trafficking of prescription drugs. Florida has the highest volume of oxycodone dispensers operating in the nation.
Also, 98 out of 100 biggest dispensers of oxycodone in the nation are in our state. Too many of these legal drugs are on our streets for illegal purposes.
That is why, working with Attorney General Pam Bondi, legislative leaders and law enforcement officials, we have come up with a comprehensive plan to tackle this issue at the source, and reverse the growing trend of illegal pill mills operating in Florida.
I am proud the pill mill legislation I signed this week will save lives.
Another bill I signed into law provides a sales tax holiday weekend, august 12th to 14th. This will help Florida's families save money when they purchase next year's school supplies.
The much needed tax holiday will also help boost our state's economy while helping prepare Florida's kids to be successful in the classroom.
