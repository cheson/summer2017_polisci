Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: April 21, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"This Sunday, my family and I will join Christians throughout the state of Florida in celebrating the Easter holiday. This is a joyous time to share in all the miracles of life and enjoy the blessings of family and friends. The Easter holiday celebrates our salvation and commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
"A sense of hope and new beginnings can be felt across the state as we begin to get Florida back to work. However, it is important that we remember those still struggling and lend a helping hand to our neighbors in need.
"Many of our military men and women are away from their families this holiday as they fight to protect the freedoms we all enjoy. I encourage you to join me in praying for their safety and comfort for their families.
"To all Floridians celebrating this holiday, I offer best wishes for a Happy Easter from both my family and Lt. Governor Carroll's family."
