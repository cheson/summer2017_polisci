I recently signed legislation that increases funding to Florida schools by $1 billion.
During the past few weeks, I have spent time listening to teachers, parents and students about the best ways we can improve Florida's K-12 education system. My job as Governor is to ensure that taxpayer dollars are invested so that Florida's children receive the best possible education.
One way the Florida Department of Education is doing this is by ranking the performance of Florida's schools. Now, schools in our state can better understand how they stack up. Also, taxpayers will know exactly what they are getting for their money.
It is important to continue to set goals and monitor schools to ensure that they achieve success. I will continue to listen to teachers, parents and students about additional ways we can implement this funding. By doing this, we can ensure that your tax dollars are being invested properly and that Florida's students are given every opportunity to succeed.
