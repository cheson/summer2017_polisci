Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement on Day # 5 of the FAA's furloughs:
"As we enter the fifth day of furloughs for FAA employees -- it appears the White House has finally taken notice of its effects on families. After travelers throughout the nation felt the impacts of the FAA's shortsighted furloughs -- and as members from both parties in Congress have sought answers and solutions to delays -- the White House has finally indicated that it will consider ending the furloughs. While this news is promising, Florida families and businesses are still experiencing delays, and Florida tourism is still being put at risk each day. I continue to call on the White House to expedite the issue and work with Congress on a solution, so we can continue our momentum in growing jobs, and let the FAA, airlines, airports and travelers, get back to doing their jobs." -- Florida Governor Rick Scott
