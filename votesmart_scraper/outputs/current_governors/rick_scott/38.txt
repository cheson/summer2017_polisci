Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today Governor Rick Scott released the following statement on State Attorney Aramis Ayala's decision not to seek the death penalty for Markeith Loyd, who is charged with killing Lt. Debra Clayton of the Orlando Police Department.
Governor Scott said, "I want to be very clear, Lt. Debra Clayton was executed while she was laying on the ground fighting for her life. She was killed by an evil murderer who did not think twice about senselessly ending her life. I completely disagree with State Attorney Ayala's decision and comments and I am asking her to recuse herself immediately from this case. She has made it abundantly clear that she will not fight for justice for Lt. Debra Clayton and our law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day."
