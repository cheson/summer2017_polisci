Today, Governor Rick Scott issued the following Passover statement:
"Ann and I wish all those celebrating Passover a happy and healthy holiday and I look forward to taking part in a traditional Seder with members of our Jewish community this evening. Passover is a time where we can all reflect on the freedom we have in our great state and nation.
However, as we begin celebrating this evening, we will not forget the innocent victims that were killed and hurt in Overland Park, Kansas this weekend when a gunman opened fire outside a Jewish community center and retirement home. There is no place for these acts of evil in our society. Ann and I will continue to pray for all those affected by this terrible tragedy. Chag Sameach."
