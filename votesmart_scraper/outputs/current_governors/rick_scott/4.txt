Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott released the below statement on the Trump Administration's decision to expand the federal red snapper season by an additional 39 days, which will include Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from June 16th through September 4th. Also included are Monday and Tuesday of July 3rd-- 4th and Monday, September 4th. This is the longest red snapper season since 2013. Saltwater fishing in the Gulf of Mexico has a $7.6 billion economic impact in Florida every year.
Governor Scott said, "This major expansion of the federal red snapper season is great news for every community along Florida's Gulf Coast. The red snapper season helps drive our economy and this extension will allow families and visitors to take advantage of red snapper fishing opportunities during Father's Day and Fourth of July weekends. This will result in a greater economic impact for our Gulf Coast communities and I appreciate President Trump and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross for their partnership with Gulf Coast states. I encourage every Floridian and visitor to get out on the water to enjoy Florida's world-class fishing."
Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Chairman Brian Yablonski said, "We greatly appreciate the cooperation across all five Gulf states and the U.S. Department of Commerce. This agreement signals a new and brighter day for red snapper management and more freedom for Florida residents and visitors to enjoy the rich and tasty tradition of red snapper fishing in the Gulf."
