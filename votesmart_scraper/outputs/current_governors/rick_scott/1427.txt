Republican gubernatorial nominee Rick Scott today praised the decision made by U.S. District Court Judge Roger Vinson to allow parts of the lawsuit brought on by 20 states challenging the constitutionality of Obamacare to go to trial.
Scott said, "As someone who led the fight against both Obamacare and Hillarycare, I applaud the judge's decision to send this lawsuit to trial. Obamacare is an unconstitutional overreach by the federal government and I'm hopeful that the courts will recognize this and put an end to this travesty.
"It's unfortunate that my opponent supports Obamacare and opposes this lawsuit, but it's not surprising since she's an Obama liberal and one of the primary lawyers in the case, Guy Burns, is a supporter of Sink's campaigns to the tune of $1,500."
