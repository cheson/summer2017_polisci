Today, Governor Rick Scott and First Lady Ann Scott were joined by Department of Children and Families Secretary David Wilkins, foster child advocate Tanya Wilkins, Guardian Ad Litem Executive Director Alan Abramowitz, Representative Ben Albritton, Senator Nancy Detert and Department of Juvenile Justice Secretary Wansley Walters to sign House Bill 215, the "Normalcy Bill" which reduces rules and regulations that currently limit the activity of children in foster care.
Governor Scott said, "Florida families have always been my top priority, and I believe that this legislation will help foster families and group homes become an even stronger family setting."
This bill, also referred to as the "Let Kids be Kids" bill recognizes the importance of allowing children in foster care the ability to take part in everyday activities, without the involvement of case managers, provider agencies or the court system. The "Reasonable and Prudent Parent" standard incorporated in the bill allows foster parents to give foster children permission to do daily, age appropriate, activities such as joining a school athletic team or going to the beach with friends.
"Children in foster care deserve to be treated like any other kid in the state, and this new law will help to accomplish that," said bill sponsor, Representative Ben Albritton. "I am very thankful that we have a Governor that values kids here in the state and puts that belief into action, and I am pleased to join him in signing this bill into law."
Senate sponsor Senator Nancy Detert said, "In our quest to protect children in our care we have, in essence, bubble wrapped them and prevented them from leading normal lives. Under this new bill, foster care kids will still be protected but they won't be red flagged as "foster care kids.' This bill will allow them to live a more normal life."
