Today, Gov. Scott made the following statement on the extension of the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance negotiations.
Gov. Scott said, "The 30-day extension in the negotiations between the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance is certainly good news for Florida. Cargo-related activity at Florida seaports supports more than 550,000 direct and indirect jobs, and contributes approximately $66 billion to our economy. We are hopeful these two organizations will quickly reach a final agreement to permanently remove the threat of a port shut down that would devastate families all across our state. We are asking the President to pursue any means possible -- including invoking the Taft-Hartley Act -- to avoid a work stoppage in the weeks ahead. A shut down of Florida ports is simply not an option."
