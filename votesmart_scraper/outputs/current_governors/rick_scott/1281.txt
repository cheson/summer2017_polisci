Three Kings Day Greetings from Governor Rick Scott and First Lady Ann Scott
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Jan. 6, 2012
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"Throughout our state, many Floridians will observe Three Kings Day, or DÃ­a de Los Reyes, today and through the weekend to mark the arrival of the Magi to worship the Christ child.
"For the men and women of our Armed Forces and the Florida National Guard who are away from their loved ones during this joyous time, we pray for their safety as they selflessly fight to protect our freedoms.
"As we continue to work to make Florida the best place to live, work and play, Ann and I wish all Floridians observing Three Kings Day a happy time of joy and love."
