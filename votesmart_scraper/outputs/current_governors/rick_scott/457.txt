Governor Rick Scott Kicks-Off the JAXPORT Mile Point Harbor Improvement Project
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: July 7, 2015
Location: Jacksonville, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott officially kicked-off JAXPORT's Mile Point harbor improvement project which will remove existing navigational restrictions on the St. Johns River at Mile Point. This project will ensure larger ships can travel the channel more efficiently, saving shippers and businesses time and money in loading and unloading cargo. The state invested $43.5 million for the Mile Point harbor improvement project.
Governor Scott said, "Since taking office, my administration has invested more than $850 million in seaport infrastructure improvements in Florida, which has helped make our state a global trade leader and has created thousands of jobs. In February, I was excited to announce that Volkswagen Group of America chose JAXPORT as the location of its import facility and Southeastern distribution center, and in April, I announced Nestle USA was shifting a majority of their U.S. to Puerto Rico shipments from the Port of New York and New Jersey to JAXPORT. We look forward to welcoming more shippers and businesses to JAXPORT because of this important investment."
Currently, larger container ships can only travel the St. Johns River during two four-hour periods of the day due to the tidal effects at the Mile Point location. The improvement will correct cross-currents that keep larger ships from using the channel. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved the project, however, no federal funding was appropriated. The state of Florida advanced the funding to ensure completion of the project.
