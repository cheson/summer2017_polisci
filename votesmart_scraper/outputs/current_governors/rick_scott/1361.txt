Governor Rick Scott Embarks on Week-Long Canada Trade Mission
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: June 6, 2011
Location: Montréal, Québec

Keeping his promise to be Florida's chief economic development officer and create 700,000 jobs over seven years, Florida Governor Rick Scott today embarked on a week-long trade mission to Canada to entice Canadian companies to do business in Florida.
Joining Governor Scott on the five-day, two-city tour is Enterprise Florida President Gray Swoope and a delegation of key Florida business leaders and stakeholders. The delegation will visit both Montreal and Toronto -- Canada's largest city.
"Combine the impact of two-way trade, investment and tourism, and Canada is Florida's number one economic partner, so it makes sense that this would be one of my very first trade missions," said Governor Scott. "Over the next week I will meet with Canadian officials and business leaders to discuss opportunities for increased trade, tourism and business that will benefit both of our economies."
On Wednesday, Governor Scott will make an important economic development announcement from Montreal.
This is Governor Scott's second trade mission since taking office. In March he traveled to Panama to view first-hand the expansion of the Panama Canal.
