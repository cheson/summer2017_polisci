This week, I signed legislation that increases funding to Florida schools by $1 billion. I would like to thank the Florida House and Senate for answering my call and putting Florida's students first.
During my time as Governor, I have spoken with Floridians across the state. I quickly learned that the two issues that they care about the most are jobs and education. These two issues go hand-in-hand. Employers want to locate in states that have quality educational systems.
This historic increase in funding will ensure that Florida's schools are in a position to educate our state's future workforce. With this increased funding comes increased responsibility. It is important that we continue to hold Florida's schools to a high standard. We must ensure that our educational system is held accountable to educate our children properly.
I am confident that continuing to invest in Florida's schools will prepare our state to be the best place to live, work and play for years to come.
