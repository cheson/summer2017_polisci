Today, Florida Governor Rick Scott issued the following statement on the Department of Defense's (DOD) announcement that they have reduced furlough days from 11 to six, with Monday, August 12, 2013, being the last furlough day of the DOD's current fiscal year. The DOD did not indicate in their announcement if they would spare the military from additional pay cuts and readiness reductions in the 2014 fiscal year, which begins in October.
Governor Rick Scott said, "It's great news that President Obama has stepped up to the plate to end National Guard furloughs for the rest of August and September. We are hopeful that this common sense approach to budgeting will now also apply to the Guard's next fiscal year, which begins in October. It is crazy to cut the pay of our American heroes when fiscal savings has been offered from other areas that do not hurt Florida families or jeopardize our preparedness efforts during hurricane season."
Governor Scott, along with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, wrote President Obama on July 8, 2013 to immediately end the National Guard furloughs which began that day. Governor Scott has repeatedly called for an end to the National Guard furloughs (forced leave without pay), and most recently spoke with DOD Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carteron on July 16 about the urgency of this request.
