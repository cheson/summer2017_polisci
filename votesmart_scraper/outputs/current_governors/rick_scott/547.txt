Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement in response to ZipRecruiter's study of the top Southern cities for job growth which found Tampa as the # 1 region, followed by Jacksonville at # 5, Orlando-Kissimmee at # 10 and Ft. Myers-Cape Coral at # 11.
Governor Scott said, "The Tampa area's #1 ranking is great news for Florida families. In addition to Tampa's top ranking, Jacksonville, Orlando-Kissimmee, and Ft. Myers-Cape Coral were all ranked in the top 15. Last week we were pleased to announce that Florida added over 29,000 private sector jobs in March and that we have had over 40 months of job growth in our state. These rankings demonstrate that it's working in Florida, and we will continue working every day to make Florida the global leader for job creation."
