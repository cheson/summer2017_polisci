Yesterday, Governor Rick Scott visited the Florida Holocaust Museum to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day. After the visit, Governor Scott presented a proclamation to the museum marking Sunday, April 7, through Sunday, April 14, 2013, as Days of Remembrance in memory of the victims of the Holocaust.
Governor Scott said, "I was honored to be at the Florida Holocaust Museum on such a solemn occasion. The Holocaust is much more than a history lesson -- it is a stark reminder that evil exists in the world. Even today we must remain ready to confront hatred and bigotry in all forms. I took my two daughters to visit Auschwitz and Birkenau to teach them this firsthand. When I was in Israel, the First Lady and I visited Yad Vashem. Every generation must heed the call to action in the face of evil. This is the Holocaust's enduring lesson to mankind."
