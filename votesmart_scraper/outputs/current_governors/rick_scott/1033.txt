Today, Florida Governor Rick Scott released the following statement in anticipation of President Obama's visit to Chattanooga, Tennessee where he is expected to unveil a proposal aimed at supporting American manufacturing by cutting the corporate income tax rate:
"When President Obama visited Jacksonville last week, we urged him to follow our lead in Florida and cut corporate taxes to help our country's manufacturing industry. Today, we welcome his support of cutting the corporate income tax rate less than a week after his visit to our state. In Florida, we have eliminated business taxes for 70 percent of businesses and we recently eliminated sales taxes on manufacturing equipment."
