Governor Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi today announced the expansion of Interconnect Cables (ICTC) at Brooksville -- Tampa Bay Regional Airport. ICTC's new 44,300 sq ft. facility will manufacture electronic assemblies and box builds for clients around the world. The expansion will add 40 new jobs with a capital investment of $3.1 million.
Governor Scott said, "Interconnect's decision to expand their presence at Brooksville -- Tampa Bay Regional Airport and create 40 jobs proves why Florida is becoming a top destination for manufacturers to expand and grow. We have worked hard to eliminate the sales tax on manufacturing equipment. With more than 365,000 private-sector jobs created since December 2010, Florida is the best place for business."
"ICTC's decision to expand in Florida is a testament to the fact that our great state truly is the best place to live, work, and raise a family," stated Attorney General Pam Bondi.
ICTC has evolved from a local cable assembly house to a worldwide provider of electronic manufacturing solutions since its founding in 1988. Their time testing manufacturing capabilities range from prototyping, to complete turnkey, contract manufacturing in over a dozen industries.
"We have opened businesses in many countries, and the coordination and support of the Brooksville -- Tampa Bay Regional Airport, Hernando County and the Florida Governor's office have been a model for how all public servants should work together to expand private sector opportunities and create jobs in a community," said Sareet Majumdar, CEO of ICTC.
