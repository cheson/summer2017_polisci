Governor Rick Scott and Amazon today announced Amazon's proposal to create more than 3,000 full time jobs with benefits and more than $300 million in investment in Florida by the end of 2016.
Governor Scott said, "Amazon's commitment to create more than 3,000 new jobs in Florida is further proof that we've turned our economy around. Amazon will continue to work with Enterprise Florida on its ongoing projects which will include a return on any taxpayer investment, and we look forward to the company's announcements as it chooses locations and creates jobs in Florida."
"We thank Governor Scott for his commitment to creating jobs in Florida," said Paul Misener, Amazon vice president of global public policy. "We propose to create more than 3,000 new jobs and over $300 million in investment in Florida, while we work toward enactment of the federal Marketplace Fairness Act, which will protect states' rights to make their own revenue policy choices."
Amazon will begin collecting Florida sales tax at such time as it is required under current Florida law. To make the proposed job creation and investments economically viable, the availability of economic development incentives will be a material factor in any final location decisions.
