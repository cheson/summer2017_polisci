Governor Rick Scott today announced that Florida's statewide unemployment rate in September was 6.1 percent, down 0.2 percentage point from last month and down 0.8 percentage point from the September 2013 rate of 6.9 percent. Florida created 12,800 private-sector jobs in September 2014. Since December 2010, Florida's private-sector businesses have added 651,300 jobs for Florida families. Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since April 2012.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today's announcement that Florida businesses have created nearly 13,000 private-sector jobs is great news for Florida families. Together since December 2010, Florida job creators have created 651,300 private-sector jobs. Florida's unemployment rate has also dropped from 6.3 to 6.1 percent, the lowest it has been since June 2008. Our policies are working in Florida, and more-and-more Floridians are able to get a job and support their family, and we will keep working until every Floridian who wants a job can get one."
Since December 2010, Florida's unemployment rate has dropped 5.0 percentage points, from 11.1 percent down now to 6.1 percent in September 2014. Florida's unemployment rate has declined or held steady over the month for 46 of the last 49 months.
Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "The 12,800 new private-sector jobs, the 261,000 online jobs ads, and the decreasing unemployment rate are all indicators that Florida is continuing to grow its opportunity economy. Florida offers the perfect climate for families and business to plan for their future."
Florida's labor force increased over the month and over the year in September. On an annual basis, Florida's labor force has increased for 55 consecutive months. This economic indicator can be a sign of optimism as more people are entering the labor force with confidence in their prospects for finding employment. The labor force is defined as the sum of employment plus unemployment (those with a job and those without a job but actively seeking work).
The long-term positive trends in the unemployment rate and job counts are among the most important economic indicators to consider when analyzing the health of Florida's economic recovery. The state's private-sector job counts have been steadily on the rise for over four years, showing that Florida's businesses are responding to the state's improving economic climate. Since December 2010, the state has added 651,300 private-sector jobs.
