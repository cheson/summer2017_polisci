Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) added 19,800 new jobs in October 2014 compared to a year ago. The unemployment rate in the Tampa metro area declined by 0.8 percentage point over the year, from 6.8 percent in October 2013 to 6.0 percent in October 2014.
Governor Scott said, "The creation of 19,800 new jobs over the year means that more Floridians in the Tampa area are able to provide for their families and prepare for their future. Let's keep working to create an opportunity economy, so that all Floridians have the opportunities to succeed for generations to come."
The industries with the largest gain in jobs over the year in the metro area were professional and business services with 10,200 new jobs and trade, transportation, and utilities with 6,800 new jobs. In October 2014, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater MSA was also among the top two metro areas in Florida for gains over the year in professional and business services.
The Tampa Bay MSA was first among the state metro areas in online job demand in October 2014 with 44,908 openings. The metro area was also first in the state in demand for STEM occupations with 12,266 openings in October. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In October, CareerSource Tampa Bay, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 39,300 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 8,346 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
Florida created 32,000 private-sector jobs in October 2014, and since December 2010, Florida has created 679,000 private-sector jobs. Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since April 2012. Florida's statewide unemployment rate for October 2014 was 6.0 percent, down 0.7 percentage point from the October 2013 rate.
