I campaigned on creating jobs and turning Florida's economy around. After being sworn-in on Tuesday, I signed four executive orders to freeze job-killing regulations and require state agencies to verify legal immigration status.
I took the first of many steps to reduce government spending by taking steps to sell the two state-owned-and-operated airplanes that currently cost $2.4 million a year to operate.
We are creating the best climate for job creation by making government smaller and less intrusive. To help us reduce regulation and streamline permitting processes, I named agency heads at the Department of State and the Department of Community Affairs. They will help move my agenda forward.
Yesterday, I visited Florida International Academy, a charter school in Opa-locka with Michelle Rhee, a nationally recognized education visionary and innovator who served on our education transition team.
I am grateful Michelle has agreed to partner with us as an Informal Education Advisor. By creating a system where the funds follow the student, not the program, we can create more choice, more option and more flexibility for parents in their children's education.
Michelle will help us come up with the best ideas for making our schools the best in the nation so we have the best educated workforce. Friday, I also visited Port Canaveral where Disney announce 450 new jobs.
I look forward to unveiling my budget recommendations later this month. Every day, I re-dedicate myself and our team to our mission here in Tallahassee -- to make Florida the jobs state and to Floridians back to work.
