Statement from Governor Rick Scott Regarding Yom Kippur
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Oct. 7, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"The Jewish community will begin observing Yom Kippur, a time of self-reflection and deep personal prayer, tonight at sundown.
"While this day is special to the Jewish people, I hope all Floridians will take this time to reflect on their lives and their communities. Yom Kippur reminds us that through personal action, we each have the power to improve our lives and the lives of those we love. It also stresses the importance of mercy, forgiveness, and acts of charity--timeless values in these difficult times. Now, more than ever, it is important that we remain committed to helping our neighbors, fellow Floridians and those less fortunate.
"Ann and I extend our best wishes for an easy fast to all those observing Yom Kippur. While our Jewish friends pray, let us all pray for our national security and for the men and women in uniform who protect us each day."
