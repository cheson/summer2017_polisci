Location: Fort Lauderdale, FL

Republican gubernatorial nominee Rick Scott today released the following statement in support of Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum's lawsuit challenging ObamaCare.
Scott said, "Today marks the beginning of what many of us hope is a rollback of the single largest government power grab in history -- the federal lawsuit against President Obama's government health care plan. Floridians are truly fortunate that Attorney General Bill McCollum had the foresight and took the initiative to bring this lawsuit to protect the rights of all Floridians against President Obama's big government power grab. While Attorney General McCollum and I may have had our differences on the campaign trail, when it comes to this lawsuit and rolling back ObamaCare we speak with one voice -- we must protect Floridian's freedom to make their own health care choices. This lawsuit is destined to become one of the most consequential in American history and all Floridians owe Attorney General McCollum a debt of gratitude for his continued work and leadership to protect our rights and the Constitution."
