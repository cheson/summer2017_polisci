Following up from recent letters to business owners from Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, California, Connecticut, New York and Maryland urging them to book a one-way ticket to Florida, Governor Rick Scott contacted Massachusetts businesses earlier this week. Governor Scott is urging them to come to the Sunshine State to take advantage of Florida's business-friendly environment.
Governor Scott said, "Florida's economic formula is working -- while Florida's unemployment rate has seen the second largest drop in the country, Massachusetts' June unemployment rate increased to the highest since November 2011. While Florida ranks 5th in the nation for our business tax climate, Massachusetts is stuck at #22, according to the Tax Foundation. It's bound to get worse in Massachusetts, as just last week we saw them raise taxes on gasoline and even computer services."
