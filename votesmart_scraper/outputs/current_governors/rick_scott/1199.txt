"The Department of Health today filed an appeal to the federal court decision blocking enforcement of the Firearm Owner's Privacy Act. This law was carefully crafted to respect the First Amendment while ensuring a patient's constitutional right to own or possess a firearm without discrimination. I signed this legislation into law because I believe it is constitutional and I will continue to defend it."
