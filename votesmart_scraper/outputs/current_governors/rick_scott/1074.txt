Governor Rick Scott To Lead Trade Mission To Chile This Week
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: May 20, 2013
Location: Unknown

This week, Governor Rick Scott will lead an Enterprise Florida trade mission to Santiago, Chile with more than 100 representatives from Florida businesses, higher education institutions, and other organizations to expand investment with Chile and create job opportunities for Florida families. The trade mission includes nearly 20 Florida manufacturers and exporters which will be matched with Chilean importers through the U.S. Embassy's Gold Key Program. Chile is Florida's seventh largest trade partner with nearly $7.7 billion in bilateral trade. Florida-origin exports to Chile have expanded by 53% in the last two years, and the state has experienced a two-way trade growth of 262% since the implementation of the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement in January 2004.
Governor Scott said, "Florida is positioned to be the number-one state for international trade. We have a diverse workforce, low taxes and a top-ranked infrastructure. As Florida's economy continues to grow, trade missions are an important way to strengthen the state's presence in the global market. I look forward to leading a trade delegation to Chile as we work to make Florida the number one state to live, work and raise a family."
The trade mission also aims to attract more Chilean cargo through Florida ports. The Port of Panama City is the number one port for Chilean copper and the Miami International Airport is the top entry point for Chilean salmon. International trade moving through the state's seaports was valued at $85.5 billion in 2012 -- including $42.3 billion in imports and $43.2 billion in exports. This number is up nearly 28 percent from 2010. Maritime cargo activities at Florida ports are responsible for generating more than 550,000 direct and indirect jobs and $90 billion in total economic value. These activities contribute $2.2 billion in state and local tax revenues.
Secretary of Commerce and President and CEO of Enterprise Florida Gray Swoope said, "Through our international trade and export assistance programs, Enterprise Florida is helping state businesses expand on a global scale and, ultimately, create more jobs. International missions, like the one to Chile, provide a unique opportunity for Florida companies to establish relationships with international companies. These trips are especially important to our small businesses, which account for the majority of international trade in Florida."
A Record of Success: International missions have been very successful for Florida, providing a notable return on the state's investment into business development activities and long-range jobs-producing opportunities. Governor Scott led trade and business development missions to Panama, Canada, Brazil, Israel, Spain, United Kingdom and Colombia. The Governor's active and innovative approach to promoting international business last year won him an award as the top U.S. governor for foreign direct investment (FDI) strategy from London-based fDi Magazine.
