Press Release

Location: Naples, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island metro area experienced positive annual job growth with an increase of 5,000 jobs over the year in July 2015. The MSA's unemployment rate declined by 0.9 percentage point over the year, from 6.8 percent in July 2014 to 5.9 percent in July 2015. Florida businesses have added 917,400 private-sector jobs since December 2010. Governor Scott made the announcement at Haynes Corporation, a manufacturer of precision diesel fuel injection systems that has created nearly 50 new jobs in Naples since 2011.
Governor Scott said, "I was proud to visit Haynes Corporation today to announce that the Naples area economy grew by 5,000 new jobs over the year in July. Haynes Corporation is a testament to our work to make Florida the most business-friendly state in the nation. Due to high taxes and regulations, Haynes relocated a division of their company from high-tax California to Florida two years ago and has created nearly 50 jobs."
Haynes Corporation is the only independent, domestic manufacturer of precision diesel fuel injection systems for heavy duty engines. They have been operating out of Florida since 1988. In 2004, Haynes acquired a company in Norwalk California to further develop their fuel injection products. However, due to the high cost of business, high taxes and crippling regulations, Haynes moved that portion of the company from California to Naples in 2013. Over the past three years, they have doubled their number of employees, from 42 in 2011 to 90 now.
Brian Taylor, Haynes Corporation's Controller and Director of Human Resources, said, "Haynes Corporation is proud of our history of success in the Sunshine State and of our ability to provide rewarding jobs to local Floridians. We have seen firsthand that no other state can offer us the same low-tax, business-friendly climate as Florida, and we are grateful to Governor Scott for recognizing our team today."
The industries gaining the most jobs in the metro area over the year in July 2015 were trade, transportation, and utilities with 1,200 new jobs and education and health services and professional and business services with 900 new jobs each. The Naples metro area had 3,736 online job openings in July 2015, and the area also had 663 online openings for high wage, high skill science technology engineering math (STEM) occupations.
Florida created 16,900 private-sector jobs in July 2015, and a total of 917,400 private-sector jobs since December 2010. Florida's statewide unemployment rate for July 2015 was 5.4 percent. In July, more than 36,600 Floridians were placed in jobs by CareerSource Southwest Florida and the state's other 23 regional workforce boards.
