Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Naples-Marco Island Metropolitan Statistical Area experienced positive annual job growth with an increase of 6,700 jobs over the year in January 2015. The MSA's unemployment rate declined by 0.8 percentage point over the year, from 6.0 percent in January 2014 to 5.2 percent in January 2015. Florida businesses have added more than 801,000 private-sector jobs since December 2010.
Governor Scott said, "The creation of 6,700 new private sector jobs over the year in Naples means more Floridians will be able to find opportunities to succeed. We want to out-complete the rest of the world and make Florida the global destination for jobs, and today's news is great but we will keep working everyday to reach that goal."
The industries gaining the most jobs in this metro area over the year in January 2015 were construction with 1,600 new jobs, trade, transportation, and utilities with 1,500 new jobs, and professional and business services with 1,100 new jobs. The Naples-Marco Island MSA had 4,041 online job openings in January 2015, and the area also had 686 online openings for high wage, high skill science technology engineering math (STEM) occupations.
Every March, the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases revised historical employment (jobs) and unemployment rates based on a benchmarking process to adjust the data. These benchmark revisions are mandated by BLS and take place this time every year in every state. This process introduces new population inputs from the most recent Census and other revisions to economic data which leads to changes in the original estimates.
Florida created 14,600 private-sector jobs in January 2015, and a total of 801,100 private-sector jobs since December 2010. Florida's statewide unemployment rate for January 2015 was 5.7 percent. In January, more than 35,500 Floridians were placed in jobs by CareerSource Central Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards.
