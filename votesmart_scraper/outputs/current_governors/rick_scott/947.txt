Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that he has agreed to a friendly wager with Alabama Governor Robert Bentley on the outcome of Monday's Florida State Seminole and Auburn Tiger BCS National Championship Game. If Florida State wins, Governor Bentley will send a gallon of Toomer's Lemonade, and if Auburn wins, Governor Rick Scott will send a fresh Florida Key Lime Pie, from Kermit's in Key West.
Governor Scott said, "Florida is the nation's premier state for football. Florida State has had a great undefeated season, and I look forward to an exciting game and some ice cold lemonade from Toomer's. Go Noles."
"I am pleased to join my good friend Governor Rick Scott in this friendly football wager," Governor Robert Bentley said. "I am looking forward to a great game between the Auburn Tigers and the Florida State Seminoles in the national championship. Both teams have worked hard all year and deserve to play for the national title. The crystal trophy has been in the State of Alabama for the last four years, and I expect it will remain in Alabama. I hope to enjoy a slice of Governor Scott's key lime pie to celebrate Auburn's national championship win."
