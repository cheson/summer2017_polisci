Governor Rick Scott and Israeli Consul General Chaim Shacham signed a Memorandum of Understanding between Florida and Israel to support research, development, and commercialization of projects related to aerospace and other technology sectors. Florida's $1 million will be matched dollar-for-dollar by Israel, to create a $2 million joint research fund.
Governor Scott said, "Our Florida Families First Budget committed $1 million in recurring funds to further Florida's long-standing economic partnership with Israel. The memorandum of understanding we signed today creates a targeted investment that will increase Florida's role as a hub for global commerce, deepen the Florida-Israel relationship, and create jobs and opportunities for Florida's families."
