Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida businesses created 17,900 private-sector jobs across the state in September, bringing the total number of jobs created in 2016 to nearly 200,000. Since December 2010, 1,222,500 private-sector jobs have been created in Florida. Governor Scott made the announcement at the ribbon cutting ceremony for Uniform Advantage's new headquarter office in Fort Lauderdale. The company designs and manufactures scrubs for hospitals, dental clinics and veterinary offices and employs more than 260 Floridians.
Governor Scott said, "I am proud to announce that Florida businesses created nearly 18,000 new jobs last month, bringing the total number of jobs created since December 2010 to more than 1.2 million. Florida's annual job growth rate has also outpaced the nation for four and half years, which is sending a message across the country that our state is the best place for businesses and families to succeed. We will continue to do all we can to encourage job creators to invest in our state so we can create more opportunities for Floridians to provide for their families and achieve their dreams."
For the 54th consecutive month, Florida's annual job growth rate of 3.6 percent is exceeding the nation's rate of 1.9 percent. The state's unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent in September, the lowest rate since November 2007.
Cissy Proctor, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said, "Since December 2010, nearly 1.25 million Floridians and their families have gotten a new job. Our explosive job growth has helped Florida's recovery from the recession and has established our state as a national leader in job creation."

Education and health services with 6,900 new jobs;
