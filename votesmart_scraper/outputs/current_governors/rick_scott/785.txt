Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Naples-Marco Island Metropolitan Statistical Area experienced positive annual job growth with an increase of 5,500 jobs over the year according to the June 2014 report. The MSA's unemployment rate declined by 1.7 percentage points over the year, from 7.5 percent in June 2013 to 5.8 percent in June 2014.
Governor Scott said, "With 5,500 new jobs and a steady decrease in the unemployment rate, the Naples area is heading in the right direction. While we're thrilled to see our pro-growth, business-friendly policies working, let's keep working until every person who wants a job can find one."
The industries gaining the most jobs in this metro area over the year in June 2014 were in construction with 1,600 new jobs and both leisure and hospitality and professional and business services with 900 new jobs each. In June 2014, the Naples-Marco Island MSA had the fastest annual job growth rate compared to all the metro areas in the state in total employment, with growth of 4.6 percent over the year.
The Naples-Marco Island MSA had 4,439 online job openings in June 2014, growing by 17 percent over the year. The area also had 545 online openings for STEM occupations. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill. Additionally, housing starts were up 13.8 percent over the year in the Naples metro area in May 2014.
In June, CareerSource Southwest Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 35,000 Floridians were placed in jobs.
