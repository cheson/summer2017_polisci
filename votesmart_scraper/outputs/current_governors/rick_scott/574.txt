Gov. Rick Scott: Florida Families Have Saved More Than $196 Million from Auto Tag Fee Cut
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: March 31, 2015
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Rick Scott today announced that Florida families have saved more than $196 million since the reductions in Florida's motor vehicle registration fees went into effect on September 1, 2014. The reductions were proposed by Governor Scott last year as part of his 2014-2015 "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget," and were approved by the Florida Legislature during the 2014 legislative session. A total of $400 million in annual vehicle registration fees were cut for Florida families and almost 7 million registrations have seen savings as a result of Governor Scott's tax cut.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Families should be able to keep more of what they earn, and that is why we have remained focused on cutting taxes and fees that directly impact all Floridians. Last year, we reduced the fee on vehicle registrations which has already saved Floridians over $196 million since last September. Reducing fees and taxes helps businesses create more opportunities for Floridians to get a great job and live their dreams. It also helps families have more money in their pockets to pay the bills and put food on the table. This year I am committed to cutting $673 million in taxes, including the cell phone and TV tax."
