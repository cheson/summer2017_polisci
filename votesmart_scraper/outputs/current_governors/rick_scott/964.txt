Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that the Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall metro area's unemployment rate has declined by 0.7 percentage point over the year, from 9.2 percent in October 2012 to 8.5 percent in October 2013. The Miami metro area has experienced 40 consecutive months of positive over-the-year job growth, with an increase of 9,000 jobs over the year.
Governor Rick Scott said, "The over the year unemployment rate decrease and job growth in the Miami metro area demonstrates that our job-creating policies are working. The Miami area economy has grown for 40 consecutive months. These 9,000 new jobs mean Florida's families are getting back to work."
In October 2013, the Miami metro area was among the top four metro areas in Florida for gains over the year in trade, transportation, and utilities, in leisure and hospitality, financial activities, and information. The Manpower Employment Outlook Survey for the fourth quarter of 2013 indicates that Miami metro area employers expect to hire at an encouraging pace during the quarter. Thirteen percent of the companies interviewed plan to hire more employees.
Housing starts were up by 70.2 percent over the year in the Miami metro area in August 2013. The Miami metro area had the third-highest online job demand in Florida in October 2013 with 35,106 openings and had the third-highest number of openings for STEM occupations in October 2013 with 7,445 online ads. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
Florida's unemployment rate decreased to 6.7 percent in October 2013, down from 6.8 percent in September 2013 and 7.0 in August 2013, and down 4.4 percentage points since December 2010.
