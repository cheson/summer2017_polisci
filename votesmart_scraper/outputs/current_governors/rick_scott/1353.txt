Governor Rick Scott's Weekly Radio Address

This is Governor Rick Scott. This week I signed three bills that cut the cost of government and make our state a safer place to live, work and play.
The first bill cuts next year's property taxes for homeowners and businesses by more than $210-million-dollars. Lowering taxes is the most important step we can take to create jobs in our state.
This tax cut allows families and businesses to use more of their hard-earned money how they see best, instead of a government agency.
Next, I signed legislation to reform Florida's retirement system. It will protect Florida's government retirees, their pensions and Florida taxpayers.
State workers will now put 3-percent of their salaries toward their retirement -- just like the private sector does. Without reform, Florida's government pensions overburden our state's taxpayers.
Last, I was honored to sign into law Silver Alerts that prevent tragedy when a person with dementia or Alzheimer's disease is missing. Silver Alerts help law enforcement officers find missing seniors who may be in a dangerous situation -- and safely return them to their loved ones.
In closing, I ask you to keep in your prayers the families of the two firefighters who lost their lives battling wildfires in our state this week.
