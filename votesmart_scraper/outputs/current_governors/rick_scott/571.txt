Today, Governor Rick Scott extended good wishes to Floridians for Passover and Easter.
Governor Scott said, "Easter provides an opportunity for families to come together and share in the hope of the holiday's redemptive promise. Ann and I look forward to celebrating the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday with our children and grandchildren, and we hope families across our state get to gather and celebrate with their loved ones.
"We also extend our best wishes to all those celebrating Passover. Passover is a time to reflect on the story and traditions of the Jewish people and Florida is proud of our unbreakable bond with the state of Israel. We hope all of our Jewish friends have a happy and healthy Passover.
"During special holidays like this, we also set aside time to recognize the brave men and women who serve our country at home and abroad. We honor all of our active duty military members and veterans for upholding the ideals of American freedom and liberty that we enjoy each day."
