Today, Governor Rick Scott made the following statement wishing all Floridians a happy Easter celebration.
Governor Scott said, "Ann and I join every family throughout our state celebrating the Easter holiday this weekend. Across the state, Florida families honor the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. This Easter, Ann and I will be spending time with our daughters, their husbands and our three grandsons. To me and my family, Easter has always been a reminder of the many blessings we have as Floridians and Americans.
"We will also pause and remember our brave men and women who are serving overseas and away from their families this holiday weekend. We thank them, and all of our service men and women, and veterans for their countless contributions to America. Ann and I will continue to pray for their safety and for their families, recognizing they are serving around the world and are unable to be with their loved ones for Easter. Because of their sacrifice, we are all able to enjoy this holiday peacefully in a free country."
