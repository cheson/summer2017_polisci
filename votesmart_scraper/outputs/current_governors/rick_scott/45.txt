Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced his "Fighting for Florida's Future" budget which proposes $618 million in tax cuts to help Florida families and small businesses. The Governor's recommended budget also invests record funding in Florida's education system, strengthens environmental protection efforts, supports law enforcement and fights for Florida's growing job market.
Governor Scott said, "Florida businesses have added more than 1.2 million jobs over the last six years and our economy is booming because of our continued focus on cutting taxes, reducing burdensome regulations and fostering an environment where job creators can grow and succeed in Florida. Our "Fighting for Florida's Future' budget continues our hard work and cuts taxes by $618 million while making strategic investments in areas that are important to families. Because our economy continues to grow, we are able to make these investments while also paying down debt and setting aside $5 billion in reserves. I look forward to working with the Legislature this session to make Florida the best place in the world for our future generations."
Cuts Taxes and Fees
The "Fighting for Florida's Future" budget proposes to cut taxes by more than $618 million including decreasing the tax on business rents, providing a one-year sales tax exemption on college textbooks, cutting the business tax, exempting school book fairs from the sales tax and implementing a 10-day back-to-school sales tax holiday, nine-day disaster preparedness sales tax holiday, three-day veteran's sales tax holiday and one-day camping and fishing sales tax holiday.
