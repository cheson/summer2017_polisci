Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that $2.45 million in defense grants will be awarded to 14 communities hosting military installations. These grants have been utilized for more than 15 years to help Florida maintain its reputation as the most military-friendly state in the nation.
Governor Scott said, "These investments are key to sustaining Florida's military installations and the more than 758,000 jobs the military and defense industry supports in our state. I am grateful to Florida's servicemen and women, veterans and military families for their sacrifices and dedication to protecting families across Florida and the nation. I am proud to announce these $2.45 million of grants that are necessary to protect Florida's military sector and keep our state the most military-friendly state in the nation."
Florida's military and defense industry is responsible for $73.4 billion, or 9.4 percent, of Florida's gross state product, which translates to jobs for more than 758,000 Floridians.
Senate President Don Gaetz said, "Governor Scott, Speaker Weatherford and I are committed to making Florida's communities the most military-friendly in America. As the sponsor of the enabling legislation, I'm keenly aware that the work of the Defense Support Task Force is critical to preserving and protecting Florida's bases and missions and I am grateful to the Task Force for making another significant investment in Northwest Florida."
House Speaker Will Weatherford (R-Wesley Chapel) said, "I am proud of the role Florida's military communities play in keeping our nation safe. This funding supports jobs and provides stability in the communities supporting our military bases."
