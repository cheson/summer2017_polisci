Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: June 30, 2015
Location: Miami, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced $80,000 in defense grants for Miami-Dade County. The funding will be used to support United States Southern Command and Homestead Air Reserve Base. This effort will work to sustain the defense industry's $5.1 billion economic impact in Miami-Dade County.
Governor Scott said, "America's military have protected our freedoms throughout our nation's history, and we are proud to announce $80,000 in grants for Miami-Dade County. As a veteran myself, I understand the importance of supporting our nation's military and their families. We will continue to work every day to ensure Florida remains the most military-friendly state in the nation."
For more than 15 years the defense grants have been successful tools in assisting local defense partners in supporting the State's military installations. Florida's military and defense sector is responsible for 9.4 percent -- or $73.4 billion -- of the Sunshine State's economy. This translates to more than 758,000 statewide direct and indirect jobs.
