Location: Fort Lauderdale, FL

Rick Scott today called on the organizers of the Koran burning to cancel the event.
"As an outsider fighting to turn our state around, my priority remains focused on creating jobs and getting Florida moving again. But, as the anniversary of the September 11th attacks approaches, anyone who seeks to lead this state has an obligation to speak out on an entirely different matter.
The eyes of the nation have turned to Florida and a small group here that plans to burn the Koran on September 11th. I sincerely ask the organizers to stop, reflect and change their plans.
I agree with General Petraeus. This kind of provocation is deeply wrong and even dangerous.
As this situation unfolds, Floridians of all faiths should come together and say this provocation doesn't reflect the values of our great state."
