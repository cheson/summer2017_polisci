Governor Rick Scott today celebrated the opening of the 2015 Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, taking place from March 27-29. The Race will be held in St. Petersburg through 2017, and is expected to welcome more than 150,000 race fans from across the world each year. Spectators and race crews will book about 27,000 hotel rooms in the Tampa Bay area this weekend, and the race will also be broadcasted to 180 million homes in 171 countries.
Governor Rick Scott said, "The Grand Prix of St. Petersburg has helped attract a record number of visitors to our state and showcases Florida to an audience of hundreds of millions around the globe. Last year we welcomed over 97 million tourists to Florida and every 85 tourists create one Florida job. These great events help establish Florida as the number one travel destination in the world and we are excited to welcome families and visitors to this weekend's race."
Now in its 11th year, The Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg is run on a 1.8-mile, 14-turn waterfront circuit that includes a combination of adjacent downtown streets circling Pioneer Park, the Duke Energy Center for the Arts, The Dali Museum and extending onto the runways at Albert Whitted Airport, which overlook the Tampa Bay and St. Petersburg Harbor and Marina.
Organizers of the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg have named Vincent Jackson, three-time Pro Bowl wide receiver of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, as Grand Marshal and Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Alex Cobb as the Honorary Starter. For a fifth consecutive year, the event will serve as the season-opening race for the Verizon IndyCar Series and the Mazda Road to Indy.
