Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: March 12, 2015
Location: Sanford, FL

Governor Rick Scott today announced the creation of 20 new jobs at Hernon Manufacturing. Hernon Manufacturing, a worldwide innovator of high performance adhesive sealants and precision dispensing equipment, has increased their sales by 100 percent over the last three years. The addition of 20 new jobs and expansion of their Sanford location will increase their workforce by nearly 50 percent.
Governor Scott said, "In order for Florida to be the number one place in the world to get a job, we must continue to cut taxes for Florida families and job creators like Hernon. That's why we are working to eliminate the sales tax that manufacturers pay when they buy new equipment and cut over $673 million in taxes, including rolling back the taxes on cell phones and TV."
Harry Arnon, President & Chief Executive Officer of Hernon said, "Thanks to Governor Scott's tax cut on manufacturing equipment and Florida's favorable climate for business, we are able to expand our operations and hire more Floridians. Hernon manufacturing is proud to be a part of the Sanford community and we look forward to continued growth."
