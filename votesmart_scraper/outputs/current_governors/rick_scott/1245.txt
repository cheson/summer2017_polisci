This week I signed my Job Creation and Economic Growth agenda into law. With this plan, Florida's unemployment rate will continue to drop. My agenda includes measures to clean up regional workforce boards, to make them more efficient and accountable.
It will also turn our current unemployment system into a re-employment system that focuses on providing free training to Florida's out of work citizens. Also, to help create jobs in our state, we have enacted measures to eliminate burdensome state rules and regulations.
And finally, my 2012 job creation and economic growth agenda provides tax relief for Florida's businesses and working families. I am confident that this package, together with an additional $1 billion for education, will make Florida the best state in the nation to live, work and play.
