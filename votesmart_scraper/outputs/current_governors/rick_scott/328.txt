Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the "Ready, Set, Work" Guarantee Challenge for Florida Technical Colleges and Centers. Governor Scott is challenging Florida's 48 Technical Colleges and Centers to issue a guarantee to businesses that their workers are ready to work on the very first day on the job, or they will be retrained at no cost to the business or the student. The "Ready, Set, Work" Technical Center Guarantee Challenge will help diversify Florida's economy and ensure employers receive the best and most prepared graduates in the nation.
Governor Scott said, "I am challenging 48 Florida Technical Colleges and Centers to issue a guarantee to businesses that their workers are ready to work on the very first day on the job or they will be retrained for free. When I talk to business owners, the number one thing they ask about when considering moving jobs to Florida is our education system. If Florida is going to overtake Texas, our number one competitor for jobs, we must be home to the most skilled workforce in the nation, and our technical colleges and centers are key to helping Florida become first in worker training and job growth."
