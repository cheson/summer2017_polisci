Location: Tallahassee, FL

Ahead of the President's visit to Florida, Governor Rick Scott issued the following statement regarding President Obama's decision to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism.
Governor Scott said, "President Obama's decision to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism is shameful. Cuba has done nothing to warrant being taken off this list. The Castro regime continues to undermine U.S. national security interests by sponsoring acts of terrorism. I will continue to stand with the pro-democracy movement in both Cuba and Florida in their fight against the Obama-Castro pact. The President should take time to reconsider this dangerous decision while in South Florida today."
