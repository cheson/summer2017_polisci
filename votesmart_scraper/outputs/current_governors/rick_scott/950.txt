Governor Rick Scott today announced that the statewide unemployment rate for November 2013 was 6.4 percent. The statewide unemployment rate has remained below the national average of 7.0 percent since March 2013. Florida added 6,000 private sector jobs in November 2013 and the state has created a total of 446,300 private sector jobs since December 2010.
Governor Scott said, "We haven't experienced an unemployment rate this low in over five years. At 6.4 percent, we're well below the nation's 7 percent unemployment rate, and we added another 6,000 new jobs in November. We've cut taxes, made government more efficient and provided more services to families. The result: we are creating an opportunity economy that supports more than 446,000 new private sector jobs since December 2010. Today's news is great, but we're not finished. We're proposing to cut automobile taxes and fees by $401 million in our next budget. In 2009, those fees were raised, and we're going to undo that 54 percent increase on Florida families."
The state gained 6,000 private sector jobs in November 2013. Florida's annual job growth rate of 2.5 percent in October and November 2013 was the fastest since June 2006. The state's annual job growth rate has exceeded or been equal to the nation's rate since March 2012.
DEO Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "The economic news just keeps getting better for Florida. We've had another significant drop in the unemployment rate, continued job growth, and job demand is at an all-time high. The policies of the Scott Administration are working to create an opportunity economy for all Floridians."
Since December 2010, Florida's statewide unemployment rate has dropped 4.7 percentage points, from a rate of 11.1 percent to November's rate of 6.4 percent. The current rate of 6.4 percent represents the lowest statewide unemployment rate since July 2008. It is also a decrease of 1.6 percentage points from November 2012, when the rate was 8.0 percent. Florida's unemployment rate has now declined year-over-year for 37 consecutive months.
