Dear Secretary Detzner:
By the authority vested in me as Governor of the State of Florida, under the provisions of Article III, Section 8, of the Constitution of Florida, I do hereby veto and transmit my objections to House Bill 725, enacted during the 115th Session of the Legislature of Florida, during the Regular Session of 2013 and entitled:
An act relating to public records and public meetings exemptionsÂ…
This bill removes the recording requirements for the closed meeting portions of the State Child Abuse Death Review Committee and its local counterparts. To protect sensitive and confidential information and the families involved in these cases, Chapter 119, Florida Statutes, currently exempts these recordings from disclosure. The matters addressed in these closed meetings are of a very serious and sensitive nature, and it is important to strike a careful balance between openness and reasonable confidentiality. With Florida's strong commitment to Government-in-the-Sunshine in mind, this balance is best struck by maintaining current recording requirements.
For these reasons, I withhold my approval of House Bill 725, and do hereby veto the same.
Sincerely,
Rick Scott
Governor
