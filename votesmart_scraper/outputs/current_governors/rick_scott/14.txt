Gov. Scott Signs Counterterrorism Legislation
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: May 25, 2017
Location: Orlando, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott signed HB 457 which creates criminal offenses for people who engage in illegal activities in connection with terrorist organizations or commit acts of terrorism.
Governor Scott said, "Last year, Florida came under attack when an ISIS-inspired terrorist stormed into Pulse Nightclub in Orlando and killed 49 innocent people. Today, while we continue to mourn this tragic loss of life, we are doing everything in our power to make sure that no family or community experiences that pain again. This important legislation will help ensure that those responsible for acts of terror like this are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and continue our efforts to prevent future attacks. I'd like to thank the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for their hard work on this bill. I'm proud to sign it into law today."
Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Rick Swearingen said, "I thank Governor Scott, the Florida Cabinet and the Legislature for their leadership and dedication to keeping Florida safe. Florida's crime rate continues to drop thanks to the hard work and dedication of our brave law enforcement officers. It is imperative that law enforcement has the tools and resources it needs to investigate crimes related to terrorism."
