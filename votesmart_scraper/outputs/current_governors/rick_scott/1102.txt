Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement on the Florida House of Representatives' proposal to spend additional state taxpayer dollars on healthcare services:
"Our challenge in healthcare is to best protect both the uninsured and the taxpayers in our state as we work to lower cost, expand access, and improve the quality of healthcare. The Legislature now has two different plans before them regarding the future of our healthcare system. The House's plan will cost Florida taxpayers on top of what they are already taxed under the President's new healthcare law. This would be a double-hit to state taxpayers. The Senate's plan will provide healthcare services to thousands of uninsured Floridians while the program is 100 percent federally funded. As it stands today, the Senate's plan is in line with what I said I would support because it protects both state taxpayers and the uninsured in our state. I look forward to continuing to work with both the House and the Senate as they discuss ways we can improve our healthcare system."
