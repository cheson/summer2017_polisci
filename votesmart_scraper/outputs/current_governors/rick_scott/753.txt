Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) added 15,100 new jobs in August 2014 compared to a year ago. This is the fifth-highest number of new jobs among all metro areas in Florida and the metro area added the most jobs of all the metro areas in the manufacturing industry. The unemployment rate in the Tampa metro area declined by 0.6 percentage points over the year, from 7.4 percent in August 2013 to 6.8 percent in August 2014.
Governor Scott said, "We're thrilled to continue to see both positive job growth and a decreasing unemployment rate in the Tampa area over the year. With 15,100 new jobs in the area over the year, including 2,000 in manufacturing, Tampa is certainly creating an opportunity economy, so let's keep working."
The industries with the largest gain in jobs over the year in the metro area were in trade, transportation, and utilities with 6,100 new jobs and professional and business services with 6,000 new jobs. In August 2014, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater MSA was the top metro area in Florida for gains over the year in manufacturing with 2,000 new jobs.
The Tampa Bay MSA was first among the state metro areas in online job demand in August 2014 with 44,025 openings. The metro area was also first in the state in demand for STEM occupations with 10,079 openings in August. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In August, CareerSource Tampa Bay, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 38,400 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 8,134 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
