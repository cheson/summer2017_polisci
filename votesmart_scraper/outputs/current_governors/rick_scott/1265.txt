Governor Rick Scott Announces Plan to Expand Port of Tampa Petroleum Facility
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Feb. 9, 2012
Location: Tampa, FL

While speaking at the Governor's Luncheon at the Florida State Fair today, Governor Rick Scott announced a bold new initiative aimed at upgrading and modernizing Tampa's port system. The 50-50 partnership between the State of Florida and the Port of Tampa will enable the port to handle up to five million more tons of petroleum products a year after its completion in 2014. The port estimates the project will create over 641 construction jobs, as well as more than 8,200 direct and indirect jobs over the next 30 years.
The Port of Tampa is an energy gateway for West and Central Florida and currently handles over seven million tons of petroleum products a year. With 45-year-old petroleum unloading facilities in need of updating, the project will ensure the port will continue to meet the region's need for gasoline, diesel and jet fuels.
Governor Scott directed the Florida Department of Transportation to invest $22.5 million in the new facility. The $45-million expansion project will provide two new petroleum berths and rehabilitate the petroleum terminal infrastructure.
"By prioritizing vital transportation projects, we can make Florida a better place for businesses to grow and expand and help get Floridians back to work," Governor Scott said. "This project will enhance Florida's infrastructure and get our state ready for a new generation of international trade with the Caribbean, South America and beyond."
