Governor Rick Scott announced today that the Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall metro area's unemployment rate has declined by 2.0 percentage points over the year, from 8.6 percent in April 2013 to 6.6 percent in April 2014. The Miami metro area gained the second-highest number of jobs in April 2014 among all metro areas in Florida compared to a year ago with 34,600 new jobs.
Governor Rick Scott said, "The news that 34,600 jobs were created in the Miami area over the year is proves our efforts to cut taxes, pay down debt and cut government waste are working. Let's keep working to build an opportunity economy in South Florida, where business can continue to grow jobs."
All nine private sector industries gained jobs over the year in April 2014 in the Miami metro area. The industries with the largest job gains over the year were in trade, transportation, and utilities with 9,400 new jobs, and leisure and hospitality and professional and business services with 5,300 new jobs each, and education and health services with 5,200 new jobs.
The Miami metro area had the third-highest online job demand in Florida in April 2014 with 32,733 job openings and had the third-highest number of openings for STEM occupations in April 2014 with 6,834 online openings. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In April, CareerSource South Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 42,506 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 8,851 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, more than 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
Florida's statewide unemployment rate for April 2014 was 6.2 percent and the state's labor force again increased over the month and over the year for the fourth month in a row. Florida's statewide unemployment rate has been below the national unemployment rate since August 2013, which was 6.3 percent in April 2014. Since December 2010, Florida has created 600,400 private sector jobs.
