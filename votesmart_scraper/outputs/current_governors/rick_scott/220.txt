Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: April 1, 2016
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida businesses had the highest private-sector job growth rate of the 10 most populous states in February. This is the 14th consecutive month that Florida has led the nation's largest states in job creation. Florida's private-sector job growth rate of 3.4 percent is also significantly higher than the nation's, which is at 2.2 percent.
Governor Scott said, "While other large states continue to drive up the cost of living, Florida has led the nation's most populous states in job growth for 14 consecutive months. Today's great news is another result that our efforts to cut taxes and grow our economy are working. We have cut taxes 55 times, which has saved families $5.5 billion, and we will keep finding opportunities to cut taxes so more families can succeed in Florida."
This is the tenth consecutive month that Florida has created more private-sector jobs over the year than Texas. Florida created 235,200 jobs over the last year, while Texas created only 142,800 jobs.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Cissy Proctor said, "Florida continues to shine as a great place for business. Our smart investments in a competitive business environment continue to enable Florida businesses to grow faster than those in other states. The Scott Administration is fully committed to private-sector job growth which has resulted in a stable and strong Florida economy"
Since December 2010, Florida businesses have created 1,056,000 private-sector jobs. In February, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, Florida's lowest rate in eight years.
