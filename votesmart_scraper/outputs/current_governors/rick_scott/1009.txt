Today, Governor Rick Scott issued the following statement regarding Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins September 15 and ends October 15:
"Ann and I are excited to join all Floridians in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. With more than four million Hispanics in Florida, communities throughout the Sunshine State will celebrate with a wide range of events and activities. Florida is the Gateway to Latin America -- a distinction that brings international trade, job creation, and educational opportunities for Florida families. As Florida continues to strengthen its ties with Latin America and Spain, our state is proud to recognize the rich contributions of the Hispanic community to Florida and across the nation."
