Excerpts of Gov. Scott's letter to President Obama:
"If your administration fails to do its job to responsibly manage the budget, thousands of Floridians will lose their jobs."
"Florida is one of America's most defense centric states."
"The impacts on Florida's military installations and defense industries will be severe under sequestration. Our immediate concerns include dramatic reductions to our National Guard, which threatens our ability to respond to wildfires this spring and hurricanes this summer."
