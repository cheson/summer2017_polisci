Press Release

Location: St. Augustine, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced proposed funding for three new state veterans nursing homes as part of the 2015-2016 "KEEP FLORIDA WORKING" budget. One of the new nursing homes has already been approved by the Florida Cabinet to be located in St. Lucie County. The location for the other two new homes will be considered by the Florida Cabinet upon approval.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Florida is the most military friendly state in the nation and as a Navy veteran, it is incredibly important that we do all we can to help our veterans and their families. My father was a member of the 82nd Airborne and we will never forget the selfless sacrifice all of our veterans have made to ensure we have the opportunity to live the American Dream. I am proud that we are going to continue to support our heroes by adding new nursing homes and we will keep working each day to ensure all of our veterans have a great quality of life in Florida."
Florida has the third largest population of veterans in the nation with 1.6 million veterans. As Florida's veteran's population continues to grow, the existing six state veterans nursing homes have been operating at full capacity. The "KEEP FLORIDA WORKING" budget proposes $7.4 million from existing state veteran nursing home revenue to create three new state veterans nursing homes. This plan will dramatically increase capacity and will serve hundreds of more veterans.
The Governor will release his full "KEEP FLORIDA WORKING" budget recommendations this week.
