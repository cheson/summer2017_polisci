At Patronis Elementary School today, Governor Rick Scott presented 12 schools in Bay County with $717,728 in school recognition funding. Governor Scott announced in February the distribution of more than $124 million in School Recognition Program funding this year to Florida's high performing schools across the state based on sustained or significantly improved student achievement.
Governor Scott said, "The leaders of tomorrow are in today's classrooms. In order to ensure that Florida schools are preparing our students for great careers and college, we must continue to support our education system. That's why we have proposed a record amount of per-student funding and have continued to make historic investments in our education system. Patronis Elementary has been an A school every year since 2010, and I was proud to recognize the hard work of their students and teachers with more than $76,000 in funding. It was great to present Bay County Schools with more than $717,000 so they can continue their mission of providing every student with a quality education."
Bay County Schools Superintendent Bill Husfelt said, "We are thankful to Governor Scott for coming to Bay County today and recognizing the outstanding work of our teachers and students. We also appreciate the Governor's leadership in signing House Bill 7069 into law to reduce the number of tests our students take. We look forward to continuing to work with the Governor to make Florida's education system the best in the world."
