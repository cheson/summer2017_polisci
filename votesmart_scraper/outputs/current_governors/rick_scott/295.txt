Today, Governor Rick Scott today announced that Willis Group Holdings PLC, a global risk advisory and insurance brokerage firm, has chosen Tampa as the site of its new Operational Center of Excellence in North America. The new center will create 157 new jobs for Tampa families and serve as a southeast regional hub for Willis. The project will also invest more than $9 million in the local community.
Governor Scott said, "We are excited to announce the creation of 157 jobs for families in Tampa. Willis Holdings could have chosen any location for their new Operational Center of Excellence, but they knew that Florida was the best place to grow their business and create new jobs. In order to keep creating these new opportunities, we will stay focused on making sure we diversify Florida's economy by cutting $1 billion in taxes and creating the Florida Enterprise Fund next year."
