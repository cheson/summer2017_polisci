FULL LETTER BELOW
Dear Mr. Speaker:
We are writing to formally request you attend our meeting with the President on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) rate hikes so you can be part of the solution.
As you noted in your statement the "House may consider changes to the law [Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act] in the weeks and months," however only executive action will quickly address this issue. Florida families are experiencing the insurance increases now, and don't have "weeks and months" to wait.
We look forward to you joining the meeting when it is scheduled at the President's earliest convenience. We are awaiting his immediate action to fix the NFIP rate hikes and help keep Floridians in their homes.
Sincerely,
Governor Rick Scott
