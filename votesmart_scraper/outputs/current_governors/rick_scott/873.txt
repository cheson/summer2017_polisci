Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) gained the third-highest number of jobs in February 2014 among all metro areas in Florida compared to a year ago with 29,600 new jobs. The unemployment rate in the Tampa metro area declined by 1.4 percentage points over the year, from 7.9 percent in February 2013 to 6.5 percent in February 2014.
Governor Scott said, "Today's news of job growth and a declining unemployment rate is evidence that it's working for Florida families here in the Tampa area. Tampa continues to be a leader in job creation, so let's keep working to create an opportunity economy where everyone who wants a job can get one."
The industries with the largest gain in jobs over the year were in professional and business services with 10,000 new jobs, trade, transportation, and utilities with 6,700 new jobs, and education and health services with 5,500 new jobs.
The Tampa Bay MSA was first among the state metros in online job demand in February 2014 with 41,292 openings. The metro area was also first in the state in demand for STEM occupations with 10,825 openings in February. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In February, CareerSource Tampa Bay, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 37,900 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 9,620 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, more than 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
Florida's statewide unemployment rate for February 2014 was 6.2 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in the state since June 2008. The rate held steady to the revised January 2014 rate of 6.2 percent. Florida's statewide unemployment rate has been below the national unemployment rate since August 2013, which was 6.7 percent in February 2014. Since December 2010, Florida has created 540,700 private sector jobs.
