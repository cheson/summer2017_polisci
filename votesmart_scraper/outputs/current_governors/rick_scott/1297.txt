Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott.
One of my duties as Governor is to making sure every student gets a good education and the opportunity to get a job. By ensuring Florida has the best educated workforce, companies will recognize our state as the best place to tap into the talent that will allow business to grow and succeed.
Part of making sure Florida has the best educated workforce is improving education in the STEM areas of science, technology, engineering and math.
While education is essential to Florida's economy, our state is facing a "perfect storm" of unique challenges when it comes to funding education.
For the 2012 -- 2013 school year, we anticipate an increase of more than 30,000 students. At the current funding level, Florida will need to spend about $191 million more on education than we spent this year.
Florida's growing student population comes at a time when we also estimate a loss of local revenue. This means Florida school districts will have over $200 million less to spend. In spite of this bleak budget picture, I am committed to increasing Florida's investment in the education of our young people.
To gain a better understanding of how Florida needs to invest in education, I am meeting with teachers across our state to hear their ideas about to improve our schools and encourage student achievement. Teachers are essential to the success of our schools and our students, and I am confident that those who daily work to inspire children and young people to learn and achieve their dreams can show us the best way to invest Florida's education dollars.
Education pays, and we clearly must find a way to increase our investment in Florida's students. Please share your ideas with me by emailing rick.scott@eog.myflorida.com.
