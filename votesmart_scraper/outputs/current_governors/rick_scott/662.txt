Today, Governor Scott issued the following statement on President Obama signing bipartisan sanctions on the oppressive Maduro Regime:
Governor Scott said, "The people of Venezuela have been waiting for the United States to take action to stand up to the oppressive Maduro regime. I applaud Congress for taking common sense steps to address the critical political and human rights crisis in Venezuela and the President for signing the legislation. But this is only a first step. We must continue to pursue policies to stand up for the people of Venezuela and the pro-Democracy leaders who are fighting for the basic freedoms that we enjoy every day."
