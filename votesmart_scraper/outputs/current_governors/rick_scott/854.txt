Acting on Governor Scott's call to investigate the processes of federal VA hospitals in Florida, Agency for Health Care Administration surveyors attempted to complete an onsite review at the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center yesterday and were turned away.
Governor Scott said, "Florida veterans deserve quality health care and I am disappointed the VA turned away the Agency's surveyors who were trying to bring transparency to the processes of federal VA hospitals. This is outrageous and unacceptable to the brave men and women who have defended our nation. We expect the federal government to do what's best for our veterans and answer the many outstanding questions important to improving their health care."
