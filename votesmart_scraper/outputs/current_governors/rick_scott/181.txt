Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that $1.8 million was awarded through the Florida Defense Support Task Force Grant Program to support seven defense projects across 13 counties. This funding will strengthen Florida's military bases ahead of any potential Department of Defense realignment or closure actions, thereby protecting the more than 774,000 jobs and more than $79.8 billion in economic impact the defense industry supports in Florida.
Governor Scott said, "I am proud to announce $1.8 million in Florida Defense Support Task Force Grants for Florida's military installations and defense communities. Florida is home to more than 758,000 service men and women, and as we approach Independence Day, we are reminded of the importance of doing all we can to support and thank these brave heroes that put their lives at risk to defend our country. We will continue to work each day to make sure Florida is the most military friendly state in the nation."
The Florida Defense Support Task Force was created in 2011 with the mission to make recommendations to preserve and protect military installations, support the state's position in research and development related to military missions and contracting, and improve the state's military-friendly environment for service members, military families, military retirees and businesses that bring military and base-related jobs to the state. This grant program is administered by Enterprise Florida, Inc. and are awarded annually, on a project priority basis, to organizations and communities working to protect, preserve and enhance Florida's military installations and missions.
