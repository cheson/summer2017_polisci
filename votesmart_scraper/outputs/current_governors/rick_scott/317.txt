Governor Rick Scott said, "Florida has a historic level of revenue even while we have cut taxes 50 times and made record investments all across our state over the last five years. The Florida First budget builds on Florida's success by cutting $1 billion in taxes and making important investments that will diversify our economy and help families and businesses thrive. This year, we have an opportunity to make Florida first in job creation, and I look forward to working with the Legislature this upcoming session to pass our Florida First budget and meet that goal."
