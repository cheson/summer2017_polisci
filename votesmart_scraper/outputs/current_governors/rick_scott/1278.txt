"Today's budget allocations put forward in the Florida House are exactly what Florida's teachers and students need to keep our schools on a path to success. Faced with another significant budget shortfall this year, tough decisions are required by the Legislature in order to put $1 billion into Florida's K-12 education system, so I applaud Speaker Dean Cannon and Representative Denise Grimsley for their leadership in paving the way toward this critical goal. I'm confident the Legislature will continue to come closer to some of the other recommendations I made in my budget in the weeks ahead."
