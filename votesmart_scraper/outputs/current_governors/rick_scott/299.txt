Today, Governor Rick Scott highlighted 75 new jobs at Sweet Pete's following the small business's expansion last year in Jacksonville. In total, Sweet Pete's employs nearly 100 Floridians.

Governor Scott said, "Sweet Pete's is a great addition to the Jacksonville community. It is exciting to highlight their growth in Florida and across the nation with 75 new jobs just this year.
