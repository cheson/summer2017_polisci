Governor Scott Orders Review of Government-Run Hospitals
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: March 23, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott signed Executive Order 11-63, creating the Commission on Review of Taxpayer Funded Hospital Districts. The Commission will consider whether government-run hospitals are in the best interest of taxpayers and recommend a cost-effective and efficient model for providing Florida with a health care safety net.
The Commission's focus will be to identify efficient models for how government-run hospitals are:
· Providing access to care for the broadest population.
· Compensating physicians.
· Ensuring predictable costs to taxpayers.
The Commission will also review sale or lease proposals of public hospitals to ensure taxpayers get the best return for their investment and that the competitive process is fair.
"I am confident this new Commission will protect Florida taxpayers," Governor Scott said. "At the same time, the Commission's guidance will help provide Floridians a high-quality health care system."
