Statement from Governor Rick Scott on June Job Growth
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: July 22, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"Today I learned that since January, Florida has added 85,500 new jobs, 4,300 of which were added in June. This is great news for Floridians.
"I am encouraged that Florida is still bucking the national trend in unemployment. We maintained a steady unemployment rate from May to June while the national unemployment rate continued to climb.
"Ultimately, my goal is to make sure every Floridian has the opportunity for a job. This won't happen overnight, but we're off to a great start. We've begun transitioning our workforce to the private sector, streamlining government functions and leading our state in the right direction."
