Governor Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi today announced that Florida has filed an amicus brief supporting Mississippi's lawsuit against the federal government's unfair National Flood Insurance Program's rate hike.
Governor Rick Scott said, "We are supporting Mississippi in their lawsuit against FEMA because the NFIP rate hike will not only hurt Florida families but will devastate our real estate market. President Obama should use every tool possible to help Florida families and we urge him to act immediately."
Attorney General Pam Bondi said, "Floridians are facing outrageous, unaffordable flood insurance premiums, and we support all efforts to protect policyholders from these devastating insurance rates."
