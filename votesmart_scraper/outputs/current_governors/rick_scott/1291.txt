Statement from Governor Rick Scott Regarding the Florida A&M University Board of Trustees
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Dec. 19, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"For the sake of appearances, and to assure the public that these investigations are clearly independent, I believe it would have been in the best interest of Florida A&M University for President Ammons to step aside until all of these investigations are complete. However, we have a process in Florida for the administration of the State University System, and that process has been followed. Like all other Floridians, I will abide by the decision made by the Board of Trustees."
