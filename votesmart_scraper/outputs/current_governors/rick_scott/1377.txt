Statement from Governor Rick Scott Regarding the Death of Osama Bin Laden
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: May 2, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"The death of Osama Bin Laden marks a great victory for Americans and for freedom-loving people worldwide. Finally, some degree of justice has been achieved after nearly a decade of death, war and untold sacrifices because of that man. For the loved ones of all those we've lost in this war on terror, may this bring some measure of peace.
"I am so proud of our dedicated military men and women and our intelligence community for not giving up in our pursuit of justice. I am grateful for their tenacity and their deep sacrifices. President Barack Obama should also be commended for doing the right thing and following through with the promise of justice initially given by President George W. Bush.
"While threats remain, today the world is a safer place."
