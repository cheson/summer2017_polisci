Rick Scott released the following statement on the news that President Obama is proposing $50 billion more in stimulus funds.
Rick Scott said, "The Obama liberals have written another bad prescription for our failing economy, more stimulus money and more debt. Floridians know that billions in government handouts don't create jobs -- a concept that Alex Sink and President Obama do not seem to grasp. On the other hand, I have a specific and detailed plan that reduces regulations and taxes to create 700,000 private sector jobs in Florida."
