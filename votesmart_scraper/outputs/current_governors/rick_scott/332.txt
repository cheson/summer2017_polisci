Governor Rick Scott Announces "Ready, Set, Work" College Challenge
Statement

Location: Orlando, FL

Today, at the Association of Florida Colleges Trustee Commission, Governor Rick Scott announced the "Ready, Set, Work" College Challenge. Governor Scott is asking all 28 state colleges to participate in the "Ready, Set, Work" College Challenge by graduating 100% of their full-time students to attend a four year university or get a job that leads to a great career. Currently, the average state college graduation rate in Florida is 43 percent.
Governor Scott said, "Ann and I both attended a community college and worked two jobs just to make ends meet. Our education at community college prepared us to attend a university and put us on a path to build great careers. It is concerning that the average graduation rate at our colleges is only 43 percent for students getting their degree in three years. We want to diversify our economy and have the most skilled workforce so more businesses will want to move to Florida. That means we must have an educated workforce ready to fill jobs in competitive fields. I look forward to every state college signing onto our challenge before the start of the legislative session to graduate 100% of their students. This is the right thing to do for students and families in Florida."
