Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Sept. 20, 2016
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott requested that President Obama make a major disaster declaration for Florida due to severe storms and flooding that impacted communities and businesses throughout the state following Hurricane Hermine. A presidential disaster declaration would provide federal resources to support recovery efforts in Florida. This request is for both individual assistance for families and public assistance to help state agencies and local governments.
Governor Scott said, "We must do everything we can to ensure that Florida families and businesses can get back on their feet following Hurricane Hermine. I have traveled across the state to meet Floridians who have been personally impacted by the storm and communities are working hard to recover from flooding and damage. The resources and financial assistance from the Federal Government would support our communities and help them rebuild. We look forward to President Obama immediately issuing a declaration in support of all Florida families and businesses affected by the hurricane."
