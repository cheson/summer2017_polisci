Tallahassee, Florida 32399
Dear Secretary Detzner:
By the authority vested in me as Governor of the State of Florida, and Article III, Section 8, of the Constitution of Florida, I do hereby veto and transmit my objections to House Bill 265, enacted during the 115th Session of the Legislature of Florida, during the Regular Session of 2013, and entitled:
An act relating to the Florida wildflower license plateÂ…
The bill increases the annual use fee for a specialty license plate; an expense in addition to the standard fees paid when registering a motor vehicle. Although buying a specialty license plate is voluntary, Floridians wishing to demonstrate their support for our State's natural beauty would be subjected to the cost increases sought by this bill.
For this reason, I withhold my approval of House Bill 265 and do hereby veto the same.
Sincerely,
Rick Scott
Governor
