Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement on the U.S. Congress's passage of a bill ending furloughs of FAA employees.
Governor Scott said, "Now that Congress has acted, it's the President's turn. Let's hope the White House does the right thing for Florida families and ends these ridiculous FAA furloughs once and for all. As we enter day six of these furloughs, our state's economic momentum has already been put at too much risk for these furloughs to continue one day longer."
