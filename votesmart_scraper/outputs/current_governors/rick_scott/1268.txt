"On behalf of Florida's students, I thank Speaker Cannon and members of the House Appropriations Committee for focusing on my proposal to place an additional $1 billion into K-12 education.
"When I put forward my budget proposal in December, I made it clear that I would not sign any budget that does not significantly increase state funding for education. Today's vote shows that the House heard this promise loud and clear, and they too are committed to prioritizing education funding.
"The most important thing we can do to ensure Floridians have the job opportunities they deserve is to provide our students with a quality education and prepare them to be competitive in our 21st century workforce."
