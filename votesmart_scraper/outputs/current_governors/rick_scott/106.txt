Gov. Scott Directs DEP to Investigate St. Petersburg Sewage Spill
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: Sept. 21, 2016
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Rick Scott today directed the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to investigate the recent sewage discharges in St. Petersburg. While the City of St. Petersburg is responsible for conducting testing in the immediate area of the sewage spill, Governor Scott yesterday directed DOH to begin additional testing at this site. Additionally, the Florida Department of Health (DOH) continues to monitor the water quality and conduct sampling at 14 beaches which includes nine in Pinellas County and five in Hillsborough County. Earlier this month, following Hurricane Hermine, the City of St. Petersburg dumped about 150 million gallons of raw and partially-treated sewage and wastewater into Tampa Bay and Boca Ciega Bay.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Florida is known for our pristine environment, world-class beaches and award winning state parks. We must do all we can to protect our environment and that is why I am directing the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to investigate the sewage dump that occurred in St. Petersburg following Hurricane Hermine. Today, I spoke with Nick Wiley, Executive Director of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and requested that they provide assistance to DEP if necessary during its investigation. I want to thank Representative Kathleen Peters, Senator Jeffery Brandes and Senator Jack Latvala who have been focused on this issue and I look forward to reviewing DEP's findings."
At this time, DOH has issued one health advisory for Simmons Park Beach in Hillsborough County which is across the bay from St. Petersburg.
