Today, Governor Rick Scott announced at the Florida Airports Council Meeting that his FY 2014-2015 budget includes $325 million for aviation improvements. Overall, the "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget" invests a record $8.8 billion in the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) to make strategic transportation improvements throughout the state.
Governor Scott said, "This year, our "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget,' invests in transportation projects to further strengthen our world-class transportation system and enable Florida to be a global hub for trade and commerce. These improvements will create more jobs and opportunities for Florida families, and because aviation is a vital industry in Florida I am recommending nearly $325 million for aviation improvements."
Florida Airports Council (FAC) Executive Director Bill Johnson said, "On behalf of all the airports in Florida, we greatly appreciate the increase in funding proposed by Governor Scott. Airports in Florida handle more than 143 million passengers each year, including 28 million international passengers. An investment in airports is an investment in Florida's future."
Because of Governor Scott's investment in aviation, FDOT will be able to help fund many significant aviation projects in Florida.
FDOT Secretary Ananth Prasad said, "Aviation is a key component in Florida's ability to create a world-class transportation system. Governor Scott's investment not only strengthens our infrastructure but enhances Florida's economy for years to come."
