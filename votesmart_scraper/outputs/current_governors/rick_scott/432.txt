By: Rick Scott
Date: July 23, 2015
Location: Miami, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott highlighted efforts Florida is taking to combat human trafficking and help victims of these horrendous crimes. Governor Scott ceremonially signed four bills that raises awareness of the signs of human trafficking, protects survivors from further exploitation, and establishes harsher punishment against perpetrators.
Governor Rick Scott said, "As a father and grandfather, I take the safety of Florida's children and most vulnerable very seriously. While Florida has a 44-year crime low, even one victim of abuse is too many. I am proud to have signed legislation that takes combative measures against human trafficking. We will continue to do all we can to end human trafficking in our state and help restore those who have been victims of these horrendous crimes."
