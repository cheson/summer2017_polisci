In case you missed it, Republican gubernatorial nominee Rick Scott was on Fox and Friends to talk about the start of early voting and his 7-7-7 plan to create 700,000 private sector jobs.
Here are some of the key exchanges:
DOOCY: So early voting starts at 7:00 there in Florida, right up until the election. Now, when you were in the Republican primary against Bill McCollum, you were actually helped by early voting. Explain why.
SCOTT: Absolutely. We put a big effort in to get out our early vote both absentee and early voting and it helped us because if you looked at the polls the day of the election, I was supposed to lose by nine and we won by four. So early voting was a big deal. We put a lot of effort to early voting into the general and we're going to do very well. You know, this race is about jobs. You know, I've got a detailed plan, seven steps to 700,000 jobs but we're going to do everything we can. I'm traveling the state all day today to get out the vote.
DOOCY: Uh-huh. Now one of the key -- and you just touched on it right there. So you've got the early voting and that did help you in the primary. But it really comes down to getting people to show up and to do the voting. How are you going to do that?
SCOTT: Well, you know, one, I have rallies all across the state today and you just talk to people. Every time I go out I'm talking to everybody I say look, you got to make sure you vote. Get out and talk to everybody that you know. Tell them why you're going to vote for me. Get them all to show up and show up early to make sure, cause you know, wait and maybe something will happen election day and you won't be able to vote. And we have lots of people getting phone calls from all our offices across the state.
