Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Jacksonville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) was among the top five metro areas in the state for job growth in January 2014 with 21,100 new jobs over the year. In January 2014, the Jacksonville metro area had the second fastest annual job growth rate of all the state's metro areas. The Jacksonville MSA's unemployment rate declined by 2.0 percentage points over the year, from 8.0 percent in January 2013 to 6.0 percent in January 2014.
Governor Scott said, "The addition of 21,100 new jobs and an unemployment drop to 6.0 percent in Jacksonville means thousands more Floridians have found work and can provide for their families. Let's keep working to ensure that every Floridian can find a great job and an opportunity to live the American Dream."
The industries with the largest job gains over the year were in professional and business services with 8,300 new jobs, leisure and hospitality with 6,100 new jobs, and trade, transportation, and utilities with 4,000 new jobs. Seven of the ten major industry sectors in this metro area gained jobs over the year in January 2014. In addition, housing starts were up 4.3 percent over the year in the Jacksonville metro area in January 2014.
In January 2014, the Jacksonville MSA was among the top six metros in Florida for online job demand with 13,263 openings and ranked number six for STEM job openings with 3,639 job ads. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In January, CareerSource Northeast Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 38,800 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 10,106 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, more than 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
Florida's statewide unemployment rate for January 2014 was 6.1 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in the state since June 2008. Florida's statewide unemployment rate has been below the national unemployment rate since August 2013, which was 6.6 percent in January. Since December 2010, Florida has gained 503,500 private sector jobs.
Every March, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases revised historical employment (jobs) and unemployment rates based on a benchmarking process to adjust the data. These benchmark revisions are mandated by BLS and take place this time every year in every state. The benchmark revisions represent an annual change in the level of employment or re-anchoring of survey estimates to actual employment counts from Reemployment Assistance tax records. This process also introduces new population inputs from the most recent Census and other revisions to economic data which leads to changes in the original estimates.
Employment data for February 2014 will be released on March 28, 2014. To view the January 2014 employment data visit www.floridajobs.org/labor-market-information/labor-market-information-press-releases/monthly-press-releases.
