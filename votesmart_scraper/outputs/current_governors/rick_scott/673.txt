Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) gained 37,600 new jobs over the year in October 2014. This is the second highest number of jobs among all metro areas in Florida compared to a year ago. The Orlando MSA's unemployment rate declined by 0.8 percentage point over the year, from 6.2 percent in October 2013 to 5.4 percent in October 2014.
Governor Scott said, "We are excited to see the continued positive job growth and a decreasing unemployment rate in the Orlando area. With more than 37,000 new jobs created over the year, area families are finding even more opportunities to succeed and live their version of the American dream."
Today's news that Orlando has created more than 37,000 new jobs over the year is great news for families in the Orlando area. Florida has added 679,000 private-sector jobs since December 2010 and we are continuing to create an opportunity economy that supports families."
In October 2014, the Orlando metro area led the metro areas in job gains over the year in professional and business services with 11,100 new jobs, leisure and hospitality with 9,400 new jobs, and construction with 6,500 new jobs.
The Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford MSA had the third-highest online job demand in Florida in October 2014 with 32,588 openings and also ranked number two in STEM overall demand in the state with 8,107 openings. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In October, CareerSource Central Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 39,300 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 8,346 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
Florida created 32,000 private-sector jobs in October 2014, and since December 2010, Florida has created 679,000 private-sector jobs.
