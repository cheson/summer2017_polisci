Governor Scott Creates Commission on Jobs for Floridians with Disabilities
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: July 26, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

To mark the 21st anniversary of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Governor Rick Scott today ordered the creation of the Governor's Commission on Jobs for Floridians with Disabilities.
According to the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy, people with disabilities have been disproportionately affected by the recent downturn in the economy. Between October 2008 and June 2011, the rate of job loss among workers with disabilities exceeded that of workers without disabilities by nine percent. The commission will identify strategies to close this gap.
"As we work to grow Florida's private-sector jobs by making our state the best place to start, grow or move a business, we need to also make sure we are ensuring job opportunities for Floridians with disabilities," Governor Scott said. "Through employment, persons with disabilities increase their independence and, therefore, enjoy a better quality of life."
Created by Executive Order 11-161, the Governor's Commission on Jobs for Floridians with Disabilities will identify barriers in state and local programs that hinder employment for persons with disabilities. They will then recommend changes to Florida laws, policies and procedures that can help remove those barriers and increase employment and job opportunities for persons with disabilities.
Governor Scott is in the process of identifying individuals to serve on the Commission and will appoint advocates, education and job-training professionals and persons with disabilities, as well as private-sector employers.
