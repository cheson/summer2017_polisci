Press Release

Location: Orlando, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has approved $500,000 of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's (FDLE) request for $2 million in emergency Justice Assistance Grant funds for the City of Orlando and Orange County to use for overtime pay for law enforcement and equipment associated with the terror attack. FDLE is working with DOJ to secure the remaining $1.5 million requested. FDLE has already set aside more than $520,000 in additional residual Justice Assistance Grant funds to help with similar costs.
Governor Scott said, "We appreciate the federal Department of Justice granting $500,000 in funding to support Orlando law enforcement as they continue this ongoing investigation. We are incredibly proud of the hard work and ongoing dedication displayed by our courageous law enforcement officers and first responders this week, and we are doing all we can to support their efforts. I look forward to DOJ quickly providing the remaining $1.5 million so we can ensure the City of Orlando and Orange County have every resource they need to assist their community."
FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen said, "I appreciate the fast work by FDLE's Office of Business Support coordinating with DOJ to secure these funds. This money will go a long way toward helping OPD and OCSO pay for costs associated with this investigation."
