International trade is critical to Florida's economic
recovery, and we must position Florida as a global hub by focusing on infrastructure projects that create long-term jobs and turn Florida's economy around.
In 2014, the newly widened Panama Canal will allow larger, "New Panamax" ships to transport goods to-and-from Asia and South America faster and easier than ever.
And Florida must be ready.
That is why I have directed the Florida Department of Transportation to amend their work plan to include $77 million for dredging the Port of Miami to a depth of 50 feet.
Once the port is dredged, the massive ships coming through the expanded Panama Canal can load and unload cargo there.
In this way, Florida will take another leap forward in international trade and create an estimated 30-thousand new jobs for the region in the coming years. That is a solid return on investment for you -- the shareholders for Florida.
In addition, I met this week with trade leaders from Colombia. Florida has important stake in ratification of trade agreements with Colombia. I urge the President and the U.S. Congress to support these trade agreements. Approving them would create more than 6300 jobs in Florida from increased exports.
Florida is competing with other states and countries, and we must ensure Florida remains the No. 1 Gateway to the Americas and the markets of the world.
