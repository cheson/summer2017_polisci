Weekly Radio Address -- Friday, September 30, 2011
Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott. I had a great week. The most interesting thing I got to do this week was to be a co-host on CNBC's Squawk Box. I got to promote Florida, which is probably the easiest job in the world. I got to talk about our beaches, our weather and the fact that we don't pay income taxes. I talked about some of the companies that are doing business here and the expansion of the Jacksonville Port and the opportunity that it comes along with the expansion of the Panama Canal and the economies of Central and South America.
I also got to speak with a representative from LEGOLAND about all of Florida's Amusement Parks and how we have 82 million tourists a year. We are the travel destination of the world, and we like people coming to Florida.
I also spoke with Texas Governor Rick Perry and what we're doing in Florida to compete with him. Florida is going to be the number one state for jobs because our taxes are fair, we're getting rid of regulation that kills jobs, we're getting rid of frivolous lawsuits, and we have beautiful weather and beaches. People love to live in Florida!
