By Governor Rick Scott
This is a triumphant moment for the residents of Florida. Members of the legislature heard our call to put Floridians ahead of special interests and combat the fraud that has become a billion dollar tax on drivers. I applaud Chief Financial Officer Atwater, Speaker Cannon, Senate President Haridopolos, Representative Boyd, Senator Negron and Senator Richter and the many Florida newspapers and media outlets for uniting the legislature behind a solution to the auto insurance fraud problem.
This is a bill that delivers on my promise to reduce the cost of living in this state by reducing fraud, stopping the growing cost related to accident fraud and ultimately saving Floridians money that otherwise would have found its way into the pockets of fraudsters, unethical providers and trial lawyers. I applaud the legislature for this decision that will help every Floridian policyholder.
With the passage of auto insurance fraud reform, my job creation agenda and $1 billion for K-12 education, it is safe to say this session has been a victory for all Floridians.
