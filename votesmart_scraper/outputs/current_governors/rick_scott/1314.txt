Press Release

Date: Oct. 12, 2011
Location: Orlando, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott unveiled his 2012 Job Creation and Economic Growth Agenda while visiting Metal Essence Inc., a precision metals and plastics fabricator in Orlando. The plan focuses on removing the barriers to beginning, relocating and growing a business in Florida.
"Unlike our elected leaders in Washington, D.C., I realize that it is Florida's families and businesses, taking risks with their ideas, capital and time, that create jobs and grow an economy," said Governor Scott. "We will continue to attract new jobs by consistently letting businesses know through our actions that we want Florida to be their home."
Since January 2011, more than 87,200 private sector jobs have been created, and Florida's unemployment rate had dropped by 1.3 percent, from 12 percent in December 2010 to 10.7 in August 2011. In 2011, Florida is adding an average of more than 9,000 new jobs every month. Governor Scott remains focused on continuously improving programs for both job creation and for workforce development to reach 100,000 new jobs this year, and 700,000 jobs in seven years.
Highlights of Governor Scott's 2012 Job Creation and Economic Growth Agenda include:
1. Streamlining business permitting and eliminating burdensome rules and regulations.
* Continuing to repeal over 1,000 burdensome rules and regulations.
* Work with the Government Efficiency Task Force to help businesses open doors and hire workers faster by establishing temporary business permits and provide a reasonable period to achieve full compliance.
* Continue effort to streamline business registration by establishing one-stop business effort.
2. Providing tax relief and reform for Florida's working families and businesses.
* Increase the business tax exemption by an additional $25,000, eliminating it for 25 percent of the companies required to pay it.

3. Reforming Florida's unemployment system to create a reemployment system.

Ports

* Improve transportation to and from Florida's ports, including support innovative concepts like inland ports.
Infrastructure
* Build interconnected, efficient transportation system, guided by the Florida Department of Transportation's vision plan. Goals for infrastructure improvement include employing creative financing alternatives, offering transportation choices, reducing bureaucracy and streamlining decision making to plan and develop future corridors.
6. Offering stability to Florida businesses by balancing the budget without raising taxes.
* Produce a balanced budget without raising taxes so Florida has the stability and commitment that businesses can plan for the future.
