Governor Scott said, "Today's news of job growth and a declining unemployment rate is evidence that it's working for Florida families in the Tampa area. Our policies are helping Florida families get back to work, and since December 2010 Florida has added 651,300 private-sector jobs."
The industries with the largest gain in jobs over the year in the metro area were professional and business services with 7,600 new jobs and trade, transportation, and utilities with 7,300 new jobs.

The Tampa Bay MSA was first among the state metro areas in online job demand in September 2014 with 43,148 openings. The metro area was also first in the state in demand for STEM occupations with 10,817 openings in September.

In September, CareerSource Tampa Bay, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 43,800 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 9,362 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
