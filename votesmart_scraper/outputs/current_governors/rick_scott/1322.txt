Statement from Governor Rick Scott Regarding President Obama Sending Pending Free Trade Agreements to Congress
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Oct. 3, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"I am extremely pleased President Barack Obama moved these critical free trade agreements off his desk and into the hands of Congress. These agreements are vital to our state and nation and for far too long, U.S. companies, including many in Florida, have had to pay billions in excessive tariffs to Colombia and Panama for the ability to export American goods to those nations. A successful jobs plan is dependent on immediate ratification of these agreements and I urge Congress to quickly pass them."
