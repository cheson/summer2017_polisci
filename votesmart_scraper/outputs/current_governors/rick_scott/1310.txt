Weekly Radio Address -- Friday, October 28, 2011
Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott.
A week ago Thursday, on my way to Brazil for a trade mission, I helped announce that IRX Therapeutics is moving their corporate headquarters from New York to Florida. This is great news for the St. Petersburg area.
While in Brazil, I attended one of the largest tourism conferences in the world. I believe I was the first governor to ever attend this particular trade conference, and we talked about why people should come to Florida. I got to meet a lot of great people in Rio de Janeiro.
Next, we went to SÃ£o Paulo. I lead 187 people from Florida, representing 115 different businesses and organizations to try to help Florida companies sell more products in Brazil and to have Brazilian companies do more business in Florida. We wanted to make this trade mission a win-win situation for both countries.
Also, last Friday, we announced Florida's job creation numbers for the month of September. Our job picture is getting better: 110,300 private-sector jobs were created this year, and in September, Florida was the number one state for job creation in the country. Although we still have 900,000 people out of work, this news is encouraging.
We are doing a lot of things to make sure that Florida is a great place to do business. We're making sure we are keeping our taxes as low as possible, streamlining the permitting process, and eliminating job killing regulation. If we do those things, and we treat everyone with respect, we'll make sure that Florida is the best state to live, work and play.
