"Florida means business, and I am honored today to add a critical component to Florida's economic development strategy with the opening of the new Department of Economic Opportunity. For the first time, we have combined the state's economic, workforce and community development professionals under one roof. I would like to thank the Florida Legislature for supporting a business-minded approach to solving Florida's economic and employment situation.
"This is a great day for Florida's economic future. I look forward to working closely with the new department and its partners to ensure we fully engage all of Florida's resources to help grow our economy, create jobs, and put Floridians back to work."
