Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement on the Louisiana Army National Guard helicopter crash during a night training exercise at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle. As of Wednesday morning, seven US Marines (residencies not determined at this time) and four Louisiana Army National Guard soldiers are still missing.
Governor Scott said, "Today, we are saddened to learn that a Louisiana Army National Guard helicopter carrying seven marines and four soldiers crashed during a training exercise near Eglin Air Force Base. I reached out to Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal today to offer any resources they may need during this tragic time. Florida National Guard Adjutant General Major General Emmett Titshaw also spoke with the Louisiana National Guard today to offer resources they may need during their search. Florida Fish and Wildlife officers immediately responded to the crash and are actively engaged in search efforts. Every day, members of our armed forces put their lives on the line to protect our state and our nation and we cannot thank them enough for their service. Ann and I join all Floridians and Americans to pray for those involved in the crash and their families."
