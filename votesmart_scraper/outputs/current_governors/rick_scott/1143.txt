Governor Rick Scott said, "With more than 255,000 job openings available in our state, it's clear the decisions we're making are helping employers feel more confident about the future of their businesses. My Florida Families First Budget lives within our means while continuing our progress of job creation by providing a quality education for every Floridian, ensuring we have a talented workforce available for current and future employers and improving the state's business climate to facilitate job creation. Ensuring that every Floridian who wants a job, gets a job remains my number one priority."
Florida's labor demand, measured by online advertised vacancies, bottomed out in April 2009 at 151,251 ads and has increased by 104,498 openings (+69.1 percent) since then.
According to the Help Wanted OnLine data series from The Conference Board, online job demand was strongest in the large metro cities, led by Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville. Among the cities with the most online ads, the highest percentage gain over the year in online ads was in Miami (+26.3 percent).
Major occupational groups with the most online ads in January were healthcare practitioners and technical occupations; sales and related occupations; office and administrative support occupations; and computer and mathematical occupations.
