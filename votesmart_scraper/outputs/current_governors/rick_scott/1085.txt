Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement on the passage of HB 7065 related to Everglades restoration:
Governor Scott said, "This is an historic investment in Florida's Everglades -- and I want to thank the Legislature, and particularly the House and Senate leadership, for seeing the value of Florida's natural treasures to our communities. We'll continue to work closely with local communities and environmental organizations to ensure we're taking the steps necessary to be good stewards of Florida's environment."
Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Herschel T. Vinyard Jr. said, "Today, the Florida Legislature showed its support for Governor Scott's historic water quality plan for the Everglades, a major step in moving forward with restoration rather than focusing on costly litigation."
The Governor's landmark water quality plan is funded, in part, by a $32 million annual appropriation by the Florida Legislature, is a partnership between the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the South Florida Water Management District, stakeholders in the Everglades Agricultural Area and all of South Florida to address water quality in the Everglades. In turn, addressing the quality of water flowing into the Everglades will enhance the environment and the economy of Florida.
