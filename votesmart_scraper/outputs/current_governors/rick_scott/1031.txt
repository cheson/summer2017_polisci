Today, Governor Rick Scott released a statement following Jesse Jackson's refusal to apologize to Floridians after visiting the state earlier in the week and calling Florida the "Selma of our time." Yesterday, Jackson stood by his remarks and said he would like to have a private conversation with the Governor instead of apologizing. Jackson has also previously referred to Florida as an "Apartheid State" and encouraged a "boycott" on the state.
Governor Rick Scott said, "It's disappointing that Jesse Jackson refused to apologize yesterday for his insulting and inflammatory comments about Floridians. Instead, he doubled down on his divisive and reckless remarks. Without an official, public apology from Jesse Jackson to the people of Florida, any conversation would only reward him for making -- and then doubling down -- on his irresponsible insults."
