Today, Governor Rick Scott signed House Bill 7069, which reduces the amount of tests Florida students take.
Governor Scott said, "This legislation reduces the number of tests our students take, including the 11th grade English Language Arts test that we eliminated this year through an Executive Order in February. I agree with many teachers and parents who say we have too many tests, and while this legislation is a great step forward, we will keep working to make sure Florida students are not over tested.
"This legislation also improves our teacher evaluation system, which will ensure we have the best teachers in our classrooms. I want to thank Senator Legg and Representative O'Toole for championing this legislation and I applaud the Florida Legislature for quickly putting it into law to better serve our students."
