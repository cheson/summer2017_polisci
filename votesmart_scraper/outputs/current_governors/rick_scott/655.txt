Press Release

Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that he will lead a business development mission to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in late February to meet with job creators and business leaders to discuss why they should move their business to Florida and buy a one-way ticket to the Sunshine State. Accompanying Governor Scott on the economic development mission will be leadership from Enterprise Florida, VISIT FLORIDA, the Department of Economic Opportunity, and the Department of Education.
Governor Scott said, "Our goal is to make Florida the number one destination in the world for jobs. I am leading a delegation to Philadelphia to send a message to all Pennsylvania job creators and families that we want you to keep more of the money you make because we understand it's your money.
"Governor Tom Wolf's proposed tax increases and mandates on businesses will no doubt be heavy blows to Pennsylvania families. In contrast, Florida is working to become even more business friendly."
While Florida has no individual income tax, Pennsylvania's is 3.07 percent, and Governor Tom Wolf wants to raise it even higher. Additionally, Pennsylvania's corporate income tax is nearly double Florida's. Pennsylvania also has taxes on inheritance and capital stock, neither of which exists in Florida. Overall, Florida's business climate is ranked 5th, while Pennsylvania is ranked 24th by the Tax Foundation.
Florida's debt has dropped $4 billion since 2010. Florida has a better bond rating according to all three top bond rating agencies, and has less debt per capita than Pennsylvania.
