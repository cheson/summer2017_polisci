Governor Scott said, "In the past year, Miami businesses added more than 15,000 new jobs, providing new opportunities for thousands of Florida families. Our efforts to cut taxes and reduce regulations are helping businesses in Miami succeed and we will keep doing everything we can to make Florida first in the nation for jobs."
