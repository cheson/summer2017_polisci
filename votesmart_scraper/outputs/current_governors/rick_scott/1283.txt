Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Jan. 5, 2012
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"It is an honor to congratulate General McKinley on his appointment to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is perfectly fitting that the National Guard's first member of this esteemed military body is a native Floridian.
"As a member of the Joint Chiefs, General McKinley will continue our state's proud tradition as a leader in our nation's defense. Considering the significant role the men and women of the National Guard have while deployed alongside traditional military personnel, it is appropriate and well deserved that they are represented at the highest levels of our federal government."
