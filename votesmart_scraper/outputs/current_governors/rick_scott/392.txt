Gov. Rick Scott to Kentucky: Florida is a "Right-to-Work" State Ready for Your Business
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Aug. 31, 2015
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that he will lead a domestic economic development mission to Kentucky in September to encourage businesses to relocate to Florida. The Governor will meet with private-sector businesses to explain why Florida is a better location for them to grow and create jobs. More specifics on the trip will be announced in the near future.
Governor Scott said, "Florida's business climate is better than Kentucky's in almost every way. Kentucky leaders continue blocking Kentucky counties from becoming right-to-work areas. Kentucky's pro-union, big government policies hurt Kentucky businesses' ability to create and retain jobs. In contrast, Florida is proud to be a right-to-work state where businesses can afford to compete with other places in America and all over the world. Florida also has no personal income tax -- unlike Kentucky.
"In Florida, we also recently passed a law to hold the line on college tuition to ensure that employers have a skilled workforce, and we have invested in workforce development programs. We have also cut taxes 50 times; we've paid down state debt and eliminated over 3,200 burdensome regulations. Over the last four and a half years, Florida has added 917,400 private-sector jobs; Florida is ranked 2nd in the country for its business environment by the nation's CEOs, and Florida's transportation infrastructure is consistently ranked among the best in America. Kentucky businesses can do better in Florida, plain and simple."
