Location: Orlando, FL

Following a meeting with Governor Rick Scott in Philadelphia in January, Wilson Legal Solutions, an international provider of business of law software and services, yesterday announced the opening of their new office in Orlando. This is the company's first expansion into Florida.
Governor Scott said, "After meeting with Wilson Legal Solutions on our economic development mission to Philadelphia earlier this year, we are excited that the company has decided to expand in Florida. Unlike Pennsylvania, Florida is cutting taxes and making it easier for businesses to succeed. In the past four and half years, Florida has cut taxes 50 times, including $400 million in tax cuts this year, and we will keep working to make Florida the global destination for business so more companies like Wilson Legal Solutions move to the Sunshine State."
Bruce Wilson, managing director and CEO, Wilson Legal Solutions said, "As part of Wilson Legal Solutions' continued growth strategy, we wanted to enhance our support for clients in the Southeast. After attending an Enterprise Florida event in January, and meeting with Governor Rick Scott, we felt Orlando was the best choice for our new office. Orlando is among the top 10 cities for job growth in the country and has a rapidly growing technology sector. We believe this location will provide us with access to strong talent as we continue to build our organization."
