Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement following House passage of HB 1325 by Representative Jim Boyd.
Governor Scott said, "I want to thank members of the Florida House for passing this historic legislation to create the new Florida Enterprise Fund. Specifically, I want to thank House Speaker Steve Crisafulli and Representative Jim Boyd for their work on this critical bill.
"This legislation to create the new Florida Enterprise Fund will protect taxpayer money by ensuring no incentive dollar leaves the state until we have confirmed a company's economic investment or job creation in Florida. The Florida Enterprise Fund's incentive dollars are one of the only parts of our budget with a guaranteed return on investment for taxpayers before any state money is spent. This legislation will also diversify our economy at a key time in our state's history to help guard against another economic downturn, and make Florida first for jobs in the country.
"As the legislative process continues, we'll continue working closely with the Enterprise Florida Board of Directors and Senate and House members on finalizing this legislation. Thanks to the hard work of Senator Jack Latvala, Florida Enterprise Fund reforms are also making their way through the Senate. I will continue working with the Legislature in the weeks ahead to make Florida first in the nation for job creation."
