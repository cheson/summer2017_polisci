Location: Tampa, FL

Governor Rick Scott announced today that the Tampa area added 44,900 new private-sector jobs in June over the year. Tampa's unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in June, dropping by 0.7 percentage point in the last year.
Governor Scott said, "Not only did the Tampa area create nearly 45,000 new jobs over the past year, but Tampa also had the highest job demand across the state. This means more opportunities are available for Floridians to get jobs and provide for their families. I am also proud to welcome two new state-of-the-art, post-Panamax cranes to Port Tampa Bay, which will expand our state's important role as a global hub for trade."
Governor Scott made the announcement at Port Tampa Bay during the commission of two new post-Panamax gantry cranes which will help the port accommodate some of the largest container vessels in the world. Under Governor Scott's leadership, Florida has invested more than $1 billion into the state's port system since 2011 in order to increase capacity, compete with top ports across the nation, and expand Florida's role as a global hub for trade. According to the Florida Ports Council, Florida's seaports generate more than 680,000 direct and indirect jobs and contribute $96 billion in economic value to the state through cargo and cruise activities.
Jim Boxold, Florida Department of Transportation Secretary said, "These cranes are part of Governor Scott's strategic investments in Florida's port system. His leadership and vision positions Florida's ports to see continued growth in international trade, the cruise industry and jobs that support Florida's families."
The industries with the largest job gains over the year in the Tampa area were professional and business services with 14,700 new jobs; leisure and hospitality with 7,400 new jobs; and trade, transportation and utilities and education and health services, with 7,100 new jobs each. The Tampa area held fast with the highest job demand of all Florida metro areas with 47,509 job openings, and the highest demand for high-skill, high-wage STEM occupations with 15,075 openings.
Florida businesses have added 102,600 new jobs since January 2016, bringing the total number of jobs created since December 2010 to 1,127,400 jobs. Florida's annual job growth rate, at 3.2 percent, is also exceeding the nation's, at 1.9 percent, for the 51st consecutive month. The state's unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent in June, the lowest rate since November 2007. More than 31,841 Floridians were placed in jobs by CareerSource Tampa Bay and the state's other 24 regional workforce boards.
