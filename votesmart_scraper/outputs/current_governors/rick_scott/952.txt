Today, Governor Rick Scott and First Lady Ann Scott distributed food to needy families at CAMACOL's 28th Annual Holiday Food Basket charity event.
Governor Scott said, "Ann and I are blessed to share holiday cheer at the Holiday Food Basket charity event and give back to communities in need of assistance. The holiday season is a wonderful time to gather with family and friends, and reflect on the wonderful blessings of the year. As a strong partner in creating opportunities for Florida families, I am excited to work with CAMACOL in strengthening our communities in the Sunshine State."
CAMACOL's Annual Holiday Food Basket charity event started with 30 baskets in 1985, and today has escalated to 15,000 baskets distributed to 3,000 needy families throughout the South Florida community. The event is made possible by sponsorship and contributions from the CAMACOL Family of Trustees and Members.
President of CAMACOL Mario O. Gutierrez said, "I am proud to be a part of CAMACOL's annual holiday food drive event. This event brings hope and happiness to those who are less fortunate, especially to the children. As a grandfather, I understand the importance of supporting my family. The value of hard work and family are one of the many things that Governor Scott and I have in common, and these qualities are evident at this event."
