Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement on the passage of Senator Joe Negron's SB 156 from the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Tourism and Economic Development. The legislation rolls back certain tax increases on motor vehicle registrations.
Governor Scott said, "I want to thank Senator Joe Negron and members of the committee for this important first step in rolling back some of the annual increases that were placed on families for registering their vehicles. We're committed to undoing the 54 percent tax increase that families experienced in 2009, so we can give more back to families. Today, we're a step closer to that goal and I look forward to working with the Legislature in delivering this victory for Florida families."
