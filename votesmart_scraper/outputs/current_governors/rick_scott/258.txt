Gov. Rick Scott Thanks CDC for 950 Zika Antibody Tests
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: Feb. 9, 2016
Location: Sarasota, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sent 950 Zika antibody tests to Florida. The antibody tests allow individuals, especially pregnant women and new mothers, to see if they ever had the Zika virus. Last week, the CDC sent 475 of these tests. Florida has a total of 1,425 antibody tests. None of the 16 Zika cases in Florida have been acquired locally and do not involve pregnant women.
Governor Rick Scott said, "We appreciate that the CDC sent 950 Zika antibody tests to Florida so we can better test those who have traveled to affected areas and had symptoms of Zika. While having these tests readily available is great progress, we are still waiting on the CDC to schedule a conference call with Florida hospital workers to ensure they fully understand the symptoms, treatments and proper precautions for Zika. We will continue to do all we can to ensure our state is prepared for the possible spread of the Zika virus."
