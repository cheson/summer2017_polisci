Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott made the following statement regarding the murder of Abinta Kabir by ISIS in Dhaka, Bangladesh last night. Kabir was from Miami and attended Oxford College of Emory University in Oxford, Georgia.
Governor Scott said, "Today, another Floridian was killed by a senseless act of terror. Ann and I convey our most heartfelt condolences to the family of Abinta Kabir -- we are deeply sorry for your loss. On behalf of all Floridians and Americans, our thoughts and prayers will be with all of the victims and loved ones of those who lost their lives in Bangladesh yesterday.
"The evil act of terror has continued to impact our state. While we lost 49 Floridians at the hands of ISIS inspired terror a few weeks ago, we have lost another Floridian to the pure evil of ISIS. When one American is attacked, our entire nation is attacked. We must immediately do everything we can to eliminate ISIS. We cannot afford to see more lives lost at the hands of terrorists."
Governor Scott has directed the flags of the United States and the State of Florida to be flown at half-staff at all local and state buildings, installations, and grounds throughout the State of Florida from sunrise to sunset on Sunday, July 3, 2016.
