Today, Governor Rick Scott visited Bing Energy to ceremonially sign HB 705 relating to seed funding. In 2007, the Florida Institute for the Commercialization of Public Research (the Institute) was created to enhance economic development in Florida through the commercialization of new discoveries made through publically funded research. HB 705 expands the Institute and officially became law on July 1st.
Governor Scott said, "Everything that we are doing to create jobs and opportunities for Florida families is working. In a little over two years we have created 330,000 private sector jobs and our unemployment rate has dropped to 7.1%, well below the national average. The bill we are celebrating today will encourage greater investments into Florida's start-up companies, ultimately leading to more jobs and opportunities for Florida families. I was pleased to visit Bing Energy in 2011 and am proud to see how far they have come and the impact they have had on Florida families."
HB 705 creates the Florida Capital Technology Seed Fund as a corporate subsidiary of the Institute. The purpose of this fund is to foster greater private-sector investment funding, encourage seed-state investments in start-up companies and advise companies on how to restructure their organizations in order to attract greater business opportunities.
Through the use of funding provided by the Institute, Bing Energy has been able to expand their business model, creating new opportunities for Florida families.
Senator Jeremy Ring said, "I would like to thank Governor Scott for signing House Bill 705, a bill that provides seed funding to start-up technology companies."
