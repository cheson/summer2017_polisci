Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that the Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall metro area's unemployment rate has declined to 8.8 percent in April 2013, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points over the year. This is the lowest unemployment rate in the Miami metro area since December 2008.
Governor Rick Scott said, "The Miami metro area experienced a decrease in the unemployment rate, and coupled with 34 consecutive months of over the year job growth, we can see that it's working here."
In April 2013, the Miami metro area led the state metro areas in over the year job gains in financial activities (+2,300). The Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall area was also one of the five metro areas in the state that gained jobs in the information industry over the year.
The Miami metro area had the third highest online job demand in Florida in April 2013 with 33,067 openings. The area also had the third highest number of openings for STEM occupations in April 2013 with 6,526 online ads. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In April, South Florida Workforce along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards reported more than 41,300 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 11,457 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2012, more than 426,000 Floridians were placed in jobs, with nearly 111,173 former claimants finding employment.
With the addition of 16,700 private sector jobs over the month, Florida has experienced positive annual job growth now for 33 consecutive months. This adds up to 330,000 new private sector jobs created in Florida since December 2010.
Florida's unemployment rate decreased to 7.2 percent, down from the March 2013 rate of 7.5 percent and the lowest since September 2008. Since Governor Scott took office, the state's unemployment rate has dropped 3.9 percentage points.
