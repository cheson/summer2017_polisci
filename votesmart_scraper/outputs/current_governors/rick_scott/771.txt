Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement in the wake of violence in the Middle East:
"As the crisis continues in the Middle East, Florida stands with Israel and specifically recognizes Israel's right to defend all Israelis against acts of violence from Hamas.
"Israel's fight to end the senseless terrorism and violence of Hamas should unite all Americans. We must not pretend that this issue is "complicated' as many pundits suggest. One thing here is not complicated at all: Hamas wants to destroy Israel. Hamas are the perpetrators.
"Support for Israel is a moral issue, above politics. I agree with Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's assessment that there are "way too few, lone voices around the world criticizing' the continued violence from Hamas.
"Violence against Jewish people and any act of anti-Semitism have no place in Florida or any part of the world that values freedom and democracy, without which there can be no peace."
