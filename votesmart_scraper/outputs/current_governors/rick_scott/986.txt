Governor Rick Scott released the following statement today, following President Obama's announcement of changes so that those people who are losing their current insurance plans under his new healthcare law may now be able to keep those policies for another year:
"The patchwork changes President Obama announced to his healthcare law today amount to nothing more than kicking the can down the road for 300,000 Florida families who are losing the insurance plans the President told them they could keep. What happens to these families in a year? Will these families still see their insurance costs go up? President Obama's changes to his own law will likely be the first of many. It is a bad law."
