Since December 2010, Florida businesses have created over 879,000 jobs, which means more families are able to live their dreams right here in Florida. We will continue to cut taxes and create an environment where businesses can grow so Florida can become the global destination for jobs."

Governor Scott made the announcement in Kissimmee at Photon-X, an imaging technology company that will be creating 110 new jobs in the Orlando area. Photon-X staff consists of technologists and engineers providing technical expertise in a variety of areas including optics, imaging, sensors, photonics, physics and computer science.
