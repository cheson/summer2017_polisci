In coordination with the state of Louisiana and Governor Bobby Jindal, Governor Rick Scott today directed the flags of the United States and the State of Florida to be flown at half-staff. This follows the news of a Louisiana Army National Guard helicopter carrying seven U.S. Marines and four Louisiana Army National Guard soldiers crashing off the coast of the Florida panhandle. This is effective immediately, at all local and state buildings, installations, and grounds throughout the State of Florida until sunset on Friday, March 20, 2015.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today, we mourn and honor the members of the Louisiana Army National Guard and U.S. Marines who lost their lives during a training exercise near Eglin Air Force Base on Tuesday. The men and women of our nation's military faithfully serve our country and protect our freedom every day. We join all Floridians, Louisianans, and Americans as we pray for their families and send to them our sincerest condolences."
