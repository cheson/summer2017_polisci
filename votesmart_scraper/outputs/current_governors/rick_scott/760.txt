Governor Rick Scott today issued the following statement on the 13th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on America, September 11, 2001.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today, all Floridians and Americans remember one of the darkest days in the history of the United States. Patriot Day is a somber reflection of the attacks and the innocent lives lost on September 11, 2001. I was in New York City that day, and saw the shock on everyone's faces. On this day of remembrance, we also reflect on the sacrifice and service of our emergency personnel and first responders. We share our gratitude with them today for selflessly answering the call to help those in need. All of America also pauses today to thank our military service men and women. Their service and the sacrifices made by themselves and their families are the reason why we live in the greatest nation in the world."
