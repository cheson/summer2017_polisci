THIS IS GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT. THE BUDGET IS MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE FLORIDA HOUSE AND SENATE. THAT MEANS ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT CREATING JOBS IN FLORIDA SHOULD CALL THEIR STATE REPRESENTATIVE AND SENATOR AND TELL THEM: WE MUST CUT THE BUSINESS TAX, AND BEGIN PHASING IT OUT COMPLETELY.
CUTTING THE BUSINESS TAX PUTS MORE MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF BUSINESS OWNERS. THEY CAN THEN GROW THEIR BUSINESS, HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES, AND CREATE MORE JOBS. IT WILL ALSO REMOVE HURDLES FOR PEOPLE STARTING A BUSINESS.
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE BACKBONE OF FLORIDA'S ECONOMY. IN FACT, COMPANIES WITH UNDER FIVE EMPLOYEES CREATED 73 PERCENT OF FLORIDA JOBS LAST YEAR. IN ADDITION, 86 PERCENT OF FLORIDA'S PRIVATE EMPLOYERS HAVE UNDER 10 WORKERS.
I CAMPAIGNED ON PHASING OUT THE BUSINESS TAX BECAUSE I KNOW IT WILL MAKE FLORIDA THE BEST PLACE TO DO BUSINESS. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THIS IS HOW WE WILL TURN OUR ECONOMY AROUND AND CREATE JOBS.
ANOTHER IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT FOR FLORIDA'S ECONOMY HAPPENED THIS WEEK IN WASHINGTON, D.C.: CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE MADE PROGRESS TOWARD A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH COLOMBIA.
IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT WE EXPAND TRADE WITH COLOMBIA, OUR FIFTH LARGEST TRADING PARTNER. THE OPPORTUNITIES TO ADD JOBS TO FLORIDA'S ECONOMY ARE TREMENDOUS.
IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF OUR COMMITMENT TO EXPAND FLORIDA'S PORTS. BY BOLSTERING FLORIDA'S POSITION AS THE GATEWAY TO SOUTH AMERICA, WE CAN MAKE FLORIDA THE SHIPPING CAPITAL OF THE EAST COAST, AND EVEN THE NATION.
