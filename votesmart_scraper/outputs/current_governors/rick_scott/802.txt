Today, Governor Rick Scott announced he has signed HB 225, which revises child restraint requirements to increase the safety of children passengers in motor vehicles. Current law requires every motor vehicle operator in Florida use a crash-tested, federally approved child restraint device for children 3 years or younger. HB 225 extends current requirements to include children 4 and 5 years old.
Governor Rick Scott said, "As a father and grandfather, I know how important it is to make the safety of Florida's children a top priority. With this initiative, we are working to ensure our children travel safely and remain protected on the road. We will continue to do all we can to keep every Floridian safe, so they can enjoy everything our great state has to offer with their loved ones."
Senator Anitere Flores, Senate bill sponsor, said, "Governor Scott is helping to save lives by signing this legislation today. I am grateful to have played a part in passing legislation that will promote the well being of Florida's youngest and protect them on the roads."
Senator Garrett Richter, President Pro-Tempore, said, "I am honored to join Governor Scott in supporting legislation that will change the requirements for child restraint devices in order to save lives. We remain committed to doing all we can to keep our children safe and sound."
Senator John Thrasher said, "Choosing an insufficient form of vehicle safety on one day can alter a family forever. Governor Scott and my fellow members are committed to keeping Florida's families happy and safe by passing legislation that enforces the proper child restraint devices."
