Hi. This is Governor Rick Scott.
This week I held my first "Let's Get to Work' Day. I am honored to revive the tradition started by Bob Graham, former Governor and United States Senator.
I will work at businesses throughout Florida that mirror the jobs I had while on my journey from living as a child in public housing to the Governor's Mansion.
Like most of you, I have worked hard all my life. My family struggled financially, and for that reason I went to work at a young age. I did everything from delivering newspapers and cleaning telephone booths, to selling groceries and working on a ship in the Navy.
The first business I started was a donut shop. So this week, I kicked off my "Let's Get to Work' Days by visiting the family-owned and operated Nicola's Donuts and Bakery in Tampa. Thanks to everyone at Nicola's for allowing me to make delicious, mouth-watering donuts and sell them, just like I did with my mother and my wife, Ann, at the donut shop in Kansas city.
I am proud of the jobs I had and the valuable lessons I learned from each one. Now, as Governor, my goal is to be sure every Floridian has the same opportunity to get a job and live the American Dream.
I will aim to do at least one workday each month. You can invite me to your business or workplace by visiting my website flgov.com, and clicking on the "Let's Get to Work' Days button.
I look forward to hearing from you. Now, let's get to work!
