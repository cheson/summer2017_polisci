"As a member of the NRA and a hunter, I'm a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. I will protect our fundamental right to keep and bear arms." -- Rick Scott
Rick believes the right to self-defense is our most basic right. He owns several guns and enjoys hunting. With liberals in control of our federal government the Second Amendment is under assault. President Obama's first appointment to the Supreme Court has ruled that the Second Amendment DOES NOT apply to states. Rick knows that we must have a Governor who can stand up to federal officials who want to erode our basic right to keep and bear arms.
* Rick is an ardent supporter of the Second Amendment and a hunter.
* Rick is a member of the NRA and a strong supporter of Florida's sportsmen.
* Rick believes that we should appoint commonsense judges who will adhere to the Constitution and will NOT legislate from the bench.
