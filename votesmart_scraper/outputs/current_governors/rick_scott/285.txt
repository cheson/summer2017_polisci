Today, Governor Scott announced that CVS Health, a pharmacy innovation company, is increasing its presence in the Orlando region and creating 500 new jobs over the next two years.

Governor Scott said, "We are excited to announce the creation of 500 new jobs for families in Orlando. With hundreds of locations already in Florida, CVS' decision to expand in our state is great news. We will continue our work to cut $1 billion in taxes and support businesses through the creation of the Florida Enterprise Fund so more successful companies like CVS can create opportunities for our families."
