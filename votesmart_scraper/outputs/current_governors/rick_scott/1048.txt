Governor Rick Scott today announced Florida's statewide unemployment rate for May 2013 dropped to 7.1 percent, the lowest rate since September 2008. Florida's rate was down 0.1 percentage point from April's rate of 7.2 percent and continues to fall below the national average, which went up to 7.6 percent in May.
Governor Scott said, "Each month we continue to distance ourselves from the national unemployment rate and it is clear we are succeeding in growing opportunities for Florida families to pursue the American Dream. Once again, Florida's unemployment rate is well below the national average. While Florida communities have experienced some incredible successes, we'll continue working tirelessly to provide jobs to families across the Sunshine State.
"We had a very successful trip this week to the 50th Paris Air Show where we worked to grow Florida as a leader in aerospace -- and create more jobs and opportunities for Florida families. I was proud to announce that Vision Systems will open its first-ever U.S. subsidiary on the Space Coast. As we continue to announce new opportunities across our state like Vision Systems, it underscores that the policies we are implementing to create more jobs for our families are working."
Since December 2010, Florida's statewide unemployment rate has dropped four percentage points, from a rate of 11.1 percent to May's rate of 7.1 percent. In the same timeframe, the national unemployment rate has dropped 1.7 percentage points, demonstrating Florida's improving economic climate continues to outpace the national recovery. Florida's unemployment rate has now declined year-over-year for 31 consecutive months.
