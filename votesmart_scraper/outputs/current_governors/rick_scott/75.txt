Location: Naples, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott released the below statement following the death of Fidel Castro.
Governor Rick Scott said, "I join Cuban-Americans and Floridians across the country who are incredibly hopeful for the future of Cuba. After decades of oppression, the Cuban people deserve freedom, peace and democracy. I have met so many Cubans who have come to Florida to flee the tyranny, brutality, and communism of the Castro brothers' oppressive regime and now is the time to look at policy changes that will demand democracy in Cuba. Today's news should usher in an era of freedom, peace and human dignity for everyone in Cuba and the State of Florida stands ready to assist in that mission. I spoke to President-elect Trump this morning to let him know that the State of Florida will help his administration in any way to support a pro-democracy movement in Cuba."
