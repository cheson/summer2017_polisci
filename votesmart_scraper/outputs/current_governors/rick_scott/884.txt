Governor Rick Scott today announced that Florida's unemployment rate for January 2014 was down to 6.1 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in the state since June 2008. Florida's statewide unemployment rate has been below the national unemployment rate since August 2013, which was 6.6 percent in January 2014. Since December 2010, Florida has created 503,500 private sector jobs.
Governor Rick Scott said, "With the steady increase in job creation and a five percentage point drop since December 2010 bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.1 percent, it is clear we're making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida. We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow, and with more than 500,000 new private sector jobs in Florida in just over three years the progress we have made is evident. We have come a long way in three years, but let's keep working to make sure every person who wants a job can have one."
Every March, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases revised historical employment (jobs) and unemployment rates based on a benchmarking process to adjust the data. These benchmark revisions are mandated by BLS and take place this time every year in every state. The benchmark revisions represent an annual change in the level of employment or re-anchoring of survey estimates to actual employment counts from Reemployment Assistance tax records. This process also introduces new population inputs from the most recent Census and other revisions to economic data which leads to changes in the original estimates.
The benchmarked 2013 jobs data showed that the state created more private sector jobs than were originally estimated. Nearly 200,000 new private sector jobs were added in 2013 alone.
Jesse Panuccio, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity said, "With a five point drop in the statewide unemployment rate and more than 500,000 new private sector jobs created since December 2010, we have another successful chapter in Florida's economic turnaround story. More Florida families are getting back to work across the state, and there is still more work to do to foster an opportunity economy for Florida's present and future generations."
