Today, Governor Rick Scott signed HB 1129 to grant infants who survive abortion procedures the same rights as infants born naturally. Governor Scott was joined by First Lady Ann Scott and pro-life supporters from across the state to sign this bill at Florida Baptist Children's Home in Cantonment.
Governor Scott said, "As a father and grandfather, there is nothing more precious or special than welcoming a new child into this world and by signing this bill, we are protecting the most vulnerable among us and affirming their rights as individuals. This legislation ensures common-sense measures are taken to help care for the babies who survive abortion procedures and grants those infants the same rights as infants who are born naturally.
"I also want to applaud bill sponsors Senator Anitere Flores and Representative Cary Pigman for their commitment to ensuring this bill became law. Representative Pigman is a U.S. Army reserve lieutenant colonel who is currently deployed in Kuwait and proudly serving our nation. I was pleased he was able to join our event today via Skype so we could recognize his hard work on this legislation and for his selfless service to our nation."
Senator Anitere Flores said, "This legislation is about protecting the sanctity of life, and with the signing of this bill today, Governor Scott is fighting for those most vulnerable-this is a victory for Florida."
Representative Cary Pigman said, "I was pleased to sponsor this important legislation this year and proud that Governor Scott is protecting the lives of those most vulnerable."
Representative Clay Ingram said, "Governor Scott is committed to protecting those most vulnerable, and with the signing of today's legislation, he is making sure all babies are treated fairly and with dignity."
