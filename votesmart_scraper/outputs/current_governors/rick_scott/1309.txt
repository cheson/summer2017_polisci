In Case You Missed It: Bullet Train Project Nearly Triples in Cost -- $98.5 Billion -- from Earlier Projections
Statement

Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Scott issued the following statement regarding news reports today (like this one: http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19236454) that the expected cost of high speed rail in California has nearly tripled from its initial estimate to $98.5 billion.
"The news today out of California that High Speed Rail cost estimates have now tripled to the $100 billion range reinforces that Florida made the right decision earlier this year to protect taxpayers from just this sort of boondoggle. As I said at the time, High Speed Rail would be far too costly to taxpayers and I believe the risk far outweighs the benefits. I'm glad Florida is no longer entangled in the high speed spending web."
