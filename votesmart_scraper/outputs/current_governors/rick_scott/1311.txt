Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott. As you know, the biggest issue we are dealing with in Florida is jobs. Last week, I rolled out my jobs agenda for the 2012 legislative session, and it is to do what we can to help businesses grow in our state.
We should accelerate the permitting process and eliminate unnecessary rules and regulations that are killing jobs. Our focus should be on Florida's education system as much as possible, putting emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math because we know that those areas are the biggest job opportunities going forward.
Let's look at our tax structure and continue the process of reducing our business tax for small businesses, as well as our tangible personal property tax for small businesses, so that Florida's small businesses can do well. Let's also make sure our business people know that we're not going to be raising their taxes. Instead, we're going to balance our budget, and we're going to be as fiscally conservative as possible.
