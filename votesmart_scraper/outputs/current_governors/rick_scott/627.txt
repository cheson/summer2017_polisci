Gov. Rick Scott: Florida Will Not Appeal Lawsuit Over Voter Rolls
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Feb. 19, 2015
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Rick Scott announced today that Florida will not continue to appeal the Arcia v. Detzner case concerning Florida's voter rolls. The state's deadline for appeal would be March 4, 2015.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Since 2012, the Department of State has worked closely with Florida's 67 independent Supervisors of Elections from every county to provide consultation and training focused on ensuring the integrity of Florida's voter rolls. In the 2013 legislative session, we were also able to make critical improvements to our election system by expanding the number of early voting hours, days and locations that Supervisors of Elections can offer, and limiting the length of the ballot. Due to these important changes in law and the continued strong partnership between the Department of State and Florida's independent Supervisors of Elections who conduct regular records maintenance, Florida is in an excellent position to conduct fair elections.
"I am confident that the 2016 presidential election cycle will put Florida's election system in a positive light thanks to the improvements made by our Supervisors of Elections, the Legislature and the Department of State. Our goal continues to be 100 percent participation by eligible voters and zero percent fraud. Florida voters deserve an election system they can be proud of, and we will never stop working to eliminate fraud and abuse and make further improvements when they are needed."
