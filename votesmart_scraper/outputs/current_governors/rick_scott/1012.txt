"At sundown tonight, Jewish families throughout Florida will celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, and usher in the annual High Holiday season. This sacred time marks a period of reflection and spiritual renewal for many Floridians.
"Welcoming the New Year on the Hebrew Calendar is a fitting time to recall the importance of faith, family, and tradition. As this Rosh Hashanah approaches, we also remember the brave men and women who protect our freedom at home and abroad so all Americans can freely practice their faith. Their sacrifice ensures that this Rosh Hashanah all Jewish Americans can observe their traditions in peace and security.
"Ann and I wish all Floridians observing the High Holidays a happy and healthy New Year. L'shanah tova!"
