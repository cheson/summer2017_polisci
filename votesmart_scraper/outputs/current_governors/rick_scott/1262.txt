"Today, I signed legislation paving the way for Florida to present the state's rules for numeric nutrient standards in Florida's water bodies to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for final approval. The future of our state's environment and economy depend on the health of our water bodies, and the state's rules will ensure the protection of both.
"The state's rules are scientifically sound, protect the environment and avoid unnecessary costs for Florida's households and businesses. Once approved by EPA, they will further enhance the State's nationally recognized nutrient control programs."
