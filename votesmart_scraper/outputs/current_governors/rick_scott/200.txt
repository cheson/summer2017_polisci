Governor Scott Requests Extension of Recreational Red Snapper Season Following Tropical Storm Colin
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: June 8, 2016
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott requested the U.S. Department of Commerce extend the nine-day recreational red snapper season in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico by three weekend days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) before July 1 to make up for fishing opportunities lost due to Tropical Storm Colin.
Governor Scott said, "While we are pleased that Tropical Storm Colin moved quickly across our state, the weather conditions created by the storm prevented anglers from participating in a significant portion of the nine-day federal red snapper season. Saltwater fishing in the Gulf of Mexico has a $7.6 billion economic impact in Florida every year, and June is one of the most important months for tourism and recreation in our state. I urge the U.S. Department of Commerce to extend the recreational season to ensure our families and visitors have the opportunity to fish for red snapper and Florida's Gulf coast communities can make up for economic losses caused by this storm."
