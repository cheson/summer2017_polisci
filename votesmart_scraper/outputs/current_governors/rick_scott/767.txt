Governor Rick Scott said, "I am proud to announce that in the upcoming legislative session we will propose an increase in Florida's per-pupil spending to the highest level in our state's history. We already have the highest total spending in K-12 this year and gave every teacher the opportunity for a pay raise. Because we were able to get Florida's economy back on track, revenues are now projected to stay at a strong enough rate to support historic investments in education."
"Florida job growth, and the overall growth of Florida's economy has made it possible for us invest record amounts in education. The credit for our historic investment in education goes to the hard working people of Florida who make it all possible."
"My mom taught me that a good education was the way out of poverty and I want all Floridians to have the opportunity to receive a great education and have their shot at the American Dream. By increasing per pupil spending to historic levels next year, school districts will have more resources to provide Florida children the best education possible."
The Governor's proposal would equate to a total of over $19.6 billion, which means $7,176 per student -- a $232 per student increase over this school year and a $50 increase over the 2007-08 per student funding level of $7,126, the previous record high level. Florida's Revenue Estimating Conference for the General Revenue Fund met on August 7, 2014 and Floridians will see sustained revenues. Florida is projected to have a growth of nearly $1.1 billion over the latest 2014-15 revised forecast.
