Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement on the signing of CS/SB 294, which bans 27 new synthetic drugs.
Governor Scott said, "Florida sheriffs, police chiefs and prosecutors have done a great job in making Florida communities safer. Thanks to their efforts, Florida is at a 41 year crime low. We will continue to work in close partnership with our state and local law enforcement officials to keep Florida families and visitors to our state safe -- and this law will provide them with even more tools to fight new drugs that threaten our children."
Attorney General Pam Bondi said, "Deadly synthetic drugs are targeted to our youth, and I will remain committed to banning these drugs and keeping them off of store shelves. I thank Governor Scott for signing this key public safety legislation, which was sponsored by Senator Bradley and Representative Ingram."
