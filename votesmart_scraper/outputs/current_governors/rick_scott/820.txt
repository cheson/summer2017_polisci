Governor Scott said, "I would like to thank the efforts of Senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson for their cooperation and leadership to support legislation holding VA employees accountable for the mismanagement of our VA hospitals. It's disappointing however, that other members of the U.S. Senate blocked progress on this bill.
"I appreciate the leadership of Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (Pensacola) as sponsor of this legislation in the House, and the House leadership on both sides of the aisle, for their leadership in passage of this bill.
"U.S. Senators should ensure our fighting men and women receive the medical care they earned and fought for. They should not have gone home from Washington to celebrate our freedoms and remember the sacrifice of our veterans over Memorial Day until they passed this critical legislation."
Wednesday, the House of Representatives with overwhelming bi-partisan support, passed the VA Management Accountability Act (H.R. 4031) to hold VA officials accountable for mismanagement in our military hospitals.
