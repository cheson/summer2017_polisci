Today, Governor Rick Scott applauded the Florida Senate's dedication to job creation as the Committee for Commerce and Tourism in the Senate unanimously passed SB 518 sponsored by Senator Dorothy Hukill. This legislation will eliminate the burdensome sales tax that manufacturers pay on manufacturing equipment.
Governor Scott said, "I want to thank Senator Dorothy Hukill, the Senate Commerce and Tourism Chair Nancy Detert and the entire committee for recognizing the need for Florida to continue down the path of job creation and more opportunities for Florida families. The elimination of the sales tax that manufacturers pay on equipment will make our state more competitive and will help our manufacturing sector grow jobs. Since December 2010, Florida has created over 290,000 private-sector jobs and our unemployment rate continues to drop. The steps we have taken over the past two years are working, and the Senate eliminating this barrier on job creation will help ensure that our state continues to move in the right direction."
