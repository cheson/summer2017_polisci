Today, Governor Rick Scott announced four license-free fishing days in June for Florida residents and visitors. The license-free fishing weekends are:
Saturday and Sunday, June 6-7, saltwater recreational fishing license requirement will be waived.
Saturday and Sunday, June 13-14, freshwater recreational fishing license requirement will be waived.
Governor Scott said, "This summer, we're excited to make it easier for families to enjoy the world class fishing our state has to offer. Florida is the fishing capital of the world and one of the many reasons we welcomed a record 98.9 million visitors to the Sunshine State last year. I look forward to fishing with my grandsons this summer, and I hope everyone takes advantage of license-free fishing this month."
"We hope new anglers, including residents and visitors, are inspired to join in the excitement with those who already enjoy fishing," said FWC Executive Director Nick Wiley. "This is an excellent way for the entire family to get out and enjoy all of the great fishing opportunities we have to offer in Florida: the Fishing Capital of the World!"
The four days in June are a part of the eight total license-free fishing days the FWC offers each year. All bag limits, seasons and size restrictions apply on these dates. To learn more about license-free fishing days, visit MyFWC.com/License.
