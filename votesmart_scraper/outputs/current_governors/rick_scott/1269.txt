Statement From Governor Scott Regarding Recommendations from the Assisted Living Workgroup
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Jan. 31, 2012
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"The Assisted Living Workgroup has developed important, practical recommendations that will protect residents in Florida's assisted living facilities (ALFs). Their work has been incredibly valuable in identifying ways that we can better protect the safety and well-being of individuals living in ALFs.
"We have a duty to protect the people who rely on the services provided by ALFs, and I thank the workgroup for undertaking this important task to put the safety of residents first. Because of the workgroup's recommendations, the Agency for Health Care Administration has been able to move forward and implement changes to increase standards among facilities to allow for more effective oversight and increased accountability. While tremendous progress has been made already, we will ask the workgroup to continue to examine issues related to ALFs over the next year."
