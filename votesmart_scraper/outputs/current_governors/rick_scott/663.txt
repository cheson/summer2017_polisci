Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Dec. 15, 2014
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement regarding the Revenue Estimating Conference's report that Florida's FY 2014-15 general revenues are expected to rise by $296 million and FY 2015-16 general revenues are expected to rise by $331.9 million over the previous forecast.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today's news of increased revenue reflects the positive steps we are taking to grow our economy. We are working everyday to make Florida the premier destination in the world for business and I applaud our job creators who have helped add almost 680,000 new private-sector jobs in less than four years. Job growth is an indicator of our economic strength and we hope to see even more gains. Because we are creating an environment where our private-sector can succeed, our economy is growing which makes it possible for us to invest in areas important to Florida families. I look forward to working with the Legislature to continue to cut taxes by $1 billion over the next two years and increase K-12 per pupil funding to the highest level in our state's history this coming year."
