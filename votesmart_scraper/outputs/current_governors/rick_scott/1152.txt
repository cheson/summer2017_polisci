There are three things I want to talk about today: FIRST -- The state of our economy in Florida -- where we have come from and where we are going. SECOND -- I will talk about why continuing to cut taxes and eliminate regulations on businesses, especially our manufacturers, is critical to keeping our state's economy moving forward. THIRD -- I will talk about our MAJOR investment in education and why I call this an "INVESTMENT" for Florida families.
ECONOMY OFF TRACK
FIRST -- I want to back up and talk about the economic situation our state is in today.
Many of you have heard these numbers beforeI came into office in 2011 during record-high unemployment, record-high debt, and record-high job losses. In the four years before I took office, Florida lost 825,500 jobs. Unemployment more than tripled -- from 3.5% to 11.1% over those four years. State debt increased over those four years by $5.2 billion. Our housing market was crippled.
There has been no lack of debate or finger pointing, by political pundits and journalists alike, about HOW our economy ended up so far off track. But, there is NO disagreement that our economy WAS IN FACT in bad shapeand Florida families were hurting.
The policies of BORROWING and SPENDINGand borrowing and spending some morewere not working in Florida.
It was time for a change.
I ran for Governor, committed to getting our economy back ON TRACK by reining in spending, paying down debt, and removing the burdens on job creators that support Florida families.
