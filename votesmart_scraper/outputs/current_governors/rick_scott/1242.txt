During the past few months, I talked with Floridians across the state about what is important to them. I quickly learned that education and jobs are the two issues that Floridians care about the most.
In fact, education and job creation are equally important to Florida's economy. Last week I signed a job creation and economic development package to boost Florida's economy in the near term. This, along with an educated workforce, is the cornerstone for Florida's economic future. Employers want to locate in states with the best and the brightest talent pool for employees. That's why I called on the Florida House and Senate to increase K-12 funding by $1 billion. I would like to thank them for answering that call.
Increasing education funding in Florida is the best investment we can make for our state's future. It is also important to remember that with increased funding comes increased responsibilities. We must continue to set the bar high on Florida's learning standards. Also, we must continue to hold our schools accountable to provide our children with the best possible education.
I look forward to signing this billion-dollar increase in funding next week. Thank you to everyone who made this significant investment in our schools possible.
