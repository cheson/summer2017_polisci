Today, Governor Rick Scott highlighted that the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) gained more than 20,000 new nonagricultural jobs over the year, ranking second among all 22 metro areas, while also experiencing a 1.6 percentage point drop in its unemployment rate during that same time period. Since December 2010, the metro area's unemployment rate has declined 3.2 percentage points from 10.9 percent.
Governor Scott said, "Everything we do is geared toward job creation and the news that more than 20,000 new private-sector jobs were created in the Orlando area means more families are finding jobs and pursing their version of the American Dream. That's proof that IT'S WORKING. The Orlando area has experienced a 3.2 percentage point decrease in unemployment since December 2010, which means our efforts to cut regulations, keep taxes low and work with our regional workforce boards to find jobs for families is working. While this is great progress, our work isn't done until every family who wants a job can find one."
The Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford MSA gained a total of 20,200 nonagricultural jobs over the year, leading all metro areas in job gains in leisure and hospitality (+7,400). These data are not seasonally adjusted.
The MSA had the second-highest online job demand for STEM occupations in Florida in February 2013 (6,872 openings) and ranked number three in overall demand in the state. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill. Additionally, housing starts increased by 58.0 percent in January 2013 (the latest available data) compared to a year ago.
Over the past year, Lake, Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties have all seen significant decreases in their unemployment rates. Osceola County led the way with a 1.9 percentage point decline, going from 10.4 percent to 8.5 percent. Lake County was second with a 1.7 percentage point drop, from 10.0 percent to 8.3 percent. Orange County's rate dropped 1.6 percentage points from 9.2 percent to 7.6 percent and Seminole County's rate went from 8.6 percent to 7.2 percent, a 1.4 percentage point drop.
In February, Workforce Central Florida along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards reported more than 38,000 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 11,034 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2012, more than 426,000 Floridians were placed in jobs, with nearly 111,173 former claimants finding employment.
Florida's unemployment rate decreased to 7.8 percent, down from the revised December 2012 rate of 7.9 percent and the lowest since November 2008. The state experienced an increase of 14,700 private sector jobs over the month. This increase brings the total number of private sector jobs created since December 2010 to 282,200.
