Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott.
Last week, I announced a plan to expand the petroleum facility at the Port of Tampa. This project will modernize the port, as well as create more than 600 immediate construction jobs and 8,200 jobs in the next 30 years. By prioritizing transportation projects, we can make Florida a better place for businesses to grow and help get Floridians back to work.
As session continues, I would like to thank the Legislature for working towards my goal of increasing education funding in Florida by $1 billion. Also, I urge them to work with me in curbing auto insurance fraud in Florida. This problem will cost Floridians more than $1 billion if nothing is done this year. If lawmakers aren't willing to make a decision that will save their constituents $1 billion, they shouldn't be here. The decision to reform PIP is what our kids call a "no brainer." We need strong PIP accident fraud reform. Lawmakers should put the needs of their constituents first.
