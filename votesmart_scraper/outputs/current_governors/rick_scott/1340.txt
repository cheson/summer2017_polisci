This week, I marked the 21st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act by creating the Governor's Commission on Jobs for Persons with Disabilities.
During the economic downturn, workers with disabilities lost jobs at a rate 9% higher than workers without disabilities. We are working to grow Florida's private-sector jobs by making our state the best place to start, grow or move a business.
As we do so, we need to also make sure we are creating job opportunities for Floridians with disabilities. Employment opportunities help persons with disabilities increase their independence and enjoy a better quality of life.
In addition, this week, as part of my efforts to get Florida back to work, I visited with the Pensacola Bay Area Chamber of Commerce.
It was great to hear ideas from business leaders on how we can create jobs. While there, I let them know that Florida is on the right track.
Since January, Florida has added 85,500 new jobs. This is great news for Floridians because we are bucking the national trend.
Ultimately, my goal is to make sure every Floridian has the opportunity for a job. It won't happen overnight, but we're off to a great start.
