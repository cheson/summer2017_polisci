New Year's Greetings from Governor Scott and First Lady Ann
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Dec. 30, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"As 2011 comes to an end, Ann and I would like to wish all Floridians a very happy new year. Today, we are reminded of America's servicemen and women who continue to sacrifice to ensure that Americans can remain free. We are very thankful for their service.
"Another reason I am thankful today is that we were able to have a positive impact on the lives of Floridians in 2011. The most current jobs figures show that Florida has gained over 120,000 private sector jobs in 2011, and I am confident that as we continue making Florida the best place for business, this trend will continue into 2012. We still have a long way to go, and I will continue to work every day as Governor to help bring jobs to our state and ensure that Florida's children can receive a quality education. This new year will present many new opportunities and challenges, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to better the quality of lives of Florida citizens."
