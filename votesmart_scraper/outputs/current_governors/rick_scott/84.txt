Location: St. Augustine, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that in October 2016, Florida businesses created 8,900 private-sector jobs, bringing the total number of jobs created since December 2010 to 1,232,400. For the 55th consecutive month, Florida's annual job growth rate of 3.3 percent is exceeding the nation's rate of 1.8 percent. Governor Scott made the announcement at Ideal Aluminum, a manufacturer of aluminum fences, gates and railings in St. Augustine. The company has created more than 30 jobs in the past two years and currently employs more than 110 Floridians.
Governor Scott said, "I am proud to announce that nearly 9,000 jobs were created by Florida businesses last month and more than 1.2 million jobs have been created since December 2010. Our job growth rate also continues to exceed the nation's and we will continue to cut taxes and reduce regulations so we can make Florida the top place in the world for families to get great jobs."
Florida's labor force growth nearly doubled from September, increasing by 64,000 over-the-month, which shows more Floridians are confident in their ability to find a new opportunity in the job market. The state's unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in October, as a result of the rapidly growing labor force.
Cissy Proctor, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said, "All across the nation, individuals and families know that Florida is a great place to find your dream job. Month after month, we continue to provide new opportunities for good jobs in Florida. We are excited that people are re-entering the labor force to pursue the next step in their careers."
