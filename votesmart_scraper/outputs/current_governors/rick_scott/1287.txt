Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott.
I hope you had as good a Christmas as I did. I got to spend time with my two daughters and their husbands, my wife Ann, and our first grandchild.
The beginning of session is right at the beginning of the year. We're going to have a great new year. It was a great 2011, and jobs are coming back, but it's never fast enough.
We are working every day to ensure that every Floridian has a job and every child can get a great education.
We are going to make sure that we do the right things. We're going to balance the budget, with no new taxes and no new debt. Jobs and education will remain our focus.
Have a happy new year.
