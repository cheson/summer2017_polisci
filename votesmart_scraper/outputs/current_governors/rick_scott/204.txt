Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida's crime is now at a 45-year low. In 2015, there were 10,773 fewer crimes than in 2014, which represents a 1.6 percent decrease. The crime rate has dropped by 3.1 percent since 2014. This year, Governor Scott invested more than $4.9 billion in public safety measures in the Florida First budget. This investment included improvements to the Florida Department of Corrections and increasing staff across Florida's public safety system.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Florida's crime rate continues to drop thanks to the hard work and dedication of our brave law enforcement officers. We are committed to building safer communities and want Florida to be the safest and best place in the nation to live, work and raise a family. By investing more than $4.9 billion in public safety measures across our state, we want to ensure that our law enforcement and safety agencies are equipped with the tools they need to keep Florida families safe."
Attorney General Pam Bondi said, "The crime rate in Florida is the lowest it has been in 45 years and that is due to the great work of our state law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day protecting Floridians and our visitors. I cannot express the extent of my gratitude to each and every law enforcement officer in our state for their selfless commitment to the safety of Floridians and our great prosecutors who work to keep the worst of the worst behind bars where they below."
FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen said, "I am proud to join Governor Scott in recognizing Florida's dropping crime rate. Our dedicated law enforcement officers work every day to protect Florida families and we will continue to do all we can to keep Florida safe."
