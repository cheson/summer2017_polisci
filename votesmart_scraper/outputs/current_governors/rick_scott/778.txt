Governor Scott reminds families of the 2014 sales tax-free holiday beginning August 1. With the new school year approaching, parents and students can save money on their back to school shopping with the sales tax-free holiday from August 1 through August 3.
Governor Scott said, "During this sales-tax holiday families will be able to save money on school supplies and other back-to-school items that will set students up for success in the upcoming school year. We are proud to offer this sales-tax holiday as it will result in direct savings for Florida families as they prepare for the school year."
Governor Scott signed legislation to approve a three-day back to school sales tax-free holiday to support Florida parents purchasing school supplies and clothing. The holiday exempts families from paying sales taxes on numerous back to school items including clothing and footwear of $100 or less per item and on certain school supplies of less than $15 per item.
"The sales tax-free holiday is an excellent opportunity for families to stock up on the supplies their children need for the coming school year," said Commissioner of Education Pam Stewart. "I appreciate Governor Scott's dedication to ensuring families have this much-deserved break."
Another tax break for families took effect July 1, 2014. Youth bicycle helmets, child restraint systems and booster seats are now tax-exempt and will provide additional relief for families purchasing these child safety items.
