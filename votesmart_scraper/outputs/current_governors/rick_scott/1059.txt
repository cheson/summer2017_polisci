Today, Governor Rick Scott made the following statement on the joint American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA) and James Madison Institute's (JMI) report on the Florida's State University System. In its report, Florida Rising: An Assessment of Public Universities in the Sunshine State, ACTA and JMI provide critical statistics on the impact rising tuition has on Florida's families.
Governor Scott said, "Higher education in Florida should be affordable so it is accessible to as many Florida families as possible. The increase in tuition and fees have demanded an increasing percentage of Florida's household income and saddled many Florida graduates with tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I strongly agree with the final report recommendation calling for the university system to continue to hold the line on tuition. I will also continue to veto any tuition increase proposed by the Florida legislature. "
The reports notes Florida's high potential to be a model for other states. "Florida has a favorable position as a national leader in low tuition and fees; this advantage for its citizens deserves to be maintained. University boards of trustees should continue to restrain the growth in tuition and fees in order to provide good value for college students," the report states.
