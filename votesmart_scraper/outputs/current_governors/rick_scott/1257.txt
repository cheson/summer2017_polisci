Governor Scott's Weekly Radio Address for March 2, 2012 - Thank You to the Florida House for Passing Accident Fraud Reform
Statement

As we near the end of this year's legislative session, I would like to thank the Florida House of Representatives for passing strong accident fraud reform.
Personal injury protection fraud is taking money out of the pockets of hard working Floridians. I am confident that the Florida Senate will stand with me on this issue. It is time in Tallahassee that lawmakers put their constituents first and do something about this billion-dollar problem.
The action taken by the Florida House this week is a good start. If we do nothing, Florida drivers will suffer by paying higher insurance premiums. Contact your legislator and tell them you're ready for Tallahassee to address accident fraud reform.
