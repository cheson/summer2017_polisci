Today, Governor Rick Scott highlighted that the Jacksonville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) experienced an increase of 17,900 nonagricultural, jobs in July 2013 as compared to a year ago. The area also experienced an over the year decrease in the local unemployment rate of 1.9 percentage points, from 8.9 percent in July 2012 to the current rate of 7.0 percent.
Governor Scott said, "With the addition of 17,900 new jobs and a decreasing unemployment rate in the Jacksonville area, it is clear that Florida families are getting back to work. The policies we have put into place over the last two and a half years are working in Jacksonville and all across the Sunshine State."
The MSA, consisting of Baker, Clay, Duval, Nassau, and St. Johns counties, added the most jobs of all the state's metro areas in professional and business services with 9,400 new jobs, the fastest annual job growth rate in this industry. The Jacksonville MSA ranked third in the state for gains in total nonagricultural employment over the year with an increase of 17,900 jobs. The Jacksonville MSA ranked in the top four metro areas in the state for job growth in the following industries:
- Professional and Business Services
- Trade, Transportation, and Utilities
- Construction
- Financial Activities
In July 2013, the Jacksonville MSA was among the top four metro areas in Florida for online job demand with 23,324 openings and also ranked number four for STEM job openings with 4,558 job ads. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
Housing starts were up over the year by 33.9 percent in the Jacksonville MSA in June 2013.
In July, First Coast Workforce Development, Inc. along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards reported more than 38,800 Floridians were placed in jobs. This represents an increase of more than 13,300 placements over the year from July 2012, a 52 percent increase. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 10,902 previously received Reemployment Assistance.
With the addition of 35,400 private sector jobs over the month, Florida has experienced positive annual job growth now for 36 consecutive months. This adds up to 369,100 new private sector jobs created in Florida since December 2010.
Since Governor Scott took office, Florida's statewide unemployment rate has dropped four percentage points, from a rate of 11.1 percent to July's rate of 7.1 percent.
