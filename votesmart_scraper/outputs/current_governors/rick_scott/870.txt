Governor Rick Scott today released the following statement about news outlets reporting the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles is considering tying their employee bonuses to the number of tickets they issue to motorists:
"The idea that FHP would tie officer bonuses to the number of tickets they write is absolutely outrageous and wrong. All state worker bonuses should be based on better -- not worse -- outcomes for the people of Florida who pay the taxes to fund state government.
"Floridians paying more in tickets is not a better outcome. Period. If this idea comes across my desk, I will reject it."
