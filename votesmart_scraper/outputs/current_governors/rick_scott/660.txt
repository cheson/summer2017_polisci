Today, Governor Rick Scott issued the following statement on the tragic death of Tarpon Springs Police Officer Charles Kondek who was killed in the line of duty this morning in Tarpon Springs.
Governor Scott said, "We are saddened by the death of Officer Charles Kondek who was killed in the line of duty early this morning. Ann and I pray that God provides comfort to his loved ones and all those who have been affected by this terrible tragedy.
"Last month, Leon County Sheriff's Deputy Chris Smith was also killed in the line of duty. Each loss of a law enforcement officer is heartbreaking and losing two heroes in less than a month is a cry for peace and a signal to all Floridians to pray for our men and women in uniform who protect our communities each day.
"As we celebrate the holidays, I hope and pray that Floridians can come together and foster a peace that will prevent future tragedies in our state. Our law enforcement bravely and selflessly risk their lives to protect us and as Governor I am always thinking about how we can thank and strengthen the men and women who wear the uniform and serve our families. Ann and I join all Floridians in honoring our fallen heroes and we will continue to pray that God watch over all of our law enforcement officers and their families."
Governor Scott plans to attend the funeral of Officer Kondek when it is announced, as he did with the funeral of Leon County Sheriff's Deputy Chris Smith in November.
