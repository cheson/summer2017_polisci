"With Thanksgiving upon us, I would like to share what I am thankful for this holiday. First, I am thankful to the men and women of America's Armed Forces and their families for their service. Because of the sacrifice and bravery of our service men and women, Americans can observe Thanksgiving knowing that they possess the gift of freedom.
"I am also thankful for Florida's state employees. Their hard work and determination is a testament that Florida is the best state in the nation. I would like to also thank them for their service to Florida's citizens.
"Thanksgiving is a time to be together with your friends and family, and my family is exceptionally blessed this year. Ann and I welcomed our first grandchild last week. Auguste Philippe Richard Guimard was born 7:48 pm on November 15th. He weighed 5 pounds, 15 ounces, and is 19 inches long. We are thankful for his safe arrival, and we are thankful to be able to celebrate his first Thanksgiving together as a family. We hope that you also get to spend this holiday with those who are most important to you."
