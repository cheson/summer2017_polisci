Today, Governor Rick Scott issued the following statement in observance of the 70th Anniversary of D-Day.
Governor Scott said, "When we consider important milestones in our nation's history, D-Day certainly stands out as one of the most significant events impacting the course of world events. On June 6, 1944, approximately 160,000 Allied troops landed on the heavily-defended shores of the northern coast of France. Among Florida's more than 101,000 living World War II veterans are many D-Day veterans, who today are being remembered in ceremonies throughout our state and nation.
"I've had the distinct honor of meeting several of these heroic veterans through their participation in Florida-based Honor Flights to our nation's capital and through individual presentations of the Governor's Veterans Service Award. I also have a personal connection, as my father served in the 82nd Airborne during World War II. One of my best memories is the day my daughter Allison called from Sainte-Mère-Église and told me she found a picture of her grandfather in a museum. My father had parachuted in behind enemy lines. I think they said 17 percent of my dad's company died in that jump. Allison was very proud of her grandfather.
"As we commemorate the anniversary of D-Day, this Navy veteran salutes all veterans for their selfless service and sacrifice, and asks God's blessings on those who did not return."
