Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Scott released the below statement following the Florida Legislature passing HB 1175 which increases transparency at Florida health care facilities.
Governor Rick Scott said, "I applaud the Legislature for passing this bill which is an important step forward in our fight to increase transparency and end unfair, high costs for patients at Florida hospitals. While there is still more work to be done to empower patients at hospitals, this bill will help provide Floridians with information to make informed decisions about their healthcare and its costs.
"Our Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding did a great job shining a light on the need for more transparency at Florida hospitals. They heard from countless patients who believed they had been victims of unfair price gouging at Florida hospitals and the Commission's efforts supported the passage of this important bill. I would like to thank Senator Bradley and Representative Sprowls for their hard work on this legislation and I look forward to working with the Legislature to further empower patients and continue increasing price transparency at Florida hospitals."
