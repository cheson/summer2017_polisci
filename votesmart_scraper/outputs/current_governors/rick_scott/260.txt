The Sunshine State is leading the nation in job growth and we will continue to welcome job creators to Florida by cutting $1 billion in taxes and creating the new $250 million Florida Enterprise Fund this year."
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Cissy Proctor said, "January has been another great month for job seekers in the state, and Florida's economy continues to rebound. Our goal is to make Florida first for jobs by supporting $1 billion in tax cuts and the creation of the new Florida Enterprise Fund."
The top occupation in demand continues to be registered nurses. Job demand was highest in Tampa followed by Miami, Orlando, Jacksonville and Fort Lauderdale.
