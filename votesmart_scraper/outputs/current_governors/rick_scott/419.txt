Governor Rick Scott said, "A great education is the best way to prepare for a great job and that is why we will continue to do all we can to support our teachers and students. In addition to our record funding for K-12 public schools, we also included a 10-day Back-to-School Sales Tax Holiday which will allow Florida families to prepare for school to start and save money on supplies."
Florida's Back-To-School Sales Tax Holiday will allow Florida families to purchase school supplies and clothing without paying local and state taxes, and applies to clothing, footwear, and certain accessories for $100 or less and school supplies of less than $15.
