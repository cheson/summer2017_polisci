The American economy is sustained by business owners large and small who invested their money because they saw the potential of our great nation. Companies from around the world should continue flocking here, but instead they are being deterred by a nation facing a trillion dollar deficit and a federal government with an insatiable appetite for more debt and intrusion into the lives of its citizens.

What we need in the White House is a leader who understands that the government's role is to create the conditions that help create private-sector jobs. We need a President who understands that the government can only give Americans the opportunity to work hard and live their version of the American dream, but government cannot do the work for them. In my first year in office as Governor, we streamlined government, cut red-tape and created a business and taxpayer-friendly climate in Florida. As a result, our state's unemployment rate dropped by more than 2.1 percentage points last year, the second biggest drop of any state in the nation, and we created 141,500 private-sector jobs.

The steps we are taking in Florida are working. The time is now to elect a leader who will make the right choices in order to grow jobs and get Americans back to work.
