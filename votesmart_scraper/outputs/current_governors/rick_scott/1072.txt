Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling to reverse the trial court's injunction that invalidated Executive Order 11-58 to require drug testing of state employees:
"Many Floridians are required to take drug tests in their workplace and it is only right for state workers paid with taxpayer funds to be required to do the same.
"The Court did the right thing today by reversing the injunction on our executive order for drug testing state employees. We will go forward in arguing this case in both the appellate and trial courts in order to ensure that taxpayer funds are safeguarded from misuse by ensuring our state workforce is drug free."
