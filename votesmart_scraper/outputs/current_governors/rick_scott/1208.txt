"Florida is raising education standards because we know from past experience that students and teachers consistently rise to the occasion when challenged. In just two years, Florida will move to a new testing standard that significantly reduces our reliance on the FCAT and moves to Common Core State Standards. This new system will allow us to compare our students with those in other states so that we can benchmark results, measure progress, and adjust curriculum to better prepare students for college and the workforce, so that they are better able to compete in the global marketplace."
"As part of our ongoing accountability efforts, we're constantly reviewing the level of and kinds of testing occurring in our classrooms. Our goal is to make sure we're not testing for testing's sake, but working to ensure our students are prepared for college and the workforce. Common Core assessments are an example of that kind of tool.
"It is never easy to raise the standards for excellence in education. This year is no exception. But every time we raise the expectations of our students and teachers, they ultimately get better in later years. Simply put, raising the bar works."
