"As a successful businessman, I know the importance of an educated workforce in growing the economy. In order for Florida to attract business, compete effectively in the global economy, and create 21st century jobs we must have an educated workforce. I am committed to improving education and putting Florida back to work." -- Rick Scott
An educated workforce is essential for job creation. Florida's education system must prepare our children to get good paying jobs, so that they are able to support their families and fuel the economy. Each student who is not going to college must be equipped with the skills necessary to compete in the 21st century economy. Rick understands this well as he went to community college before enlisting in the U.S. Navy, then upon returning he finished the education that was the foundation of a successful career in business.
