Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement following the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to hear a case related to drug screenings for state employees.
Governor Scott said, "State employees should have the right to work in a safe and drug free environment, just like in any other business. The merits of this case are still being deliberated in the U.S. Southern District Court, and we will continue to fight to make sure all state employees, who are paid by taxpayer funds, can work in a safe, drug free workplace."
