Today, Governor Rick Scott announced seven additional companies that have agreed to host teachers for Governor Scott's proposed STEM summer residency program. Governor Scott has announced $1 million in proposed funding in the Florida First budget for the state to partner with high-tech companies in Florida to create a paid summer residency program for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) teachers to bring new industry trends back to Florida's K-12 classrooms.
Governor Rick Scott said, "It is exciting that more and more companies throughout Florida are signing onto our STEM summer residency initiative. STEM education is essential to ensuring our students are prepared for the jobs of the future. To make Florida first for jobs, we must invest in our teachers so they can prepare our students to be competitive in the global workforce. I look forward to more companies signing on."
