Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida businesses created 22,600 private-sector jobs across the state during August, bringing the total number of jobs created in 2016 to 167,100.

Since December 2010, 1,191,900 private-sector jobs have been created in Florida. The state's unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent in August, the lowest rate since November 2007. Governor Scott made the announcement at All Access Multimedia, a marketing and production company in Ft. Myers that specializes in commercials, web video and infomercials.
Governor Rick Scott said, "I am proud to announce today that Florida businesses created more than 22,000 new jobs last month and that Florida's annual job growth rate has outpaced the nation for almost four and a half years. In addition to today's great news, this week we also announced that two businesses, Hotwire Communications and Intellitech, chose to relocate their headquarters from other states to Florida and create hundreds of new jobs. It's clear that our low tax, business friendly environment continues to send a strong message across the country that Florida is the best location for businesses to grow. We will continue to do all we can to outcompete other locations for new opportunities so we can make Florida first for jobs."
Cissy Proctor, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said, "Florida's strong economy is bolstered each month with the addition of thousands of new jobs. I am proud that in just eight months, more than 167,000 people have been empowered to secure financial stability for themselves and their families through a new job."
