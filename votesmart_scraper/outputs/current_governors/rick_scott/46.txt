Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that he will cut over $8 million in additional annual fees for Florida's veterans, seniors and businesses during the upcoming legislative session. Governor Scott has been fighting to eliminate fees and unnecessary regulations since he first took office.
Governor Rick Scott said, "When we cut fees and taxes, it helps businesses create jobs, and reduces costs for families across our state. This session I look forward to working with the Legislature to cut more than $8 million in unnecessary fees. We have to continue to do all we can to return more money back to families and job creators."
Some of the fee cuts include:
Fee Cuts for Seniors
Free Vehicle Title Transfers for Surviving Spouses. Currently, surviving spouses are required to pay the $70 fee to retitle deceased spouses' vehicles. This will exempt spouses from paying the fee and save $1.6 million for Floridians annually.
Free Replacement and Renewal ID Cards for Citizens 80 and over. This will exempt seniors 80 and over from paying the $25 fee on renewal or replacement ID cards. This will save over $700,000 for Florida's seniors.
Free Original ID Cards for Citizens 80 and Over Who Surrender Their Driver License. Many senior citizens decide to no longer hold a driver license to operate a vehicle, yet still need an ID card. The Fighting for Florida's Future Budget exempts citizens over the age of 80 from paying the $25 fee who surrender their license. This is expected to save $2.3 million for Florida's seniors.
