Today, Governor Rick Scott highlighted the number of available job openings in Florida increased in February 2014 compared to the previous February by 9,727, or 3.6 percent, for a total of 278,717 openings (seasonally adjusted). These figures from Help Wanted Online are an all-time high in the data series, which began in May 2005. Job postings in Florida also increased over the month compared to January 2014 by 8,204 openings or 3.0 percent.
Governor Scott said, "Another record month for job demand in Florida is great news for Florida families. Every job posting represents an opportunity for a Florida family and a chance to achieve their dreams. With an unemployment rate at 6.1 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in the state since June 2008, and the creation of 500,000 private sector jobs since December 2010, it is clear that our job creation efforts are working."
Florida's labor demand has increased by 125,933 openings, or 82.4 percent, since April 2009, when the number of openings was the lowest, with 152,784 openings.
According to the Help Wanted OnLine data series, online job demand was highest in the large metro cities, led by Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Ft. Lauderdale. Among cities with the most openings, the highest percentage gain over the year was Sarasota with 36.4 percent growth.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "It's another record month for our economy, with job postings in Florida growing by three percent since January. This continued growth, is further proof that Governor Scott's sound economic policies are creating an opportunity economy in Florida and are helping to support the economic recovery nationwide."
Major occupational groups with the most online ads in February were sales and related occupations, office and administrative support occupations, healthcare practitioners and technical occupations, and management occupations.
