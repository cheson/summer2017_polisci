Florida Governor Rick Scott Rejects Federal High Speed Rail
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Feb. 16, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

After thoughtful consideration, Governor Rick Scott informed U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood of the state's decision to reject President Obama's Tampa to Orlando high-speed rail project.
Below are Governor Scott's Remarks as Prepared:
* As you know, I was elected to get Floridians back to work and to change the way government does business in our state.
* I am committed to making good on those promises.
* Recently, I sent a budget proposal to the legislature that reduces the size and scope of government; reduces the costs of that government and passes those cost savings on to taxpayers so that we can create new jobs and turn Florida's economy around.
* I believe when you reduce government's reach and hold that government accountable, you create an environment where the economy can flourish.
* When you reduce taxes and put that money back in the hands of hardworking Floridians and Florida businesses, that money will be spent on creating private sector jobs
* As you know, my background is in business, not politics. But you don't have to be an economics expert to understand that if you spend more money than you take in, your business will fail.
