Today, Governor Rick Scott released the below statement regarding the shooting of 12 law enforcement officers in Dallas, Texas.
Governor Scott said, "This morning, Ann and I are heartbroken to hear of the horrendous tragedy that took place in Texas last night. The violence displayed against Dallas law enforcement was a senseless and cowardly act that has no place in our country. Law enforcement officers across the nation bravely put their lives on the line every day in order to protect our homes, our communities, and our families. We join of all of America in mourning these fallen heroes and praying for the recovery of those injured. Just as Texas stood with Florida following the Orlando terror attack last month, Florida will stand with Texas during this unfathomably difficult time."
