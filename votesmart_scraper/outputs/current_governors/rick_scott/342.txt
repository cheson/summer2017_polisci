Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: Oct. 30, 2015
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida's housing market saw another strong month of positive growth with more closed sales and higher median prices over the year in September 2015. Closed sales of existing single-family homes statewide totaled 23,574 last month, up 13.4 percent from September 2014.
Governor Scott said, "A growing housing market shows that more people are choosing Florida as the best state in the nation to live, work and raise a family. It is exciting to see that when we diversify Florida's economy and put job creation first, more families can achieve their dream of owning a home in our state."
In September 2015, the median number of days on the market for single family homes in Florida dropped by more than 11 percent over the year. Florida building permits were also up 70 percent over the year, with 10,390 new private housing units authorized by building permits in September 2015.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "The pro-growth policies under Governor Scott continue to succeed for Floridians. September was another strong month for Florida's housing market, with over the year increases in closed sales and median home prices."
The statewide median sales price for single-family existing homes last month was $199,900, up 11.1 percent from the previous year. The statewide median price for townhouse-condo properties in September was $150,000, up 5.1 percent over-the-year. September marked the 45th consecutive month that median sales prices increased over-the-year for single-family homes and the 51st consecutive month for townhouse-condo properties.
