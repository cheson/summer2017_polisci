Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: March 2, 2016
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) fulfilled the request he made last week for more antibody tests for the Zika virus and provided an additional 500 tests. Florida currently has the capacity to test 4,621 people for active Zika virus and 1,579 for Zika antibodies. Currently, Florida has 44 CDC-confirmed cases of the Zika virus, all of which are travel related.
Governor Scott said, "Making sure all Floridians stay informed and remain prepared for the possible spread of the Zika virus is our number one priority. We appreciate the CDC fulfilling our request and providing our state with 500 additional antibody tests. I would like to thank Dr. John Armstrong for his leadership to make sure our state is prepared to respond to any health emergency, including the Zika virus."
Based on CDC guidance, several pregnant women who have traveled to countries with local-transmission of Zika have received antibody testing, and of those, four have tested positive for the Zika virus.
