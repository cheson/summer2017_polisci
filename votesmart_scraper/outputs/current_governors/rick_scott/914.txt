Governor Rick Scott announced that according to Help Wanted OnLine, the number of available job openings in Florida increased in January 2014 compared to the previous January by 13,725, or 5.1 percent, for a total of 282,056 openings (seasonally adjusted). This is an all-time high in the data series, which began in May 2005, and the third consecutive month of record growth for job openings. Job postings in Florida also increased over the month compared to December 2013 by 1,588 openings or 0.6 percent.
Governor Rick Scott said, "This is the third consecutive month that the number of online job openings has reached an all-time high. The historic increase in openings is further proof that the steps we are taking to create jobs and opportunities for Florida families are working. Florida has added 462,100 private sector jobs since December 2010, and we won't stop until every Florida family has the opportunity to achieve their version of the American Dream."
Florida's labor demand has increased by 129,405 openings, or 84.8 percent, since April 2009, when the number of openings was the lowest, with only 152,651 openings.
According to the Help Wanted OnLine data series, online job demand was highest in the large metro cities, led by Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Ft. Lauderdale. Among cities with the most openings, the highest percentage gain over the year was Ft. Myers, with 28.4 percent growth.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "Another record month for job demand shows that sound economic policy in Florida is making a difference. Floridians now have more opportunities to find the jobs that will provide for their families and their future."
