Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: April 9, 2015
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Scott made the following statement regarding the attack of peaceful protestors at the Summit of the Americas in Panama by supporters of the Castro regime.
Governor Scott said, "The attacks by Castro's supporters against Floridians and Americans peacefully protesting at The Summit of the Americas is outrageous and another example of why the President should not remove Cuba from the state sponsored terrorism list. President Obama and the US State Department should immediately stand up against this violence and send a strong message to the Castro regime that America does not allow their citizens to be abused for peacefully expressing their views. In Florida, we continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Cuba and their pro-Democracy movement."
