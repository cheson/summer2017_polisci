Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement on the Federal Veterans Affairs Hospitals move to block state health inspectors from their facilities after reported deaths, now opting instead to "audit" themselves:
"While federal Veterans Affairs officials continue to shut out the light of transparency at their facilities across the country, they have today announced the worrisome notion that they will "audit' themselves. This announcement comes after federal Veterans Affairs Hospitals here in Florida have shut out our state inspectors from auditing six different federal hospitals on six different occasions. Why has the federal Veterans Affairs department now decided to "audit' itself after mounting problems have been uncovered all across the country? The brave men and women who fought and served so admirably deserve the benefit of an independent thorough review that will get to the bottom of the death reports here in Florida and around the U.S."
