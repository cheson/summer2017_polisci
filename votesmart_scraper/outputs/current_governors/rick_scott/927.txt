The metro area's unemployment rate in December 2013 was the third lowest in the state.
Governor Scott said, "It's working in Fort Lauderdale, and all across our state. Today's news that Fort Lauderdale added 20,500 jobs in December 2013 is even more reason why we should remain focused on creating an economy in Florida where all Floridians have the opportunity to succeed."
