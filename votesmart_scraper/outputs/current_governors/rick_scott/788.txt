Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Jacksonville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) gained 19,200 new jobs over the year in June. The Jacksonville MSA's unemployment rate declined by 1.3 percentage points over the year, from 7.4 percent in June 2013 to 6.1 percent in June 2014.
Governor Scott said, "The unemployment rate drop to 6.1 percent and the addition of 19,200 new jobs means that more families in the Jacksonville area are able to provide for their families. Let's keep working to ensure that every individual who wants a job in this area can find one."
The industries with the largest job gains over the year in the metro area were in leisure and hospitality with 8,000 new jobs, professional and business services with 5,500 new jobs, and trade, transportation, and utilities with 2,700 new jobs. All nine private sector industries saw positive annual job growth in June.
In June 2014, the Jacksonville MSA had 20,321 online job openings and had 4,535 online openings for STEM jobs. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In June, CareerSource Northeast Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 35,000 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 7,239 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
