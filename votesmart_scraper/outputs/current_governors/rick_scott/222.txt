Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Rick Scott announced today that February home prices were higher across the state than a year ago. The statewide median sales price for single-family existing homes last month was $200,000, up 11.1 percent from the previous year.
Governor Scott said, "As housing prices rise across the state, it is clear that Florida continues to be a top destination for business owners and families to live and succeed. We are working every day to cut taxes, grow jobs, and support important economic growth. I look forward to even more Floridians achieving the dream of home ownership in the Sunshine State."
In February, 9,453 new building permits were issued in Florida, which accounted for more than 10 percent of all new U.S. building permits.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Cissy Proctor said, "Florida's strong housing market is a great indicator of the economic success Florida has seen over the last five years. Strategic investments in Florida's future have resulted in our state's strong economic story."
