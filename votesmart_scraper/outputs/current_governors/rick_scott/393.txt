Floridians Should Continue to Watch Remnants of Erika
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Aug. 29, 2015
Location: Naples, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott received a full update on the remnants of Erika at the Collier County Sheriff's Office in Naples. Governor Scott urged all Floridians to remain prepared for any potential impacts from the storm, especially increased rain and flooding in certain coastal regions.
Governor Rick Scott said, "We just got an update from the National Hurricane Center that Erika has dissipated, as expected, as it traveled over land. That is encouraging news, but doesn't mean we stop watching this weather system.
"We will keep watching this weather system as it enters the Gulf of Mexico. We know that when any weather system enters the Gulf it can bring a lot of rain to Florida.
"Even though the weather is nice today in many parts of our state, we still have to stay alert.
"If you go to the beach, please look for warning flags and ensure waters are safe before you enter. The risk of rip currents along Florida coasts will increase as this weather system gets closer.
"Today is a great reminder that we need every family to prepare their own game plan during hurricane season. Continue to watch the news and pay attention to updates from your local elected officials throughout the weekend. You can visit FLGetAPlan.com to build an emergency plan for you and your family in the event of any storm."
