Today, Governor Rick Scott issued the following statement regarding Florida's top five ranking of most fiscally healthy states by the Mercatus Center.
Governor Scott said, "Florida's top five ranking of most fiscally healthy states is great news. By paying down debt, maintaining a healthy pension system, balancing our budget and building our reserves, Florida's economy is growing so we can make important investments in our families and ensure our state is in great financial shape. Florida has become a global beacon for business, and created over 879,000 new private sector jobs in a little over four years.
