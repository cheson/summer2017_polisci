Governor Rick Scott announced today that the Miami area gained 18,100 new jobs over the year in November. The area's unemployment rate declined by 0.3 percentage point over the year to 5.5 percent in November. Florida businesses across the state have added more than 1 million private-sector jobs since December 2010.
Governor Scott said, "While Florida businesses have created more than one million jobs in just five years, the Miami area also continues to see tremendous job growth. More than 18,000 jobs were added over the year, and the unemployment rate in South Florida continues to drop. We will work to cut $1 billion in taxes and create the Florida Enterprise Fund this year so we can make Florida first for jobs."
