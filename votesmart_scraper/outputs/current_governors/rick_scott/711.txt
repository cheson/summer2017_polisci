Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Naples-Marco Island Metropolitan Statistical Area experienced positive annual job growth with an increase of 4,400 jobs over the year in September 2014.

Governor Scott said, "With 4,400 new jobs, the Naples area is heading in the right direction for an economic turnaround, and Florida has added 651,300 private-sector jobs statewide since December 2010. So let's keep working to create an environment where Florida's private sector can create more jobs for Florida families."
The industries gaining the most jobs in this metro area over the year in September 2014 were leisure and hospitality and professional and business services, with 900 new jobs each, and construction with 800 new jobs.

The Naples-Marco Island MSA had 4,878 online job openings in September 2014. The area also had 696 online openings for STEM occupations, an increase of 16.4 percent over the year. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In September, CareerSource Southwest Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 43,800 Floridians were placed in jobs.
