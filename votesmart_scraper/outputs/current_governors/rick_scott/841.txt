Today, Governor Rick Scott and former Governors Jeb Bush and Bob Martinez advocated for lowering tuition by advancing SB 1400, which would allow all Florida students, regardless of their background, to qualify for the in-state tuition rate.
Governor Scott said, "Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition rate at universities their peers and classmates do. We want our students to stay here in Florida when they go to college and when they choose a career, and that means we must make college more affordable for all those students who call Florida home. The Florida Senate should take immediate action to move SB 1400 forward."
Governor Bush said, "We must keep and capitalize on the talent of all Florida students who want to attend our exceptional colleges and universities. Punishing some children for their parents' acts by creating obstacles to a college degree isn't in their interests, or ours. I urge the Florida Senate to do the right thing for our state and pass SB 1400."
Governor Martinez said, "For Florida to continue to be a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom to people from all backgrounds, we must ensure our future generations are prepared for success. As a university trustee, I know this often starts with having access to a great higher education. I hope the Florida Senate and the full Florida Legislature support SB 1400 as a critical measure to continue to move our state forward."
