Governor Rick Scott today made the following statement on the Inspector General's Report on Citizens Insurance Corporate Travel.
Governor Scott said, "Citizens, a taxpayer supported entity, is now the largest insurance company in Florida. I requested this IG report to ensure Citizens is held to the highest standards of accountability and transparency, and it is clear from the IG's findings that Citizens is in urgent need of four reforms. First, Citizens should immediately change their travel guidelines to comply with official state travel restrictions. Second, Citizens board members must immediately change their travel policy to prohibit any international travel. Third, the Citizens travel policy should be further tightened to only allow essential employees to attend board meetings in order to eliminate excessive expenses. Finally, as I have previously said, Citizens needs its own independent statutory IG to enforce existing rules, and the additional reforms it is clear they need to make. Any egregious expenses, unethical behavior, or violation of the law must be grounds for dismissal. A company this large, supported by hard-working Florida families, must be held to the highest standards of integrity."
