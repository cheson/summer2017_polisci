Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott.
As you know, I had my fifth "Let's Get to Work" day a few days ago. I got to help unload cargo ships at the port of Miami, working for Seaboard Marine and then I got to work on a Carnival Cruise Line ship in the afternoon. I was a disc jockey, a greeter, and I participated in some line dancing. What was great about the experience is that I learned more about the issues of the employees working in those industries, as well as what employees at our ports deal with each and every day.
I have also put a lot of effort into PIP insurance fraud in our state. If we don't do anything about it, it will continue to be a significant tax on you. Its over 900 million dollars worth of fraud a year right now and the PIP portion of your auto insurance will continue to grow at around 20 percent or more a year if we don't do something about it.
Last, this Veterans Day, I want to thank every veteran and every active member of our military for their service. As you know, some have paid the ultimate sacrifice and my heart goes out to them. So, Lt. Governor Jennifer Carroll and I, who as you know, were both in the Navy, along with my wife Ann, just want to thank every member of the military and every veteran for their service and commitment to our country.
