Press Release

Location: Tallahasse, FL

Governor Rick Scott announced today that December was the strongest month for new housing permits in 2015, with 10,545 permits authorized across the state in December. Florida building permits totaled 107,984 during 2015, up 28 percent from 2014.
Governor Scott said, "I am proud to announce that December was the strongest month last year for our housing market. Florida's low taxes, business-friendly environment and beautiful weather are attracting more than 1,000 new residents to our state each day, and it is exciting that more Florida families are able to achieve their dream of owning a home. We will keep working to make Florida first in the nation for families to succeed."
Additionally, in December 2015, the median number of days on the market for single family homes in Florida dropped by more than 13 percent over the year, while the median number of days on the market for townhouses and condos dropped by nearly 11 percent. South Florida led the state in new housing permits, with more than 23,000 units in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach during 2015.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Cissy Proctor said, "Florida's rapidly growing housing market is a direct result of the Scott Administration's efforts to attract businesses and jobs to our state. People across the nation recognize Florida as a great place to build a business and raise a family while saving their hard-earned money."
The statewide median sales price for single-family existing homes last month was $206,500, up 11.6 percent from the previous year. The statewide median price for townhouse-condo properties in December was $156,500, up 5 percent over-the-year.
