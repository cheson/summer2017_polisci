Statement from Governor Rick Scott Regarding Chanukah
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Dec. 20, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"Beginning at sundown tonight, Jewish Floridians will begin celebrating the eight days of Chanukah. I hope that this year's celebration is shared with friends and family and is a reflective time, filled with joy and prayer.
"The strength of Florida's Jewish population is one of our state's greatest assets. After returning from a trade mission to Israel this month, I have a better understanding of the Jewish faith and history. While in Israel, I was honored to participate in Shabbat prayers and visit holy sites, including the Western Wall, and during this special holiday, I hope we can all reflect on the important contributions our Jewish friends contribute to our state and nation. Ann and I are honored to celebrate the festival of lights with Florida's Jewish community."
