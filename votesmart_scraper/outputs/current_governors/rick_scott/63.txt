The Fighting for Florida's Future budget invests $355.6 million in financial assistance to state and local governments for emergency public awareness, outreach programs, and disaster mitigation programs.
Affordable Housing
Since 2011, Florida has invested more than $1 billion to make Florida's affordable housing among the best in the nation.
