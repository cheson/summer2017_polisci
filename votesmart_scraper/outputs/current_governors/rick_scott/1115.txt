Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) had the fifth highest rate of job growth in January 2013 among all metro areas in Florida compared to a year ago, growing by 2.5 percent. The Pensacola metro area has experienced seven consecutive months of positive annual job growth. Additionally, the unemployment rate in the Pensacola metro area declined by 1.3 percentage points over the year, from 9.0 percent in January 2012 to 7.7 percent in January 2013.
Governor Scott said, "Everything we do is geared towards job creation and today we have more proof that IT'S WORKING. The area's positive job growth rate is further proof that the steps we're taking to create jobs and opportunities for Florida families is working. Statewide, we've added more than 280,000 private sector jobs over the last two years, which means we're providing hundreds of thousands of opportunities for families across the Sunshine State to achieve the American Dream."
The Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent MSA created 4,000 new jobs over the year and its job growth rate of 2.5 percent exceeded the state rate of 1.8 percent during the same time period. The Pensacola metro area led all areas in Florida in over-the-year percentage growth in trade, transportation, and utilities (+6.1 percent). These numbers are not seasonally adjusted.
The Pensacola metro area showed an increase in online job demand in February 2013, with demand for STEM occupations growing by more than 36 percent over the year (not seasonally adjusted). STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
Foreclosures in the Pensacola metro area were down 32.2 percent over the month and down 11.0 percent over the year in January 2013. Housing starts in the Pensacola Metro area were up 5.0 percent over the month and up 92.2 percent over the year in January 2013 (not seasonally adjusted).
Also in February, Workforce Escarosa along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards reported more than 38,000 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 11,034 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2012, more than 426,000 Floridians were placed in jobs, with nearly 111,173 former claimants finding employment.
Florida's unemployment rate decreased to 7.8 percent, down from the revised December 2012 rate of 7.9 percent and the lowest since November 2008 (seasonally adjusted). The state experienced an increase of 14,700 private sector jobs over the month. This increase brings the total number of private sector jobs created since December 2010 to 282,200 (seasonally adjusted).
