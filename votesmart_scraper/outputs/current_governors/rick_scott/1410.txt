Hi. This is Governor Rick Scott.
This week, I announced my decision to reject the Obama Administration's plan to partially-fund costly high-speed rail from Tampa to Orlando.
My decision to reject the project comes down to three main economic realities:
First -- capital cost overruns could put Florida taxpayers on the hook for an additional 3-billion-dollars.
Second -- overly-optimistic projections about ridership and revenue would burden Florida taxpayers in excess of 300-million-dollars over 10 years.
Finally -- if the project becomes too costly and is shut down, Florida would have to return 2.4-billion-dollars to D.C.
This federal high-speed rail program is not the answer to Florida's economic recovery.
We must invest where we will get a return for the shareholders -- Florida's taxpayers. We should focus on improving our ports, rail system and highways to handle the increased shipping volume that will result when the Panama Canal is expanded, and when free-trade-agreements with Colombia and Panama are ratified.
I believe when you reduce government's reach and hold that government accountable, you create an environment where the economy can flourish. When you reduce taxes and put money back in the hands of hardworking Floridians and businesses, that money will be spent on creating private sector jobs
The budget proposal I sent to the legislature reduces the size and scope of government, reduces the costs of government, and passes savings on to taxpayers. I believe that's the answer to Florida's economic recovery.
Let's get to work!
