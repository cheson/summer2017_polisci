Statement from Governor Rick Scott Regarding the Passover Holiday
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: April 18, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"As Floridians of the Jewish faith gather with family and friends to observe Passover, it is a time to reflect on the great gift of freedom God has given to every man and woman. This eight-day observance honors the historic emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt.
"While celebrating this special holiday, it is important to remember the brave military men and women who are overseas protecting the freedom we all enjoy. Let us also pray for their safe return home.
"As the Passover holiday begins today at sundown, I offer best wishes for a Happy Passover to the Jewish families in Florida from my family and Lt. Governor Carroll's family."
