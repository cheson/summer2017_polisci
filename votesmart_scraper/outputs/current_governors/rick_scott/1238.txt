Job statistics released today by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity show Florida's unemployment rate for March 2012 declined from 9.4 to 9.0 -- the largest monthly unemployment rate drop in 20 years, since 1992. Florida added 10,800 jobs in March and more than 100,000 private sector jobs have been created since Governor Scott took office.
Governor Scott issued the following statement regarding Florida's unemployment rate heading in the right direction:
"The largest monthly unemployment rate decline in 20 years is a milestone all Floridians can celebrate. This news comes on the heels of significant steps taken this week to make Florida the best state in the nation to live and do business. I signed Florida's education budget into law this week, with $1 billion new state education funding, and recently signed my 2012 Job Creation and Economic Growth Agenda, which lowers taxes and creates a competitive advantage for Florida businesses.
"Florida's unemployment rate is declining at a much faster rate than the national unemployment rate. Clearly, we're doing the right things to get our economy growing in Florida. I'm going to continue doing everything in my power to make Florida the number one state in the country for job growth."
