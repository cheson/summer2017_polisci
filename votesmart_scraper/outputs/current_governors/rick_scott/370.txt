Location: Lexington, KY

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced 1st Choice Aerospace's creation of 40 new jobs in Miramar, Florida. 1st Choice Aerospace chose to expand in Florida instead of at their Kentucky location. The company specializes in repairing pneumatics, crew seats, O2, fuel, cargo, and waste systems for commercial, cargo, and military aircrafts. 1st Choice Aerospace also plans to make a capital investment of more than $7 million in the local community.
Governor Scott said, "Today I'm proud to announce 1st Choice Aerospace's creation of 40 new jobs in Miramar. While 1st Choice Aerospace had the opportunity to expand in Kentucky, they ultimately chose Florida as the best place to grow their business. As a right-to-work state with zero personal income tax and low corporate tax rates, it is clear why 1st Choice picked Florida over Kentucky. I look forward to meeting with more companies today and tomorrow to encourage them to move and expand in Florida."
Chris Yeazel, Owner, 1st Choice Aerospace said, "We are extremely excited to announce our expansion plans in Miramar, Florida. We are pleased with the additional capacity and global outreach that this strategic location will afford us, allowing us to further accommodate our customers' needs and execute on them. With the business friendly atmosphere and the aviation talent available in South Florida, we are poised for significant growth over the next 36 months."
