Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Sept. 8, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"Today we remember the nearly 3,000 Americans who were killed on September 11, 2001, and the families whose lives were instantly changed by the loss of a loved one at the hands of senseless acts of terrorism.
"While we pause to reflect on one of the darkest days in American history, it is also marked by powerful heroic deeds reflecting the enduring spirit of our nation in times of tragedy. We recognize the brave acts of our civilian and military first responders and emergency personnel for their immediate and courageous actions in the aftermath. While we will never forget the unjust attacks that happened on our soil, we are reminded of the renewed patriotism that spread across our country.
"Today is also a time to acknowledge the current members of our Armed Forces who are tirelessly defending the very freedoms that provoked the attacks that day. We admire their commitment to fighting the global war on terror and pray they all return home safely.
"We also recognize all veterans who have served our nation in times of war and peace. They too have sacrificed and we are incredibly thankful for those who choose to selflessly risk their lives each day to protect us.
"On this solemn 10-year anniversary, Ann and I join all Floridians in honoring those who lost their lives that day and remembering the exceptional freedoms every American enjoys today."
