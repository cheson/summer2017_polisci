Army Corps to Decrease Lake Okeechobee Flows Following Gov. Scott's Emergency Declaration
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: June 30, 2016
Location: Orlando, FL

Today, following Governor Scott's emergency declaration in St. Lucie and Martin Counties, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Jacksonville District announced they will reduce the amount of water flowing from Lake Okeechobee into local waterways and estuaries beginning this weekend. Governor Scott expanded the emergency declaration to also include Lee and Palm Beach Counties.
Governor Scott said, "I appreciate the quick response of the Army Corps to reduce discharges from Lake Okeechobee, which will bring much needed relief to Martin, St. Lucie, Lee and Palm Beach Counties. While this is an important first step, we cannot lose focus on the need for the federal government to immediately fund repairs to the Herbert Hoover Dike so a long term solution can be achieved. Today, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity will also immediately activate a virtual business emergency operations center to assess businesses impacted by algal blooms. Florida remains committed to using every available resource to address the needs of these communities following yesterday's emergency declaration."
DEO's program will begin to survey businesses affected by the water releases and share the results with various state and local agencies to implement appropriate disaster relief programs. Affected businesses should complete a Business Damage Assessment survey that will be used to determine which emergency support programs might be beneficial to aid recovery efforts in the area. Local and state officials will use this information to provide any needed assistance programs.
