Governor Scott Transcript:
"You know right now, this is the first day of sequestration. I don't believe Congress or the President should continue to get paid while they haven't solved this problem. We've had to balance our budget in our state. We've had to watch how we spend money. We've had to live within our means. And we didn't do it with a meat cleaver; we did it with a scalpel. We watched what we could do agency by agency. The federal government needs to do the same thing. They should not be paid while they don't solve this problem."
