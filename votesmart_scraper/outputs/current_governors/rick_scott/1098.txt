Governor Rick Scott today announced that 32,400 private-sector jobs were created in Florida last month and the state's March 2013 unemployment rate decreased 0.3 percentage points to 7.5 percent. This is Florida's lowest unemployment rate since October 2008 and the second largest drop in the nation as of February.
Governor Scott said, "It is great news that our unemployment rate is below the national average at 7.5 percent and that we created more than 32,000 jobs in March. In a little over two years since I've taken office, we've created more than 320,000 private sector jobs -- and we are now closing in on the halfway point to our goal of creating 700,000 jobs in seven years. These numbers prove that IT'S WORKING in Florida and our families have opportunities to live their version of the American Dream in the Sunshine State. In Florida, our economy is turning around because we focus every day on creating new jobs for our families."
Governor Scott made today's announcement at Pelican Wire Co., a manufacturing company in Naples that was just named the Southwest Florida Manufacturer of the Year last week. Pelican Wire employs 60 people and manufactures wire used in electrical heating applications in aerospace, medical and other industries.
Over the month, the state experienced an increase of 32,400 private-sector jobs, meaning that 32,400 Floridians have been placed in new jobs and are earning wages. Florida's job growth rate is faster both over the month and over the year than the nation. Since Dec. 2010, Florida has added a total of 321,700 private-sector jobs.
