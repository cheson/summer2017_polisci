Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement in response to remarks from Jesse Jackson who yesterday called Florida "the Selma of our time." Jackson has also referred to Florida as the "Apartheid State."
Governor Rick Scott said, "Jesse Jackson owes every Floridian an apology for his reckless and divisive comments. It is unfortunate that he would come to Florida to insult Floridians and divide our state at a time when we are striving for unity and healing. Floridians are a strong, resilient people. We are fortunate to live in a great state where all Floridians enjoy opportunities to get a great job and a world-class education."
