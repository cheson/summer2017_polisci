This week, I visited northwest Florida one year after the oil spill. I joined the cabinet on a fishing tournament and caught a 40-inch red fish on my first cast! I had to throw it back because it was too big.
I'm making sure everyone knows that the fishing is great, the seafood is delicious and safe, and our beaches are among the best in the world.
Together with visit Florida and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, we announced plans to boost tourism.
Part of that includes announcements that Florida will have two free-fishing weekends in June, an extended bay scallop season, and half-off state park admission during mother's day and father's day weekends this year.
You elected me to turn Florida's economy around.
An important part of making that happen is my plan to reduce taxes for businesses so Florida companies can be more competitive and free up private-sector money that can be used to create jobs.
I also campaigned on reducing property taxes to put more money back in your pocket.
I will not allow special interests to hijack your tax dollars and squander the opportunity to fix our economy. Please join me in calling on both the house and senate to reduce taxes for businesses and property owners so we can get Florida back on track.
