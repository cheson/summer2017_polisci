Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that he will propose $8.5 million for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to fund a variety of enhancements for Florida's crime laboratories. This includes funding for lab equipment, DNA database upgrades, and crime scene vehicles, which will reduce the turnaround time for processing evidence, including rape kits.
Governor Scott said, "The $8.5 million investment we are announcing today is critical to giving innocent victims the answers they rightfully deserve, including the thousands of women who have been victims to absolutely horrific, violent crimes. I look forward to working with the Legislature and Attorney General Pam Bondi this upcoming legislative session as we continue to make our state safe for all families."
