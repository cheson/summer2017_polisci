By: Rick Scott Pam Bondi
Date: July 30, 2015
Location: Tampa, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott highlighted efforts Florida is taking to combat human trafficking and help victims of these horrendous crimes. Governor Scott ceremonially signed four bills that raises awareness of the signs of human trafficking, protects survivors from further exploitation, and establishes harsher punishment against perpetrators. Last week, the Governor also held a bill signing ceremony in Miami.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Our goal is to end all forms of human trafficking present in Florida and to protect our state's most vulnerable citizens. I am honored to join many advocates in the Tampa area today to sign legislation against human trafficking and provide funding for more safe houses in Florida. By working together, we can continue to shine a light on this crime so every person trapped by any form of exploitation is rescued and restored."
Attorney General Pam Bondi said, "I want to thank Governor Scott for his efforts to stop human trafficking in Florida and for the additional funds in this year's budget to help victims of this abhorrent crime heal in a safe environment. The Statewide Council on Human Trafficking will continue to work with Governor Scott and state lawmakers to make Florida a zero-tolerance state for human trafficking."
