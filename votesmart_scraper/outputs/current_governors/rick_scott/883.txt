Today, Governor Rick Scott applauded the Florida Senate for unanimously passing SB 156, which cuts taxes by nearly $400 million by rolling back fees on motor vehicle registrations. The proposal is a major part of the Governor's "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget."
Governor Scott said, "I want to thank Senate President Don Gaetz, Senator Joe Negron and members of the Florida Senate for their unanimous support to roll back the 2009 tax increase on vehicle registrations. This tax cut will let families keep nearly $400 million of their hard-earned money in their own pockets. It's critical to our "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget,' which cuts taxes, pays down debt, and cuts government waste. Today's vote is great news, and we'll continue working with the Legislature to let families keep more of their hard-earned dollars."
