Governor Scott: Florida's Private Sector Grew Faster Than All Large States in May
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: July 1, 2016
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida businesses had the highest annual private-sector job growth rate of the 10 most populous states in May. Florida's private-sector job growth rate of 3.4 percent is also significantly higher than the nation's, which is at 1.9 percent.
Governor Scott said, "Florida's job growth rate is growing 79% faster than the nation and our labor force has increased by more than double the national rate. With the recent expansion of the Panama Canal, Florida is the gateway to Latin American and undoubtedly the global leader for trade. While other states are losing jobs and experiencing rising unemployment rates, we look forward to growing jobs and bringing new opportunities for Florida families."
Six of the 10 most populous states -- Illinois, North Carolina, Texas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York -- experienced a monthly decline in employment numbers. This is the 13th consecutive month that Florida has created more private-sector jobs over the year than Texas. Florida created 239,000 jobs over the past year, while Texas created only 135,500 jobs.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Cissy Proctor said, "Florida businesses are growing faster than those in other states because we have prioritized cutting taxes, reducing burdensome and unnecessary regulation and fostering a competitive business environment. As the best place in the nation to start or grow a business, people know that Florida is a place to thrive."
Since December 2010, Florida businesses have created 1,118,200 private-sector jobs. In May, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent, Florida's lowest rate in more than eight years.
