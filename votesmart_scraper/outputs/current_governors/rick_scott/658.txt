Statement

Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement regarding Florida officially becoming the third most populous state in the nation.
Governor Scott said, "Today's news of Florida officially becoming the third most populous state is exciting. As the holiday season approaches, we have learned in the last week that Florida businesses have added over 715,000 private-sector jobs in less than four years, far surpassing our goal to create 700,000 jobs in seven years. Our unemployment rate of 5.8 percent is also the lowest since 2008, and now we are overtaking New York as the third most populous state. Florida is on the way to become the number one destination for jobs and we continue to be the best place to live, work and raise a family. I look forward to more people and more job creators moving to Florida in the near future."
