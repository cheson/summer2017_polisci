Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement on the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee approving new sanctions on Venezuelan officials.
Governor Scott said, "I commend the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations for moving forward on new sanctions for Venezuelan officials that have violated the human rights of students who are protesting peacefully for freedom. Now it's time for the Obama administration to stop dragging their feet and send a clear message to the Maduro regime that they will face consequences if they continue to repress freedom fighters."
