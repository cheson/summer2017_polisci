Governor Rick Scott Lifts Emergency Rule for APD
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: April 14, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Rick Scott today announced an agreement with the House and Senate that would provide an infusion of cash that will prevent the Agency for Persons with Disabilities from discontinuing services.
"I thank Senate President Mike Haridopolos and House Speaker Dean Cannon for joining me to protect the community APD serves, and I applaud the hard work of the staff at APD for finding a solution to this problem," Governor Scott stated. "After years of deficit spending that put these services at risk, I'm glad that we're taking steps to finally bring responsible financial management to this agency and the people they serve."
After an Inspector General report disclosed that the agency would likely run out of cash to pay for needed services in early May due to an unprecedented $174 million budget shortfall, Governor Scott issued an emergency order stretching funds through the end of the fiscal year to avoid any cutoff of services.
The Governor's Office worked closely with the Legislature to find a way to provide immediate funding so that the Emergency Order could be lifted and to find a long term solution to the problem. Governor Scott also continues to work with the Legislature and members of the disability community to develop strategies to prevent future shortfalls in APD's budget.
Today's deal lifts a hold on approximately $30 million that will cover the agency's provider costs through the end of the fiscal year.
