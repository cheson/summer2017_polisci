Florida Governor Rick Scott made the following statement today in response to the House Democratic leadership's support of key tax cuts in the "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget."
Governor Rick Scott said, "I welcome the support of Florida House Minority Leader Perry Thurston and House Democratic leadership to return hundreds of millions of dollars in vehicle registration fees to Florida's families. This is a great first step in returning money to hard-working Floridians. We are committed to return $500 million to Florida families this year as part of our "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget,' which includes undoing the 54 percent tax increase families saw in 2009 to register their motor vehicles. This has never been government's money and we are happy to have the support of our colleagues in the legislature."
