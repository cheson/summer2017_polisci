Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that the Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall metro area gained the second-highest number of jobs in February 2014 among all metro areas in Florida compared to a year ago with 30,400 new jobs. The area's unemployment rate has declined by 2.3 percentage points over the year, from 9.0 percent in February 2013 to 6.7 percent in February 2014.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today's news that 30,400 jobs were created in the Miami area over the year is a huge win for Florida families. Let's keep working on building an opportunity economy in South Florida where businesses can thrive and grow."
Nine of the ten major industry sectors gained jobs over the year in February 2014 in the Miami metro area, with only the government sector showing a decline. The industries with the largest job gains over the year were in trade, transportation, and utilities with 9,200 new jobs, professional and business services with 5,500 jobs, leisure and hospitality with 4,000 new jobs, and education and health services 3,300 new jobs.
The Miami metro area had the third-highest online job demand in Florida in February 2014 with 31,430 job openings and had the third-highest number of openings for STEM occupations in February 2014 with 6,675 online ads. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In February, CareerSource South Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 37,900 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 9,620 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, more than 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
Florida's statewide unemployment rate for February 2014 was 6.2 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in the state since June 2008. The rate held steady to the revised January 2014 rate of 6.2 percent. Florida's statewide unemployment rate has been below the national unemployment rate since August 2013, which was 6.7 percent in February 2014. Since December 2010, Florida has created 540,700 private sector jobs.
