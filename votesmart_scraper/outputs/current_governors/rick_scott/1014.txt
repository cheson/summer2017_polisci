Location: Tallahasse, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott and the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced a saltwater license-free fishing day for September 1. On this day, Florida residents and visitors can experience Florida's unique saltwater fishing opportunities first hand without being required to have a recreational saltwater fishing license.
Governor Scott said, "The license-free fishing day on September 1is a great way for families to enjoy Florida's incredible saltwater fishing opportunities during the Labor Day holiday. Florida is the Fishing Capital of the World and this license-free weekend is a great opportunity to introduce friends and family who may have never experienced Florida saltwater fishing to enjoy the Sunshine States' bountiful waters and historic fishing communities."
License-free fishing days, including freshwater days, were held earlier this year on April 13 and June 8 for freshwater and June 1 for saltwater. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) will consider adding four additional license-free fishing days to the calendar at the Sept. 5 meeting in Pensacola. If approved, there will be two more saltwater and two more freshwater license-free fishing days before the end of 2013. All other regulations still apply.
An annual license for residents can be purchased at 1-888-FISH-Florida or at License.MyFWC.com. All fishing license fees are used to support Florida fish and wildlife conservation and help attain additional funding for Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration projects.
All bag limits, seasons and size restrictions apply on these dates. For fishing tips, locations and rules, visit MyFWC.com/Fishing.
