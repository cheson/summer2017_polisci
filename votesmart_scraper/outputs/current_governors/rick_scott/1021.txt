Today, Governor Rick Scott highlighted the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area's (MSA) creation of 23,200 new jobs over the year, the second highest number of nonagricultural jobs gained among all metro areas in the state in July 2013. The Orlando MSA's unemployment rate declined by 2.0 percentage points over the year, from 8.9 percent in July 2012 to 6.9 percent in Florida in July 2013. Since December 2010, the metro area's unemployment rate has declined 4.0 percentage points from 10.9 percent.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today is great news for families in the Orlando area. With the addition of over 23,200 new jobs over the year and an unemployment rate four percentage points lower than December 2010, it is clear that it's working in Florida."
In July 2013, the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford MSA led all metro areas in Florida in job gains over the year in leisure and hospitality with 8,400 new jobs and was second in the state in education and health services with 4,100 jobs created.
The Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford MSA had the second highest online job demand in Florida in July 2013 with 34,306 openings and also ranked number two in STEM overall demand in the state with 7,319 openings. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
Housing starts in the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford MSA also increased by 52.1 percent over the year in June 2013 compared to a year ago.
In July, Workforce Central Florida along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards reported more than 38,800 Floridians were placed in jobs. This represents an increase of more than 13,300 placements over the year from July 2012, a 52 percent increase. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 10,902 previously received Reemployment Assistance.
With the addition of 35,400 private sector jobs over the month, Florida has experienced positive annual job growth now for 36 consecutive months. This adds up to 369,100 new private sector jobs created in Florida since December 2010.
Since Governor Scott took office, Florida's statewide unemployment rate has dropped four percentage points, from a rate of 11.1 percent to July's rate of 7.1 percent. In the same timeframe, the national unemployment rate has dropped 1.9 percentage points, demonstrating Florida's improving economic climate continues to outpace the national recovery. Florida's unemployment rate has now declined year-over-year for 33 consecutive months.
