I had a great week. I did my second "Let's Get to Work' Day at Audubon Park Elementary School. I got to do what I did when I was in middle school. My parents couldn't afford to buy me lunch, so I worked half of my lunch break to earn lunch. It was a lot better than the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I always had to eat. But I worked with a great group of people this week. Marsha runs the cafeteria there, and I think the school has about 1100 students.
I helped prepare breakfast and lunch, and I also served breakfast and lunch. I got to meet lots of the students and teachers. I had a great time. Afterwards my wife and I got to visit some classrooms and see all of the new technology schools are using and how committed these kids are to learning. They're great students, great teachers, great parents. It was worthwhile to do it, and I got to hear lots of stories about the things that people are dealing with.
Also, I traveled to Flagler and St. Johns counties to meet with a variety of business and civic leaders to understand the issues they're dealing with and where the state can be helpful to make sure we create more jobs in Florida.
I think about my job: one, I have to make sure kids have a chance to get a great education. That helped me. Two, make sure everyone has a chance to get a job. That helped me and I figured my experience is pretty similar to most families. Three, I have to be sure to keep the cost of living as low as possible.
It was a great week. We've generated 65,000 jobs so far this year, but we have to keep it up. We still have a lot of people out of work. Have a great week.
