Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida businesses have created 917,400 private-sector jobs since December 2010 and the state's unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent. In July 2015, 16,900 private-sector jobs were created across Florida. Florida's annual private-sector job growth rate, now at 3.8 percent, has exceeded that of the nation since April 2012. Governor Scott made the announcement at Haynes Corporation, a manufacturer of precision diesel fuel injection systems that has created nearly 50 new jobs in Naples since 2011.
Governor Rick Scott said, "I am excited to announce that more than 917,400 private-sector jobs have been created in our state since December 2010. Thousands of Floridians are finding new opportunities to find a great job, provide for their loved ones, and achieve their dreams in our great state. We are working hard to continue cutting taxes and reducing regulations so more businesses will grow and expand here."
Florida's unemployment rate decreased by 0.6 percentage point over the year from the July 2014 rate of 6.0 percent, down to 5.4 percent in July 2015. The July 2015 unemployment rate is the lowest since March 2008 when it was also 5.4 percent. Florida's unemployment rate has declined by 5.3 percentage points since December 2010.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "In July, Florida saw another strong month of job creation. We continue to outpace national growth, and our business climate continues to be one of the best in the nation."
