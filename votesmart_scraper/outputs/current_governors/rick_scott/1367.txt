his week, I signed into law a budget that meets my three CORE principles. It reduces the size of government, holds government accountable and provides tax relief to individuals and businesses.
I campaigned on making the tough choices necessary to turn our economy around. I commend the Legislature for sending me a budget that met my priorities. They had a tough task, given the nearly $4 billion budget shortfall our state faced this year
As promised I went through the budget, line by line, and found $615 million additional savings before I signed it into law.
Now, with these funds to work with, I call on our House and Senate leaders to redirect some of those vetoed special interest dollars into elementary, middle and high school education.
I am confident that all of us can agree that school funding is far more important than spending those dollars on alligator marketing, or boat racing, or anything else that the Tallahassee insiders seem to think is so important.
Let's turn these short-sighted, frivolous spending programs into long-term investments in the future of Florida's workforce.
