Governor Rick Scott today praised the members of the Senate Committee on Judiciary for following the lead of the Senate Committee on Health Policy after they unanimously voted to pass SB 1636 -- legislation to protect lives and rights of babies who are born alive after unsuccessful abortions.
Governor Scott said, "It is our responsibility, as leaders in this state to stand up for those most vulnerable in society. When an injured newborn child is left helpless on the operating table, we owe it to that child to do everything in our power to save his or her life. I applaud the sponsor, Senator Anitere Flores, and other members of the Senate Committee on Judiciary for passing this bill to affirm the rights of the most vulnerable."
The Senate Committee on Judiciary passed the legislation today by a vote of 9-0. The bill now goes to the Senate Budget Committee on Appropriations. The House version, HB 1129 was placed on the House calendar under 2nd reading.
