Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement for Rosh Hashanah:
"Ann and I are excited to join our Jewish friends throughout Florida in celebrating Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. During this sacred time, we pray for peace and security in Israel and all those who are being affected by terrorism across the world. This year, our state has had many blessings and we also reflect on those moments of sorrow. While many of our brave men and women in uniform are defending our nation, we pray for them and all those in harm's way.
"Florida is home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the nation, and we wish all those celebrating a happy and healthy new year. L'shanah tova!"
