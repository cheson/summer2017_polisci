overnor Rick Scott today announced that in June 2013, Florida created more jobs and the statewide unemployment rate remained below the national average. At 7.1 percent, the state's May and June unemployment rates were the lowest since September 2008. Florida's unemployment rate remains below the national average of 7.6 percent for the fourth consecutive month. During the month of June, 2,300 private sector jobs were added, for a total of more than 333,000 private sector jobs since December 2010.
Governor Scott said, "Florida's June unemployment rate of 7.1 percent will continue to contribute to the long-term trend of decreasing unemployment throughout the state. The creation of more than 2,000 private sector jobs last month is further evidence of the state's continuing economic recovery. As Florida families are getting back to work, it is clear that IT'S WORKING."
Since December 2010, Florida's statewide unemployment rate has dropped four percentage points, from a rate of 11.1 percent to June's rate of 7.1 percent. In the same timeframe, the national unemployment rate has dropped 1.7 percentage points, demonstrating Florida's improving economic climate continues to outpace the national recovery. Florida's unemployment rate has now declined year-over-year for 32 consecutive months.
