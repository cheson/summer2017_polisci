Governor Rick Scott today highlighted the state budget's investments in economic development efforts focused on creating jobs and opportunities for Florida families.
Governor Rick Scott said, "The priorities outlined in this budget will continue to make Florida the perfect climate for business. Florida's unemployment rate dropped faster than anywhere else in the country except one state and we've created more than 330,000 private sector jobs in the past two years. Our unemployment rate continues to decline and we learned last week that Florida is once again below the national average at 7.2 percent. But, our work is not done until every Floridian who wants a job gets one.
"In the last three years, the economic benefit for completed incentive contracts was 86 percent higher than projected. It's obviously working. In the last two years, Enterprise Florida announced over 300 new projects that will result in 74 percent more jobs. This is great news for Florida families."
The Florida Families First budget supports Governor Scott's commitment to continued economic and job growth.
-Quick Response Training: The budget provides $12 million for skills training offered to companies that are creating and training new high-skill/high-wage jobs in the state either by expanding their current workforce or relocating their company to the state.
-Economic Development Incentives: The Florida Families First budget provides $45.5 million for economic development tools and incentives to promote job creation in Florida. Additionally, uncommitted funds from current year appropriations will be deployed to increase funding for this area.
