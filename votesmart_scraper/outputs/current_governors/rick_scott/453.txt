Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: July 9, 2015
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Rick Scott today signed Executive Order 15-134 which includes measures to increase oversight, accountability and efficiency at the Florida Department of Corrections. The measures included in this Executive Order expand upon reforms and initiatives previously implemented by Secretary Julie Jones since the beginning of the year.
Governor Scott said, "This Executive Order empowers Secretary Jones to improve safety in our correctional facilities, enhance services to reduce recidivism, and address the growing needs of inmates that require additional mental health services. From the programs outlined in this Executive Order, the Department of Corrections will be able to better identify what works and what doesn't work, and apply lessons learned across the state's entire correctional system. This Executive Order will also empower our social service agencies to work together to understand how mental health needs are addressed across state and local levels. This collaboration will allow Florida to develop a more holistic approach for investing taxpayer funds to meet the mental health needs of our communities, while keeping Floridians safe."
Secretary Julie Jones said, "The directives set forth in Executive Order 15-134 perfectly reflect Florida's commitment to expand policy and procedure focused on the safety and rehabilitation of our inmates. I applaud Governor Scott's leadership and look forward to continuing to work together to transform the Florida Department of Corrections."
The Executive Order takes three major steps:
* Calls for an independent audit of the agency's operations to be conducted by the National Institute of Corrections and the Association of State Correctional Administrators;
* Establishes two prototype institutions focused on identifying and measuring enhanced operational methods; and
* Creates a partnership between the Department of Corrections, the Department of Juvenile Justice and the Department of Children and Families to establish best management practices in order to improve mental health services.
