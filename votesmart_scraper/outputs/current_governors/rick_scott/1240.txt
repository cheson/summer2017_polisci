Today we remember the millions of victims of the Holocaust and while many years have passed, our memory of all those who suffered will never weaken.
On this day, we also recognize the great freedoms we all have in the United States and the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces who risk their lives to ensure democracy prevails.
It is critical that we educate our children and future generations about the atrocities of the past and the importance of never forgetting acts of injustice. We must stand firm against all forms of hate, evil and violence, and Ann and I join all Floridians in reflecting on this day of remembrance.
