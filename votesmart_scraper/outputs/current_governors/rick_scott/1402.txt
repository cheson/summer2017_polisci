This week I gave my first state of the state address, urging the Florida Legislature to not allow special interests to persuade them to turn their backs on you -- the people who elected them. Like me, many of them were sent to Tallahassee to reduce the size of state government, lower taxes and eliminate regulation.
While the legislative session that began this week is a regular session, it is -- in many ways -- an emergency session. This week, we learned that January's unemployment rate remains unacceptably high -- at 11.9 percent.
For the 1.1 million Floridians out of work, it is an emergency. We must make Florida the No. 1 state for business and get people back to work. I am completely committed to this mission. We have to reduce the size, scope and cost of government, and return tax savings to tax payers.
We must modernize the pension of state workers so that it is fair to the taxpayers of Florida. We must have an education system that focuses on individual student learning, recruits and promotes the best teachers and encourages schools to outperform other schools in order to attract students.
I look forward to working with the legislature during the coming weeks to make Florida the best place to live, work and play.
Let's get to work.
