Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott applauded the announcement of an agreement between Miami-Dade County and Royal Caribbean to build a brand new cruise terminal at PortMiami.
Governor Scott said, "Florida is undoubtedly the global leader for trade and we are excited that Royal Caribbean chose PortMiami for their brand new cruise terminal which is expected to create 4,000 jobs in South Florida. Florida is home to the top three cruise ports in the world, and PortMiami set another world record of 4.9 million cruise passengers in 2015. Florida's world-class ports helped bring a record 105 million tourists to our state last year and supported more than one million travel-related jobs. With the recent expansion of the Panama Canal, we expect more opportunities at Florida ports and look forward to welcoming more visitors and adding more jobs with great projects like this one from Royal Caribbean."
