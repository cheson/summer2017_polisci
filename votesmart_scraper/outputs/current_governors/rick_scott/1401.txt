"I commend the House for taking the lead on reforming the unemployment compensation system. The House's legislation reduces taxes on Florida businesses and ensures that we have the necessary safety net for those who are out of work. By linking the number of weeks a person can receive benefits to the state's unemployment levels, we are creating an environment for Florida's job creators to get the state back to work. I want to thank Representative Holder, House Majority Leader Lopez-Cantera, and Speaker Cannon for their prompt attention to this issue, and I look forward to the Senate tackling unemployment compensation as soon as possible."
