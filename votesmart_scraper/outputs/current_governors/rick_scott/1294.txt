Location: Jerusalem, Israel

While leading a trade mission to Israel this week, Governor Rick Scott visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Accompanied by members of the delegation, Governor Scott was greeted by Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, the Rabbi of the Western Wall and the holy sites of Israel. During his visit to the Western Wall, Governor Scott also got a tour of the Kotel Tunnels and participated in Sabbath prayers.
"It was an honor to visit the Western Wall this week. I was incredibly moved to have the opportunity to pray at such a holy and significant site," said Governor Scott. "The Jewish community makes invaluable contributions to our state and nation's spiritual diversity, and it has been a humbling experience to visit this and other important sites to their faith and history."
Last Thursday, Governor Scott and a delegation of more than 30 senior Florida business and government leaders embarked on a trade mission to further strengthen the mutually beneficial business and cultural ties between Israel and Florida. The Governor has been meeting with top Israeli business and government leaders in Jerusalem, Tel-Aviv and Beersheva that are interested in expanding into Florida and using the state as a platform for business in the United States and the Americas.
