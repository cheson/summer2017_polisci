Today, Governor Scott announced the number of available online job openings in Florida increased sharply in November 2012 compared to the previous November by 29,522 (+12.4 percent), for a total of 267,310 openings (seasonally adjusted). Additionally, the number of November 2012 job postings was an increase of more than 2,674 over October 2012.
Governor Scott said, "We've cut taxes and reduced regulations to grow jobs for Florida families, and the growth of online job openings is an important sign of Florida's growing economic strength. I've made job creation for Florida families my top priority, and while our work isn't done this is a step in the right direction."
Florida's labor demand, measured by online advertised vacancies, bottomed out in April 2009 at 151,251 ads and has increased by 116,059 openings (+77 percent) since then.
According to the Help Wanted OnLine data series from The Conference Board, online job demand was strongest in the large metro cities, led by Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville. Among the cities with the most online ads, the highest percentage gain over-the-year in online ads was in Naples (+12.4 percent).
Major occupational groups with the most online ads in November 2012 were sales and related occupations; healthcare practitioners and technical occupations; office and administrative support occupations; and computer and mathematical occupations.
