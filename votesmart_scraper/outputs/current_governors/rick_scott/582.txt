Governor Rick Scott today announced that Florida businesses have created 807,100 private-sector jobs since December 2010. In February 2015, 14,900 private-sector jobs were created across Florida. Florida's annual private-sector job growth rate, now at 3.9 percent, has exceeded that of the nation since April 2012. Florida's unemployment rate for February 2015 was 5.6 percent, down from the January 2015 rate of 5.7 percent.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today's announcement of more than 807,000 new private-sector jobs since December 2010 is great news for Florida families. More than 14,000 jobs were created during the month of February alone, and more opportunities are becoming available for families each month. We know that a great job helps dreams come true in our state, and we will keep working to make Florida the best place in the world for families to succeed."
Florida's unemployment rate decreased by 0.9 percentage point over the year from the February 2014 rate of 6.5 percent, down now to 5.6 percent. Florida's labor force increased over the month and over the year in February. In February, Florida's annual labor force growth of 1.9 percent was more than double that of the nation's, with 0.8 percentage point annual growth. On an annual basis, Florida's labor force has increased for 60 consecutive months.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "February was another strong month for Florida's continually improving economy, with nearly 15,000 new private-sector jobs, growth in the labor force, steadily falling unemployment, and record job demand. These positive trends are evidence that Governor Scott's policies have spurred economic growth in the Sunshine State."
