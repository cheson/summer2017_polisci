At Blue Angels Elementary School today, Governor Rick Scott presented 22 schools in Escambia County with $1.4 million in school recognition funding.

Governor Scott said, "Florida teachers are doing a great job preparing our students for college and careers, and I am proud to recognize the hard work of the Escambia County school district by presenting them with $1.4 million in school recognition funding today. These funds will help provide Escambia county schools and teachers with resources they need to continue to build upon their success, and put Florida another step closer to providing our students with the best education system in the nation."
Escambia County Schools Superintendent Malcolm Thomas said, "Escambia County is proud to welcome Governor Scott's visit today and highlight the great successes of our twenty-two schools. Our students, teachers, and school staffs are working hard every day, and this recognition funding will play a big role in continuing our success as we continue our journey to excellence."
