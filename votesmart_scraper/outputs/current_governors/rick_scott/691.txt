Governor Rick Scott today announced that the number of online job openings in Florida increased in October 2014 compared to the previous October by 21,480 openings or 8.7 percent, for a total of 268,453 openings (seasonally adjusted), according to data released by Help Wanted Online. Job postings in Florida also increased over the month compared to September 2014 by 6,775 openings or 2.6 percent.
Governor Scott said, "October was another strong month for job demand in Florida with a total of 268,453 job openings posted online, which is an increase of 75 percent since 2009. Together we are creating an opportunity economy where more Floridians are able to get a job and provide for their families. This good news is just one of many indicators showing the positive turnaround in Florida's economy over the last few years, and together we have created more than 651,000 private-sector jobs since December 2010."
Florida's online job ads have increased by 115,669 openings, or 75.7 percent, since April 2009, when the number was the lowest, with 152,784 openings. According to the Help Wanted OnLine data series, job demand was highest in the large metro cities, led by Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Ft. Lauderdale. Among cities with the most openings, the highest percentage gain over the year was Pompano Beach with 40.2 percent growth.
Major occupational groups with the most online ads in October were sales and related occupations, healthcare practitioners and technical occupations, office and administrative support occupations, and computer and mathematical occupations.
DEO Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "October's online job demand of more than 268,000 online job vacancies is proof of Florida's continued economic resurgence. These job openings represent opportunities for individuals to provide for their families, work towards economic prosperity, and set the path towards their next great job."
