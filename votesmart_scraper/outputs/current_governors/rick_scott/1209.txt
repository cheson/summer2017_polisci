"This Independence Day, Americans will celebrate the birth of the United States of America. We are blessed to live in a country like no other, a country of liberty and freedom. One of the most remarkable traits of our great nation is the opportunity that Americans have to live freely, pursue their dreams and succeed. I have seen this demonstrated frequently as Governor when I travel the state and talk with business owners and hear their stories of determination and resolve as they work to succeed.
"As Americans, my wish is that we never take these opportunities for granted, and we give thanks to the men and women, both past and present, who have made the freedom and liberty we enjoy every day possible in our country.
"Today, I ask you to join me in honoring our servicemen and women. Because of their sacrifice, and the sacrifice of their families, we can enjoy this holiday, knowing that we are truly free.
"Ann and I wish everyone a safe and happy Independence Day. Let freedom ring!"
