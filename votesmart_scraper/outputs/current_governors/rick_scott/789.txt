Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) added 25,300 new jobs in June 2014 compared to a year ago, the third-highest number of new jobs among all metro areas in Florida. The unemployment rate in the Tampa metro area declined by 1.4 percentage points over the year, from 7.7 percent in June 2013 to 6.3 percent in June 2014.
Governor Scott said, "We're thrilled to continue to see both positive job growth and a decreasing unemployment rate in the Tampa area. With 25,300 new jobs in the area over the year, Tampa is creating an opportunity economy where more Floridians are able to find a job and support their family."
The industries with the largest gain in jobs over the year in the metro area were in professional and business services with 7,900 new jobs and trade, transportation, and utilities with 6,700 new jobs.
The Tampa Bay MSA was first among the state metro areas in online job demand in June 2014 with 43,123 openings. The metro area was also first in the state in demand for STEM occupations with 10,718 openings in June. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In June, CareerSource Tampa Bay, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 35,000 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 7,239 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
Florida created 36,900 private-sector jobs in June 2014, the single highest month of private-sector job creation since the Governor took office. Since December 2010, Florida has created 620,700 private sector jobs. Florida's statewide unemployment rate for June 2014 was 6.2 percent, down 1.2 percentage points from the June 2013 rate.
