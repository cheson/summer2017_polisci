This week Florida mourned the loss of police officers in St. Petersburg and in Miami. These senseless crimes are heartbreaking, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families. Please join me in showing gratitude for the men and women of law enforcement who risk their lives to protect ours.
During the past week, I continued my work to make sure Florida is the number-one state for job creation. I visited one of Florida's 14 public deepwater seaports -- the Port of Jacksonville. Florida's ports are an important part our state's economic engine.
I also visited the Publix Super Markets distribution center in Lakeland. While there, I toured a five-hundred-thousand square feet distribution center where goods are prepared for sale around the state.
Visiting businesses around the state reinforces why you elected me your Governor. It is about getting government out of the way, so that businesses can create jobs and get Florida back to work.
On February 7th, I will propose a budget to the Legislature that delivers on that promise. It will include tough choices and set important priorities. It will cut government spending, reduce the tax burden on families and businesses, and still meet critical needs of our state.
By focusing on these priorities, we will make Florida the best state to start or grow a business.
When the budget is announced, I invite you to stand with me. Tell the special interests that NOW is the time to cut spending and reduce taxes. Our mission to get Florida's economy back on track is just getting started.
Let's get to work.
