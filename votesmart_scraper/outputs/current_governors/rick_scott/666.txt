Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: Dec. 8, 2014
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that a record number of foster parents were recruited this year. From July 2013 -- June 2014, Florida recruited a record 1,463 newly-licensed foster homes, with an additional 576 in the last five months.
Governor Scott said, "As a proud father and grandfather, I am thankful that so many of Florida's families have opened their homes and hearts. Children are an incredible gift and it is very exciting to see what they accomplish."
To help address retention of foster parents and strengthen the partnership between child placing agencies and foster homes, Governor Scott signed legislative changes to support a Quality Parenting Initiative (QPI). QPI provides training and strategies to improve child safety, permanency and well-being for children who are placed in Florida's out-of-home care system.
