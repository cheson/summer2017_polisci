Unemployment analysis released today shows Florida's unemployment rate continuing to drop this month. In the same timeframe, the federal rate ticked up. The new rate, 10.8 percent, is the lowest in Florida since 2009.
"I remain focused on job creation, so it is great news that this trend is continuing in the right direction," said Governor Rick Scott. "With tax relief for property owners and elimination of taxes on about half of the businesses that currently pay, I believe we are on the path to getting Florida back to work."
