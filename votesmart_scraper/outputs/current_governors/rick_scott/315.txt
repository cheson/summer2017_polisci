Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: Dec. 1, 2015
Location: Tallahasse, FL

Gov. Rick Scott announced today that due to more Floridians finding jobs, Florida businesses will start paying lower reemployment taxes in January. The minimum tax rate will be cut more than 50 percent from the current rate of $16.80 per employee to $7.00 per employee in 2016.
Governor Scott said, "As more Floridians are finding the job opportunities they need to succeed and provide for their families, the cost of doing business in Florida keeps dropping. This dramatic reduction in taxes will be especially helpful for Florida's small businesses, and is one more reason that companies are choosing Florida as the best place to grow. We will continue to create a business-friendly environment to help diversify our economy so Florida can become first for jobs."
