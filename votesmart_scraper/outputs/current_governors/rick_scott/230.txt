Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott signed SB 636 which requires rape kits to be tested within 120 days of submission to a state crime lab. Governor Scott's Florida First budget also invests $10.7 million in Florida's crime laboratories to eliminate Florida's backlog of rape testing kits.
Governor Scott said "This legislation will provide thousands of women with a renewed sense of safety and closure as they heal from the horrific crime of rape. I am thankful for the hard work of Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Florida Legislature to make sure perpetrators are immediately brought to justice. This legislation will also help eliminate the backlog of rape testing kits in Florida and reduce future turnaround time for processing evidence. Our Florida First budget this year also invests a total of $10.7 million to ensure Florida's law enforcement personnel have the tools they need to keep all Floridians safe."
Attorney General Pam Bondi said "As a career prosecutor, I have seen first-hand the heartache caused by sexual assault, and this legislation is a significant step toward bringing more predators to justice and helping victims heal. I want to thank Governor Scott for signing this important public safety legislation today to help ensure future kits are tested expediently, and for investing millions of dollars to begin testing the thousands of unprocessed kits in our state."
FDLE Commissioner Swearingen said, "I appreciate the support of Governor Scott and lawmakers in funding all of FDLE's legislative forensics requests. FDLE is committed to providing quality forensic services within the 120 day timeframe ensuring victims receive timely results of sexual assault kits."
