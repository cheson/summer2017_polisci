Gov. Scott: Florida Added More Than 12,000 Private-Sector Jobs in June
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: July 17, 2015
Location: Orlando, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida businesses have created 896,900 private-sector jobs since December 2010, and the state's unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent- the lowest rate since March 2008. In June 2015, 12,200 private-sector jobs were created across Florida. Florida's annual private-sector job growth rate, up to 3.9 percent, has exceeded that of the nation since April 2012.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today's announcement of nearly 900,000 new private sector jobs in just four and a half years is great news. We have cut taxes 50 times -- including $400 million in tax cuts this year -- and we will keep working to create an environment where more businesses can expand and grow in Florida so families have more opportunities to succeed in the Sunshine State."
Governor Scott made the announcement at ODC Construction, a residential construction services company in Orlando. Since 2011, ODC Construction has created 200 new jobs, and currently employs 300 Floridians. The Orlando area gained more than 47,000 new jobs over the year in June 2015, the highest number of new jobs among all Florida metro areas for the 29th consecutive month.
Florida's unemployment rate for June 2015 was 5.5 percent, almost half of the December 2010 rate. Florida's unemployment rate decreased by 0.6 percentage point over the year from the June 2014 rate of 6.1 percent, down to 5.5 percent in June 2015. The June 2015 unemployment rate is the lowest since March 2008 when it was 5.4 percent. Florida's unemployment rate has declined by 5.2 percentage points since December 2010.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "The June economic numbers show that Florida's job market has continued its strong growth through the first half of 2015, with 110,400 private-sector jobs added since January 1. We are also growing jobs at a faster rate than the nation and all other large states. This economic resurgence is happening because employers and job seekers have renewed confidence in Florida's pro-growth policies and low taxes. The Scott Administration will continue to support these policies so that Florida will have the top performing economy in the nation."
