Today, Governor Rick Scott highlighted the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area's (MSA) for gaining the highest number of jobs in January 2014 among all metro areas in Florida compared to a year ago with 36,400 new jobs. The Orlando MSA's unemployment rate declined by 2.2 percentage points over the year, from 8.2 percent in January 2013 to 6.0 percent in January 2014.
Governor Rick Scott said, "With one of the fastest growing economies in our state and 36,400 new jobs over the year, Orlando is showing the world that Central Florida is open for business. Florida has added more than half a million private sector jobs statewide since December 2010 and our unemployment rate is down to 6.0 percent here in Orlando -- let's keep working to write more chapters in Florida's turnaround story like this."
In January 2014, the Orlando metro area gained the most jobs over the year in Florida among all metro areas. The industries with the largest job gains over the year were leisure and hospitality with 10,300 new jobs, trade, transportation, and utilities with 7,000 new jobs, and professional and business services with 6,800 new jobs.
Housing starts in the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford MSA were up by 28.2 percent over the year in January 2014 compared to a year ago. The Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford MSA had the second-highest online job demand in Florida in January 2014 with 26,686 openings and also ranked number two in STEM overall demand in the state with 6,474 openings. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In January, CareerSource Central Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 38,800 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 10,106 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, more than 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
Florida's statewide unemployment rate for January 2014 was 6.1 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in the state since June 2008. Florida's statewide unemployment rate has been below the national unemployment rate since August 2013, which was 6.6 percent in January. Since December 2010, Florida has gained 503,500 private sector jobs.
Every March, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases revised historical employment (jobs) and unemployment rates based on a benchmarking process to adjust the data. These benchmark revisions are mandated by BLS and take place this time every year in every state. The benchmark revisions represent an annual change in the level of employment or re-anchoring of survey estimates to actual employment counts from Reemployment Assistance tax records. This process also introduces new population inputs from the most recent Census and other revisions to economic data which leads to changes in the original estimates.
Employment data for February 2014 will be released on March 28, 2014. To view the January 2014 employment data visit www.floridajobs.org/labor-market-information/labor-market-information-press-releases/monthly-press-releases.
