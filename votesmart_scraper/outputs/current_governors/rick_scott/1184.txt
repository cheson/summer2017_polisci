Today, Governor Rick Scott announced a $2 million teacher professional training matching grant program at David Lawrence Jr. K-8 Center. This funding will be in Governor Scott's recommended budget for 2013-2014 and the competitive grant program will be matched by private sector investment and local investment in order to support Florida's teachers as they work to grow and improve in their field.
"The best way to strengthen our education system is to have a great teacher in every classroom and this $2 million investment in a competitive education grant program for teacher professional development is a major step toward that goal," said Governor Scott. "Given the importance of testing and measuring, we need teachers to have the support and the tools they need to ensure standards are met -- and this funding for their professional development will do just that."
In September, Governor Scott traveled to cities across Florida to speak with teachers, parents, students, administrators and unions listening to ideas about how to better prepare students for college and careers. One of the issues that was talked about was professional development opportunities for teachers to ensure they have the tools they need to become even better teachers.
