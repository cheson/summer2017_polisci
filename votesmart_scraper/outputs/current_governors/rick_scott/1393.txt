HIS WEEK I ANNOUNCED A STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE TO CRIMINAL DRUGS IN FLORIDA.
ILLEGAL DRUGS, AND CRIMINAL USE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, ARE RUINING LIVES AND THREATENING PUBLIC SAFETY.
FLORIDA'S LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE NATION. HOWEVER, OUR LOCAL SHERIFFS AND POLICE CHIEFS SIMPLY CANNOT CONTINUE TO TACKLE THIS MOUNTING ISSUE ALONE.
WITH SUPPORT FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI AND THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE WILL CONFRONT THIS SCOURGE.
TO THAT END, I UNVEILED THE STATEWIDE DRUG STRIKE FORCE. IT WILL EASE THE BURDEN ON LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BY PROVIDING INTELLIGENCE, ANALYTICAL, AND INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT.
THE NUMBERS PLAINLY SHOW THAT FLORIDA HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT DEMANDS A SERIOUS, COORDINATED RESPONSE. OUR LAW-ENFORCEMENT-DRIVEN SOLUTION SPECIFICALLY TARGETS THE HORRIFIC PROBLEMS DRUGS CAUSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
THANKS TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY FOR STANDING TOGETHER TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO THIS STATEWIDE DRUG STRIKE FORCE. WE ARE UNITED IN OUR MISSION TO PROTECT FLORIDIANS AND THOSE WHO VISIT OUR GREAT STATE.
