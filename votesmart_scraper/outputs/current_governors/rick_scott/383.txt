Today, Governor Scott made the following statement regarding the Journal of Commerce (JOC) report on the Top 10 Fastest Growing US Ports for Imports and Exports during the first-half of 2015. Four Florida Ports made it on the fastest growing export list with Miami and Palm Beach tied for #2, Everglades at #7 and JAXPORT at #8. Miami also made it on the Top 10 Fastest Growing import list, ranking at #4.
Governor Rick Scott said, "It's no surprise that Florida has four of the fastest growing ports in the nation. Our world class infrastructure allows goods to move efficiently across the world and we are continuing to set Florida apart in the global marketplace as a leader in exporting and importing products. While these rankings are great news, we want Florida to hold the number one spot among all U.S. ports and be the best place in the world to do business. We must remain competitive in the global marketplace and we will continue to make strategic investments into our ports, roads and bridges so that businesses choose Florida over other states."
