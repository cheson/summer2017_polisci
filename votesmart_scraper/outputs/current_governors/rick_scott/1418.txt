Governor Scott's Podcast -- 2/4/11
Statement

This week, a federal judge ruled Obamacare unconstitutional, as many of us predicted. This over-reaching law hurts small businesses, doctors, and patients -- and infringes on our freedom. To pay for Obamacare, the federal government enacted some of the largest tax hikes in our nation's history.
I call on President Obama and the federal government to immediately repeal the six tax increases that are part of Obamacare.
Furthermore, the federal government needs to roll back the eighteen new or higher taxes put into place to pay for this massive spending bill.
Next Monday I will announce my budget in Eustis in Lake County. This budget is in line with my commitment to change the way government does business. It cuts state spending, cuts taxes and holds government accountable.
In these tough economic times, there will be deep cuts. In fact, my budget will cut $5 billion in state spending while also cutting taxes. It will be one of the most fiscally responsible budgets in the nation.
In the days ahead, the special interests and those who support big-government solutions will attack my budget. They don't recognize -- as you and I do -- these times require a bold new path.
We MUST get the state's economy back on track. This requires less government spending and lower taxes. During these attacks, I ask you to stand with me. Let's tell them that enough is enough. Let's get to work.
