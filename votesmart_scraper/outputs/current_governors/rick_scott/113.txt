Gov. Scott: To Expedite Zika Testing, We Need More Resources from CDC
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: Sept. 14, 2016
Location: Washington, DC

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that following his request in August for additional lab support personnel to help the state expedite Zika testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing Florida with seven personnel to support testing and lab functions. In order to ensure pregnant women get results back faster, Governor Scott today is requesting even more support personnel from the CDC. Last week, the Florida Department of Health (DOH) also purchased additional lab equipment to help expedite Zika testing. On August 3rd, Governor Scott directed DOH to provide Zika testing to pregnant women at all county health departments at no cost. To date, more than 2,200 pregnant women have received a free Zika test and assessment through DOH county health departments.
Governor Scott said, "With more than 70 cases of locally acquired Zika in Florida, it is critically important that we continue to provide everyone, especially pregnant women, with test results as quickly as possible. While these additional personnel will help to expedite Zika testing, we know that there is an increasing demand for testing throughout our state and we must be prepared to respond. That is why today I am requesting the CDC to provide Florida with additional lab support personnel to aid in our testing efforts. I am hopeful the CDC will quickly fulfill this request as our state continues to do everything possible to protect pregnant women.
"Today, I will continue to meet with congressional leaders to discuss the need for immediate funding for Zika preparedness. I expect Congress and the president to address this national health issue by taking action now."
