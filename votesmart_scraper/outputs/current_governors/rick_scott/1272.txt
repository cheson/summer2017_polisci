Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott.
This week, I urged the House and the Senate to send me a bill that addresses auto insurance fraud in Florida. PIP fraudsters cause auto insurance premiums to skyrocket, and honest Floridians pay the price.
Floridians are fed up with being cheated by scammers who get a payday, while innocent citizens get stuck with the bill. Our broken no-fault system is a hidden billion-dollar tax on Floridians. It drags on our economy and slows growth, and we must take action to stop this fraud. We must lower the cost of living in our state. I am confident that the legislature will get this done.
Also this week, I joined business, military, veteran and workforce leaders during the annual Florida National Guard Day at the Capitol. Together we launched the Hiring Florida's Heroes campaign to connect our returning veterans with job opportunities in our state. Hiring Florida's Heroes is a smart move for businesses and the right thing to do for our veterans and their families.
If you are an employer interested in hiring a hero, please call 1-866-FLA-2345 or visit veterans.employflorida.com.
