Governor Scott: Job Openings In Florida Remain Strong
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: Jan. 11, 2013
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Scott announced the number of available online job openings in Florida increased in December 2012 compared to the previous December by 19,380 (+8.0 percent), for a total of 260,281 openings (seasonally adjusted).
Governor Rick Scott said, "In two years, the private sector has created more than 200,000 jobs, unemployment has dropped by 3 percentage points and Florida's economy continues to grow and strengthen as the housing market improves and businesses grow. As a result of Florida's strengthening economic climate, employers are re-investing in their business by offering more employment opportunities for Floridians. Last December marked an 8 percent increase in online job postings over the year, and I'm confident that as we head into 2013, we'll see more jobs made available to Florida families."
Florida's labor demand, measured by online advertised vacancies, bottomed out in April 2009 at 151,251 ads and has increased by 109,030 openings (+72.1 percent) since then.
According to the Help Wanted OnLine data series from The Conference Board, online job demand was strongest in the large metro cities, led by Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville. Among the cities with the most online ads, the highest percentage gain over-the-year in online ads was in St. Petersburg (+25.8 percent).
Major occupational groups with the most online ads in December were healthcare practitioners and technical occupations; sales and related occupations; office and administrative support occupations; and computer and mathematical occupations.
