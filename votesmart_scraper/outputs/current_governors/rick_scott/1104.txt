Today, Governor Scott issued the following statement on the cancellation of the Blue Angels Air Show for 2013 due to sequestration.
Governor Scott said, "The cancellation of the 2013 Blue Angels Air Show is a major blow to families and jobs in Pensacola and the nation. Families come from everywhere to enjoy the show and watch America's military might on display. These visitors fill area hotels, they eat at our restaurants and enjoy our beaches. The President missed a real opportunity to lead and help Florida families get back to work by making government more efficient and reducing spending in ways that make sense. In Florida, we continue to work to grow jobs for Florida families. Just last week, I was proud to be in Pensacola to announce that Navy Federal Credit Union will create more than 1,500 jobs for families in Northwest Florida -- our largest economic announcement to date. In Florida, our plan to grow the economy is working, and we encourage Washington to follow our lead."
