Governor Rick Scott today announced that Florida's businesses created 32,100 private sector jobs over the month in February 2014. This is the highest number of private sector Florida jobs created in a single month since the Governor took office. Since December 2010, Florida's economy has added 540,700 private sector jobs. The state's unemployment rate for February 2014 was 6.2 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in the state since June 2008. The rate held steady from the revised January 2014 rate of 6.2 percent. For the seventh consecutive month, Florida's statewide unemployment rate remains below the national unemployment rate, which was 6.7 percent in February 2014.
Governor Rick Scott said, "It is clear that businesses are growing and creating more jobs and opportunities for Floridians. We are moving Florida's opportunity economy forward and the addition of more than 32,000 private sector jobs in just last month is great news for Florida families. Let's keep working so that every Floridian who wants a job can get one, so let's keep working."
In February 2014, Florida's labor force increased over the month and over the year. Labor force was 9,515,000 in February 2014 and is defined as the sum of employment plus unemployment (those without a job but actively seeking work). Florida's labor force participation rate, which is labor force divided by the total civilian noninstitutional population, was 60.2 percent in February 2014, up 0.3 percentage point from the January 2014 participation rate of 59.9 percent. Although the unemployment rate held steady, the increase in the labor force this month means more people gained employment.
Jesse Panuccio, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity said, "Job creation is the key to an opportunity economy and February was a very strong month on this score. We continue to have a lower unemployment rate than the nation. Our record job demand is a promise for the future for families that were devastated by the recession. We will continue to pursue policies that keep our economy growing."
With more than 32,000 private sector jobs created in February 2014 and an unemployment rate of 6.2 percent, our low-tax and pro-business policies are working. Not only are companies recognizing Florida as the best state in the nation to do business, but Floridians across the state are finding more opportunities to get a job and provide for their families.
