Location: Kennedy Space Center, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott attended the grand opening of Boeing's new Commercial Crew Cargo & Processing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center and highlighted their plans to add 550 new jobs on the Space Coast this year. Currently, Boeing employs over 1,400 Floridians and is the world's largest aerospace company and a top U.S. exporter.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Leaders in the aerospace and aviation industry like Boeing are choosing Florida over other states because of our world-class facilities, advanced infrastructure and commitment to cutting taxes. Enterprise Florida is laser-focused on the long-term success of companies like Boeing and has been instrumental in helping them expand in Florida. We must fully fund EFI so Florida remains competitive in the global economy."
In partnership with Enterprise Florida and Space Florida, Boeing has modernized its Orbital Processing Facility-3 into a brand new Commercial Crew Cargo & Processing Facility (C3PF) at the Kennedy Space Center that will house the creation of NASA's latest spacecraft technology.
House Speaker Steve Crisafulli said, "I'm proud to join the Governor to highlight Boeing's expansion and job creation here in the Space Coast. Companies like Boeing are diversifying our economy and giving Floridians more opportunities. I look forward to continuing to work with Enterprise Florida and local partners to bring more companies like Boeing to Florida to keep our aerospace industry strong."
