Today, Governor Rick Scott announced he has signed legislation related to Charlotte's Web, a low-THC cannabis used to treat certain illnesses such as epilepsy in children. Senate Bill 1030 and 1700 were both signed, approving the medication and protecting patient information in the compassionate use registry.
Governor Scott said, "As a father and grandfather, you never want to see kids suffer. The approval of Charlotte's Web will ensure that children in Florida who suffer from seizures and other debilitating illnesses will have the medication needed to improve their quality of life. I am proud to stand today with families who deserve the ability to provide their children with the best treatment available."
