[Governor Scott]
Hi, I'm Governor Rick Scott, and I'm joined by Time Warner Chief Financial Officer John Martin, who has some great news for Florida, and especially the Tampa area.
This week, his company announced that Hillsborough County has been chosen as the location for Time Warner's new "Shared Services Center." They estimate they'll need approximately 500 Floridians to staff the facility. This is a really significant announcement and another step forward that we're continuing to make a difference for our state.
[CFO Martin]
That's right, Governor. Time Warner looked at possible sites all across the nation, but we ultimately decided that the state of Florida was the best place to locate our new facility. Florida has so much to offer, including a talented work force, great beaches and -- most important to United States -- a great place to do business. You have created a business environment where we can feel good about investing today with an eye towards growing in the future. I believe this will be a great partnership between Time Warner and the state of Florida.
[Gov Scott]
This is great news for our state, for Hillsborough County, and for Time Warner. I've made it a point to make job creation my number one priority, and we're definitely headed in the right direction. But I will not rest until every Floridian who wants to work has the opportunity to find a job. Let's get to work!
