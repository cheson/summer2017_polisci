Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: March 3, 2016
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida's home prices in January were up from last year by 13.7%. The statewide median sales price for single-family existing homes in January was $199,000 and the statewide median price for townhouse-condo properties in January was $152,000, up 5.5% over-the-year.
Governor Scott said, "Today's news that home prices are up shows that our economy is growing. We want to continue to cut taxes and create an environment where businesses can succeed so more families will move and buy a home in Florida."
Another housing indicator, new housing construction, remains healthy in the state. Florida building permits totaled 7,938 in January 2016, accounting for more than 10% of all U.S. building permits.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Cissy Proctor said, "Florida continues to shine as a top destination for tourists, job seekers, families, and retirees thanks to the Scott Administration's pro-growth policies. The state's expanding housing market shows that Florida is the best place in the nation to live, work, play, and do business."
