Today, during a meeting of the Florida Cabinet, Governor Rick Scott showed his appreciation for Florida's teachers and applauded their commitment to improving Florida's education system today by presenting special commendations to several North Florida 2013 Teachers of the Year. The commendation was created to honor Florida's valued educators and their effort to foster greater student achievement. The five winners invited to attend today's meeting come from Franklin, Gadsden, Leon, Liberty, and Wakulla counties.
"Every day you help Florida's students realize their potential, fulfill their dreams, and embark on challenging journeys toward college and successful careers," said Governor Scott to the teachers in attendance. "Florida's strong, effective teachers give students an advantage in today's competitive environment, and that is why I am proud to award this special commendation to teachers who go above and beyond to make a difference in education."
This special recognition takes place a few weeks after Governor Scott announced his Florida Families First Budget proposal to increase Florida teacher salaries and education funding.
The participating 2013 Teachers of the Year are below:
Laura King, Franklin County -- King teaches social studies and language arts at Franklin County K-12 School. With more than 16 years of classroom instruction under her belt, King's classroom management is an example to her peers and her use of technology in the classroom captures students' attention right away.
Zola Akins, Gadsden County -- In addition to being the reading coach at George W. Munroe Elementary School, Akins also teaches language arts, reading, and writing. She has been teaching in Gadsden schools for 11 years. This is her second year as Gadsden's Teacher of the Year.
