While addressing the 18th Annual Our Hero's Luncheon in Tampa today, Governor Rick Scott urged Floridians to show appreciation for Florida's fallen first responders by approving HB 95, creating the Fallen Heroes Family Tax Relief Act. This legislation changes Florida law to correspond with the provisions of HJR 93, which will be on the ballot this November. If approved, the amendment will provide a property-tax exemption to the surviving spouse of a first responder who dies in the line of duty. The bill signed by the Governor today provides for the statutory changes to implement the constitutional amendment if it is approved by 60 percent of voters.
"For Florida's law enforcement officers and first responders, any routine traffic stop or emergency call can turn into a dangerous situation that can potentially cost their lives," said Governor Scott. "Their selfless service ensures our well-being and safety, and the families of the fallen live each day with the loss of their loved one. The constitutional amendment is one way we can show them our appreciation for their sacrifice."
