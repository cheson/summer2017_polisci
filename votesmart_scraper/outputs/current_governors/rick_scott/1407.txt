This week we celebrated the diversity of our people and our state.
First, we recognized students, teachers and business leaders this week as we observed Black History Month.
Lt. Governor Jennifer Carroll and I invite you to celebrate the achievements of African-American leaders whose contributions leave a lasting legacy of strength, determination and pride.
I also visited Apalachicola and enjoyed some world-famous oysters. I stopped by a seafood house where fresh Florida shrimp, oysters and fish are shipped to restaurants and stores across the United States.
I also witnessed the historic Space Shuttle launch from Kennedy Space Center. As the program nears retirement, we see an exciting, emerging commercial space industry carving a new path for our state's $8-billion-dollar-a-year space industry.
With Florida's aerospace industry representing only 3 percent of the $250-billion-dollar global marketplace, there is significant opportunity for Florida to grow in this sector.
Next week, I will visit four northern cities on a Share a Little Sunshine tour in partnership with VISIT FLORIDA. The weather in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Chicago is forecast to be in the 30s and 40s. I'll encourage those winter-weary residents to come visit the Sunshine State.
To boost our tourism, we will tell people how they can register to win Florida vacation packages being given away to winners in each city.
I invite you to help us promote Florida's great seafood, beaches, and weather by visiting ShareALittleSunshine.org
Let's get to work!
