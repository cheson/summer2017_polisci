On June 24, 2016 Governor Rick Scott directed 49 Florida state flags to be placed in front of the Florida Historic Capitol for 49 days as a memorial of those who lost their lives during the Orlando terror attack at Pulse Nightclub. Today, on the 49th day, Governor Scott and First Lady Ann Scott will send the state flags to the families of the victims.
Governor Rick Scott said, "The memory and legacy of the 49 innocent victims will live on in the hearts of all Americans. These flags serve as a reminder of their individual impact on so many. While we will never completely heal from the pain of such loss, we will continue to be reminded of the joy each and every victim brought to their loved ones. We continue to mourn with the families and loved ones as they grieve, and ask all Floridians to continue praying for all those affected during this time of healing."
First Lady Ann Scott said, "We will never forget the loss of the 49 innocent lives that were taken from us far too soon. We will continue to live and honor the victims of this horrendous attack. My heart goes out to all of the victim's family and friends. We will continue to pray that they can find healing in this time of pain."
