Governor Rick Scott's Weekly Radio Address
Statement

This is Governor Rick Scott. This week, all Americans witnessed the final launch of Atlantis from Kennedy Space Center.
This is an historic time, and it's sad to see the program end. However, I am optimistic that we can attract high-tech aviation and aerospace jobs to the space coast because of our highly skilled workforce.
I work tirelessly every day to make sure Florida is the number one place to do business, so we attract businesses to the space coast and to the rest of Florida.
Also this week, I signed legislation that continues Florida's proud tradition of being a military friendly state.
This legislation cuts property taxes for deployed service members and creates the veterans hall of fame, to be located in the state capitol building. This legislation also allows military spouses who work in the healthcare industry to get to work sooner when they move to Florida.
As a veteran myself, I understand the importance of supporting the military and their families. Servicemen and women deserve our gratitude and respect for defending our freedoms.
In closing, I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Hernando County Deputy Sheriff John Mecklenburg.
Deputy Mecklenburg lost his life last weekend while protecting the citizens of Florida. Today we stand with his family and his brothers and sisters in uniform.
