Governor Rick Scott today announced that the statewide unemployment rate for September 2013 was 6.8 percent and 6.7 percent for October 2013. The statewide unemployment rate has remained below the national average of 7.3 percent since March 2013. Florida has created 440,900 private sector jobs since December 2010.
Governor Scott said, "Florida's unemployment rate is now below seven percent at 6.7 percent in October 2013. This is our eighth month below the national average. Over the last two months, the state has added more than 67,000 private sector jobs. This is great news for Florida families.
"Our total job creation is now at 440,900, but we have more work to do. We don't just want a state where job creation reaches a certain number, or unemployment falls to a certain number. We want to create an opportunity economy. We want a state with dynamic, growing industries that will create jobs and careers for generations to come."
The state gained 20,800 private sector jobs in September 2013 and 46,400 private sector jobs in October 2013. Florida's annual job growth rate from October 2012 to October 2013 is the fastest since June 2006. With 46,400 new private sector jobs last month, this is the most growth in a month since December 2010. Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded or been equal to the nation's job growth rate since March 2012.
"Today's numbers represent another successful chapter in Florida's remarkable turnaround story under the Scott Administration," said Jesse Panuccio, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. "We continue to outpace the nation with respect to job growth, job demand, and unemployment decline, which is further proof that policy matters and the Governor's pro-growth agenda is working."
Since December 2010, Florida's statewide unemployment rate has dropped 4.4 percentage points, from a rate of 11.1 percent to October's rate of 6.7 percent. Florida's September 2013 rate was down 0.2 percentage point from the August rate of 7.0 percent, and the rate fell another 0.1 percentage point in October 2013. The current rate of 6.7 percent represents the lowest statewide unemployment rate since August 2008. It is also a decrease of 1.5 percentage points from October 2012, when the rate was 8.2 percent. Florida's unemployment rate has now declined year-over-year for 36 consecutive months.
