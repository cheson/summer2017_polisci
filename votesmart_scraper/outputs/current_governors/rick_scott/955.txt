Today, Governor Rick Scott highlighted a $50 million investment from the 2013-2014 Florida Families First budget for cancer research activities across the state. The Governor highlighted the investment at the Moffit Cancer Research Center in Tampa, which is nationally recognized as a leading treatment and research institution, and is designated by the National Cancer Institute as a Comprehensive Cancer Center.
Governor Scott said, "Thanks to modern medicine, many individuals who are diagnosed with common types of cancers can be treated and live longer lives. It's the more complex form of cancers, however, that create more of a challenge for families and doctors. Treatment of these complex cancers requires more research and development, and also the best and brightest among the medical profession. That's why in our Florida Families First budget we were able to work with the Legislature to invest $50 million in cancer research centers across the state. Here at Moffitt, we invested more than $10 million to support their cancer research activities."
