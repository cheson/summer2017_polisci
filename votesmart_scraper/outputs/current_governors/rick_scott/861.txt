Today, Governor Rick Scott thanked members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for their passage of SB 1400, which keeps college affordable for Florida's students.
Governor Scott said, "Tuition is too high; and our students are graduating with too much debt. It is important to address the issue of college affordability to ensure higher education is attainable for Floridians so they can get the best job possible. On behalf of all of Florida's families who dream of a brighter future for their kids, and all of our students who aspire to achieve success in the classroom and in the workforce, we will keep fighting to help every student in Florida afford a college education."
