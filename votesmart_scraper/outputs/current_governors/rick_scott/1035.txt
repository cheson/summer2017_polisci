WHEREAS, the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin is a tragedy; and the Martin family, the family of George Zimmerman, and all those affected by Trayvon's death remain in our thoughts and prayers; and
WHEREAS, emotions are running high as we continue to grieve the loss of Trayvon and the toll that the tragic events surrounding his death have taken on the community of Sanford, Florida, and other communities across our state; and
WHEREAS, tragic events compel us to a time of deep reflection and prayer to find strength and peace in uncertainty; and
WHEREAS, Floridians are unified in not only their resilience, but also in being a people of great humility, kindness, and compassion;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, Rick Scott, Governor of the State of Florida, do hereby declare
Sunday, July 21, 2013, as a STATEWIDE DAY OF PRAYER FOR UNITY IN FLORIDA.
