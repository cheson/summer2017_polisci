Today, Governor Rick Scott issued the following statement regarding the potential negative impact of lifting the Cuban Embargo on Florida agriculture:
Governor Scott said, "Agriculture is a vital part of our economy in Florida, and lifting the embargo on Cuba could do irreparable harm to it. Importing agricultural products from Cuba could drive down demand for Florida products, open our crops up to invasive pests and species, and give the Castro regime leverage to continue the suppression of their people. Florida agriculture has over a $100 billion impact on our state, and President Obama should be doing everything he can to support it. Sadly, he continues to stand side by side with the Castro regime. I will continue to oppose lifting the embargo, and fight for Florida families, farmers, and our agriculture industry."
