Today, Governor Rick Scott highlighted job growth at IDI, a data and analytics company in Boca Raton. Since the company was founded in 2014, they have created 40 jobs for local families. IDI also expects to create more than 200 new jobs in Boca Raton over the next few years.
Governor Scott said, "I am excited to visit IDI today to celebrate their recent success and the creation of 40 jobs over the past two years. IDI is one of many small businesses growing in Florida and plans to add 200 new jobs over the next few years. We will keep working to cut $1 billion in taxes and create the new $250 million dedicated Florida Enterprise Fund this session so Florida can become first for jobs."
IDI has 140 employees with additional offices in New York, Seattle, Atlanta, and Washington D.C. Through leading-edge, proprietary technology and a massive data repository, IDI's data and analytical solutions harness the power of data fusion, uncovering the relevance of disparate data points and converting them into comprehensive and insightful views of people, businesses, assets and their interrelationships. In December of 2015, IDI completed the acquisition of New York-based Fluent, Inc., an industry leader in people-based digital marketing, and also announced the beginnings of the beta release of its next generation data analytics platform, idiCOREÂ™, with wider distribution to the risk management industry expected within this quarter.
IDI CEO Derek Dubner said, "Since our inception, IDI has experienced incredible growth. We are grateful to Governor Scott for his commitment to creating a business-friendly environment in Florida so companies like ours can succeed. IDI is dedicated to making the world a safer place, reducing the cost of doing business, and enhancing the consumer experience, and we look forward to working with new clients across the country to meet this goal."
City of Boca Raton Mayor Susan Haynie sad, "I am proud of IDI's growth and success. In a relatively short period of time they've created 40 jobs locally, and plan to create over 200 more for our city. We have a thriving business community here in Boca Raton and it's always an honor to highlight their accomplishments."
Cissy Proctor, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said, "Small businesses like IDI have helped stimulate Florida's economic recovery and contributed to the more than 1 million new jobs added since 2010. By strategically investing in business incentives and tax cuts, we can make Florida first in the nation for jobs and the best place to do business."
