Governor Rick Scott announced today that the Pensacola area added 3,500 new private-sector jobs over the year in October. The area's unemployment rate was 4.9 percent. Florida businesses created 8,900 private-sector jobs across the state during October 2016, bringing the total number of jobs created since December 2010 to 1,232,400 jobs.
Governor Scott said, "Thousands of families now have the opportunity to find new jobs in Northwest Florida thanks to the success and hard work of local businesses which have added 3,500 new jobs in the last year. A job is the most important thing to a family and that is why we will continue to help Florida businesses succeed by cutting taxes, diversifying the economy and making Florida more competitive for major jobs wins."
The industry with the most job growth in the Pensacola area over the year was professional and business services with 900 new jobs. The Pensacola area had 4,468 job openings in October, which included 1,219 openings for high-skill, high-wage STEM occupations.
The state's unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in October, as a result of the rapidly growing labor force which nearly doubled over the month. For the 55th consecutive month, Florida's annual job growth rate of 3.3 percent is exceeding the nation's rate of 1.8 percent. Nearly 38,000 Floridians were placed in jobs by CareerSource Escarosa and the state's other 23 regional workforce boards.
