Governor Scott said, "Despite the Agency being turned away from a fourth facility, this time in Miami where there is a history of concerning medical practices, I believe we are making progress toward the goal of bringing transparency to the processes at the VA hospitals in Florida.
"Earlier today, Secretary Dudek spoke with Ms. Joleen Clark, the VA's VISN 8 Network Director. Ms. Clark would not give a date certain, but said her office would be able to provide the requested "information expeditiously' on behalf of all Florida VA facilities. Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration is available to review such information as soon as it is made available. Florida's brave veterans deserve answers."
