Following up from his recent letters to Illinois, California, Connecticut and Maryland business owners urging them to book a one way ticket to Florida, Governor Rick Scott also contacted Minnesota businesses urging them to come to the Sunshine State to take advantage of Florida's business friendly environment.
Governor Scott said, "Minnesota's formula of more taxes and spending is not working. Florida has cut regulations and lowered taxes while paying down state debt. Not only is Florida a great place for businesses, but it's also a great place to get an education, and we will continue to work to bring more jobs and opportunities to Florida families."
