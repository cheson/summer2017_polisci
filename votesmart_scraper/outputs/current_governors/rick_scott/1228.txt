Florida's unemployment rate dropped to 8.7 percent in April 2012, three-tenths of a point better than last month.
"With more than 243,000 Florida job openings listed by various help-wanted websites, we are seeing positive trends of job creation by companies and employers throughout our state," said Governor Rick Scott. "Florida's jobless rate moved to its lowest point in more than three years and is a clear sign we are moving Florida in a direction that gives businesses and job creators the confidence they need to grow and expand."
