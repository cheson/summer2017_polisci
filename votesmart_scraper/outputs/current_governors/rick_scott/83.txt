Governor Rick Scott announced today that the Fort Lauderdale area added 25,700 new private-sector jobs over the year in October. The unemployment rate in Fort Lauderdale was 4.6 percent in October, declining by 0.1 percentage point in the last year. Florida businesses created 8,900 private-sector jobs across the state during October 2016, bringing the total number of jobs created since December 2010 to 1,232,400 jobs.
Governor Scott said, "Fort Lauderdale continues to be a leader in job creation across the state, adding more than 25,000 jobs in the last year. This is great news for Floridians working hard to find their dream job and provide for their families. We will continue to focus on cutting taxes and making Florida business-friendly so we can continue to encourage job creation in Florida."
The industries with the most job growth over the year in the Fort Lauderdale area were trade, transportation and utilities with 6,700 new jobs; professional and business services with 4,500 new jobs; and education and health services and leisure and hospitality, both with 4,000 new jobs. Fort Lauderdale job demand remained fourth in the state with 22,183 openings, including 5,710 high-skill, high-wage STEM job openings.
The state's unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in October, as a result of the rapidly growing labor force which nearly doubled over the month. For the 55th consecutive month, Florida's annual job growth rate of 3.3 percent is exceeding the nation's rate of 1.8 percent. Nearly 38,000 Floridians were placed in jobs by CareerSource Broward and the state's other 23 regional workforce boards.
