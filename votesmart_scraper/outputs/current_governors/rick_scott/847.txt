Governor Scott said, "I want to thank the members of the South Florida Water Management District today for affirming our commitment to sending water south. We're committed to restoring and protecting water quality for families along the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuaries, and this an historic step that will put into motion projects that are critical to protecting Florida's natural treasures."
