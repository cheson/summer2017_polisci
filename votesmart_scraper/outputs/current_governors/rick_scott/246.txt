Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott signed HB 545 into law which establishes harsher penalties for individuals who commit human trafficking and protects victimized children from being convicted for criminal charges.
Governor Scott said, "I am proud to sign this important legislation into law today so we can better protect victims of human trafficking in Florida and ensure perpetrators are brought to justice. While we have made tremendous progress in Florida to fight the evil of human trafficking, even one victim of this unfathomable crime is too many. I appreciate the hard work of Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Florida Legislature for their efforts to combat human trafficking in Florida, and we will continue to do all we can to end human trafficking and care for victims."
DJJ Secretary Christina Daly said, "Many don't realize that human trafficking exists right here in our own state and communities. This legislation moves us one step closer to ending human trafficking in Florida by implementing harsher punishments for human traffickers and ensuring that our state's most vulnerable are protected from further exploitation. I'm thankful to Governor Scott for signing HB 545 into law today to keep our children and families safe."
DCF Secretary Mike Carroll said, "This bill ensures that victims of human trafficking aren't unfairly punished for their abuse but rescued and restored, and also provides harsher penalties for perpetrators to make sure they are fully punished for this crime. Together, we can end this terrible crime from happening in Florida and help rescue and restore individuals trapped in exploitation."
