Governor Rick Scott today announced the appointment of Judge Burton C. Conner of Fort Pierce to the Fourth District Court of Appeal.
"Judge Conner represents the values and judicial conservatism I am looking for in our judges. He has a great reputation in the community and a great law-and-order demeanor," Governor Scott said. "Primarily a criminal court judge for most of the past 15 years, he has demonstrated a judicial philosophy that makes him unlikely to overstep the role of the judiciary."
Judge Conner, 58, has served on the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit Court since 1997 and was an Okeechobee County Court judge from 1984 to 1988. His private practice experience was with Conner and Hooker from 1996 to 1997, as a sole practitioner from 1989 to 1996, and with Conley and Conley from 1979 to 1984. He earned his bachelor's degree from the Duke University and his law degree from the University of Florida.
Judge Conner will fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Judge Gary Farmer.
