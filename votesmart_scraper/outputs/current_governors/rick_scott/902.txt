Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement regarding President Obama's budget that makes significant reductions to the Lake Okeechobee dike system and Everglades projects.
Governor Scott said, "Last year, Florida communities experienced a rainy season that exposed the short comings of the federal government's inaction in funding projects to protect South Florida estuaries. One would think the administration would have gotten the message to make families in South Florida a priority, but they've chosen to continue down a path of failure. Following review of the President's proposed budget, it appears he's chosen to reduce funding to the Herbert Hoover Dike System at Lake Okeechobee by $11 million, and reduce funding to Everglades projects by $22 million. These proposals are disappointing, but despite the federal government's continued shortcomings, we'll continue to stand up for families.
"My "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget' makes critical investments in the C-44 STA project, the Tamiami Trail project, provides record spending in springs, and continues to fund our $880 million plan to restore the Everglades. These investments will work to restore water quality and protect our natural treasures -- and we'll continue to pressure the Obama Administration to live up to its commitments to Florida families."
