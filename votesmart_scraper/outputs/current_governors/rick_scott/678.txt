Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) again experienced positive annual job growth over the year in October 2014 with 2,800 new jobs. The metro area's unemployment rate declined by 0.7 percentage point over the year, from 6.3 percent in October 2013 to 5.6 percent in October 2014.
Governor Scott said, "With an unemployment rate down to 5.6 percent in the Pensacola metro area, it is clear that we are creating an opportunity economy in every area of our state. In October 2014, 2,800 new jobs were created in the Pensacola area, and we will not stop until every Floridian who wants a job can get one."
The industry with the largest job gains in the Pensacola metro area over the year was leisure and hospitality with 1,600 new jobs. The Pensacola metro area had the second fastest annual job growth rate in information at 9.1 percent and in leisure and hospitality at 7.9 percent in October 2014.
The Pensacola metro area had 5,251 online job openings in October 2014, an increase of 8.2 percent over the year, and 918 openings for STEM occupations, an increase of 7.1 percent over the year. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In October, CareerSource Escarosa, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 39,300 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 8,346 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
