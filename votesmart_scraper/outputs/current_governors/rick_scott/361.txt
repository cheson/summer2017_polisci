Governor Rick Scott: Florida Green Sea Turtles Set New Nesting Record
Press Release

Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Scott announced a record year for the number of green sea turtle nests in Florida. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) documented approximately 28,000 green sea turtle nests on 26 Florida beaches this year.
Governor Scott said, "It's exciting to hear that our efforts to protect Florida's environment are helping the sea turtle population thrive. In June, I helped release two loggerhead turtles into their natural Florida habitat. We are committed to protecting our state's natural treasures so future generations of Floridians will be able to enjoy them."
The trend for green sea turtles shows an increase in nesting over the past 27 years. Nearly 30 years ago only 464 green turtle nests were recorded on these 26 beaches (200 miles) that are part of the Index Besting Beach Survey program. In 2011, the count was 10,701; in 2013, it was 25,553.  The counts represent about 68 percent of green turtle nesting statewide. Results of the FWC Statewide Nesting Beach Survey program which documents nearly all sea turtle nesting in Florida on 800 miles of coastline will be available in early 2016.
Loggerhead sea turtles, the most prevalent sea turtle species on Florida's shores, accounted for 52,647 nests on index beaches this year. The high level of loggerhead nesting in recent years followed a large drop in loggerhead nest counts between 1998 and 2007.
