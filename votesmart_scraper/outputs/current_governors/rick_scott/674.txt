Governor Rick Scott announced today that the Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall metro area gained the highest number of jobs in October 2014 among all metro areas in Florida compared to a year ago with 37,800 new jobs. The area's unemployment rate declined by 1.7 percentage points over the year, from 8.1 percent in October 2013 to 6.4 percent in October 2014.
Governor Scott said, "With 37,800 new jobs created over the year and an unemployment rate of 6.4 percent, the Miami area continues to provide families with opportunities to get a job. Florida has added 679,000 private-sector jobs since December 2010, and we will keep working until every Floridian who wants a job is able to get one."
The industries with the largest job gains over the year were trade, transportation, and utilities with 9,700 new jobs, professional and business services with 5,600 new jobs, education and health services with 4,900 new jobs, and construction with 4,400 new jobs.
The Miami metro area had the second-highest online job demand in Florida in October 2014 with 34,228 job openings and had the third-highest number of openings for STEM occupations in October 2014 with 7,631 online openings. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In October, CareerSource South Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 39,300 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 8,346 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
Florida created 32,000 private-sector jobs in October 2014, and since December 2010, Florida has created 679,000 private-sector jobs. Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since April 2012. Florida's statewide unemployment rate for October 2014 was 6.0 percent, down 0.7 percentage point from the October 2013 rate.
