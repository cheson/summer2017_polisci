Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida businesses added 11,500 private-sector jobs in December 2014. The number of private-sector jobs added statewide in November 2014 was also revised up to 39,900 new jobs, 1,300 more jobs than reported last month. Since December 2010, Florida has added 728,500 private-sector jobs. Florida's statewide unemployment rate in December was 5.6 percent, the lowest since April 2008. Governor Scott made today's announcement at the grand opening of SeaLand, a leading ocean transportation company that will create 65 new jobs with a capital investment of $350,000 in Miramar.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today we are excited to announce that Florida businesses added 11,500 private-sector jobs in December, for a total of 728,500 private-sector jobs created in only four years, and we look forward to seeing even more businesses grow and create jobs for families across the state. As we prepare to release our 2015-2016 "KEEP FLORIDA WORKING" budget recommendations, we will stay laser-focused on our goal of making Florida the global destination for business and job creation."
Since December 2010, Florida's unemployment rate has dropped 5.5 percentage points, from 11.1 percent down now to 5.6 percent in December 2014. Florida's unemployment rate has declined or held steady over the month for 49 of the last 52 months. Florida's December unemployment rate is also down 0.2 percentage point from last month, and down 0.7 percentage point from the December 2013 rate of 6.3 percent.
Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "With these strong December numbers, we now have the complete picture of Florida's economic turnaround these past four years. Last year was the best yet in Florida's recovery, with 225,700 private-sector jobs added, record levels of job demand, a falling unemployment rate, and nation-leading labor force growth. Good policy is driving Florida's growth. And we're not done. Governor Scott is proposing a mix of tax cuts and critical investments that will keep Florida working for years to come."
"The Alliance is thrilled that SeaLand has located in Miramar. The company's rich history and bright future in marine and logistics is a strong addition to two of Greater Fort Lauderdale/Broward County's targeted industries. We wish the company continued success," said Alliance CEO Bob Swindell.
