"I am disappointed to learn today another VA hospital--the C.W. "Bill' Young VA Medical Center in Bay Pines--turned away the Agency for Health Care Administration's surveyors. Yesterday, we learned there were two instances where veterans were harmed, or may have been harmed at this same VA hospital.
"We need to shine a light on what happened in federal VA facilities in Florida. A thorough review of the deaths should be conducted and released. Floridians deserve to know how our veterans died and who is being held accountable. We still expect the VA to provide this information and be transparent so we stand up for the heroes that stood up for our country."
