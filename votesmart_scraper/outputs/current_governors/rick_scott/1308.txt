Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott
We've had a great week here in Florida. Last Saturday I had the opportunity to work at Captain Anderson's Seafood Restaurant on the Bay in Panama City Florida.
This is my fourth "Let's Get to Work' Day and I did everything from cleaning fish to making key lime pie and soup and even serving tables. I didn't realize that one tuna was 106 lbs. I was also happy that I didn't drop anything while waiting tables, and was able to sell a lot of desserts.
The best part of Saturday's Work Day was sitting down and talking to employees about some of the issues that they are facing every day and what I better focus on as Governor that will improve this state.
As you may know, we've had a great year so far in job creation. Even though Florida was number one in job creation in the nation last month and we've created 110,000 private sector jobs, it is still not enough. We still have 900,000 people out of work.
Also, on Monday this week we announced that Boeing will be adding 550 aerospace jobs at Kennedy Space Center. Our Lt. Governor Jennifer Carroll and Space Florida, which is primarily funded by your tax dollars, did a great job working with NASA and the Kennedy Space Center to get Boeing to choose Florida.
I hope you've had a great week.
