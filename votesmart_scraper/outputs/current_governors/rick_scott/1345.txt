This is Governor Rick Scott. This week I helped break ground on a road construction project that will help make Florida the trade capital of the Southeast United States.
The Eller Drive Overpass Project at the entrance to Port Everglades in Broward County will help efficiently move traffic to and from the port and improve the local economy.
This project is also critical to moving cargo and goods from the port to the rest of our state.
International trade and investment continues to be a strong economic driver in Florida.
Florida's ports, including Port Everglades, are essential to our state's economic future.
I am confident that with projects like the Eller Drive Overpass at Port Everglades, Florida will be ready to benefit from the expansion of the Panama Canal in 2014.
We are working to ensure Florida's ports will be able to handle this future growth and the increase of international trade that will come along with it.
We are well on our way to making Florida the best location in the world to start, grow, or move a business.
