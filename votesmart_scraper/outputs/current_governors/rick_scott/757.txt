Governor Rick Scott today announced that Florida created 23,000 private-sector jobs in August 2014. Since December 2010, Florida's private-sector businesses have added 643,100 jobs for Florida families. Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since April 2012.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today's announcement of 23,000 private-sector jobs being created in Florida over the month of August is great news for Florida families. As we continue to create an opportunity economy and a business-friendly environment, we are seeing more jobs being created throughout Florida communities. Since December 2010, we have created more than 643,000 private-sector jobs, and we will continue to work so that every Floridian who wants a job can get one."
The statewide unemployment rate for August 2014 is 6.3 percent, down 0.8 percentage point from the August 2013 rate. Since December 2010, Florida's unemployment rate has dropped 4.8 percentage points, from 11.1 percent down now to 6.3 percent in August 2014.
Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "The creation of 23,000 private-sector jobs in Florida last month is another strong chapter in Florida's economic turnaround story. With measurable growth last month in the manufacturing and business and professional services industries, we can see that our efforts to foster the creation of high-skill, high-wage jobs are paying off for Florida families."
The long-term positive trends in the unemployment rate and job counts are among the most important economic indicators to consider when analyzing the health of Florida's economic recovery. The state's private-sector job counts have been steadily on the rise for over four years, showing that Florida's businesses are responding to the state's improving economic climate. Since December 2010, the state has added 643,100 private-sector jobs.
