Rick Scott today issued the following statement in recognition of National Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from September 15-October 15, 2010:
"This month we honor and celebrate the achievements Hispanic-Americans have made here in Florida and in the United States of America. We recognize this diverse and rich culture, which has become a critical part of the fabric of our state.
"Hispanics have helped strengthen our state in business, politics, education, the U.S. military and as public servants, making countless contributions to our society.
"Throughout this election, and my career, I have met thousands of Latinos who work hard every day in search of the American Dream. Their dedication and passion in search of the best things America has to offer embodies the principles of this nation and this state. I am running for Governor to ensure that every Floridian has the opportunity to work hard and achieve the American Dream.
"I'm proud to honor Hispanic Heritage Month, and I will continue to highlight the important issues facing Florida's Hispanic community and Floridians of all backgrounds."
