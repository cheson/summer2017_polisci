Gov. Scott Requests President Obama to Declare a Federal Emergency Following Algae Blooms
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: July 6, 2016
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott requested President Obama to declare a federal emergency following algae blooms in local waterways surrounding the Indian River Lagoon and anticipated algae blooms surrounding the Caloosahatchee River.
Governor Scott said, "It is the federal government's sole responsibility to maintain the federally operated Herbert Hoover Dike, and for more than a decade, the federal government has ignored proper maintenance and repair to this structure. As a result, billions of gallons of water have been discharged into the Indian River Lagoon and Caloosahatchee River which is causing toxic algae blooms to cause havoc to our environment. I am asking President Obama to immediately declare a Federal Emergency and use the full resources of the federal government to address the effects caused by the frequent discharges of water from Lake Okeechobee."
