Statement

"Floridians scored a huge victory today when the House approved tax relief measures that will make it easier for Florida businesses to create jobs in our state. I am grateful that Speaker Cannon, Chairman Precourt and the Florida House have continued their commitment to creating an environment where Florida businesses, and in turn Florida's families, can thrive.
"By allowing more than 3,500 businesses to stop paying income taxes and instead put that money into jobs, and maximizing incentives to make Florida more attractive to quality manufacturing jobs, the Florida House has demonstrated it knows what it takes to help grow private-sector jobs.
"The tax burden on a company clearly matters, as we saw by the addition of 141,500 new private-sector jobs and an unemployment drop of 2.1 percentage points last year following the significant business tax reform we enacted."
