Florida's Unemployment Rate Drops for the Fifth Month in a Row
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: June 17, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"Florida is leading the nation in job creation and our unemployment rate has dropped for the 5th straight month, a huge win for Floridians. It is unfortunate the federal government can't say the same thing for the rest of the country.
"Our efforts to make Florida the most business friendly state are clearly paying off and we are bucking the national trend.
"Since I took office, we've created 76,800 jobs for parents, recent graduates, workforce veterans and all Floridians who have been struggling to get back on their feet.
"Texas is still leading the country in job growth this year, but Florida is trailing right behind at number two. We are gunning to be the number one state for job growth and I will not rest until Florida surpasses Texas for the top spot."
