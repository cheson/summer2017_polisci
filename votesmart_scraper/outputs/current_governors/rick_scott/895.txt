Today, Governor Rick Scott issued a statement on unanimous passage of the vehicle registration fee rollback in the Senate Appropriations Committee as well as the House Finance and Tax Subcommittee. The legislation will cut taxes by $400 million.
Governor Scott said, "I want to thank members of the Senate Appropriations Committee as well as the House Finance and Tax Subcommittee for their support in undoing the 2009 tax increases by reducing motor vehicle fees. This tax cut will give families back $400 million of their own money. I look forward to our continuing work with the Legislature on our "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget' to cut taxes and fees, pay down debt and cut government waste, so we can create an opportunity economy where all families can pursue their dreams in the Sunshine State."
