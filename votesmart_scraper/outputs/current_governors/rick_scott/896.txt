Governor Rick Scott issued the following statement regarding the U.S. Congress passing legislation that provides relief from unfair flood insurance rate hikes.
Governor Rick Scott said, "This is a victory for all Florida families who have been impacted by ongoing uncertainty and faced the possibility of paying devastating rate increases. Throughout this process I have been in communication with Sen. Rubio, Sen. Nelson, Speaker Boehner and President Obama. Though we saw little interest from the President on acting quickly to stop impending rate hikes, it appears he will sign this legislation and lift the burden that has been facing our state. With Florida contributing more than its fair share in flood insurance costs, today's vote was overdue and much needed."
