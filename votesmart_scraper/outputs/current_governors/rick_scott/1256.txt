This week, I would like to congratulate the Florida House and Senate on another successful legislative session. At the beginning of the session, I called on lawmakers to increase K-12 funding by $1 billion. This was my top priority.
I would like to thank Speaker Cannon and Senate President Haridopolos, as well as the entire Legislature, for putting Florida's children first.
Lawmakers also passed key components of my 2012 Jobs and Economic Development Package, including:
* Turning our unemployment system into a re-employment system.
* Making workforce boards more accountable.
* Delivering business and property tax relief.
Like me, lawmakers realize that private companies create jobs, not government. I look forward to signing legislation that strengthens Florida's business climate and invests in our children.
