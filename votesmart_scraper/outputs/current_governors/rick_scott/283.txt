Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Rick Scott announced today that Florida's private-sector job growth rate of 3.6 percent in November was the highest among the ten most populous states, including Texas, California, and New York. November marks the ninth consecutive month that Florida's growth rate has been first among large states. Florida's private-sector job growth rate is also significantly higher than the nation's, which is at 2.1 percent.
Governor Scott said, "For the ninth consecutive month, Florida's job growth rate leads the nation's largest states, including our biggest competitor, Texas. Florida businesses have create more than ONE MILLION jobs in only five years, and just last week we learned Florida's population surpassed 20 million residents. As more and more people continue to move to our state, we need to make sure that Florida is first for job creation. That's why we will work to diversify our economy by cutting $1 billion in taxes and creating the Florida Enterprise Fund this Legislative session."
