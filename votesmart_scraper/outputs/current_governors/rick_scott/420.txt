Gov. Rick Scott: Three Florida Hospitals Named Worst in US for Preventing Infections is Unacceptable
By: Rick Scott
Date: July 31, 2015
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Scott released the following statement in regards to a study conducted by Consumer Reports on U.S. hospitals that found three of the 12 lowest rated hospitals in infection prevention are located in Florida. The Florida hospitals are St. Petersburg General Hospital, UF Health Jacksonville, and Venice Regional Bayfront Health.
Governor Scott said, "The news that three Florida hospitals are the worst in America for preventing infections is troubling and unacceptable. The study also further demonstrates the importance of the work being conducted by the Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding to shine a light on the services provided at these facilities. In May, I reached out to UF Health Jacksonville regarding their score for hospital acquired infections and injuries as the worst in the state. This national study further shows the improvements this taxpayer funded hospital needs to make for the patients they serve. We are looking at all options available at the statewide level to address this problem."
