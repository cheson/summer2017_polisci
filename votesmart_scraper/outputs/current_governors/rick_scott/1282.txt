Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott. This Tuesday is the beginning of the Florida legislative session and my State of the State speech. This session, my focus will be on three things: first, I will pass a jobs creation package to ensure that Florida's unemployment numbers continue to drop. Second, we will reform Florida's auto insurance costs, so we can keep the cost of living low in Florida. Third, I want to ensure that Florida's children have access to a quality education by adding an additional $1 billion into next year's education budget.
2011 was a great year. According to the latest figures, Florida added more than 130,000 jobs. I will work every day to make sure that we continue to add jobs. I look forward on working with the legislature in the upcoming session.
