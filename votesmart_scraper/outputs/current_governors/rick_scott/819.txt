Governor Rick Scott said, "My wife Ann and I join Floridians this Memorial Day in honoring the men and women of the United States military who have given their lives to serve our country throughout our nation's history. It is because of their bravery and sacrifice that we are able to enjoy the freedoms of our great country and have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. We continue to pray for the members and families of the Armed Forces who are honorably serving today.
"As we take this opportunity to join our families and friends in enjoying everything our beautiful state has to offer, I urge all Floridians to pause for one minute to observe the National Moment of Remembrance to honor America's fallen on Monday at 3:00 p.m. local time. This moment should serve as a time to remember, reflect, and honor the men and women of our military who have bravely served our state and our nation."
