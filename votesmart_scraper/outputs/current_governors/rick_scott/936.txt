Governor Rick Scott today made the following statement regarding Martin Luther King, Jr. Day:
Governor Scott said, "Ann and I join all Floridians in celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr. Day today. This important holiday allows us to honor the legacy of one of the greatest leaders the world has ever seen. Martin Luther King, Jr. worked tirelessly and passionately to advocate for a nation built on a foundation of equality for everyone. Last year marked the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's historic "I Have a Dream' speech, and half a century later we are still working towards that dream. I am honored every day to have the opportunity to work to ensure that every Floridian has the chance to get a great education and an opportunity to succeed in the Sunshine State."
