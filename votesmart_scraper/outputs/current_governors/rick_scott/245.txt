Location: Tallahassee, FL

Following news of the first confirmation of a sexually transmitted Zika case in Polk County from an individual who traveled out of the country, Governor Rick Scott asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to host another conference call with Florida healthcare workers on how Zika is spread, its symptoms, treatments and proper precautions.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Now that there is a person-to-person transmitted case of the Zika virus in Florida, I am requesting the CDC to schedule another conference call with Florida healthcare workers to ensure they have all the resources and information they need to protect families. I appreciate the CDC for previously speaking with Florida doctors and healthcare workers on a conference call last month, but it is imperative that the most up-to-date information is available so we can stay ahead of the possible spread of the Zika virus in Florida. We will continue to do all we can to keep families across our state safe."
In February, Governor Scott asked the CDC to conduct a call with Florida healthcare workers, including OBGYNS, doctors and those who work with pregnant women, which the CDC completed on February 11th
