In recent days, we've started seeing evidence that Florida is on the right track. A key indicator of this is our state's ability to recruit and retain innovative and progressive companies that contribute to our economy and create jobs.
This week, I was pleased to announce two companies that have recently decided to invest and expand their Florida operations, bringing jobs into our state. Wawa convenience stores opened its first Florida facilities this week in Orlando and plan to expand to over 100 Central Florida stores in the next five years.
Digital Risk, a company already operating in our state, announced that they are expanding their Florida operations and adding high-paying jobs. The growth throughout Florida also demonstrates our success in maintaining a business-friendly environment statewide. It is clear that Florida is on the right track to getting back to work.
