"This Independence Day, Ann and I join families across Florida in celebrating the birth of our nation. As Americans, we are truly blessed with a rich history, freedoms, and opportunity unlike any other nation in the world.
"In commemorating our nation's independence, it is important to remember the strength and courage of our founders who stood strong against tyranny and fought for our freedoms over 200 years ago. America has since served as a beacon of hope, liberty and courage for all.
"As we celebrate on the Fourth, we must be sure to honor the bravery of those who fought for and continue to defend our freedom at home and abroad. The bravery and sacrifice of the servicemen and women in the United States Armed Forces make it possible for us to continue to enjoy our liberties. Join Ann and me in praying for the safety of the courageous men and women who are currently serving overseas, as well as comfort and strength for their families here at home.
"I ask Floridians and those visiting our great state to remain cautious over the holiday weekend. With increased traffic on the highways, it is important to remain alert and focused while traveling. If you choose to celebrate with fireworks or an outdoor barbeque, please do so with extreme care as the severe drought conditions in most counties increases the risk of fire."
"Ann and I wish all Floridians and their families a safe and happy holiday."
