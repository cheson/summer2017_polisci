This week we learned Florida's unemployment rate in February moved in the right direction. However, 11.5 percent is still unacceptable. This is more evidence we must make Florida No. 1 for private-sector job creation.
An important part of making Florida competitive is creating a world-class education system. Florida competes with every other state and country, and our students are competing too.
This week, I signed the Student Success Act. It will give Florida the best educated workforce, so our students and our state can compete in the 21st century economy.
I am proud that the first bill I signed is this important legislation. We must recruit and retain the best teachers to make sure every student and every classroom in Florida has a highly effective teacher.
I thank the Florida Legislature for their work on this important issue. I now call on the legislature to increase school choice by expanding charter schools. Doing so will move our education system another step forward.
We must give parents more choice to select the schools best for their children.
You can help. Join me by letting your voice be heard.
