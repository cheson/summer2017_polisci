Location: Unknown

This week Enterprise Florida released the "Florida is Ready!" advertisement encouraging California shipping companies to re-route their businesses through Florida. The ad was featured in the Journal of Commerce on April 6 and will also be featured in the LA Times and the LA News Group, which includes nine publications, in advance of Governor Rick Scott's trade delegation to California. During the trip, Governor Scott will meet with California businesses to let them know why Florida is the best place for their company to succeed.
Governor Rick Scott said, "We are excited to travel to California next week to tell California companies why they should do business in Florida, including all of the great reasons for California shippers to consider sending their goods through Florida ports. With our low-tax, business friendly climate and our commitment to investing in our transportation infrastructure, Florida is ready to welcome more job creators to our state. In comparison, California has some of the highest taxes in the country and is ranked 50th in regulatory freedom. Elected officials in California are not making it easier for businesses to succeed, and I look forward to meeting with California companies next week as we continue to work toward making Florida the global destination for jobs."
