Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Jacksonville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) gained 19,000 new jobs over the year in January 2015. The Jacksonville MSA's unemployment rate declined by 0.7 percentage point over the year, from 6.5 percent in January 2014 to 5.8 percent in January 2015. Florida businesses have added more than 801,000 private-sector jobs since December 2010.
Governor Scott said, "Florida is on a mission to unseat Texas as the number one state for job creation, and each new job puts us closer to that goal. We are excited to announce that thanks to Florida job creators, 19,000 new jobs were created over the year in Jacksonville. We will keep working to create even more jobs for local families."
The industries with the largest job gains over the year were leisure and hospitality with 4,600 new jobs and education and health services with 4,100 new jobs. Nine of the ten major industry sectors gained jobs over the year in January 2015. In January 2015, the Jacksonville MSA had 17,013 online job openings and had 4,305 online openings for high wage, high skill science technology engineering math (STEM) jobs.
Every March, the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases revised historical employment (jobs) and unemployment rates based on a benchmarking process to adjust the data. These benchmark revisions are mandated by BLS and take place this time every year in every state. This process introduces new population inputs from the most recent Census and other revisions to economic data which leads to changes in the original estimates.
Florida created 14,600 private-sector jobs in January 2015, and a total of 801,100 private-sector jobs since December 2010. Florida's statewide unemployment rate for January 2015 was 5.7 percent. In January, more than 35,500 Floridians were placed in jobs by CareerSource Central Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards.
