Governor Scott's Weekly Radio Address for February 24, 2012
Statement
By: Rick Scott

Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott.
This week, I would like to urge the Florida Senate to join me in curbing auto accident fraud in Florida. The math is simple. If we do nothing, this problem will end up costing Florida drivers $1 billion in higher car insurance rates, taking money directly out of the pockets of Florida families.
Fixing problems like this is the reason we, as elected officials, were sent to Tallahassee. It's time to put our constituents first and pass legislation that puts a stop to accident fraud and puts money back in the pockets of Floridians. I urge you to call your state senator today and tell them that you are sick and tired of Tallahassee politics getting in the way of fixing real-life problems.
