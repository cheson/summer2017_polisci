Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Scott announced that Florida's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew faster than all other large states at 5.1 percent in the second quarter of 2015, according to data released this week. Florida's GDP was also higher than the national average of 3.8 percent.
Governor Scott said, "Florida's GDP outpacing all other large states, and the nation as a whole, is another indicator that our economy continues to grow. We have added over one million new jobs in the last five years and we are seeing the positive effects of this growth throughout our state. We are working to be first in the nation for job creation by cutting $1 billion in taxes and creating the new Florida Enterprise Fund so that more businesses succeed and expand in Florida."
