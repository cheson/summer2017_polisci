Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: May 1, 2015
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Rick Scott announced today that according to the revised preliminary 2014 visitation figure released by VISIT FLORIDA, 98.9 million visitors came to Florida last year. This figure represents a 5.1 percent increase over the previous high of 93.7 million in 2013 and marks the second largest year-over-year visitor increase Florida has experienced in a decade.
Governor Scott said, "We are excited to join VISIT FLORIDA to announce that Florida welcomed a record number of tourists to our state in 2014. Tourism is Florida's number one industry, and every 85 visitors to our state adds another job for our families. More than 98 million tourists is unprecedented in the history of Florida, and we look forward to continuing to break records and welcome even more visitors this year."
These numbers have been revised since Governor Scott's previous announcement in February. VISIT FLORIDA anticipates two more revisions based on the receipt of additional data before the figure becomes final in the Fall.
