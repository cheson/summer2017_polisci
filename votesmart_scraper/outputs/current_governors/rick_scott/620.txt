At Harns Marsh Elementary School today, Governor Rick Scott presented 51 schools in Lee County with $4.2 million in school recognition funding. Governor Scott announced last week the distribution of more than $124 million in School Recognition Program funding this year to Florida's high performing schools across the state based on sustained or significantly improved student achievement.
Governor Scott said, "I am proud to present more than $4 million in school recognition funding to Lee County schools today and recognize their achievements. By providing this funding, we are helping our schools continue to prepare our students for success. We know that a good job starts with a great education, and we will keep working to make Florida's education system the best in the nation by proposing the highest level of per student funding in Florida's history this year.
Lee County Schools Superintendent Nancy Graham said, "We are grateful to Governor Scott for his visit today to highlight the exciting success of the Lee County School District. Our school-based staff -- teachers and support personnel -- work hard each day to ensure that every student achieves his or her highest potential. This funding will help us continue that mission and become a world-class school system."
