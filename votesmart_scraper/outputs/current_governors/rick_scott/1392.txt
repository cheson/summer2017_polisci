Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: April 6, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Rick Scott today released the following statement regarding progress toward enacting a free-trade agreement with Colombia.
"I applaud Congress and the White House for recognizing the importance of ratifying the trade deal with Colombia, which I maintain is important to turning Florida's economy around and creating jobs. This is more important now than ever, since we have committed to expanding Florida's ports to bolster Florida's position as the Gateway to South America and the shipping capital of the east coast, and possibly the nation."
