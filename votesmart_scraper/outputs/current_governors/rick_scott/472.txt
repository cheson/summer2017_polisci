Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that bay scallop season kicks off this weekend, June 27, for Florida residents and visitors. The season will remain open through September 25 stretching from the Pasco-Hernando County line to the Mexico Beach Canal in Bay County.
Governor Scott said, "Bay scallop season is an exciting opportunity for Floridians and visitors to enjoy the world's best scallops and our state's beautiful gulf waters during the summer months. We're happy to open the season early this year so more Floridians and visitors can take advantage."
Last year, Governor Scott requested the bay scallop season open three days earlier than previous years to benefit coastal communities who rely on our fisheries.
"We're excited to announce this year's scallop season. It's another great opportunity for residents and visitors to get out on the water and enjoy Florida's natural resources," said Nick Wiley, FWC's Executive Director.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission encourage all participants to follow safety measures while diving for scallops by staying within 300 feet of a divers-down flag or buoy when in open water or within100 feet of a divers-down flag or buoy when scalloping on a river, inlet or navigation channel. Boat operators should also adhere to safety precautions within 300 feet of a divers-down flag or buoy in open water or within 100 feet on a river, inlet or navigational channel.
