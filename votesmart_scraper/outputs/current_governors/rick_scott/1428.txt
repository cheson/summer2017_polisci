Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott spoke to a bipartisan crowd here today and presented himself as a Ronald Reagan conservative who would cut spending, slash taxes and ease regulation.
One of his themes: It's just too hard for entrepeneurs to start and expand businesses in Florida.
"We are 45th out of 50 states in regulation," Scott said. "We've gone down the path of California in regard to regulation."
Scott also criticized the Obama stimulus package as a job killer that will saddle taxpayers with higher taxes.
"We will not grow our economy if we keep raising our taxes, spending more money, running defecits, raising fees, regulating the living daylights out of everything," Scott said.
The former head of hospital chain Columbia/HCA who has never run for office, Scott said President Obama's health reform sparked him to spend millions of his own money in the race for governor.
"President Obama had the opportunity to really improve health care," Scott said. "But unfortunately, his focus was that government can do it better."
