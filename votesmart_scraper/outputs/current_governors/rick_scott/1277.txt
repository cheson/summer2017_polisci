Hi, this is Governor Rick Scott.
Today, we had more good news on the jobs front.
Florida's unemployment rate fell to 9.9%. That's a 2.1% drop just in 2011. That's a net of 130,000 jobs. That's 130,000 families where someone wasn't working at the beginning of the year that is now working. So that's outstanding.
We still have a lot of work to do. We still have 900,000 people out of work. Every day I focus on three things: to make sure our children can get a great education, make sure everyone has the opportunity to get a job and to keep the cost of living low in our state.
Have a great week.
