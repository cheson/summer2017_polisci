Press Release
By: Rick Scott Rick Perry
Date: June 6, 2014
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that he has agreed to a friendly wager with Texas Governor Rick Perry on the outcome of the seven-game series between the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs. If Miami wins, Governor Rick Perry will send a 3 lb. cinnamon roll from Lulu's Bakery and Caf√© in San Antonio to Tallahassee, and if San Antonio wins, Governor Rick Scott will send Whetstone Chocolates from St. Augustine to Austin.
Governor Scott said, "Coach Erik Spoelstra and the Miami Heat have had an incredible run and I look forward to a great series. I am confident that the Heat will be bringing home a third straight title and I look forward to them cementing their legacy as one of the greatest basketball teams of all time. Go Heat."
"The Heat are aptly named because they're all sizzle and no steak," Gov. Perry said. "While the Heat got lucky last year, the Spurs are proof of the power of teamwork and dedication to craft, qualities that will help them bring the O'Brien Trophy back to the Lone Star State."
The Heat will tip-off against the Spurs tonight at 9:00 p.m. EDT at the AT&T Center in San Antonio. Tonight's game marks the beginning of a seven game series for the NBA Championship and the Larry O'Brien Trophy.
