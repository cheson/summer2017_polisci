Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: May 4, 2015
Location: Tallahassee, FL

Governor Rick Scott released the following statement today regarding Kansas Governor Sam Brownback and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's intent to file an amicus brief in support of Florida's lawsuit against the Obama Administration for ending Florida's Low Income Pool (LIP) healthcare program in an attempt to coerce the state to expand Medicaid under Obamacare.
Governor Rick Scott said, "I spoke with Kansas Governor Sam Brownback and Texas Governor Greg Abbott and they have agreed to file an amicus brief in support of our lawsuit against the Obama Administration. I am glad Kansas and Texas are joining our fight against the Obama Administration for attempting to coerce Florida into Obamacare expansion by ending an existing federal healthcare program and telling us to expand Medicaid instead. The US Supreme Court has already called this sort of coercion tactic illegal. Making sure all of our families have access to affordable, high quality health care is incredibly important and we will continue to fight to protect the health care of all of our families."
