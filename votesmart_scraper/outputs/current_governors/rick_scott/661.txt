Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida businesses have added 715,700 private-sector jobs since December 2010, far surpassing his goal to create 700,000 jobs in seven years. In November 2014, Florida experienced the highest single month of private-sector job growth since Governor Scott took office, with 38,600 jobs created. Florida's statewide unemployment rate in November was 5.8 percent, the lowest since May 2008. Governor Scott made today's announcement at Viewpost, a financial services company that will be creating 262 new jobs over the next three years in Maitland.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Four years ago, we unveiled an ambitious plan to fix Florida's economy and turn the state around. Our goal was to create 700,000 jobs in seven years. Today our goal was reached three years early, with 715,700 private-sector jobs created in Florida since December 2010. I applaud our job creators across the state who sacrifice and work hard to create new jobs. Every job impacts a family and we will keep working each day to make Florida the world's number one destination for jobs."
Since December 2010, Florida's unemployment rate has dropped 5.3 percentage points, from 11.1 percent down now to 5.8 percent in November 2014. Florida's unemployment rate has declined or held steady over the month for 48 of the last 51 months. Florida's November unemployment rate is also down 0.2 percentage point from last month, and down 0.7 percentage point from the November 2013 rate of 6.5 percent.
Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "Florida's incredible economic turnaround story had one of its best chapters yet in November. Our private sector continues a long-term trend of nation-leading job creation, decreased unemployment, labor force growth, and record job demand. Pro-growth policies work and Florida's economy is proof."
