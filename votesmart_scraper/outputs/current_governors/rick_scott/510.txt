Governor Rick Scott today announced that Florida businesses created 25,800 private-sector jobs in April 2015. Since December 2010, 865,600 private-sector jobs have been created across the state. Florida's annual private-sector job growth rate, now at 4.1 percent, has exceeded that of the nation since April 2012. Governor Scott made the announcement at IRadimed, a manufacturer of MRI compatible, non--magnetic IV infusion pump systems, that has created 46 jobs for families in Winter Springs, including 39 new jobs since December 2013.
Governor Rick Scott said, "We are excited to announce today that 865,600 new private-sector jobs have been created in Florida since December 2010, including more than 25,000 new jobs in the month of April alone. By working every day to keep cutting taxes and create an environment where job creators can succeed, we are keeping Florida on track to becoming the global destination for jobs."
Florida's unemployment rate for April 2015 was 5.6 percent, a decrease of 0.8 percentage point over the year from the April 2014 rate of 6.4 percent. Florida's unemployment rate has declined by 5.1 percentage points since December 2010. On an annual basis, Florida's labor force has increased for 62 consecutive months.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "April was another strong month for Florida's economy. The state added 25,800 private-sector jobs, our annual job growth rate remains above four percent, job demand remained high, and the statewide unemployment rate dropped. After surpassing the all-time high for private-sector job creation in the state in March, all indicators are pointing towards continued economic growth. Hard-working Floridians are proving that the Sunshine State is the best place in the nation to live, play, and work."
