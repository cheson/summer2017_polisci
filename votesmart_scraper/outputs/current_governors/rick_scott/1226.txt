As Tropical Storm Beryl approaches Florida's northeast coast, I urge all Floridians in the affected communities to stay alert and aware. Tropical Storm Beryl is expected to bring heavy rain and winds, and it is vital to continue to monitor local news reports and listen to the advice of local emergency management officials. It is a holiday weekend, and many families may be away from home and not tuned into the most updated information. It is imperative that radio stations and business owners in our tourism industry help inform visitors of the potential dangers and impact of the storm. By taking the recommended precautions prior to a storm, Florida's residents, visitors and businesses will be prepared for the potential impact and recover more quickly in the days following.
