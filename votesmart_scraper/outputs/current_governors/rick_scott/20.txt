Florida is one of the most business-friendly states in the nation because of our efforts to reduce burdensome regulations and encourage innovation and job creation across all industries, including transportation. I look forward to seeing the continued growth of ridesharing companies in our state."
Cissy Proctor, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said, "This legislation will ensure the innovative ridesharing network across Florida continues to thrive. Helping Florida businesses grow is critical to our economy, and this bill will also empower workers across the state to work when and where they want to meet the needs of their families."
