Governor Rick Scott today made the following statement regarding the progress of international driver's license legislation:
Governor Scott said, "I applaud the Florida House of Representatives and the Senate Committee on Community Affairs for passing legislation to amend a state statute to improve driver's license provisions for international visitors. The Senate Committee on Transportation and Representative Daniel Davis have done a great job of demonstrating that international visitors are welcome in Florida. This legislation promotes tourism and will ensure visitors from across the globe continue to choose Florida as their vacation and business destination. VISIT FLORIDA anticipates tourist spending will reach record levels and I look forward to signing this legislation when it reaches my desk."
