"As response and recovery efforts continue, the State of Florida is fully committed to doing everything we can to help all of the families and communities in need. We have reached out to emergency management officials and elected leaders in Louisiana, including Governor John Bel Edwards, Congressman Garret Graves, Central Mayor Jr. Shelton and Denham Springs Councilwoman Lori Lamm-Williams to offer resources and express our condolences. The Florida Division of Emergency Management has also already assisted by sending 14 truckloads of water to their state over the weekend. Louisiana families remain in our thoughts and we stand ready to continue helping in any way possible."
