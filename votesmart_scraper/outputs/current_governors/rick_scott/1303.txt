"President Obama's latest observation that job creation efforts have been hindered because America has been "lazy' in attracting investment is clearly incorrect. To characterize the efforts of American businesses and Governors throughout the nation who are working hard to build jobs in this way is not only wrong but stands in the way of their efforts to sell the value of our great nation every day. I recently returned from Brazil, where I and dozens of Florida business leaders worked hard to attract jobs to America. Every day my focus is on attracting new businesses and jobs to Florida.
"Obstacles to job creation in America are a result of policy, not of motivation. Our business taxes are among the highest in the world. Our regulations are among the most difficult in the world. If you need evidence, look no further than the companies who have moved their oil rigs from the Gulf coast to foreign countries in the last year because of the regulatory environment. Just last week, yet another major medical device manufacturer announced they were cutting more than 1,000 jobs because of new Obamacare taxes. The President's comments indicate a belief that more taxes, more regulation and more government is the solution, yet those are the very things standing in the way of those of us who are trying -- very energetically -- to recruit businesses and jobs to our states.
"Please, Mr. President, help us bring jobs to America and let us have an honest conversation about the barriers in our way."
