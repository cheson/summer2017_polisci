Gov. Nathan Deal today announced the statewide back-to-school tax-free holiday weekend will take place tomorrow and Saturday, Aug. 1-2. The sales tax-free holiday was reinstated under the Georgia Jobs and Family Tax Reform Plan in 2012 and extended for an additional two years through this year's tax reform package.
"Reducing the tax burden on hard-working families has always been a top priority of mine," said Deal. "This sales tax holiday will allow Georgia families to save money on those necessary items for school, and it is my hope that they get out this weekend and take advantage of this opportunity. I remain committed to maintaining our status as having one of the lowest per capita taxpayer burdens in the country, and I thank the General Assembly for working with me to make this weekend a possibility."
The Governor's Office of Planning and Budget estimates the two-day holiday will save Georgians up to $70 million. Under the law, the holiday starts tonight at midnight and will conclude at midnight on Aug. 2.
