Location: Tallahassee, FL

"I applaud Speaker Cannon, Chairman Schenck and the Florida House of Representatives for passing legislation critical to combating Florida's prescription drug epidemic. I also commend the House for crafting a bill that is both tough on illegal distributors and fair to law-abiding industry professionals.
"I will continue to work the Senate and to ensure that this important bill becomes law. I am confident that legislation coupled with the efforts of the Drug Strikeforce will make Florida a leader in the fight against prescription drug abuse."
