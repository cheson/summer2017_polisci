Today, Florida Governor Rick Scott congratulated Broward, Hamilton, Hendry, Jefferson, Levy and Orange County School Districts for giving their teachers the opportunity to buy tax-free classroom supplies by enrolling in the Florida Teacher Classroom Supply Assistance Debit Card Program.
Formally unveiled last week by Governor Scott, the Florida Teacher Classroom Supply Assistance Debit Card Program will provide an average of $250 tax free for each teacher in participating districts to spend on classroom supplies. This program was part of the Governor's comprehensive education package including teacher pay raises and record funding for K-12 education last legislative session.
Governor Scott said, "Congratulations to Broward, Hamilton, Hendry, Jefferson, Levy and Orange County School Districts for enrolling in the Teacher Classroom Supply Debit Card program. The tax-exempt ID number on every debit card will allow teachers to shop for school supplies tax free for the entire year. I encourage all Florida school districts to follow the lead of Broward, Hamilton, Hendry, Jefferson, Levy and Orange County school districts and enroll in this great program for their teachers."
With the Teacher Classroom Supply Debit Card, teachers can buy supplies tax-free and purchase products at a reduced rate from the Florida state term contracts and discounts available on the VISA website. Teachers interested in the debit card should contact their school district to encourage the district to enroll in the Florida Teachers Classroom Supply Assistance Debit Card Program.
