Today we recognize the strength and commitment of our country's workforce. Because of the dedication of the American worker, we have a great nation built through ingenuity, perseverance and determination. I am also reminded today of the tough economic times we have all encountered, and how vital the ability to find a job is to those who strive to achieve the American Dream.
As our state struggles though the highest unemployment rate on record, we must redouble our efforts to build an economy and business-friendly environment where employees are needed; and, as Governor that will be my highest priority.
That is why I have a developed a 7 step plan that will create 700,000 jobs in 7 years. Take a moment to read it.
Florida has the potential to lead the way on job growth and turn our economy around. Our workers are ready. I am ready.
Let's get to work!
Rick
