Governor Rick Scott said, "We are excited to announce that Florida businesses added more than 20,000 new private-sector jobs last month and our unemployment rate has been cut in half over the last four and a half years. We want Florida to be the first in the nation for jobs and with more than 940,000 private-sector jobs added since December 2010, we are well on our way to reaching that goal."
Luis Orbegoso, President of ADT Business, said, "With an excellent quality of life, wonderful schools, beautiful parks, and no state income tax, ADT is proud to be headquartered in Florida. As one of the oldest and most respected brands in the state, we are excited to welcome Governor Scott here today to share in our growth. ADT is constantly innovating, and we look forward to many more years of success in Florida and nationwide."
The August 2015 unemployment rate is the lowest since February 2008, when it was 5.2 percent. Florida's unemployment rate has declined by 5.4 percentage points since December 2010.
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "Florida's economic resurgence continued in August with a nation-leading growth rate for private-sector jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in seven years.
