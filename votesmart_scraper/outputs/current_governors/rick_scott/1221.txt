County Business Development Roundtables

This week, I met with business and community leadership from counties in the Panhandle, North Central Florida and the Lake Okeechobee area. It's always helpful to meet with Floridians to hear first-hand what we can do to help create jobs. Every day, I continue to work to make Florida the No. 1 state for business. It is our goal to ensure that every Floridian who wants a job has the opportunity to get one.
Having conversations with business leaders across the state allows my administration to better serve the people of Florida. I will work to continue this open dialogue that allows Floridians to hold their government accountable. I believe elected officials have a moral responsibility to help create an environment for businesses to succeed, and my administration will continue to do just that.
