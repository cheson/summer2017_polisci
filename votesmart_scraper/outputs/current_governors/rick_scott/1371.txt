This month Florida's business environment was ranked third in the nation by Chief Executive Magazine. That is three places higher than the 6th place ranking we received last year.
While third is pretty good, Texas was ranked at the top -- for the 7th year in a row. I congratulated Texas Governor Perry for his state's admirable achievement. In the spirit of good-natured competition, I also warned him that 7 years at the top is long enough, and Florida is pushing to be no. 1 in job creation.
I am 100 percent confident we can achieve this goal. I am confident because Florida is the best place to live. People from all over the world visit Florida and dream of living here year round.
In addition, Florida is a great place to do business, and we are working to make it even better.
Since the legislative session ended, I've been reviewing the full impact of every bill and every line of the budget. All of them must make Florida a better place to live and play -- and a better place to start, grow or move a business.
The budget meets my 3 core principles of cutting the size and cost of government, and passing the savings on to taxpayers and businesses in the form of tax cuts. I can tell you, though, that there will be additional savings.
In these tough economic times, we must ensure every hard-earned tax dollar is used wisely and in a way that will get Florida back to work. In this way, we will make Florida the no. 1 place for business.
