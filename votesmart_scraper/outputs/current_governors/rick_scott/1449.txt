"I'm the only candidate in this race who has built businesses and helped create tens of thousands of jobs. We need to turn the current economic climate in Florida around by cutting taxes and limiting regulation to attract new industries that create jobs." -- Rick Scott
* 40% of Florida homeowners are underwater on their mortgages. Unemployment is at record highs. Our kids can't find jobs. And our state's budget is a mess. If existing politicians had the solutions, we wouldn't be in this mess. That's why it's time for taxpayers to take our state back, time for families to come first again. What's needed are fresh, conservative ideas and new leadership. We won't solve today's problems with the same old solutions. To put our state on the right path, we need a conservative who is not afraid to upset the apple cart. Florida needs an outsider who is not part of the political establishment. Taxpayers need a businessman who knows how to create jobs, cut costs and balance budgets.
* Rick has been successful in business both nationally and here in Florida: He has created jobs, cut budgets, and put the customer first. He will bring the same vision to Tallahassee.
* Rick will create jobs by keeping taxes low and limiting job killing regulations.
* Rick will ensure that Florida has an educated workforce that will allow Florida to attract new business and good paying jobs.
