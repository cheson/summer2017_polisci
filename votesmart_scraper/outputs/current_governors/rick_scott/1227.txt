"This weekend Floridians throughout our state will remember the men and women of the United States Armed Forces who have lost their lives while serving our country throughout our nation's history. As we come together with family and friends to honor our fallen military and veterans, let us also bring to mind the tremendous sacrifice they have made for our benefit.
"Those who serve in the Armed Forces risk their lives to preserve our national independence and the unmatched freedom we enjoy as United States citizens. Our military defends our own democracy, as well as assists emerging democratic societies around the globe. These opportunities for freedom are made possible only through the selfless sacrifice of our military.
"To those currently serving in the Armed Forces and the Florida National Guard, Lt. Governor Jennifer Carroll, Ann and I want to express our appreciation for your bravery and willingness to spend time away from your family and loved ones. Know that we are praying for your safety and for your families here at home to receive the strength and support they need.
"On Monday, I urge all Floridians to join me in observing a Moment of Remembrance at 12 p.m. noon local time. This time of reflection will honor the men and women of our military, both past and present, for their service and sacrifice."
