Governor Rick Scott's Weekly Radio Address
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: June 1, 2011

This is Governor Rick Scott. This Independence Day, Ann and I join families across Florida in celebrating the birth of our nation. As we celebrate this holiday weekend, we honor our servicemen and women in the United States Armed Forces and the Florida National Guard for their bravery as they defend our freedom at home and abroad.
If fireworks or an outdoor barbeque are part of your plans, I ask you to use extreme care. Many counties are still experiencing severe drought conditions, and it's up to all of us to protect our state from wildfires.
This week I visited Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami to discuss legislation that improves quality of care and bolsters our health care safety net while also protecting taxpayers from out of control Medicaid costs.
One of the bills I signed requires urgent care centers to be transparent about the cost of medical care. This bill will provide easy access to the price of the 50 most used services at each center. Empowered with information about costs, patients who pay out-of-pocket for medical care can choose the most affordable provider for the care they need -- and save money on their health care costs.
With patient choice, quality care and protection for taxpayers, Florida will be a national model for Medicaid reform and quality health care.
