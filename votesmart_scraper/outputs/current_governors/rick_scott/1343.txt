This week, I would like to talk about how important the free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama are to Florida's future.
Florida has a unique opportunity to become a major hub for international trade for South and Central American and the Southeastern United States.
With the anticipated expansion of the Panama Canal in 2014, along with how we are improving Florida's seaports, these agreements would result in an immediate economic boost for Florida.
Both Panama and Colombia have worked to open their economies to the outside world and the work has paid off: Colombia's GDP has grown five percent in recent years and Panama's is expected to grow by four percent this year.
In fact, nearly half of all U.S. made high-tech goods exported to Colombia come from right here in Florida.
Ratified trade agreements will increase Florida exports by at least $523 million and create 6,400 jobs. In fact, Florida stands to benefit more than any other state.
With increased trade, lower taxes and the elimination of burdensome regulation, Florida is well on the way to becoming the number-one destination to start, grow or move a business.
