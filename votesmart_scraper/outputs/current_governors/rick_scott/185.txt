Gov. Scott: Disappointing the Obama Administration Denied Request for Emergency Declaration Following Terror Attack
Press Release
By: Rick Scott
Date: June 20, 2016
Location: Orlando, FL

Today, the Obama Administration rejected Governor Scott's request for an Emergency Declaration under the Stafford Act following last week's terror attack at Pulse Nightclub. By denying this request, the federal government will not provide the $5 million in federal funds requested by Governor Scott to help with emergency response efforts, law enforcement response, emergency medical care, counseling services and other social services to assist victims. The federal government, however, will allocate $253,000 to help pay for overtime for first responders.
Governor Rick Scott said, "It is incredibly disappointing that the Obama Administration denied our request for an Emergency Declaration. Last week, a terrorist killed 49 people, and wounded many others, which was the deadliest shooting in U.S. history. It is unthinkable that President Obama does not define this as an emergency. We are committing every state resource possible to help the victims and the community heal and we expect the same from the federal government."
Below are examples of emergency declarations that the federal government has approved:
President Obama's Inauguration in 2009
Massachusetts Water Main Break in 2010
Boston Bombing in 2013
West Fertilizer Company Explosion in 2013
Flint Water Crisis in 2016
