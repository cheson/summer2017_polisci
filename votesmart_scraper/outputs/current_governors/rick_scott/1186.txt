Governor Rick Scott and the Department of Business and Professional Regulation's Division of Certified Public Accounting today announced the department is awarding $99,000 in scholarships to 16 minority students studying to become certified public accountants at Florida higher educational institutions. The scholarships were awarded through the CPA Education Minority Assistance Program, which was created in 1999 to encourage minorities to enter the profession.
"Florida is home to exceptional universities that train students to compete in the global market place and I am pleased to award these students for their hard work to become certified public accounts," said Governor Rick Scott. "In order for Florida to be the number one place for businesses to grow we must have the most skilled workforce in the nation. I encourage these students to stay in Florida once they have obtained their professional licensure and contribute to our state's positive economic development."
The CPA Education Minority Assistance Program is funded by a $5 portion from each individual and firm license fee.
