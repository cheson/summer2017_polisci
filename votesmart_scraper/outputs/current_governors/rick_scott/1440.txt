Rick Scott released the following statement regarding today's nonfarm payroll report.
Rick Scott said, "Today's report that 54,000 people have lost their jobs serves as a stark reminder to Floridians that the policies trumpeted by Alex Sink and President Obama are driving our economy down the drain. From the stimulus to healthcare reform, the policies of the Obamacrats are only keeping more Americans out of work as opposed to my plan of reducing regulation and taxes to create 700,000 jobs in Florida."
