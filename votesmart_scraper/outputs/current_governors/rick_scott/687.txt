Today, during a Veterans Day Reception at the Governor's mansion, Governor Rick Scott awarded 61 Florida veterans with the Governor's Veterans Service Award for their service to Florida and the nation.
Governor Rick Scott said, "It is an honor to join Floridians in recognizing America's heroes today. Our veterans have made countless contributions to help preserve freedom and democracy in America, and Veterans Day is a great opportunity to reflect on those contributions. With more than 1.5 million veterans who call Florida home, I have had the privilege to meet so many of these veterans as I travel the state and listen to their stories. We thank our veterans for their service and sacrifice, and we will keep working to make Florida the most military-friendly state in the nation."
