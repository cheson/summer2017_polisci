Governor Rick Scott announced today that the Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall metro area gained the second-highest number of jobs in June 2014 among all metro areas in Florida compared to a year ago with 29,600 new jobs. The area's unemployment rate declined by 1.9 percentage points over the year, from 9.2 percent in June 2013 to 7.3 percent in June 2014.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Today's news that 29,600 jobs were created in the Miami area over the year is evidence that our pro business policies are working in this part of the state. While this is great news, let's keep working to make an opportunity economy with jobs that will last for generations to come."
The industries with the largest job gains over the year in Miami were in trade, transportation, and utilities with 5,900 new jobs, and leisure and hospitality and professional and business services with 5,400 new jobs each.
The Miami metro area had the third-highest online job demand in Florida in June 2014 with 32,744 job openings and had the third-highest number of openings for STEM occupations in June 2014 with 6,776 online openings. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.
In June, CareerSource South Florida, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 35,000 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 7,239 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.
Florida created 36,900 private-sector jobs in June 2014, the single highest month of private-sector job creation since the Governor took office. Since December 2010, Florida has created 620,700 private sector jobs. Florida's statewide unemployment rate for June 2014 was 6.2 percent, down 1.2 percentage points from the June 2013 rate.
