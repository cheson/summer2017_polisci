Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that the Governor's Office will begin accepting applications for the Florida Constitution Revision Commission. The 37 member Commission convenes every 20 years to review Florida's Constitution and propose potential changes to be approved by Florida voters.
Governor Scott said, "Every 20 years, we are given the opportunity to review Florida's Constitution to ensure that our laws are best serving the citizens of our state. The Constitution Revision Commission will serve on behalf of all Floridians, and appointees will learn firsthand what issues and potential changes are most important to our families in order to best make these impactful decisions. I encourage Floridians interested in serving on the Commission to apply today and I look forward to appointing qualified individuals who will represent our families and communities."
