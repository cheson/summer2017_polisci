Governor Rick Scott released the following statement today on President Obama's interim nuclear deal with Iran:
"President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran does nothing to stop the country's pursuit of nuclear weapons. The deal relieves Iran from economic sanctions while allowing them to continue to enrich uranium. This could prove to be a dangerous formula for the safety of our ally Israel, the Middle East and the world."
