Governor Rick Scott today welcomed Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to Florida where she will be visiting Miami International Airport (MIA) to review U.S. Customs and Border Protection staffing issues. Following complaints of long-wait times and a chaotic clearance process caused by the United States Customs and Border Protection not staffing the passport control lanes and exits sufficiently, Governor Scott sent a letter to Secretary Napolitano in September outlining the issues facing MIA and asking her to visit the airport to see the challenge first hand.
Governor Rick Scott said, "Miami International Airport is the nation's number one airport for international flights and I am pleased Secretary Napolitano has decided to accept my invitation to visit the airport to take a closer look at staffing needs there. We must ensure Florida is well-positioned to welcome new and returning visitors to the Sunshine State.
"If this staffing problem is not corrected immediately, it has the potential to damage Florida's international competitiveness. More than 1 million jobs in Florida depend on international trade and investment, which is one of the healthiest and fastest growing sectors of our economy. We look forward to hearing Secretary Napolitano's solutions to improve this important customer service issue because we want to ensure that those who visit Florida and who conduct business here are able to clear customs efficiently.
