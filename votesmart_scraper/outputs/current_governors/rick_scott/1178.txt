Governor Scott issued the following statement in response to recent congressional resolutions expressing America's unwavering commitment to Israel's security:
"I commend Florida's congressional delegation for supporting House Resolution 813 and Senate Resolution 599. These important resolutions reiterate America's unwavering support for Israel during this difficult time. When I visited Israel last year, I learned firsthand of Hamas' relentless campaign of terror against Israel's southern cities. Now, after a year in which Hamas has launched nearly 900 missile and rocket attacks, Israel has initiated defensive measures to protect its citizens. Like all democracies, Israel has the inherent right to act in self-defense to end terrorist attacks. I stand firmly with our ally Israel and offer my continued prayers for peace and security."
