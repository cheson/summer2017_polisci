Today, Governor Rick Scott released the following statement on Venezuela and Maria Corina Machado:
"It is beyond shameful that the Obama Administration attempted to impede the testimony of Maria Corina Machado before the Organization of American States. This unacceptable action by the Obama Administration only hurts those fighting for the freedom of the Venezuelan people and helps the goal of the Maduro regime to repress freedom fighters. For the sake of the Venezuelan people we must categorically denounce these actions."
