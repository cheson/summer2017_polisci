Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) led all metro areas in over the year job creation, with a gain of more than 31,000 jobs. The MSA also experienced a 1.8 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate during the same time period, down to 8.0 percent. Additionally, since December 2010 the metro area's unemployment rate has declined 3.4 percentage points, dropping from 11.4 percent to 8.0 percent.
Governor Scott said, "Everything we do is geared toward job creation and today we have more proof that IT'S WORKING. The creation of over 31,000 jobs in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area is further proof that the steps we're taking to create jobs and opportunities for Florida families is working. Statewide, we've added more than 280,000 private-sector jobs over the last two years, which means we're providing hundreds of thousands of opportunities for families across the Sunshine State to pursue the American Dream."
"We are extremely proud of the progress our region has made in finding employment for many of our residents who were out of work, and we appreciate the support of Governor Scott and our statewide partners in helping us achieve this goal," said Ed Peachey, President/CEO or WorkNet Pinellas and Tampa Bay Workforce Alliance. "Getting our community back to work and ensuring that current and future employers have a skilled and talented workforce available to them remains our No. 1 goal."
