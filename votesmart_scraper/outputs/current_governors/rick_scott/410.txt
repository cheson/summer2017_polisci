Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the number of online job openings in Florida were up over the year in July 2015, with over 273,900 job openings. The figures from Help Wanted OnLine are the highest for the month of July for online job demand since May 2005.
Governor Scott said, "The demand for jobs across the state is growing and the good news is that we have many opportunities available for families to get a great job in Florida. By cutting taxes 50 times -- including $400 million this year -- we are helping job creators provide more opportunities for Florida families to find fulfilling careers."
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Jesse Panuccio said, "Job openings are an important economic indicator, and July continued a long-term trend of robust demand across the state. The openings are across industries, pay scales, and skill levels. This is good news for job seekers at all points in their careers, and it shows that Florida's pro-growth economic policies are working."
Job demand in Florida increased over the year by nearly 8,000 openings, an increase of three percent. The top occupation in demand continues to be registered nurses, and ranges from web developers and systems analysts to administrative and retail workers. Online job demand was highest in the large metro cities, led by Tampa, Miami, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Fort Lauderdale.
The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity combines the state's economic, workforce, and community development efforts. This new approach helps expedite economic development projects to fuel job creation in competitive communities.
