Today, Governor Rick Scott issued the following statement supporting Israel in its ongoing conflict with Hamas:
Governor Scott said, "I stand firmly with our ally Israel and unequivocally support Israel's right to defend herself from vicious terrorist attacks launched by Hamas and other terrorist organizations. While the Middle East is in turmoil, Israel remains an island of stability and democracy. As home to one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel, Florida has a special relationship with Israel. It was my honor and privilege to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu during my trade mission to Israel, and I am proud to offer Israel my solidarity and support during this difficult time."
