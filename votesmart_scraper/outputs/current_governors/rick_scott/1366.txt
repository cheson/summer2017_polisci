Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: May 27, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"This Memorial Day, I join Floridians in commemorating all of the men and women of the United States Armed Forces who have lost their lives while serving this great nation of ours. This day is set aside to provide us with the opportunity to come together with family and friends so that we may remember, reflect, and honor those we have lost throughout our nation's history.
"Americans are able to enjoy a life of freedom because of the valor and selflessness of those who serve in the Armed Forces, many of whom have given their lives in order to preserve these civil liberties. Our military has been essential in defending democracy, both for our nation and others across the world. It is important to remember, today and every day, what some have given up while making the lives we enjoy today possible.
"This is also a day for us to pay respect to those who are currently serving in the Armed Forces and to show our appreciation for their bravery and the sacrifices they continually make. Let us pray for the safety of the courageous servicemen and servicewomen who are overseas, as well as comfort and strength for their families here at home.
"I ask you all to join me in observing a Moment of Remembrance this Memorial Day at 3 p.m. local time. This will provide us all with a moment to honor those who have served in the military and reflect upon the ultimate sacrifice some have paid to help ensure our freedom.
"I would like to thank our military men and women, both past and present, for all that they have done and continue to do for us. May God bless you all."
