Statement from Governor Rick Scott Regarding Rosh Hashanah
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Sept. 28, 2011
Location: Tallahassee, FL

"Tonight at sundown marks the beginning of Rosh Hashanah, a new year for the Jewish people. This sacred time also begins the period of High Holy Days, a time of spiritual renewal and reflection for many Floridians.
"During this season, I am reminded of the joys of faith and family and the universal quest to grow closer to our Maker. May the call of the shofar remind us all of the importance of tradition and values in these challenging times.
"The High Holy Days should also remind us of the invaluable freedoms we enjoy as Americans and the brave men and women who protect those freedoms at home and abroad. It is also important to remember the contributions the Jewish community make to our state and nation's diverse heritage and spiritual makeup.
"Ann and I wish all Floridians observing the High Holy Days a happy and healthy New Year. L'shanah tova!"
