Rick Scott Statement On State Of The Governor's Race
Statement
By: Rick Scott
Date: Sept. 1, 2010
Location: Fort Lauderdale, FL

Rick Scott released the following statement today on the news that Bud Chiles will leave the governor's race.
"We have always planned on a two person race for governor," said Scott. "This will be a contest which presents a clear choice between a conservative outsider with business experience and a specific plan to create 700,000 jobs and another liberal Obamacrat who wants to raise taxes, cut Medicare, and supports Obama's failed stimulus. Anyone who doubted that Chiles would eventually drop out underestimates how desperately Obama liberals like Alex Sink want to do to FL what they have done to America."
