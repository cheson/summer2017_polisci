Letter to Barack Obama, President of the United States - Venezuela
Letter
By: Rick Scott
Date: July 30, 2014
Location: Washington, DC

Dear Mr. President,
I'm writing to you, once again, about the growing unrest in Venezuela. I sent you several thousand petitions signed by Venezuelans from throughout Florida calling on you to take action by placing sanctions against members of the Maduro government that have been involved in the violent crack-down against the people of Venezuelan. I have yet to receive a response.
Your Administration's inaction has only emboldened the Maduro government to continue the violence and orchestrate a sham of a trial against democracy leader Leopoldo Lopez. The recent release in Aruba by the government of Netherlands of Commander Hugo Carvajal, who is linked to the guerrilla of the FARC and to narco-trafficking, further highlights the United States' lack of leadership before the international community. For Carvajal, who is wanted by the DEA, to be released to Maduro is nothing short of an embarrassment for our country.
Mr. President, I urge you to take seriously the crisis in Venezuela and support the measures recommended by Senator Marco Rubio as well as instruct your State Department to carry-out a diplomatic initiative that will seek the international condemnation of the Maduro government.
Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Rick Scott
Governor
