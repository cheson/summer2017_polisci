Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced Floridians and visitors will be able to fish without a freshwater recreational fishing license on April 4 and 5.
Governor Scott said, "Florida is the Fishing Capital of the World, and fishing is an economic engine for our state, providing jobs across Florida. These designated license-free fishing days are a great opportunity for Floridians and our visitors to enjoy spring weather with their families and loved ones. I look forward to taking my grandsons fishing next weekend, and we hope everyone takes advantage of the license-free fishing."
"We hope visitors and residents alike will be able to join in the excitement of Florida's freshwater fishing," said FWC Chairman Richard Corbett. "This is an excellent opportunity to share the fun and togetherness of a fishing trip with the entire family or to introduce someone to a lifelong hobby of fishing."
Freshwater fishing has an annual economic impact (recreational) of $1.7 billion, sustaining 14,000 jobs.
