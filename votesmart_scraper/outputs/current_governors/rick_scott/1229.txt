"Next week, I will be leading an economic development mission to Spain. Along with a delegation of more than sixty Florida business leaders and economic development professionals, I will work to develop economic ties between Florida and Spain. The objective of this mission is twofold. We will promote the five-hundredth anniversary celebration of Spanish presence in Florida and further cement our cultural ties. Next, I will promote Florida as the ideal location for Spanish companies to do business.
Spain has been one of the fastest growing foreign investors in Florida in recent years. Well over 300 Spanish companies maintain operations in our state. Spain is also an important source of tourism to Florida and I will promote Florida as the world's number one tourist destination. By developing and maintaining relationships with key economic partners, we can ensure that Florida's economy continues to grow."
