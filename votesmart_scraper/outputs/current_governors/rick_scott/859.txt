Today, Governor Rick Scott met with representatives from the American Cancer Society to discuss the investment in the "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget" to make Florida among the best states in the nation for cancer research. The Governor's proposed funding for cancer research includes $60 million for existing Florida Cancer Centers to assist in achieving National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation, and another $20 million commitment for peer-reviewed research grants.
Governor Scott said, "Investing in cancer research is important to all Floridians, and will help save the lives of countless individuals. Because of Florida's high-quality cancer research centers, Floridians don't have to leave our state to receive world-class treatment. I am glad to meet with representatives from the American Cancer Society to discuss the importance of cancer research funding, and how we can work together to eliminate this terrible disease."
