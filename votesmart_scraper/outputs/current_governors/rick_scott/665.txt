Location: Tallahassee, FL

Today, Governor Rick Scott honored Private First Class Justin Johnson from Punta Gorda, Florida and Staff Sergeant Patrick Zeigler from Orange County, Florida, who are expected to be awarded Purple Heart Medals for their bravery during the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. President Obama is expected to sign legislation authorizing Purple Heart Medals for acts of heroism during the 2009 Fort Hood Shooting after passage of the bill in the US House and US Senate.
Governor Scott said, "Florida stands proudly as two Floridians -- Private First Class Justin Johnson and Staff Sergeant Patrick Zeigler -- are expected to be awarded the Purple Heart for their bravery during the 2009 Fort Hood Shooting. Both men sustained injuries in the massacre. As a veteran myself, I join all Floridians to express sincere gratitude to Justin and Patrick and their families today for their sacrifice.
"We also remember Sergeant Danny Ferguson, from Mulberry, Florida, who lost his life during the 2014 Fort Hood Shooting. The horrific acts that happened at Ft. Hood will forever be remembered by all Americans and we will continue to honor those who were injured, or killed, and their families."
