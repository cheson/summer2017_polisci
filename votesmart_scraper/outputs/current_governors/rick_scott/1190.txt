Hi, I'm Governor Rick Scott.
Last week, Florida showed the world that we are the best state in the nation for being prepared for hurricanes and other emergencies. Because of the hard work by our state, local and federal emergency management teams, Florida was prepared for Isaac.
Our primary concern throughout the storm was the safety of the 19 million people that call Florida home, as well as the 1.5 million visitors we have in our state daily. Now that Isaac has passed, we are focused on making sure that the affected areas in our state recover. We have repeatedly seen that Floridians come together in a time of need. There are many ways you can lend a hand.
One way is to visit the website www.volunteerfloridadisaster.org to donate to Florida's disaster fund, Neighbors to the Rescue. As always, you can also help by donating to an established relief organization of your choice. As Floridians, we know how devastating severe weather can be, so it's important that we remain prepared.
