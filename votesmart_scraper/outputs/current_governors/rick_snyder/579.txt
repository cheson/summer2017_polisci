Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation revising the Michigan Merit Curriculum to allow school districts the flexibility to enhance career technical education programs.
The bills, approved with strong bipartisan support, will assist more students in taking courses where they can obtain technical, employable skills that lead to good jobs.
"We want to make sure students have options for career-oriented courses that include material from rigorous subjects and that maintain high educational standards," Snyder said.
"We know that a strong public education is an important part of Michigan's comeback. Career-technical classes play an important role in developing talent and helping open opportunities for students for jobs of today and tomorrow."
House Bill 4465, sponsored by state Rep. Ed McBroom, amends the Michigan Merit Curriculum to allow students to fulfill the algebra II requirement by completing a career and technical education program that has the material embedded into lessons.
The bill also provides additional opportunities for students to pursue courses that will prepare them for careers in skilled trades, while maintaining high standards in terms of required curriculum. It is now Public Act 208 of 2014.
HB 4466, sponsored by state Rep. Joel Johnson, requires that students be informed about potential career and technical education options and streamlines the process for students who wish to pursue the personal curriculum option. It is now Public Act 209 of 2014.
