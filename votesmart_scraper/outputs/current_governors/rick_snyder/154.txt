Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that April unemployment rates declined in all of Michigan's regional labor markets. The state's unemployment rate remains below the national average at 4.8% and at its lowest rate in 15 years.
"It is critically important that all Michiganders have an opportunity to be part of our state's comeback. To see the unemployment rate fall in each of Michigan's regional labor markets is outstanding news and something everyone should be proud of. Through initiatives like the Rising Tide program, we continue to make progress and will remain focused on building a stronger future for every community. We will do that by creating an environment for more and better jobs, updating our seen and unseen infrastructure, and improving our education system so that students are equipped with the skills needed for the new opportunities they'll have in Michigan's reinvented economy."
