Location: Lansing, MI

Several responsibilities of certain skilled trades boards will transfer to the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs under Executive Order 2017-3, signed Monday by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"As we continue reinventing state government to serve our customers better, it's important to ensure all systems are working in the most efficient and effective way possible," Snyder said. "Centralizing these functions in the department will allow us to streamline services for all Michiganders."
Executive Order 2017-3 eliminates duplicative and unnecessary processes that exist at the board and department levels. Boards affected by this order include:
The Board of Boiler Rules
The Electrical Administrative Board
The Elevator Safety Board
The Board of Mechanical Rules
The State Plumbing Board
The Building Officials Advisory Board
These boards will still maintain the ability to call special meetings, make recommendations to the department, advise on rulemaking and determine licensing standards.
A full list of responsibilities can be found in the Executive Order.
