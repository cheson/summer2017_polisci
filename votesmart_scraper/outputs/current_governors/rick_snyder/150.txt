Blog: State to go 'Purple!' for Alzheimer's Awareness Month
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 1, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

June 2016 is "Alzheimer's Awareness Month' in Michigan and the state is going "Purple!' to raise awareness of this effort.
As Michiganders, we need to reach out and show our support for the people, families, and caregivers affected by Alzheimer's. More than 5 million Americans -- 180,000 in Michigan alone - suffer from this disease. It is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States. In 2015, more than 15 million caregivers nationally provided more than 18.1 billion hours of unpaid care
To help bring attention to this important issue, Governor Snyder's official Facebook and Twitter accounts, as well as his website, will be "going purple." In addition, facts about Alzheimer's disease and links to resources for those needing help will be shared via social media throughout the month.
In a proclamation, the governor called on Michigan residents to join in tweeting, posting and sharing their stories and thoughts on Alzheimer's awareness using the #puremipurple hashtag on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
Those seeking more information about Alzheimer's disease and the free support and services the Alzheimer's Association offers are encouraged to call the 24/7 helpline at 800-272-3900 or visit http://www.alz.org to find out how to contact the Chapter that serves their community.
