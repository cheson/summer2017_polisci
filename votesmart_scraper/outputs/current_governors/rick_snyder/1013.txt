Health is the foundation for Michigan's economic transformation and overall quality of life, Gov. Rick Snyder said today in laying out his vision for improving health and wellness across the state.
The governor presented his Special Message to the Legislature on Health and Wellness during a visit to the Heart of the City Health Center in Grand Rapids.
Good health allows children to thrive and learn, it readies graduates for meaningful careers and it permits our current work force to grow and adapt to a dynamic economy. Healthier residents also strengthen families and communities. The governor emphasized that every Michigander has a role to play in improving health and wellness. While medical advances can address many problems, all Michiganders have the power to improve their own health. This is critical because many of the chronic conditions we face, from diabetes to coronary heart disease, are greatly influenced by our lifestyle choices.
"By embracing positive habits such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting an annual checkup and not using tobacco, we can significantly improve our health," Snyder said. "Committing to these lifestyle choices is good for us as individuals and good for us as a state. When it comes to health and wellness, we can and we must do better."
Currently 67 percent of Michigan adults are overweight or obese. In fact, Michigan is eighth in the nation with an adult obesity rate of 31.7 percent. This is significant because obesity is linked to several chronic conditions, including diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Obesity also has taken a toll on our state financially. Nearly $3 billion in annual medical costs are attributed to obesity - a cost that taxpayers and job providers can no longer afford.
