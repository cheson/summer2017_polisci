Snyder Signs VO-4 Legislation Strengthening Penalties for Repeat Felons
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Oct. 1, 2012
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed the Violent Offense-Fourth Felony (VO-4) legislation, requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years in prison for violent repeat offenders. The measure is part of Attorney General Bill Schuette's public safety and crime prevention initiative.

"This is an important part of reinventing public safety in Michigan," Snyder said. "By holding chronic offenders accountable we can keep our communities safe, bring peace of mind to victims and their families, and help Michigan reach its full potential."

Under Senate Bill 1109, sponsored by Sen. Rick Jones, those who have committed four felonies while progressing to more violent crimes like attempted murder, assault with the intent to commit murder, criminal sexual conduct, carjacking or kidnapping are subject to the stricter penalty.

"VO-4 helps ensure safer communities by giving prosecutors a tool to remove the worst of the worst - violent, repeat offenders - from our streets," said Schuette. "I am pleased to join Governor Snyder, Speaker Bolger, Majority Leader Richardville, Representative Walsh and Senator Jones to make Michigan safer by putting public safety first. We will never have a full economic recovery until we have safety in our streets, neighborhoods, and schools."

SB 1109 is now Public Act 319 of 2012.
