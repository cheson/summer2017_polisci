Snyder Signs Budget Supplemental that Includes $4 Million for Testing Detroit Rape Kits
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed a supplemental budget bill that includes $4 million for the State Forensics Laboratory Fund to conduct DNA testing on thousands of unprocessed rape kits from crimes committed in the city of Detroit.
"Thousands of victims have been waiting too long for the justice they deserve. This effort will start us on the path to find justice for these victims. It also will help improve public safety in Michigan by helping us catch and lock up these vicious criminals," Snyder said. "This initiative shows how state and local agencies can work together and find new ways to fight crime."
The appropriation is funded by settlement monies successfully recovered by Attorney General Bill Schuette from state and national litigation.
"Twice women were violated, first by the rape, and second when justice was left in a box on the shelf. That's going to end, starting now. I cannot thank Gov. Snyder and Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy enough for working together with us to make this happen," Schuette said.
In 2009, approximately 11,300 untested rape kits dating back 25 years were discovered in a Detroit Police Department property storage facility. Each rape kit has the potential to solve multiple crimes, including those committed by serial rapists.
Since the closure of the Detroit Police Department Crime Laboratory in September 2009, the Michigan State Police (MSP) has been providing forensic science services to the city of Detroit and the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office. The MSP's Forensic Science Division has been instrumental in the laboratory analysis of sexual assault kits and will continue to work with the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office and the Detroit Police Department on efforts to test the kits.
