Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Bill Continuing Funding to Help Develop a Statewide Trauma System
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation ensuring funding continues for statewide coordination of trauma services that will improve emergency care in Michigan.
"This support allows Michigan to develop a regionalized, coordinated and accountable trauma system, which delivers the right resources to the right patient at the right time," Snyder said.
House Bill 4915, sponsored by state Rep. Matt Lori, extends the sunset date for fees from the Crime Victim's Rights Fund for the trauma system until Oct. 1, 2018. Original legislation to fund this system was passed in 2010, but a technical issue in the legislation led to a delay in fee collection, requiring more time to collect the revenue needed to implement the statewide trauma system.
This appropriation was already included in the Fiscal Year 2015 budget, but the technical fix was required for fees to be collected. It is now Public Act 299 of 2014.
