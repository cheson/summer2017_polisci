Gov. Rick Snyder: Dramatic Drop in Unemployment Rate Serves as an Inspiration to Move Forward
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Dec. 17, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for November fell four-tenths of a percent to 6.7 percent. The rate is the lowest in the state since April 2006.
"It's exciting to see the continued improvement in our unemployment rate -- the lowest in more than eight years -- because it shows the foundation we've built for economic success is strong and there are more and better jobs for Michiganders. More than 303,000 private sector jobs have been created since December 2010, showing how far we have come as a state. But it also should inspire us to reach even higher and go even further.
"There is more we can do. Our goal should be to building upon the rock-solid foundation we've established. We know that there are thousands of good paying jobs available here in Michigan. We know that a key part of an environment for success is having a well-trained workforce. And we know we can be a national leader in creating opportunities for students and adults to gain in-demand skills that can fill the jobs of today and tomorrow. Our goal is to see that the gains we are acknowledging today extend long into the future."
