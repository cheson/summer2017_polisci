Michigan Child Protection Registry Transferred to Secretary of State
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Feb. 20, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the Michigan Child Protection Registry has been transferred from the state Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs to the Department of State. The registry helps shield families from unwanted adult advertising.
"The Child Protection Registry is a helpful resource for parents," Snyder said. "I'm confident that, under the leadership of Secretary of State Ruth Johnson, the program will deliver the best possible service for Michigan families."
Executive Order 2014-5 transfers all of the registry's authority, powers, duties, functions and responsibilities to the Department of State, effective 60 days after filing. The department, Snyder said, will be a good fit for the program, given its broader reach and extensive experience with public safety programs and interacting with parents and students through driver education and driver license functions.
Secretary Johnson, who has an ongoing interest in child protection issues, believes housing the registry within the Secretary of State's office makes sense.
"Our department has contact with more Michigan citizens than any other state agency and that provides an ideal opportunity for us to advance the mission of this registry and protect our children," Johnson said.
The registry was created in 2004 and serves as an email "Do Not Call" list to help protect children and minors from receiving adult-oriented messages. Registered addresses and numbers are protected from messages that advertise pornography, tobacco, illegal drugs, alcohol and gambling.
