Location: Lansing, MI

The state or federal government must now provide alternative water supplies to users whose water is contaminated as a result of substances migrating from government owned and operated properties under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder. The legislation was prompted by groundwater and well contamination at the former federal Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda.
"Every Michigander deserves access to a clean, safe supply of water for drinking and cooking," Snyder said. "This bill helps ensure that Michigan residents get the quality water they deserve in instances where their current supply becomes contaminated because of substances from state or federal properties."
SB 950, sponsored by state Sen. Jim Stamas, is now Public Act 545 of 2016.
Gov. Snyder also signed 14 additional bills:
Senate Bill 72, sponsored by state Sen. Rick Jones, allows landlords to ban renters from cultivating or smoking medical marijuana on their property, if the written lease contains language stating the ban. SB 141, also sponsored by Jones, makes a technical amendment to existing law that lays out the sentencing guidelines for the illegal sale of medical marijuana. SBs 1175 and 1176, sponsored by state Sens. Rick Jones and Mike Shirkey, respectively, clarify that penalties and sentencing for crimes involving synthetic marijuana are equivalent to those involving plant-derived marijuana. The measures are now Public Acts 546, 547 and 548-549 of 2016.
SB 289, sponsored by state Sen. Margaret O'Brien, creates a state prohibition on patent trolls, in an effort to stop bad-faith patent infringement and save employers from having to pay needless litigation expenses. It is now Public Act 550 of 2016.
SB 884, sponsored by state Sen. Goeff Hansen, extends the current sunset for maintenance of effort payments made by counties to the state in relation to their Medicaid-funded long-term care nursing home facilities. The sunset was set to expire on Dec. 31, 2017, but will now last until Dec. 31, 2022. The bill is now Public Act 551 of 2016.
SBs 982-985, sponsored by state Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker, create uniformity with other states regarding debtors who transfer assets to avoid paying debts to creditors. The measures are now Public Acts 552-555 of 2016.
SB 1104, sponsored by state Sen. Mike Shirkey, limits damages for past medical or rehabilitation service expenses to actual damages for medical care that arose out of an alleged malpractice in a medical malpractice lawsuit. It is now Public Act 556 of 2016.
House Bill 5421, sponsored by state Rep. Laura Cox, clarifies administration of the board of trustees for the bankruptcy trust created by the Grand Bargain for Detroit, including removal of trustees. It is now Public Act 557 of 2016.
HB 5514, sponsored by state Rep. Lana Theis, amends the insurance code to update the mortality tables used for determining minimum valuation standards for annuity and pure endowment contracts. These tables are used to calculate the reserves insurance companies must maintain for their annuity contracts and ensure continued company solvency. The tables are updated periodically to reflect actuarially supported updates in life expectancies. The bill also eliminates an outdated $25 filing fee. It is now Public Act 558 of 2016.
HB 5782, sponsored by state Rep. Mike Callton, amends the Mental Health Code to allow otherwise confidential mental health information to be shared as necessary for the treatment, coordination of care, payment, or delivery of mental health services. This bill codifies a recommendation of the Michigan Mental Health and Wellness Commission, which was created by Gov. Snyder in 2013 and chaired by Lt. Gov. Brian Calley. It is now Public Act 559 of 2016.
