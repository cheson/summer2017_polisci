Acts of violence against pregnant women in Michigan will have increased penalties under legislation signed today by Lt. Gov. Brian Calley.
"Physical violence against anyone is unacceptable, but violence against pregnant women is especially terrible and should be strongly punished regardless of the attacker's relationship to the woman," Calley said. "Updating this law shows that violence will not be tolerated in our state."
House Bills 4479 and 4788, sponsored by state Rep. Amanda Price, expand current penalties for the assault and/or battery of a pregnant woman regardless of relationship to the woman. The bills are now Public Acts 87 and 88 of 2016.
Calley also signed three other bills:
Senate Bills 508 and 509, sponsored by state Sen. Steve Bieda, prohibits cyber revenge, the intentional posting, sharing, or publishing of sexually explicit material of an adult without their consent. Penalties for cyber revenge will include imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $1,000. The bills are now PA 89 and 90.
HB 4477, sponsored by Rep. Kesto, codifies existing court practices for delivering legal notices on appeal to protected persons, including those with personal protection orders. It is now PA 91.
