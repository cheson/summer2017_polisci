"Happy Thanksgiving, Michigan! We set aside this special day of thanks to express gratitude for the many blessings we have in our lives.
"We'll gather with our friends, families, and neighbors to celebrate one of our nation's oldest traditions. Let's also pause to remember and thank those who are in the armed forces defending our nation.
"As Americans and Michiganders, we have so much to be thankful for. Together, we have worked hard to reinvent our state. Now more people are headed to work, and our children are finding more opportunities close to home as they search for jobs. We're home to talented people, strong industries, outstanding schools, incredible natural resources, and a bright future.
"And I'm thankful to serve as the governor of the state that I love.
"This is really a wonderful time of year, and I hope you enjoy time with your loved ones. Happy Thanksgiving."
