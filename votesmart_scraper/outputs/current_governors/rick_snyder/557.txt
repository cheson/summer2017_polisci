Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today urged Southeast Michigan residents affected by last week's disastrous flooding to report losses to their local governments as soon as possible. This information is essential for the state to be able to request relief from the federal government.
"Over the past several days, I've met with many residents throughout Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties and seen firsthand the tragic damage the flood caused to their homes, businesses and personal property. As I've talked with those affected, many are wondering what happens next and how we secure the financial assistance.
"We are working to complete a damage assessment as quickly as possible and I need affected residents to help us complete the process this week. It is essential that residents report their losses to their local officials: every dime and every dollar count. Keep all documents, photograph your losses and keep all receipts. Reporting damage is a vital step in applying for federal aid to get Michigan residents back on their feet after last week's devastation."
Once damage assessments are submitted to local governments, the information will be forwarded on to the state. Gov. Snyder's goal is to have all information gathered this week.
