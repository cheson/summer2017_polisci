Teachers who have retired from the profession can return to work without sacrificing pension and health care benefits if they are teaching in a critical shortage area, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Retired educators are a valuable resource," Snyder said. "Having them back in the classroom will assist schools in filling critical shortage areas where their knowledge will greatly benefit today's students."
