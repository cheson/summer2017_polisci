Gov. Rick Snyder today issued a Thanksgiving greeting for the people of Michigan.
"Hello and happy Thanksgiving!
"What a wonderful time to be thankful for family, friends, and all the great things we have in our lives.
"Thanksgiving is a story about people of different backgrounds learning from one another -- and giving thanks for all they share.
"Over the past few years we've worked together to get through some difficult times. And people came together from all across our state to help one another.
"Michigan is a big home for 10 million people. Many came here from different states and countries. We have different religions, some speak different languages. But we're all Michiganders.
"We have talented people, good jobs, strong industries, and outstanding universities. We're fortunate to be surrounded by some of the greatest natural beauty in the world. Whether it's the Great Lakes, the Sleeping Bear dunes, or our trails and rivers, it's great to call Michigan "home."
"I'm thankful for these things, and for the opportunity to serve you as governor.
"I hope you and your family enjoy your time together. Have a great Thanksgiving."
