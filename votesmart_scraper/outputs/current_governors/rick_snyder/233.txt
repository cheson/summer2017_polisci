Gov. Rick Snyder Appeals Denial of Federal Funding For Flint
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: March 3, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today submitted an appeal to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for assistance denied under the original request for an emergency. The approval could potentially bring more federal funding and much-needed resources to help the people of Flint.
"While government and independent experts say the quality of the water is improving, there is a long road ahead for Flint's recovery," Snyder said. "We are continuously working on ways to help the people of Flint recover from this health crisis. Assistance from our federal partners could go a long way in moving Flint forward."
In the appeal to the Federal Management Emergency Agency, Snyder specifically requests funding from the Category B program for emergency protective measures and the Individuals and Households Program, saying the response to the Flint water crisis requires a continued effort from all local, state, federal and national partners.
Federal Category B funding is targeted to protect public health and safety and would cover costs for provision of food and water and other essential needs, removal of health and safety hazards, activation of state or local emergency operations centers, and emergency measures to protect further damage. The Individuals and Households program can provide money for homeowners to repair damage from a disaster that is not covered by insurance, including septic or sewage systems and well or other water systems.
