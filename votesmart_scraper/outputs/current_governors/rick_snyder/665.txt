Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement regarding President Obama's visit to Michigan to sign the bipartisan, national farm bill:
"The president's visit is a well-deserved recognition of Michigan's dynamic, cutting-edge food and agriculture industry. Just as our state is a model of economic success, it also has a distinguished reputation as an agricultural leader and innovator. The president's decision to sign this vital, bipartisan legislation at Michigan State University underscores our state's importance on the global agricultural stage.
"Michigan's $96 billion food and agriculture sector continues to be one of our state's leading economic mainstays. We feed the world as well, with agriculture exports generating about $3.2 billion in economic activity. With nearly 55,000 farms and 10 million acres of farmland, we're the nation's second-most agriculturally diverse state. Clearly, Michigan is poised to remain among the top agricultural states for decades to come. The farm bill helps to provide certainty for one of our most vital industry sectors.
"The farm bill takes a more modern approach to U.S. agriculture. It reduces spending by about $23 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office; enacts needed benefit reforms while ensuring that our vulnerable are fed, provides stronger conservation measures and offers more information for consumers. It's an important bill for Michigan and we appreciate the work of U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow in moving it forward. We are honored that President Obama is signing this landmark bill at one of our world-class universities, and we welcome him to the Great Lakes State."
