Statement
By: Rick Snyder

"I appreciate that House leadership took seriously my concerns about the long-term impact of the proposal, but I still have a billion dollars worth of concerns because there has been no plan presented as to how this will affect residents and their communities statewide.
"Half of a billion dollars will come due in 2019 and over one billion by 2022, years in which we have planned funding specifically to invest in modernizing our state's infrastructure. Improving our infrastructure shouldn't be postponed, and so I'd like to see a public plan as to how this will be paid for before I can lend my support to the new proposal."
