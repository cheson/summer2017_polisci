Snyder Signs Bills Improving Adoption Process
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 15, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation streamlining the process for direct placement adoptions.
"Adoption is emotional for all involved," Snyder said. "These bills will help avoid unnecessary delay in the process encouraging a smooth transition for everyone."
House Bill 4646, sponsored by state Rep. Mike Shirkey, allows a parent or guardian to relinquish parental rights, without going to court in cases of direct placement adoption after the birth of a child. The release must be voluntarily signed following a required 72-hour wait period after the child's birth and an attorney representing the parent or guardian must be present. The out-of-court consent must be signed before filing a petition for adoption. The bill also requires the release to include the specific steps that must be taken for revocation.
It is now Public Act 117 of 2014.
