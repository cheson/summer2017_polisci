BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
BLITZER: Detroit is billions and billions of dollars in debt. Michigan's governor is not waiting any longer for a plan from the city's government.
In a very dramatic move today, he named the Washington attorney Kevyn Orr as his pick to take over the city as the emergency manager.
Republican Governor Rick Snyder is joining us, along with Kevyn Orr.
Gentlemen, thanks very much for joining us.
GOV. RICK SNYDER (R), MICHIGAN: It's great to be with you, Wolf.
KEVYN ORR, DETROIT EMERGENCY FINANCIAL MANAGER: Thank you, Wolf, for inviting us.
BLITZER: Well, Mr. Orr, let me start with you.
What are you going to do? I think you have about 18 months now to try to get Detroit's finances in order.
ORR: Wolf, the first thing I want to do is make an assessment if I can of enhancing city services to the citizens of Detroit. You know, some of the efforts have been made and there are some things in the pipeline we want to focus on those, and then I'm going to sit down with the consultants and with the restructuring team that the governor has in place to try to prioritize what we need to do next based upon the data.
