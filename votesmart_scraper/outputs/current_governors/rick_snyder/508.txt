Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement thanking Michigan's veterans for serving the state and nation.
"It's Veterans Day -- a time to honor all those women and men who have served in the Armed Forces.
"In Michigan, we're proud of the nearly 700,000 veterans who call our state home. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their service in defense of our freedoms.
"Today, the State of Michigan is working to help veterans succeed. We've passed new laws to make it easier for veterans to use their specialized skills in civilian life. We host job fairs to help veterans find new careers in our state. And the Michigan Veterans Affairs Agency helps veterans get connected to the services and benefits they deserve.
"It's great to see Michigan businesses are hiring returning veterans. They have great talents and leadership skills. I encourage companies to look to veterans when they're making hiring decisions.
"Today is a great day to honor our veterans and thank them for their service. But it shouldn't just be about today. Each and every day, we're proud to have them home. They put their lives on the line for our country, and that's a debt we can never fully repay."
