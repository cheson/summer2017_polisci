Snyder Vetoes Bill That Could Restrict Sustainable Forest Management in Michigan
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Jan. 15, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today vetoed a bill that could have restricted the Michigan Department of Natural Resources from effectively and sustainably managing forests, potentially putting Michigan's natural resources at risk.
"Biodiversity is essential to how our world-class natural resources are managed," Snyder said. "While there may be opportunities to look into our forest management practices, reducing biodiversity authority will only cause confusion and hurt our forests."
Senate Bill 78, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Casperson, would have restricted the tools the department could use for managing forests for biodiversity. In his veto letter, the governor wrote that this legislation could also threaten forest certification, which is critical in maintaining forest products industries.
