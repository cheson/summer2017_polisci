Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder has ordered the United States flags on all state buildings and those within the State Capitol Complex to be lowered in honor of Kalamazoo Public Safety Officer Eric Zapata on Tuesday April 26. Flags should be returned to full-staff on Wednesday, April 27.
Officer Zapata, 35, a 10-year veteran of the force, was shot and killed after he and other officers were dispatched on a report of shots fired in Kalamazoo's Edison neighborhood on April 18.
"The thoughts and prayers of the entire state are with Officer Zapata's three children, friends, community and the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety," Snyder said. "Officer Zapata is an example of the brave men and women who protect our citizens every day."
When flown at half-staff or half-mast, the United States flag should be hoisted first to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff or half-mast position. The flag should again be raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day.
