Gov. Snyder released the following statement at the culmination of a four-day trip to Washington, D.C. for the National Governor's Association Winter Conference:
"I appreciate the many opportunities during the past several days to share input about some of the most important issues facing Michigan -- health care reform, improving our infrastructure and more and better jobs -- with President Trump, Vice President Pence, several Cabinet secretaries and members of Congress from both parties.
"It is clear to me that now more than ever before, Washington, D.C. is listening to the states. I frequently hear from residents that they want solutions made closer to home, so I'm very encouraged by the open dialogue we had this weekend and look forward to what I hope will be a great deal of collaboration with the President and Congress.
"My commitment to telling the Michigan story and forming new partnerships remains. Here in Michigan we have enrolled nearly 625,000 residents who previously did not have health care coverage in our Healthy Michigan program, and it has been one of the best health care successes in the nation. But, it is also clear that the insurance portion of the Affordable Care Act has not worked and that we are seeing access reduced as insurance rates go up. It's imperative with reform of the Affordable Care Act that we are able to keep Healthy Michigan going with more flexibility in administering our state program, while at the same time bringing stability to the insurance marketplace."
