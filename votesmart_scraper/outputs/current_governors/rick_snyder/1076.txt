Gov. Rick Snyder in his inaugural address today called for a culture change in which cooperation, courage and innovation will lead the way to reinvented economy and enhanced quality of life in Michigan.
Gov. Snyder made his remarks on the Capitol steps upon taking the oath of office to become Michigan's 48th governor.
"It is time to stop fighting among ourselves," Gov. Snyder said. "It is time to solve our problems and create new opportunities."
Gov. Snyder's commitment to bipartisanship and public service was reflected in the inaugural ceremony, in which local and state leaders of both political parties were invited to participate. Detroit Mayor Dave Bing emceed the event and Grand Rapids Mayor George Heartwell delivered the innovation and closing prayer. Gov. Snyder was pleased to have the legislative majority and minority leaders share the stage, which was not the case in previous inaugurations. Former Govs. Jennifer Granholm and John Engler also bridged the political gap by attending.
"We need to put party and geography aside and come together as Michiganders to reinvent Michigan," Gov. Snyder said.
Getting Michigan back on track will require sacrifice and a new mind-set, the governor cautioned.
"It won't be simple or easy," Gov. Snyder said. "There is no magic solution to our problems. But with most of our problems, there also comes opportunities. It will require shared sacrifice from all of us. Many have already made sacrifices. Many of us need to join those who have already contributed."
