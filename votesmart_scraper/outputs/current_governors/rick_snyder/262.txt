Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Law enforcement officers will have the tools to contact family members quickly during an emergency situation under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"This common-sense reform will save law enforcement time and give families peace of mind knowing that they'll be quickly contacted should a friend or loved one be involved in an emergency." Snyder said.
House Bills 4459 and 4460, sponsored by state Rep. Peter Lucido, allows Michigan residents to designate an emergency contact to be linked with their driver's license or personal identification card. The bills are now Public Acts 4 and 5 of 2016.
HB 4535, sponsored by state Rep. Lana Theis, allows active law enforcement officers to use their certification by the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards when purchasing a handgun, instead of going through the traditional purchase permitting process. It is now PA 6.
Senate Bills 232 and 233, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Robertson, clarify that Michigan residents who purchase vehicles from out-of-state dealers still receive sales tax and use tax exemptions for the trade-in value of their car. They are now PA 7 and 8.
