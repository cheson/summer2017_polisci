Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for June fell to 4.6 percent, its lowest point since February 2001:
"Today's drop in the unemployment rate marks another milestone on Michigan's comeback path. At 4.6 percent, our unemployment rate has now fallen by more than 10 percent since its peak in 2009. We continue to move in the right direction, but we recognize there is more to do to ensure Michigan's comeback lasts.
"We have 900 days left of this administration, and I promise to keep working hard to find long-term solutions to Michigan's most demanding challenges. By focusing on creating more and better jobs, developing high-skilled talent, improving our education system, and addressing our most significant issues, our state can be an even better place for every Michigander to call home."
