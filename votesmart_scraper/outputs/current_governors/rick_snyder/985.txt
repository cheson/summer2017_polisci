Gov. Snyder Signs Fostering Connections Legislation

Young people aging out of Michigan's foster care system at 18 will soon have the option to receive life-directing support until age 21, under legislation signed into law today by Gov. Rick Snyder. With the signing of the legislation, the Michigan Department of Human Services can begin moving forward with federal review and approval. Implementation of the program is expected in early 2012.
Many of the 800 foster care youths turning 18 each year lose the only reliable adult support they have ever known - some even become homeless - when funding for their care ends.
"Young people in foster care need the same kind of support other 18-year-olds do as they navigate the crucial years leading up to age 21," Snyder said. "The Fostering Connections legislation will give those who wish to receive it the extra assistance they need to become successful adults."
Extended benefits are made possible by the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, which gave states the option of receiving matching federal funds for providing additional services.
"Michigan is proud to be in the forefront of this important reform effort," said Maura Corrigan, director of the Michigan Department of Human Services. "Offering an additional three years of support to young people who are on the cusp of adulthood will help ensure they successfully arrive at that destination."
Under the legislation, officially known as the Young Adult Voluntary Foster Care Act, Michigan will offer 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds the option of living in a licensed foster family home, a child care institution or a supervised independent living arrangement. In addition they will receive case management support, training in independent living skills, counseling services and medical assistance.
