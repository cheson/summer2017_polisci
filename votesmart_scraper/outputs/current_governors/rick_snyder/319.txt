Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of a task force led by Lt. Gov. Brian Calley that will recommend reforms for Michigan's special education system to help special needs children reach their full potential.
The task force will develop policy recommendations to address the key findings of Calley's recent statewide special education listening tour that led to a formal presentation to the State Board of Education. The complete report and survey results are available to download here.
"The Special Education Reform Task Force will continue the great efforts started by Lt. Gov. Calley as he spoke to fellow parents about their experiences within the existing system," Snyder said. "This group will help us remain focused on putting Michigan's special needs children and their families front-and-center when considering reforms to this vital component in our educational system."
