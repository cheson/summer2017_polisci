Michiganders will soon have an easier time tracking continuing education requirements needed for most state professional licenses online under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"This is a great example of efforts to put people's needs first by making government more customer-friendly," Snyder said. "Allowing the department to partner with companies to provide licensees online tracking will eliminate hassles for Michiganders, while speeding up the process."
Senate Bills 554 and 555, sponsored by state Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker, allow for partnerships with companies to provide electronic record keeping of professional license requirements. This will allow citizens easier access to track requirements and a streamlined process to provide proof of continuing education compliance to the state, as they will have real-time access to outstanding continuing education requirements. The bills are now Public Acts 29 and 30 of 2016.
Snyder also signed seven other bills:
SB 56, sponsored by state Sen. Rick Jones, allows regular salary evaluations for trial court and Court of Appeals judges. It is now PA 31.
SBs 176 and 357, sponsored by Schuitmaker, and House Bill 4980, sponsored by state Rep. Klint Kesto, updates state regulations for Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Devices to provide the Secretary of State with better oversight of the use and installation of the devices. The bills are now PAs 32-34.
