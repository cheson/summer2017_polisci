Gov. Rick Snyder Issues Executive Order to Improve Operating Efficiency for Ethnic Commissions
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Jan. 26, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed Executive Order 2016-3, transferring administrative responsibilities of three ethnic commissions to the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.
Previously housed in the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, the Michigan Asian Pacific American Affairs Commission, Hispanic/Latino Commission of Michigan and the Commission on Middle Eastern American Affairs will now fall under the direction of LARA. The reorganization will help streamline human resources and budgetary functions within each commission.
"Moving these commissions to LARA helps ensure efficient organization and management of each group's administrative needs," Snyder said. "It also allows the Civil Rights Department to devote more time and resources toward their goal of ensuring equal opportunities for all Michigan residents," Snyder said.
Each commission affected by the reorganization will continue working to enhance economic opportunity, prevent discrimination and encourage cultural awareness of the Asian Pacific American, Hispanic/Latino and Middle Eastern American communities. The commissions will also continue to advise the Governor, Legislature and state departments on the needs of these communities.
