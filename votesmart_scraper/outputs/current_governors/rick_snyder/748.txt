Governor Rick Snyder reflects on the 50th Anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have A Dream" speech:
Fifty years ago today, Martin Luther King, Jr. stood upon the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., and delivered a speech to a crowd of hundreds of thousands -- and to a nation of millions.
Dr. King spoke that day of his dream -- it was a dream of racial equality, a dream of justice, and a dream of freedom.
His was a message of hope, but it wasn't a hope that belonged to him alone. It was a dream, it was a hope, that resonated among those who stood gathered before him --- and among the men, women and children across the country who heard his words.
It is also a message that has echoed across time as the fight against discrimination of all kinds continues.
In Dr. King's words, "As we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back."
It is up to us to continue that march ahead. To stand for equality, for justice, and for better opportunities for all. Today, we remember Dr. King's message. We take it to heart, and we work to achieve that dream.
