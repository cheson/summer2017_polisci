Support coming from all directions as yet another group signs up to help Rick Reinvent Michigan
Associated Builders and Contractors of Michigan today endorsed Rick Snyder, adding to a growing list of Michigan job creators supporting Rick's 10-point plan to Reinvent Michigan.
"The construction industry was hit particularly hard by the recession, so I'm very pleased builders and contractors believe in my plan and are willing to help make my vision of a successful Michigan a reality." Snyder said. "We've got a lot of work to do to reinvent our state and it's going to take a team of 10 million people pulling in the same direction."
ABC of Michigan chose to support Rick because of his focus on the economy and his demand that government produce results.
"Too often government uses the amount of money spent trying to fix a problem as the only measure of success instead of looking at results. That has to change. Taxpayers deserve to know how their money is spent and know that it is being spent well," Snyder said.
ABC of Michigan represents nearly 1,000 contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers and related firms across the state.
Rick said he welcomes the ABC of Michigan endorsement, but refused to accept political donations from any special interest group.
