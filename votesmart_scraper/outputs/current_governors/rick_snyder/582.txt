Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to help families provide substance abuse services to family members unwilling to enter treatment programs.
"Substance abuse treatment is an emotional process for both individuals and their family members," Snyder said. "These bills will help people get the treatment they need."
House Bill 4486, sponsored by state Rep. John Walsh, gives families an option to get assistance for family members who are unwilling to enter substance abuse treatment programs. The bill establishes a procedure under which a person's family members can petition for involuntary substance abuse treatment. The court can order involuntary treatment for up to 72 hours or until a hearing occurs in cases where there is convincing evidence of substance abuse or if people appear to be a danger to themselves or others.
The bill is now Public Act 200 of 2014.
The governor also signed 10 other bills:
HB 4378, sponsored by state Rep. Andrea LaFontaine, dissolves the state list of professional interior designers and aligns the interior design profession with state licensing regulations. It is now PA 193.
HBs 4683 and 4684, sponsored by state Reps. David Nathan and Cindy Denby, respectively, eliminate the need for wine auction licensees to register as auctioneers. They are now PAs 194 and 195.
HB 5085, sponsored by state Rep. Phil Potvin, allows an individual who is over 21 years of age and has successfully completed a pistol training course to supervise minors while they are shooting a pistol. Presence of a parent or guardian is not required but the minor must have parental consent. It is now PA 201.
SB 49, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Casperson, makes firearms records confidential and not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. The bill allows disclosure of records in cases where firearm owners pose a threat to themselves or other individuals, they have used the firearm in an action that violates the law or to aid in the violation of a law, or to ensure the safety of a peace officer. The bill is now PA 202.
HB 5325, sponsored by state Rep. Hugh Crawford, defines the term "firearms records" to mean any form, information or record required for submission to a government agency regarding the records of pistol sales, entry of information into the Law Enforcement Information Network and applications for concealed pistol licenses. It is now PA 203.
HB 4155, sponsored by state Rep. Aric Nesbitt, specifies that information in the pistol records database can only be accessed and disclosed if the requester of the firearms records provides a record of his or her identity, and the time and date the request was made. It is now PA 204.
SBs 834 and 881, sponsored by state Sens. Phil Pavlov and Geoff Hansen, respectively, and HB 5328, sponsored by state Rep. Kevin Cotter, provide necessary updates to the Michigan Handgun Act. The bills eliminate previous Freedom of Information Act request exemptions that are no longer necessary upon signage of SB 49. They are now PAs 205-207.
