Gov. Rick Snyder: Pension Vote Shows Detroit Continues to Move Toward Brighter Future
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: July 22, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement on the vote of Detroit retirees and active employees to accept pension changes as part of a settlement deal.
"Detroit continues to move forward. The vote totals released today reflect an important step in the process of resolving Detroit's bankruptcy as quickly as possible.
"These were difficult decisions for many people. We recognize and appreciate the sacrifices they are making to help their city and their state. I believe many of the workers who voted for the unprecedented settlement recognized the historic efforts from the Legislature, our philanthropic community, the Detroit Institute of Arts, business leaders and others who contributed to the "Grand Bargain.'
"This vote is recognition that all of Michigan has pulled together to support our state's largest, and iconic, city and the people who work to protect and provide services to its residents. We have farther to go down this road. But the vote tallies show how far we've come in the past year, and that Detroit's future is increasingly brighter."
