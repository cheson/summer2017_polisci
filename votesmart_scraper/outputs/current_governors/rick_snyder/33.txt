Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed Executive Order 2017-2 creating the Child Lead Exposure Elimination Commission to continue Michigan's fight against lead exposure from all sources.
"Eliminating the risk of child lead exposure will require the coordination and expertise of people across all sectors," Snyder said. "Creating this permanent commission will help advance the strategies recommended to better protect Michigan children from lead exposure."
The creation of a permanent commission was a recommendation of the Child Lead Poisoning Elimination Board, chaired by Lt. Gov. Brian Calley. The new commission will focus on implementation of the board's recommendations and monitor the state's efforts to eliminate lead exposure in children.
"No amount of lead exposure is safe for children, so we need to eliminate lead hazards that pose a danger before exposure occurs," Calley said. "Making this a permanent priority will help ensure that strategies recommended by the Child Lead Poisoning Elimination Board are implemented to protect Michigan kids."
Housed within the Department of Health and Human Services, the 15-member commission will act in an advisory capacity to the Governor and department director to coordinate and collaborate with all levels of government and stakeholders regarding programs and policies related to the elimination of child lead exposure.
