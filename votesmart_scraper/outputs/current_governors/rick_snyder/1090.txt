Snyder asks Bernero to join him answering questions from voters
Rick Snyder invited his opponent Virg Bernero to share the stage at a town hall meeting here tonight, taking live questions from real voters and holding the campaign's first impromptu debate.
"This is what democracy is all about -- real people asking tough questions and getting straight answers -- not scripted, 30-second sound bites," Snyder said. "I plan to keep holding these town hall meetings until Election Day to talk about my 10-Point Plan to Reinvent Michigan so voters can hear directly from me about my positive vision to create more and better jobs."
Snyder invited Bernero to share the stage at the town hall as the Lansing mayor was holding a news conference at the event location. In front of reporters and with cameras rolling, Snyder walked up to Bernero and invited him speak at the town hall, and then insisted the mayor sit in the front row.
After a short introductory speech Rick asked Bernero to address the crowd. The two candidates then took turns answering questions for more than an hour from about 150 voters.
Bernero handed Snyder a letter requesting a meeting to discuss future debates. Debate negotiations ended at 4 p.m. Friday after the Bernero campaign rejected a final offer from Snyder to hold three televised debates around the state. Snyder said there are no plans to restart debate negotiations.
"I am happy that my Democratic opponent was able to attend my 59th town hall with voters," Snyder said. "This was a good discussion of the issues by the both of us."
