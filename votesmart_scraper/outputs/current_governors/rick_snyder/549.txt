Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement after the state Senate and House of Representatives voted on changes that clarify the original intent of the Michigan Business Tax.
"The Legislature voted overwhelmingly on a solution that reflects the original intent of the 2007 law, encouraging companies to continue investing in Michigan and creating jobs.
"This bipartisan solution maintains the fiscally responsible and stable budget foundation that we have worked so diligently to build over the last four years, allowing us to continue investing significantly in our priorities, including schools and our infrastructure, and the policies that have helped drive Michigan's comeback.
"Working with our partners in the Legislature, we've created an environment where companies can grow and thrive, including the steps to build a skilled workforce that will help fill the jobs of today and tomorrow. The votes by the state Senate today and House on Tuesday are a step that allows us to continue that progress."
