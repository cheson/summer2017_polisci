Gov. Snyder Statement on Federal Denial of WIC Expansion for Flint Children
Statement

Gov. Snyder released the following statement today after the federal government denied the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services request to use supplemental nutrition funding for Flint children up to the age of 10 who may have been affected by high levels of lead in the water:
"I have strongly and continually stated that it is essential for all levels of government to work together to help Flint recover from this crisis, as it was all levels of government that failed Flint. While I understand WIC funding does not normally cover children over the age of 5, the improved health and developmental growth that will come from better nutrition for these kids necessitates a waiver of this rule.
"I strongly urge the federal government to reconsider this request and provide additional support for children ages 5 to 10. We must draw on all resources possible and work cooperatively to meet the needs of the residents of Flint, both immediate and long-term."
