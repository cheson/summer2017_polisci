Statement

Location: Lansing, MI

Local townships will now have the option to borrow money from their county to assist in funding road construction projects under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"This legislation is another step toward ensuring safer and more modern infrastructure across the state," Snyder said. "Better roads are essential to maintaining Michigan's economic growth. The sooner we responsibly complete road projects the better our state will be for Michiganders and visitors alike."
Senate Bill 729, sponsored by state Sen. Wayne Schmidt, allows townships to borrow funds from the county to expedite road projects and keep construction costs down. The borrowing will help townships fund projects prior to millage renewals. The bill also allows for matching of funds to complete joint projects between a township and a county. It is now Public Act 77 of 2016.
Snyder also signed seven additional bills:
SB 171, sponsored by state Sen. Steven Bieda, simplifies the filing process for the owners of facilities which provide housing to the disabled or elderly to receive an existing property tax emption by requiring approval of an exemption by December 31 of the calendar year in which it was filed. It is now PA 78.
SB 366, sponsored by state Sen. Curtis Hertel, prevents non-governmental organizations and individuals from charging unnecessary fees for copies of deeds being requested from property owners. It is now PA 79
