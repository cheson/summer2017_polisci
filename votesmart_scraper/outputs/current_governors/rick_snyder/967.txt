Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued Executive Directive 2012-1, which enhances customer service by promoting state and local government technology innovation. The funding was called for and approved as part of the current fiscal year budget.
The directive establishes Information, Communications and Technology (ITC) management responsibilities as well as an ITC Innovation Fund Investment Board within the Department of Technology, Management and Budget. The department received a $2.5 million appropriation for the fund.
"Michigan is continually recognized as a national leader in information technology," Snyder said. "By consolidating and standardizing its IT functions, our state has become more efficient and cost-effective. We're now taking Michigan to the next level by providing start-up funding to encourage greater innovation and efficiency. These improvements will lead to new best practices that will drive Michigan's success in the global economy."
The fund will improve the manner in which information technology resources are allocated, provide venture capital loans for new technology projects that otherwise would not receive funding and support the modernization of state government. All state Executive Branch agencies and departments and shared service projects involving local governments and other public service providers are eligible to receive loans from the fund. The fund was authorized by Public Act 63 of 2011.
The investment fund board will oversee management of the fund, including the solicitation of projects, eligibility criteria, performance and accountability, contractual reporting, loan repayment and project termination.
