Gov. Rick Snyder: Gain in the State's Labor Force a Positive Step Forward for Michigan
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 13, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state gained 27,000 people in the labor force while the number of unemployed went down by 1,000 and the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for March remained unchanged at 4.8%. The state's unemployment rate has now been below the national average for two months.
"Another gain in the state's labor force is a positive step forward as we work together to continue Michigan's reinvention and address the challenges still facing our state. It's important to recognize that the state's unemployment rate has dropped a full percentage point since March 2015. And Michigan job providers have added more than 450,000 jobs since December 2010, which is a reminder of how far we have come. Still, we have more to do to get more of Michigan working. We need to continue our efforts to reinvent the state, ensure public health and safety, improve education, and create more high-skilled talent for in-demand jobs. Together, we can find long-term solutions that will help all Michiganders find success here."
