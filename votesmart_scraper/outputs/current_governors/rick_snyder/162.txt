Circuit courts now have the ability to determine eligibility of individuals seeking restricted driving privileges under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"This bill increases accountability in regard to issuing restricted licenses when appropriate, which will help keep motorists safety in the forefront of such decisions," Snyder said.
House Bill 4436, sponsored by state Rep. Peter Lucido, grants circuit courts the ability, under certain circumstances, to determine if an individual who has been denied the reinstatement of their driver's license should be eligible to receive a restricted driving license. It is now Public Act 117 of 2016.
Snyder also signed HB 5439, sponsored by state Rep. Michael Webber, which amends the Michigan Renaissance Zone Act to allow a business in a renaissance zone to make a payment of lieu of taxes to any taxing jurisdiction within the local unit of government in which the zone is located. This change would only apply to MSF-designated renaissance zones. It is now PA 118.
