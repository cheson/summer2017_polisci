Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder released the following statement after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in the King v. Burwell case:
"We appreciate that the deep uncertainty of this issue has been resolved. The health and wellbeing of the people of Michigan is always a top priority.
"Our focus can now center on securing the second waiver for our Healthy Michigan Plan, which has been an outstanding success. Today, nearly 600,000 Michiganders of all ages have health care through Healthy Michigan, translating into 152,920 primary care visits, 414,724 preventive care visits, 46,347 mammograms, and 23,817 colonoscopies or colon cancer screenings. Our citizens are able to take steps to live healthier, more productive lives -- and that benefits us all.
"Healthy Michigan saves money for our state, too, by reducing uncompensated care costs that once were passed on to taxpayers and businesses. And the plan emphasizes personal responsibility by requiring participants to share in the costs while giving incentives for living healthier lives.
"Regardless of feelings on the Affordable Care Act, it's vital to our state that we continue working to improve and reform health care, create more and better jobs, and build a brighter future for our kids right here in Michigan."
