Snyder Signs Driver Responsibility, Fireworks Bills
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Dec. 14, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder signed late Tuesday bills that repeal some of the state's driver responsibility fees and allow the sale of certain consumer-grade fireworks in Michigan.
Senate Bill 166, sponsored by state Sen. Bruce Caswell, eliminates certain fees for lesser driving violations, including operating a motor vehicle with an expired license, operating a vehicle without a valid license, having more than one license or failing to surrender licenses from other states.
"This legislation addresses unintended consequences of the previous law and helps protect many of our most economically vulnerable Michiganders," Snyder said.
S.B. 166 is now Public Act 255.
The governor also signed House Bill 4293, sponsored by state Rep. Harold Haugh, and S.B. 194, sponsored by state Sen. Rick Jones, which will expand the types of fireworks that are legally allowed to be sold to consumers. He signed into law with the understanding that the Legislature will take up a related bill when it reconvenes in January to increase penalties that would help protect Michiganders from bad actors or "fly by night" operations.
H.B. 4293 is P.A. 256 and S.B. 194 is now P.A. 257.
