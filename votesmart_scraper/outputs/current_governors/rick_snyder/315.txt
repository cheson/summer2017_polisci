Statement
By: Rick Snyder

Location: Detroit, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today announced that the Michigan Prescription Drug and Opioid Abuse Task Force has presented him with a comprehensive report of their findings and more than two dozen recommendations for changes in regulations and practices that could address a growing problem in Michigan.
The governor formed the task force in mid-June and appointed Lt. Gov. Brian Calley as the chair with the direction to examine the recent trends, evaluate strategic options, and develop a statewide action plan by fall 2015.
"The impact of prescription drug and opioid abuse is being felt in every community across Michigan. It crosses all demographic, geographic and political lines," Snyder said. "This problem is something we must work together to address as soon as possible and I appreciate the dedication of Lt. Gov. Calley and the task force in working on this issue and presenting their findings in such a short time frame."
