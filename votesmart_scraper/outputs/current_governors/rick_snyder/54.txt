Joined at Grace Emmanuel Church in Flint by state Rep. Sheldon Neeley and other state and local officials and community members, Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to ensure Michigan residents are notified more quickly if lead levels in their public water supply exceed safety requirements.
"These bills help ensure that all Michigan families are promptly notified in situations where lead levels in public water supplies exceed safe levels for drinking and cooking," Snyder said. "This is an important step in our ongoing efforts to strengthen Michigan's water quality and infrastructure."
House Bill 5120, sponsored by state Rep. Sheldon Neeley, requires a municipal water supply to notify customers of a lead action level exceedance within three business days. A public water supply must still provide public educational resources as currently required. This improvement for public health was also part of Snyder's proposed reforms to the Lead and Copper Rule presented in Flint last April. It is now Public Act 478 of 2016.
Gov. Snyder also signed 20 additional bills:
HB 4235, sponsored by state Rep. George Darany, requires physicians or health facilities to report all maternal deaths to help Michigan reduce the number of these deaths. It is now Public Act 479 of 2016.
HB 5422, sponsored by state Rep. John Chirkun, expands the elements of fourth-degree vulnerable adult abuse to include an intentional act by a caregiver posing unreasonable risk of harm or injury regardless of whether physical harm resulted. It is now Public Act 480 of 2016.
