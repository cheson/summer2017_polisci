Gov. Rick Snyder made the following statement today with regards to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell visiting Flint:
"I'm encouraged by Sec. Burwell's visit to Flint today, and hope she brings with her the news that the federal government will soon approve my request to expand Medicaid for Flint children up to age 21 and pregnant women. Expanded health care and nutrition services are essential for Flint residents, and we continue to work in partnership with the federal government to find ways we can work together during this critical time in Flint's recovery."
