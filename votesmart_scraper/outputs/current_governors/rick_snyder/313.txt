Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement today on latest legislative efforts to ensure preservation of Michigan's infrastructure:
"I met and talked with both the Senate Majority Leader and House Speaker late this afternoon. I believe there is strong momentum to provide the resources we need to halt decades of decline in our roads and bridges, making them safer for Michiganders now and for years to come.
"There is room to work in the days ahead to ensure a comprehensive transportation solution that's fiscally responsible and allows us to continue investing in our core priorities that help Michiganders and fuel our state's comeback.
"I look forward to continuing this critical work with our partners in the Legislature and getting a solution in place in the near future."
