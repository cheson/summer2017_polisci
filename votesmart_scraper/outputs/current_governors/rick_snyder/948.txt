Snyder Signs Bill to Help Control Prescription Drug Trafficking
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder has signed legislation that will help reduce the illegal trafficking of prescription drugs, which is an area of concern highlighted in the governor's Special Message to the Legislature on Public Safety released today.
The Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs maintains an electronic system for monitoring controlled substances dispensed by all prescribers. The Michigan Automated Prescription System, or MAPS, is the prescription database for Schedule 2-5 controlled substances. LARA is permitted by statute to provide access to that data to prescribers and pharmacists, licensing boards of authorized prescribers and limited access to law enforcement officials.
House Bill 4369, sponsored by state Rep. Lesia Liss, allows LARA to provide that same limited level of access to health insurance carriers as currently provided to law enforcement. This enhances health providers' ability to ensure patient safety and identify individuals who are chronically misusing controlled substances.
"Michigan's public safety is threatened by the diversion of controlled substances from their legal, safe use to illegal use and distribution," Snyder said. "Prescription monitoring programs are effective tools to identify and prevent diversion of controlled substances at the prescriber, pharmacy and patient levels."
