Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder signed remaining pieces of the Fiscal Year 2013 budget. The supplemental includes funding to protect families and provide financial assistance for farmers who suffered crop losses.

House Bill 5400, sponsored by state Rep. Chuck Moss, also completes the transfer of the Michigan Rehabilitation Services Program from the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs to the Department of Human Services as directed in Executive Order 2012-10, issued by Snyder in June.

"These additional funds will help keep Michigan families and homes safe, provide relief to those in the agriculture industry who suffered crop losses, and continue our efforts to make state government more efficient and effective," Snyder said.

The bill provides $36.1 million in supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2012-13:

Community Health - $2.9 million to restore funding for the Healthy Homes program, which provides grants to contractors and local groups for lead abatement.
Corrections - $17.6 million for the Special Equipment Fund for priority facility security systems, including camera and recording systems, personal protection systems, electronic detection systems, and perimeter security devices in correctional facilities.
Environmental Quality - $600,000 to support the Aquifer Protection and Dispute Resolution Program, a low-interest rate loan financing program that assists the construction renovation of needed water pollution control facilities.
Human Services and Licensing and Regulatory Affairs - Implements Executive Order 2012-10 by transferring the Michigan Rehabilitation Services from LARA to DHS.
Treasury - $15 million contributed to the Agricultural Loan Origination Program, which provides financial assistance to farmers to alleviate financial distress caused by crop damage and related economic impacts.

The bill now is Public Act 305 of 2012.

Snyder also signed 13 other bills.

Senate Bill 809, sponsored by state Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker, improves roadway safety by increasing the mandatory license suspension for drunken drivers from one year to one year and 45 days. The measure also brings the open alcohol container law into federal compliance to continue to receive federal funding for the highway safety improvement program. The bill now is P.A. 306.
