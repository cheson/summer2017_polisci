Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder released the following statement commemorating Veterans Day, which will be observed on Monday:
"On Veterans Day, we honor all Americans who have served so selflessly in the armed forces. We thank them for the critical role they have played in preserving the liberty that we hold dear as a nation and as individuals.
"Freedom is not free. Those who serve our nation know the cost of freedom and are willing to step forward and bear that cost, no matter how high. On Veterans Day, we reflect on the sacrifices that they have made to protect our freedom.
"We think of all who have served overseas, especially the veterans recently returned from Iraq and Afghanistan. We think of the families of those who have served and the struggles they have endured while they have been separated from their loved ones. We owe them all a debt of gratitude that is impossible to repay. To our veterans and their families, we say "Thank you for the sacrifices you have made to protect us and our way of life.'
"We are proud that nearly 700,000 veterans call Michigan home. It is up to us now to make sure that we fulfill our obligations to these men and women who have served so bravely. Agencies statewide are working to help ease their transition from military to civilian life and to provide our veterans access to the critical resources they need to succeed now that they have come back home.
"I ask all Michiganders to join me in thanking our veterans for their sacrifices and selfless dedication to protecting our freedoms."
