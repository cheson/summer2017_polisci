Redistricting Plan Signed into Law
Press Release

Legislation that redraws the boundaries of Michigan's congressional and legislative districts was signed into law today.
New maps are needed due to population shifts reflected in the 2010 census.
"At our peak, we had 19 seats in Congress. We only have 15 today and next year we are going to drop to 14 because Michigan was the only state in the nation to actually lose population over the last decade. This clearly shows why we need to fundamentally reinvent Michigan as a place where businesses can grow and create jobs and people can raise a family," Gov. Rick Snyder said.
House Bill 4780, sponsored by state Rep. Pete Lund, and Senate Bill 498, sponsored by state Sen. Joe Hune, comply with the state's Apol standards which include a requirement to minimize breaks in municipal and county lines. The maps also meet federal Voting Rights Act requirements. The bills are now Public Acts 128 and 129 of 2011.
