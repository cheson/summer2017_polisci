Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding the state House Energy Policy Committee's approval of a package of legislation that will help Michigan meet its energy needs long into the future:
"I commend the House Energy Policy Committee for its important work on bills that will lead Michigan toward a more adaptable, affordable, reliable, and environmentally protective energy future. This is a great step in the process and I'm hopeful we can build upon the good work being done in both chambers to get this done by the end of the year.
"The bills now headed to the House floor would be a victory for Michiganders and a positive step in the long-term direction of our state. The package helps us continue with the progress we have made on competitiveness and affordability. It also addresses our goal of controlling our own destiny on energy. Decisions about our state's energy should be made in Michigan and not in Washington, D.C.
"Reducing energy waste, on-bill financing, and having at least 30 percent of our energy come from our cleanest sources -- renewables and energy waste reduction -- are all things that were in my March special message, and I am excited to see support for them."
