Benton Harbor Financial Emergency Resolved
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: March 10, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today announced that the financial emergency in the city of Benton Harbor has been resolved and appointed a Receivership Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) to help ensure a smooth transition and guide the city to continued financial stability.
"This is an important day for the residents of the city of Benton Harbor. I'm pleased to be able to accept Tony Saunders' recommendation that the financial emergency has been sufficiently addressed," Snyder said. "With authority being returned to local control, this Transition Advisory Board will work cooperatively with local leaders to ensure continued financial stability and growth in the city and ensure the essential services that citizens need and rely on."
Benton Harbor Emergency Manager Tony Saunders notified the governor late Thursday, March 6, of his determination. Saunders and the governor cited several factors and accomplishments, including:
General fund expenditures being reduced by 30 percent, allowing the city to turn previous annual deficits into an annual fiscal year operating surplus of more than $1 million.
Two operating millage renewals previously rejected by the electorate, passing by more than 80 percent.
Two collective bargaining agreements being executed following negotiations and which provided cost savings.
Annual pension contributions increased 380 percent after the pension system was transferred to the Municipal Employees' Retirement System of Michigan. This resulted in the City meeting its recommended pension contribution during FY 13-14 for the first time in 10 years.
