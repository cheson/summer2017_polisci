Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the appointment of Linda Strohl of Sawyer to the Commission on Services to the Aging.
The commission is a 15-member body appointed by the governor to offer oversight on the administration of state programs and priorities affecting aging Michiganders. A majority of the members must be at least 60 years of age and no more than eight may be from the same political party.
"I thank Linda for her service and am confident her work will help ensure that aging adults have the opportunity to live healthy and independent lives," Snyder said.
Strohl is the executive director for Senior Nutrition Services, Region IV, and is a current member of the State Advisory Council on Aging. Strohl holds a bachelor's degree in sociology from Smith College at the University of Illinois. She will represent Independents and fills the vacancy created by the resignation of Renee Reid-Smith.
Strohl will serve the remainder of a three-year term expiring July 28, 2018. Her appointment is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.
