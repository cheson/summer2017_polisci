Snyder Signs Bill Updating State's Billboard Rules
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Jan. 30, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Legislation signed by Gov. Rick Snyder today revises existing law regarding the placement and maintenance of billboards in Michigan, bringing the state in line with required federal highway administration standards.
"The needed updates in this legislation will bring more common sense to the state's billboard regulations and will ensure Michigan continues to receive vital federal road funding," Snyder said.
House Bill 4629, sponsored by state Rep. Brad Jacobsen, updates the nearly 15-year-old law. The bill, which is now Public Act 2 of 2014, clarifies the definition of digital billboards, better defines the permitting process for billboards, and specifies the rules for trimming trees and vegetation around billboards.
Michigan risked losing up to $100 million in federal funding without the new law.
