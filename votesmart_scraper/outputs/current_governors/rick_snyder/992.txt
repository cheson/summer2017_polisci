Governor Applauds Senate Passage of Health Insurance Initiative
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Nov. 10, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today applauded Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville, Health Policy Committee Chairman Jim Marleau and the state Senate for passing legislation that will help consumers and small businesses purchase health insurance starting in 2014.
Senate Bill 693 creates the MiHealth Marketplace, an online marketplace proposed by Snyder in his recent Special Message to the Legislature on Health and Wellness. He issued the following statement:
"I applaud senators for taking this innovative step on this critical issue," Snyder said. "This nonprofit entity emphasizes free-market principles that will better manage health care costs and increase competition among insurers. It will ensure that government does not expand its reach. It will be run like a business not a bureaucracy.
"Michigan needs to act quickly so the state isn't forced to accept the federal government's "one-size-fits all approach' to health care reform. We understand the unique needs of our consumers and businesses. Michigan should decide its own health care future."
