Gov. Rick Snyder and legislative leaders agreed today on spending targets for the fiscal year 2016 budget that includes an additional $400 million in General Fund money to help repair Michigan roads and bridges while work continues on a long-term solution to the state's infrastructure needs.
The agreement is an important step as lawmakers and Snyder continue work on the 2016 budget, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. The deal marks the fifth straight year that Michigan's budget is on course for completion in June.
Getting the state budget done early helps schools, local governments, and others depending on state funding to have timely information to build their own spending plans.
"By increasing our investment in our infrastructure and education, we're investing in Michigan's future," Snyder said. "This is essential work to keep our economy growing stronger and improving the quality of life for all Michiganders. I am pleased with how quickly the process has moved along and I think this is a testament to the strong working relationship we have with our legislative partners."
With increased revenue from Michigan's growing economy announced at last week's estimating conference, leaders agreed to invest an additional $400 million in General Fund dollars to fix roads and bridges across the state.
Leaders plan to work toward a long-term funding solution for transportation throughout the summer. The final budget, expected to be signed in June, will increase investment in other key priorities such as education, public safety, health and human services, as well as saving for the future in the state's rainy day fund.
