Bill Signed to Revise Judicial Makeup in Clinton County

A bill revising the number of judgeships in Clinton County has been signed by Gov. Rick Snyder.

Senate Bill 43, sponsored by state Sen. Rick Jones, amends a 2011 law that eliminated several judgeships statewide, by retaining the Clinton County District Court seat and eliminating one of the two circuit court judgeships instead.

Which circuit court judgeship will be eliminated will be determined when either of the two seats become vacant or when either of the sitting judges chooses to not seek re-election.

"This legislation is consistent with the Michigan State Court Administrative Office's Judicial Resources Recommendations Report and ensures Clinton County residents have judicial representation at both the district and circuit court levels," Snyder said.

The 2011 report called for the removal of one judgeship from within the 29th Judicial Circuit, but was not specific to which one. Public Act 300 of 2011, which eliminated the judgeships, designated the county to lose its district court judgeship, leaving the probate court to assume district court responsibilities despite there being two circuit court judges.

SB 43 is now Public Act 33 of 2013.
