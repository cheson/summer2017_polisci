Statement

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding congressional approval of free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea:
"Michigan is a clear winner with the free-trade agreements approved by Congress. As one of North America's top producer states, Michigan will benefit greatly by opening new doors to global markets. Michigan's congressional delegation deserves our appreciation for working effectively to ensure the agreements' passage.
"During my recent trade mission to Asia, one common theme expressed by senior government officials and top corporate executives was the need for more free trade between our nations. Michigan is in a great position to be a more active trading partner. Our proximity to international borders coupled with the top-quality products for which Michigan is known has prepared us to lead on the world stage. Of course, it is imperative we have a modern border crossing that ensures the unimpeded flow of goods. That's why we absolutely need the New International Trade Crossing and should approve the pending legislation without delay.
"The new market opportunities in South Korea alone stand to bring $10 billion in new exports and create 70,000 jobs in the U.S. That holds great promise for Michigan, especially in our agriculture and manufacturing sectors.
"This is our chance to show the world what we already know: Michigan's farmers and workers are the best in the world. As more foreign consumers see what Michigan has to offer, demand for our products will continue to climb. That means a more prosperous Michigan with exciting opportunities for the next generation. I commend Congress and the president for doing what's best for Michigan and America."
