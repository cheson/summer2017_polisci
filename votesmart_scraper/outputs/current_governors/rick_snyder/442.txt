For the first time, the Governor's Economic and Education Summit is combined, allowing the most innovative minds in education and economic development to discuss the best ways to better prepare Michigan's students for future success. A key focus at this year's summit will be the skilled trades and talent development. As Michigan companies look to expand and create more and better jobs, they're having trouble finding talent to fill those jobs. That's why one of Governor Snyder's top priorities is to make Michigan number one in the nation for skilled trades.
