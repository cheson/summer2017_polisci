Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement upon authorizing a state declaration of disaster for Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties and their affected municipalities in the wake of this week's severe flood damage:
"The flooding that continues to impact Southeastern Michigan is a disaster in every sense of the word. As local and state authorities work around the clock to deal with this situation, it is clear that the significant personal property and infrastructure damage, coupled with ongoing threats to public safety, warrants this state declaration. By taking this action, the state can fully coordinate and maximize efforts to support its local partners.
"I'm proud of our communities and residents throughout the region for pulling together in the face of these challenges. Please remember that safety must be our top priority, so I encourage everyone to exercise great caution as the cleanup continues."
