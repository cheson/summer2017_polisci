Location: Flint, MI

Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city's drinking water until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is completed, Gov. Rick Snyder said.
Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority through next summer, when the KWA is expected to be completed. The Flint city government will provide $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation has committed $4 million.
"All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water," Snyder said. "The technical experts helping the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit's willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation's generous commitment, and the dedication of all parties to come together to protect Flint families and children."
