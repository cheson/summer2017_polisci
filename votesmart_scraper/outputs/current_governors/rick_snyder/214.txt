Location: Lansing, MI

Michigan's application for $15 million in federal funding to assist the city of Flint's workforce needs has been approved by the U.S. Department of Labor, Gov. Rick Snyder said.
"We are pursuing every available avenue to support the families of Flint," Snyder said. "This grant will provide temporary employment for eligible residents, allowing them to support the humanitarian work taking place in the city as well as providing them with the skills that will translate to longer-term employment. We appreciate the federal government's prompt and positive reaction to Michigan's request and will continue our efforts to develop the talent that exists throughout the city."
The initiative will provide temporary jobs for workers to assist the community's recovery while also providing humanitarian assistance to residents. The funding will come through the National Dislocated Worker Grant Program, which assists states and other eligible applicants in responding to unanticipated events that cause significant job losses.
Of the $15 million approved, $7.5 million will be released up front to provide temporary employment for eligible individuals who will assist with recovery work, and provide career and training services that could lead to permanent employment.
Temporary jobs funded by the grant include delivering water, filters and related supplies to impacted residents. Other work may include work on damaged water lines, as well as clean-up and recycling efforts.
The request for this grant is part of the governor's comprehensive action plan designed to help the people of Flint recover from the water crisis.
