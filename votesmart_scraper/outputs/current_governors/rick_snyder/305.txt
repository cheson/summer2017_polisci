Michiganders will have safer roads and stronger bridges to travel on, after Gov. Rick Snyder today signed a seven-bill package implementing the state's legislative solution to infrastructure funding.
The governor signed the bills in a public ceremony at the Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association, where he was joined by Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, House Speaker Kevin Cotter, lawmakers, officials representing community, labor and business organizations, and numerous other stakeholders who worked diligently on a road funding solution.
"This package provides the single largest investment in transportation funding over the last half century. It will go a long way to improve Michigan's roads and ensure a safe and efficient system of transportation essential to a stronger future," Snyder said. "Residents and visitors alike deserve much better than what we drive on today. This targeted, ongoing investment will help preserve and fix our infrastructure now and in the future, which is fundamental to continuing and accelerating our economic comeback."
