Governor Rick Snyder today issued the following statement regarding President Obama's visit to Marquette:
"All Michiganders can take great pride in the national recognition earned by Northern Michigan University and the communities of Marquette County. Their partnership to expand high-speed wireless internet services through NMU's WiMAX network wisely recognizes the critical need to enhance online availability in the 21st century. This cutting-edge approach benefits students and families while providing an essential tool that drives business development.
"At the state level, we are working aggressively to provide additional online and self-service alternatives for Michigan residents. Expanding wireless capabilities in the Upper Peninsula complements our efforts and provides welcome conveniences to U.P. customers. The President is right to highlight this initiative as a model of cooperation and innovation. We welcome the President to Michigan and look forward to him sharing this Upper Peninsula success story across America. We also applaud NMU and the Marquette area as they get their well-deserved attention on the national stage. They are outstanding ambassadors for the Upper Peninsula and our entire state."
