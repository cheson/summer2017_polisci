Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Bills Streamlining Concealed Pistol Licensing in Michigan
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: March 4, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation that will reform how licenses for concealed pistols are issued in Michigan. The bills will streamline the process across all counties, dissolving county gun boards and transferring all application and licensing duties to county clerks and the Michigan State Police.
"These bills streamline how we issue concealed pistol licenses, creating a uniform system that will better support the rights of firearm owners in Michigan," Snyder said. "I appreciate that the Legislature revamped this legislation, removing any unintended consequences that could have put domestic abuse victims in danger."
Senate Bills 34 and 35, sponsored by state Sen. Mike Green, will eliminate lengthy application periods by creating a uniform, centralized system when applying for a concealed pistol license. The bills also require MSP to establish an online permit renewal system by October 2018. The change makes Michigan the 47th state to update its concealed pistol licensing process in this similar manner.
Snyder vetoed similar legislation last session, despite supporting most of the included reforms, due to a provision that could have increased the risk of violence and intimidation faced by domestic abuse victims who seek court protection.
The bills will take effect Dec. 1, 2015 and are now Public Acts 3 and 4 of 2015.
