New Law Allows College Students to Postpone Jury Duty
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Feb. 18, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder signed a bill today that allows full-time college students to postpone jury duty until the end of the school year.
"Serving on a jury is an important part of our civic responsibility," Snyder said. "However, for college students, jury duty can be disruptive to their studies. This law gives them the opportunity to focus on their education while still giving them the opportunity to serve after the school year."
House Bill 4570, sponsored by state Rep. Kevin Cotter, requires the chief judge of a judicial circuit or district to postpone the jury duty of students at Michigan's public universities, community colleges and other educational institutions and vocational schools, if the student proves that it would interfere with his or her class schedule. A similar exemption already exists for eligible high-school students.
HB 4570 is now Public Act 10 of 2014.
The governor also signed Senate Bill 475 today.
The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Hildenbrand, creates the Trampoline Court Safety Act. It requires trampoline court establishments to publicly display instructions and court rules, inform customers of the activity's inherent dangers, and comply with trampoline court safety standards. It is now PA 11.
