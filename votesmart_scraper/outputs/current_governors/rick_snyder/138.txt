Gov. Rick Snyder: It's Time to Build on Michigan's Momentum
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 15, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's unemployment rate in May dropped to 4.7 percent, the lowest it has been since March 2001.
"Michigan's unemployment rate peaked at 14.9 percent in June 2009 and was the highest in the nation. Since then, Michigan has seen the largest unemployment decrease in the country -- and our rate now stands at 4.7 percent. With this positive jobs report, the fiscal year 2017 budget completed and legislation in place to help improve education in Detroit, it's clear that Michigan is moving in the right direction.
"Now it's time to build on that momentum. There is more to do to fulfill our goal of a brighter future for all Michiganders. We're making significant investments in Flint, Detroit's schools, K-12 education, skilled trades and other critical areas that will help continue our comeback. We will keep moving forward so that Michigan's reinvention can continue long into the future."
