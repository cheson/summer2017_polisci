Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after both the Michigan House and Senate approved legislation to ensure Detroit Public Schools has the funding to finish the current school year:
"I appreciate the Legislature working quickly this week to approve funding that will keep the students who attend Detroit Public Schools in their classrooms through the end of the school year. The kids of Detroit need to be in school and learning if they are to have a brighter future, and the bipartisan support for this funding shows how important the issue is to everyone.
"This supplemental funding doesn't change the fact that a long-term legislative solution is still needed to bring about fiscal stability and responsibility as well as improved academic outcomes within DPS. I'm confident the Legislature will continue its bipartisan focus on helping Detroit students succeed and we will get there soon. "
