Statewide unemployment once again dropping below the national average is excellent news. These numbers should encourage all Michiganders to continue to work hard and keep our foot on the gas.

The state's continued commitment to workforce development along with the lowest unemployment rate our state has seen in nearly 17 years proves that.
