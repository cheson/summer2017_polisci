Firefighters who have trained and been certified in other states will be eligible for employment in Michigan, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"We want to welcome residents from other states and make it as easy as possible for them to find jobs here," Snyder said. "This new law also will help municipalities save money, as they do not have to pay to retrain new hires."
