Statement

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding the 2010 U.S. Census figures released today:
"The census figures clearly show how crucial it is to reinvent Michigan. It is time for all of us to realign our expectations so that they reflect today's realities. We cannot cling to the old ways of doing business. This is why my administration has aggressively laid out an agenda based on fiscal discipline, meaningful tax reform and regional cooperation.
"These strategies are essential if we are to reverse the negative population trends. We cannot successfully transition to the "New Michigan' if young, talented workers leave our state. By the same token, Michigan will not succeed if Detroit and other major cities don't succeed. We all must be partners in Michigan's reinvention.
"I told a group of high school students yesterday the problems we face as a state should have been fixed years ago and that I will not leave them unsolved for future generations to deal with. This data reinforces just how urgent that task is so that our high school and college graduates can find jobs and lead successful, productive lives in Michigan.
"The consequences of accepting the status quo are apparent in these trends. Losing our best and brightest young adults to other states, or failing to rejuvenate our urban areas, are not acceptable options. Fundamental change is needed and we will achieve that by working together with relentless positive action. The challenges posed by these census numbers will be met. We will use these census trends as guideposts as we implement new, collaborative approaches that move our state forward."
