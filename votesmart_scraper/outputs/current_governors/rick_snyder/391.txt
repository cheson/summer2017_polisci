Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Several Bills to Improve Quality of Life for Michigan Residents
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 3, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation that will reform regulation of mobile home parks, ensuring better safety protections for residents and allowing new actions to be taken against owners who allow parks to fall into disrepair.
"Regulations are meant to ensure that homes and businesses are habitable and safe, not get in the way of such efforts," Snyder said. "This bill eliminates barriers of communication and provides remedies for issues that arise in mobile home parks, for the safety of all residents."
House Bill 4054, sponsored by state Rep. Andy Schor, increases communications among agencies concerning inspections and guidelines for licensed parks. This new law is an effort to improve conditions in all mobile home parks after the Life O'Riley Park in Lansing had to be condemned and its residents evacuated after it was found to be uninhabitable. It is now Public Act 40 of 2015.
