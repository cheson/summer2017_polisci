Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding the president's State of the Union address scheduled for tonight:

"As Michigan's reinvention continues, we look for Washington to join us as a partner so that the Great Lakes State can realize its full potential. The states can't go it alone. The federal government must step forward with clear, achievable goals that successfully confront chronic challenges such as job growth, the staggering national debt and common-sense immigration reform.

"Michigan is doing its part. We're working nonstop so families have more and better jobs, and our children are equipped to take advantage of the exciting opportunities that await them. Michigan is moving forward with courage and vision. Gone are the days when we simply kicked the can down the road and dumped problems in the laps of future generations. Standing together, we've returned fiscal responsibility to our state, overhauled the tax structure and built our policy agenda around the needs of working families and children. We're doing what's right rather than what's easy, and I strongly encourage Washington to act with that same conviction.

"The president has a great opportunity to assure states that this is a time for action at the federal level. With that confidence, Michigan will continue to reinvent itself and emerge as a national model of success. We know what needs to be done. Let's work together to do what's best for Michigan and America."
