Governor Signs Bill to Fund, Maintain Sex Offender Registry
Press Release

Legislation signed today by the governor will require registered sex offenders to pay a yearly fee to maintain the state's sex offender registry.
Senate Bill 221, sponsored by state Sen. Rick Jones, requires registered offenders to pay the $50 annual fee, required for as long as the offender is required to be on the registry. The bill is now Public Act 149 of 2013.
"This law will help reduce taxpayer costs to maintain Michigan's sex offender registry," Gov. Rick Snyder said. "By requiring registered sex offenders to pay an annual fee to fund the registry website, law enforcement will be able to direct more of its resources to public safety."
Previously, registered sex offenders only had to pay a one-time fee, which only provided enough revenue to cover about 10 percent of the cost to maintain the state's sex offender registry.
Michigan now joins neighboring states in charging a fee to maintain a sex offender registry website. Indiana also charges $50 per year for its registry, and Illinois and Ohio each charge offenders $100 per year.
