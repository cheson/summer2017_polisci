Snyder Signs Bill to Better Protect Children from Sex Offenders
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 1, 2012
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to protect children from all sex offenders, including their parents.

Senate Bill 1005, sponsored by state Sen. Judy Emmons, amends the Juvenile Code to comply with federal guidelines. It allows the family court to terminate the parental rights of a parent required to register as a sex offender. To ensure the proper care of children, the duties of legal guardians are expanded to include early childhood, child and adolescent development training.

"Our children deserve a safe, nurturing environment in which to grow and develop," Snyder said. "Protecting them from any type of abuse is a key priority."

The bill now is Public Act 115 of 2012.

Snyder also signed S.B. 349, sponsored by Sen. Dave Hildenbrand, which changes the deadline for a property owner to file an affidavit claiming an exemption for a principal residence. It also allows lending institutions that own foreclosed properties to retain the principal residency exemption. The bill is now P.A. 114 of 2012.
