Patients will save money on prescription medication for long-term chronic health conditions under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Everyone should have access to high quality, affordable healthcare," Snyder said. "By lowering the costs of prescription drugs we can help provide Michiganders with the opportunity to better manage long-term health conditions."
SB 150, sponsored by state Sen. Margaret O'Brien, helps reduce costs by curbing waste of prescription medications. The bill requires insurers who provide prescription drug coverage to prorate the daily cost-sharing rate for patients who do not use a full 30-day supply. It also creates a program for patients to synchronize multiple prescriptions for a chronic health condition.
