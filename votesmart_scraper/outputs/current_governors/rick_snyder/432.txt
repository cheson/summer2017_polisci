Gov. Rick Snyder said today's launch of the Michigan Department of Talent and Economic Development demonstrates that Michigan is taking the lead in closing the talent gap by preparing its people for the highly skilled, technical jobs of today and tomorrow.
Snyder created the new state department through Executive Order 2014-12. The department is led by Steve Arwood, who is also the CEO of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.

"This new department will accelerate the state's effort to become a national leader in connecting highly skilled talent with in-demand jobs. This team is poised to help Michigan prosper by engaging partners across the state with the bold goal of tackling the skills gap head on through innovative and effective workforce development programs," Snyder said.

TED brings state job creation and economic development efforts together under one umbrella. The department consists of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the Michigan State Housing Development Authority, the Michigan Strategic Fund and the newly created Talent Investment Agency.

TIA joins the efforts of the Workforce Development Agency and the Unemployment Insurance Agency to integrate new workers into the economy and help those workers that have been in or out of the workforce transition into new jobs. It will coordinate state programs involving jobs preparedness, career-based education, skilled trades training, incumbent worker training, employment assistance, STEM training programs and programs targeted at the structurally unemployed. TIA is headed by Stephanie Comai, previously deputy director of the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.
Immediate priorities to enhance talent development include:
