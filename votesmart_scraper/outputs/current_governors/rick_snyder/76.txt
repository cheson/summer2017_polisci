Gov. Rick Snyder Visits Michigan's Sister State in China
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Nov. 18, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder and the Michigan delegation met Thursday in Guangzhou with Party Secretary of Guangdong province Hu Chunhua during the sixth full day of the Governor's 2016 China investment mission.
Hu and a delegation from China visited Michigan in May and signed a sister state agreement with Snyder, the first agreement of its kind to be signed between the state of Michigan and a province of China since 1982.
"Michigan was one of the first states to begin a formal relationship with China, and we are committed to a partnership that allows that to thrive. Guangdong, which is already home to a number of auto companies and suppliers, is a natural fit for Michigan," Snyder said. "These agreements bring a unique vision to our relationships with China and add to Michigan's already unprecedented commitment to helping businesses and people in both of our countries."
Snyder is spending the last days of his mission in Beijing and Nanchang, holding a Michigan press conference and meeting with business leaders and government officials.
The trip marks the Snyder administration's sixth mission to China. Other missions led by Snyder or Lt. Gov. Brian Calley have included Japan, South Korea, Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, Chile, Columbia, Switzerland, Ireland and Great Britain.
