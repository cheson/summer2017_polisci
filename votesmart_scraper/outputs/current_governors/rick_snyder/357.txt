Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder has proclaimed August as Spinal Muscular Atrophy Awareness Month in Michigan to promote increased knowledge and support for both research and those affected by the disease.
The governor also participated in the #SmashSMA social media challenge by creating a video with his @onetoughnerd take on helping smashing SMA for good.
"I am honored to help raise awareness of SMA and all of the people and families it affects," Snyder said. "I encourage all Michiganders to learn more about SMA and consider participating in the "#SmashSMA' challenge. The more we can help do, faster, to stop this deadly disease, the better."
SMA is the leading genetic cause of death in children under the age of two that leads to the degeneration of voluntary muscle movement for those living with the disease, ultimately impacting one's ability to walk, eat or breathe. One in 40 Americans are genetic carriers of SMA.
