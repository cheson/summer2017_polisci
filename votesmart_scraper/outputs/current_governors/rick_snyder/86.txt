Gov. Snyder Reforms Councils to Better Serve Individuals with Disabilities
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Nov. 1, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed an executive order forming a new council to ensure the continued coordination of resources for individuals with disabilities.
Executive Order 2016-20 creates a new Developmental Disabilities Council and abolishes the Michigan State Planning Council for Developmental Disabilities established in 2006. This change allows the new council to better align with state and federal law.
"It's important that Michiganders with disabilities have access to resources to help with their quality of life," Snyder said. "Streamlining these efforts will ensure that advocates can work together cohesively to provide residents with disabilities the best opportunities available."
The council, which will be established within the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, will be composed of individuals with disabilities and advocates or representatives of organizations supporting those with disabilities.
