Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement about Teacher Appreciation Week and National Teacher Day.
"Behind every successful person today, there is a teacher who inspired, motivated and mentored. Our educators play vital roles in the lives of millions of Michiganders. Each of us, I'm certain, can look back and remember teachers who influenced us to reach our potential and opened doors to a lifetime of learning. Our teachers provide the foundation for the rest of our lives.
"This week, we're raising awareness of the importance of teaching in our society and encourage Michiganders to celebrate and honor our educators. But perhaps the most appropriate tribute would be to continue learning and growing, remembering the lessons they taught us and the example they set."
