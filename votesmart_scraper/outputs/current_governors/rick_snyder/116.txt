Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: July 8, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder is joining President Barack Obama's call to lower Michigan and U.S. flags to half-staff today through sunset on Tuesday, July 12, in honor of the victims of the July 7 attacks in Dallas, Texas.
"This attack on the men and women who work to keep us safe was an attack on all of us, and we are all joining in their sorrow," Snyder said. "To the families and colleagues of the officers killed in Dallas, we grieve with you. We will always be grateful for your sacrifice. We will not forget."
Michigan residents, businesses, schools, local governments and other organizations are encouraged to display the flag at half-staff. Flags should be returned to full-staff the evening of Tuesday, July 12.
When flown at half-staff or half-mast, the U. S. flag should be hoisted first to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff or half-mast position. The flag should again be raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day.
