Press Release

Date: March 25, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed bipartisan legislation that will help create jobs and increase tourism by helping expand the state's booming craft beer industry.
The nine-bill package doubles the amount of beer microbrewers may produce, from 30,000 barrels per year to 60,000. It also allows brewpub owners to now have interest in five other pubs, up from the previous two, so long as the combined barrel production does not exceed 18,000 barrels per year. Additionally, small microbreweries that produce less than 1,000 barrels of beer per year are now able to distribute their product directly to retailers under certain conditions.
"Michigan-made beer is award winning and world renowned," Snyder said. "We have the fifth-largest number of microbreweries and brewpubs in the nation, and this legislation will empower our great craft beer industry to keep growing."
According to the Michigan Brewers Guild, the state's brewing industry contributes more than $133 million to the economy and more than $24 million in wages.
The package, House Bills 4709-4711, and Senate Bills 329, 504-507 and 650, do the following:
HB 4709, sponsored by state Rep. Kevin Cotter, doubles the amount of beer microbrewers may produce, from 30,000 barrels per year to 60,000. It is now Public Act 42 of 2014.

HB 4711, sponsored by state Rep. Andy Schor, allows a brewer to sell its beer for on-premises consumption at two locations on its licensed brewery premises. It also allows a microbrewer that produces less than 30,000 barrels of beer per year to sell its beer for on-premises consumption at any brewery licensed premises, and allow a microbrewer that produces between 30,000 and 60,000 barrels of beer per year to sell its beer for on-premises consumption at not more than three licensed brewery locations. It is PA 44.

It is PA 47.
SBs 506 and 507, sponsored by Hune, remove a requirement that brewers, wineries, liquor makers or their wholesalers have to pay a state beer, wine or liquor tax more than once every three months. It also revises details for which entities are required to deliver the tax. They are PAs 48 and 49.

The bill is now PA 52.
SBs 711 and 735, sponsored by state Sen. Jim Marleau, extend the sunset date on sales and use tax exemptions for materials purchased or used in the renovation of Detroit's Cobo Hall, because work is taking longer than expected.
