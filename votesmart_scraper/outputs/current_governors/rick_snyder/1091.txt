State's largest construction trade union signs up to help Rick Reinvent Michigan
Rick Snyder celebrated Labor Day by standing shoulder to shoulder with members of the state's largest construction trade union as they endorsed his 10-point plan to Reinvent Michigan.
Today's endorsement by the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters & Millwrights is a clear example that Michiganders want fresh, new leadership and a positive vision of Michigan's future.
"We have to put an end to the us-against-them mentality that has held our state back for so long. I hope this sends a clear signal that I am committed to making the economy better for everyone," Rick said. "Turning Michigan into a success is going to take all of us working together."
Rick said he appreciated the willingness of the Carpenters & Millwrights to make its decision based on who it thinks is best able to fix the economy instead of basing it on partisan loyalty.
"Carpenters are known for volunteering their time to help their community by building wheelchair ramps for people who cannot afford them - that is exactly the kind of attitude we need to Reinvent our state and I am proud to call them partners in this effort," Rick said.
The Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters & Millwrights is the largest construction trade union in Michigan. It represents more than 18,000 journeypersons and carpenters across the state.
Rick Snyder is the only candidate who is not accepting PAC contributions.
