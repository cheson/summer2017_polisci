Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Bills to Help Michigan Residents Secure Property from Federal Government
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 29, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Nearly 900 acres of land in Calhoun County will be conveyed by the federal government to the state of Michigan so that the state can certify it to the rightful landowners, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Residents of Michigan have settled this land and paid taxes on it, and now it will be rightfully theirs," Snyder said. "The federal government was a great partner in sorting this out, and now the land will continue to be put to good use by Michiganders."
