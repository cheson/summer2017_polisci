Snyder Statement on House Approval of Tax Reform Plan
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 28, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement regarding state House approval of the tax reform initiative (House Bills 4361 and 4362):
"The importance of the House's bold action cannot be overstated. Michigan's current tax structure has been an impediment to job creation and growth for far too long. It lacks the certainty, fairness and simplicity that job providers seek. By stepping up to the plate and passing this initiative, the House sent a clear message that Michigan is serious about putting families back to work.
"I applaud House members for doing their part to put Michigan back on the path to prosperity. In particular, I appreciate the leadership of House Speaker Jase Bolger and Tax Policy Committee Chairman Jud Gilbert. We now look forward to working with our Senate partners so that these bills can soon become law."
