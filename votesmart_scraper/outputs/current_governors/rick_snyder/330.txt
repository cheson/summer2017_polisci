Location: Lansing, MI

A high-tech automotive research and development project announced by Vice President Joe Biden today will tap the talent in Michigan's universities and private sector, helping the state continue its automotive leadership around the world for years to come, Gov. Rick Snyder said.
Biden, speaking in Detroit, said the Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) will share a facility with the Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow (LIFT) program in the city's Corktown neighborhood.
The institute will focus on developing fiber-enforced polymer composites for automotive materials that are lighter and stronger than steel -- helping vehicles become lighter and more fuel-efficient. The program is supported by the U.S. Energy Department and was announced by President Barack Obama in January.
"This project shows how the government can collaborate with the private sector and Michigan's world-class universities on innovative approaches that will be the future of the auto industry," Snyder said. "Michigan is the perfect location for a project that will provide opportunities for collaborative research and the development of new materials that will make cars better worldwide -- keeping and growing the number of jobs here."
