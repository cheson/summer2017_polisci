Epi-Pens and other auto-injectibles of epinephrine will be available in more public places to address severe allergic reactions, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Making Epi-Pens more readily available is a common sense way to protect those who have severe allergies," Snyder said. "With this new law, parents can be more confident sending their kids to camp or on field trips without constant worry of a severe allergic reaction that could threaten their health."
