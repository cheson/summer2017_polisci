Snyder Signs Public Safety Bills to Maintain Michigan's Drunk Driving Standards
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 9, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed into law a pair of public safety bills that will maintain Michigan's current drunk driving standards and sentencing guidelines.
"These are important bills that will help maintain the health and safety of drivers, passengers and pedestrians in our state," Snyder said. "They send a clear message that Michigan is serious about stopping drinking and driving and supporting the ongoing efforts of law enforcement and the courts to protect public safety."

HB 4093, sponsored by state Rep. Andrea LaFontaine, maintains the existing drunk driving standard of 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (BAC) until Oct. 1, 2018. That BAC standard was scheduled to go up to 0.10 percent in October. It also would maintain a 0.04 BAC standard for drivers of commercial vehicles and a "zero tolerance" standard of 0.02 BAC for those under the age of 21.

HB 4131, sponsored by state Rep. Klint Kesto, maintains the existing sentencing guidelines in place for those convicted of exceeding the state's BAC limits.

"This legislation helps save lives - research has proven strict drunk driving laws help reduce alcohol-related fatal crashes by nearly 90 percent," said Col. Kriste Kibbey Etue, director of the Michigan State Police. "Keeping the legal BAC level at .08 forces people to think twice before getting behind the wheel after having too much to drink and keeps Michigan consistent with drunk driving enforcement in all 50 states."

In addition to protecting the public safety, the governor also said the new laws keep Michigan in compliance with federal drunk driving standards and eligible for federal transportation funding.

HB 4093 and HB 4131 are now Public Acts 23 and 24 of 2013.
