Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement in honor of Patriot Day and calls for the lowering of U.S. flags in remembrance of the lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001:
"We join together as Americans to remember the innocent lives lost in the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the sacrifices made. We keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers.
"Patriot Day honors those who perished, first responders, and men and women who demonstrated incredible bravery and compassion. This day will forever be a reminder of the heroic individuals who stood tall in the face of evil to help their fellow Americans.
"We're grateful for all first responders who walk in their footsteps, serving their communities. We also thank the courageous men and women in the armed forces who have paid the ultimate price for freedom, those serving today, and our brave veterans.
"On Friday, Sept. 11, the state of Michigan will lower its flags to half-staff to honor Patriot Day and the victims of the attacks. Please do so as well at your home or workplace. As the flags are lowered, let's remember and pray for the 2,977 lives lost and their families."
