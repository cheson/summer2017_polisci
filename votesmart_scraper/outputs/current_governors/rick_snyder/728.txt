Governor Snyder: Washington, Stop the Gridlock
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Oct. 1, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement about the shutdown of the federal government:
"Today, gridlock in Washington has brought our federal government to a standstill. It's yet another reminder of a fact we know too well: There's something wrong with our national political culture today.
"In Michigan, we're making good progress, but the federal government's shutdown could have an impact on the people of our state. Over 40 percent of Michigan's budget -- just over $20 billion -- comes from federal government funding, and that money pays for services for our citizens such as Medicaid and food assistance for those in need.
"If the federal government is shut down for just a day or two, the effects on Michigan's residents will be minimal. A longer-term shutdown, though, could have consequences. Right now, our budget office is monitoring the situation to determine the impact that the shutdown will have on various federal programs in our state.
"Unlike Washington, we found a way in Michigan to get our fiscal house in order. We've balanced our budget three years in a row, eliminated a $1.5 billion deficit and have saved over $500 million in our rainy day fund. We did it by setting politics aside, planning ahead, and solving one problem after another with relentless positive action.
"Too often, leaders in government play a blame game instead of solving the problems that lay before them. Michiganders see that there's another way. Washington ought to take notice, come to the table and work round the clock to solve this problem for the American people."
