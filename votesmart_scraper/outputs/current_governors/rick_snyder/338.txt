Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder is leading an investment mission to Japan and Germany focusing on strengthening trade relationships and attracting job-creating business investments and looking to expand markets for Michigan-made goods.
"The world is increasingly interconnected and it's important for leaders in other countries to hear about what Michigan has to offer," Snyder said. "We're the leader in automotive research and design, we have a strong manufacturing base and we have a talented workforce. Those qualities are attractive to businesses considering expanding in the United States, and we want them to create those jobs here."
"Our innovative technologies in manufacturing, computers and electronics, alternative energy, homeland security and agriculture have global appeal and we welcome the opportunity to explore smart trade partnerships," Snyder said. "Diverse industries and ease of entry into other European Union countries provide an excellent opportunity for Michigan companies to increase their exports."
