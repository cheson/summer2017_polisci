Snyder Signs Executive Order to Ensure Effectiveness of State Labor Relations Specialists
Press Release

Gov. Rick Snyder has signed an executive order preventing the proposed consolidation of labor relations professionals within state government into a single office.
Executive Order 2011-11 rescinds a portion of a 2009 executive order (EO 2009-55) that required all labor relations functions to be consolidated into the Office of the State Employer. That mandate had not been fully implemented because too many of the affected employees had other duties that required them to remain in their respective departments.
"It is clear that the proposed consolidation was not achieving the desired efficiencies," Snyder said. "Segregating the duties of labor relations specialists from overall human resources functions would not deliver optimal results. To ensure the best possible service to our state employees and provide the most effective results for taxpayers, our labor relations employees should continue to be a key part of their departments on a daily basis."
