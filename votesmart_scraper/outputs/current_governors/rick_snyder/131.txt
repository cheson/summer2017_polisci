Location: Lansing, MI

To provide Michiganders with disabilities increased opportunities for competitive integrated employment, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley and Michigan Supreme Court Justice Richard Bernstein Tuesday held a statewide workshop in Flint, drawing more than 275 attendees from more than 100 organizations across the state.
The inaugural MI Hidden Talent workshop took Calley and Bernstein's statewide tour on disability hiring into the how-to phase.
"Too many individuals with disabilities are underemployed or unemployed in Michigan," Calley said. "We must work together to provide more resources to students and youth with disabilities transitioning from school to employment to ensure they are afforded the same job opportunities as their peers without disabilities."
The State of Michigan has been working to be a more inclusive employer itself since Gov. Snyder signed an executive directive in 2014.
As a continuation of those efforts, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed at the workshop to further increase the number of students and youth with disabilities transitioning from school to employment, as well as post-secondary education intended to lead to employment. The partners included the Michigan Department of Education, Rehabilitation Services, Bureau of Services for Blind Persons, Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Administration, Workforce Development Agency, and Developmental Disabilities Council.
Calley and Bernstein spoke during the workshop, as well as keynote speakers Kathy Burris from CVS Health and Kathy West Evans from the Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation.
