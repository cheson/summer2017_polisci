More than 13,000 job-seekers and workers will receive training for in-demand technical jobs through grants totaling $12.8 million awarded under Michigan's Skilled Trades Training Fund, Gov. Rick Snyder announced today.
The training program was established in 2013 by Snyder and the Legislature to help employers develop the talent they need to fill thousands of available skilled-trades jobs. The fiscal year 2016 funding is on track to create more than 3,100 jobs and retain more than 10,000 positions, with more than 350 employers taking advantage of the program.
"Michigan families continue to benefit from a growing economy and a declining unemployment rate," Snyder said. "Despite these positive trends, there are still too many skilled-trades jobs that employers are struggling to fill. The Skilled Trades Training Fund is an excellent resource that helps employers provide the training that enhances their talent base. The result is more and better jobs for Michigan workers."
