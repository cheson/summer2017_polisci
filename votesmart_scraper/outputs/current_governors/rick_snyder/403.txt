Location: Lansing, MI

Airsoft guns, such as paintball, BB or pellet guns, will no longer qualify as firearms under state law, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder that brings Michigan in line with federal firearms statutes.
"These measures address the confusion that has arisen over Michigan's varying definitions of firearms," Snyder said. "The bills were overwhelmingly supported in both the House and Senate, and will give sportsmen and other residents the clarity they have sought on this issue."
