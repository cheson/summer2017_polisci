Additional school nurses are on duty in Flint public schools to assist students who may dealing with lead exposure, Gov. Rick Snyder said today.
Three nurses started working in several Flint Community Schools on Monday to start monitoring student health and well-being. Two additional nurses are scheduled to report to schools today and a total of nine nurses are expected to be assigned to Flint schools by next week.
"Every Flint school will have nursing services available through this initiative," Snyder said. "Every school may have children affected by lead, which is why our action plans and resources are providing intervention and treatment. We will continue plans to address the long-term needs of Flint's families just as we have addressed their immediate needs through bottled water and filters."
Flint Community Schools is coordinating with the Michigan Department of Education and Catalyst Health Solutions to place nurses in schools.
"On behalf of the children of Flint Community Schools I want to thank everyone who remained committed to providing this invaluable resource," Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. "Nine additional school nurses will strengthen our ability to meet the needs of our students and their families, some who may be impacted by the water crisis."
In January, Snyder signed legislation bringing $28 million to immediately help families in Flint with lead testing, treatment and other emergency services. In total, Snyder has worked with the state Legislature to already secure nearly $70 million to address immediate needs for Flint residents as part of a total recommendation of $230 million in state resources.
