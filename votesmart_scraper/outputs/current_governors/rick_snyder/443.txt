"Hello, I'm Governor Rick Snyder. March is Reading Month, a time to celebrate and recognize the importance of reading. Reading can inspire imagination and creativity, as well as open up a new world of opportunities for Michiganders of all ages.
As Governor, I have put a particular emphasis on improving our children's reading levels by the third grade. That means encouraging children at the earliest stages to discover a love for reading. Promoting reading to our children early on can help them develop strong reading skills that are critical to long-term success.
That's why I hope parents, teachers, and students at all level participate in March is Reading Month. Reading is fun, and it can easily become part of your daily routine.
As we celebrate March is Reading Month, I urge all of you to read with your friends, family and classmates-- not just this month, but every month."
