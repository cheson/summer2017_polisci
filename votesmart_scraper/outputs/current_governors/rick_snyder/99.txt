Statement

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for August remained at 4.5 percent, its lowest point since January 2001.
"As we move forward and work to continue our comeback, it's encouraging to see that Michigan's unemployment rate remains below the national average and more than 10 points lower than its peak in the summer of 2009. Our job creators have added more than 450,000 private sector jobs in five and a half years, and there are nearly 100,000 jobs available today in Michigan on www.mitalent.org. That reminds us of how far we've come but how much work we still have to do.
"We need to close the skills gap, better connect Michiganders with existing jobs, and ensure that our residents are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the high-tech careers of the 21st century. We will continue our efforts to strengthen our workforce and create more opportunities for all Michiganders."
