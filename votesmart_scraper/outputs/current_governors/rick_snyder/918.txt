Snyder Signs Bill Providing Medical Amnesty to Minors Seeking Alcohol Poisoning Treatment
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 8, 2012
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation providing medical amnesty for minors who seek treatment for alcohol poisoning either for themselves or another individual.

H.B. 4393 is sponsored by state Rep. Anthony Forlini. Currently, individuals under the age of 21 can receive a misdemeanor offense for the purchase, possession or consumption of alcohol, which sometimes deters minors from seeking proper medical attention. Although already an informal practice among law enforcement in many areas of the state, including medical amnesty in the law will encourage minors to seek assistance sooner if they or another appear to have consumed an unsafe amount. The bill now is Public Act 125.

"Ensuring the safety of our youth is a priority," Snyder said. "Removing the fear of penalty when seeking emergency assistance can help save lives."

The governor also signed the following bills:

Senate Bills 29, 30 and 93, which allow citizens with concealed pistol licenses and specialized training to carry a Taser as a nonlethal form of self-protection. State Sen. Geoff Hansen sponsored S.B.s 29 and 93, and state Sen. Rick Jones sponsored S.B. 30. They now are P.A.s 122, 123 and 124, respectively.

H.B. 4658, sponsored by Forlini, removes the sales tax exemption on prisoner-purchased items in correctional facilities. Prisoners should pay the same tax rate as other citizens, and the tax is expected to bring in about $300,000 per year to the state. The bill now is P.A. 126.

H.B. 5057, sponsored by state Rep. Lisa Posthumus Lyons, allows for faster implementation of a fee on heirloom birth certificates. Of the $40 fee, $20 will go to the Children's Trust Fund. The bill now is P.A. 127.
