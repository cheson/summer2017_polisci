Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Bipartisan Bill Extending Filing Deadline for Flint Mayoral Election
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 5, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to authorize extension of the filing deadline for the Flint city election, ensuring mayoral and city council candidates who filed petitions with the necessary signatures will be placed on the ballot for the primary election this August.
"It's important that Flint voters have their voices heard regarding who their next mayor will be," Snyder said. "I appreciate the quick actions of the Legislature in seeking a solution for this situation and working together to get it done."
Senate Bill 329, sponsored by state Sen. Jim Ananich, allows the Michigan Bureau of Elections to adjust the filing deadline for this year only, and authorizes pre- and post-election reviews in the City of Flint from now until 2017. The bill is now Public Act 43 of 2015.
