Bill Signed to Help Fill Funding Gap for Affordable Housing Projects
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed a bill that will help fill a gap between what a developer can pay and what banks are willing to lend for commercial mixed-use and multifamily residential developments.
Senate Bill 347, sponsored by state Sen. Mark Jansen, clears the way for the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) to create the Michigan Mezzanine Fund, which will leverage existing funds to invest in those housing developments. It allows MSHDA to attract outside capital to help fill the funding gap and diversifies MSHDA's revenue streams, allowing the authority to free up more funds for investment in affordable housing for the state's low-to-moderate income residents.
"The Michigan Mezzanine Fund will not only help fill a funding gap, but it will also boost the housing, real estate and construction industries in our state," Snyder said. "This is an important part of our plan to revitalize Michigan's urban cores."
MSHDA, which provides financial and technical assistance through public and private partnerships, will serve as general partner of the fund. The investment fund will be seeded with $25 million in non-taxpayer dollars, and leverage that with an additional $75 million-$100 million in private investments. The fund will then fill the gap between the equity a developer can bring to a project and the 60-70 percent that banks are willing to lend on a development.
SB 347 is now Public Act 116 of 2013.
