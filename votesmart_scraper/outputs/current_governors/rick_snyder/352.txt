Gov. Rick Snyder today directed the Michigan State Police to amend a recent disaster declaration for Grand Traverse County to include Leelanau County after severe thunderstorms caused widespread damage in both counties on Aug. 2.
"Last week's severe storms took a toll on homes, businesses, public roads and public buildings throughout Grand Traverse and Leelanau counties," Snyder said. "As more information has come in about lingering impact, we are striving to help Leelanau County to ensure residents and businesses there have the resources they need to recover as quickly as possible."
Leelanau County requested a governor's declaration after determining local resources are insufficient to address the situation and state assistance is required to protect public health, safety and property to lessen or avert the threat of a crisis.
The Michigan Emergency Management Act allows the director of the Michigan State Police, or his or her designee, to amend a declaration with the concurrence of the governor.
Communities in both counties have been coping with widespread and severe damage resulting from the storms, including an extraordinarily large amount of fallen tree debris. Efforts have been underway by local communities to stabilize structures and remove debris to ensure public health and safety.
The declaration for Grand Traverse and Leelanau counties ensures all possible state resources will be provided to support local recovery efforts.
The governor's declaration authorizes the Michigan State Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division to coordinate state response and recovery efforts. The State Emergency Operations Center has been activated to coordinate these efforts since Aug. 11.
