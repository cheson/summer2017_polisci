Today we remember those who perished in the attacks of September 11, 2001, and we pray for the survivors and the families who lost loves ones on that day.
We also remember those who have sacrificed their lives in defense of our freedoms. We are grateful for their sacrifices on behalf of the American people.
Our thoughts and thanks reach out to our veterans and the members of the military still serving today, those stationed in Afghanistan and around the world. We owe them a debt of gratitude and much more.
The scars of September 11 still remain, but together we will continue moving forward in a positive way to improve our local communities, our state and our country.
