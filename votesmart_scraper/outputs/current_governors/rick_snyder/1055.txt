Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement in support of breast cancer awareness activities, including the Susan G. Komen Mid-Michigan Race for the Cure, which is Sunday, April 17 in downtown Lansing:
"Early detection is key in the fight against breast cancer. We can all help save lives by raising awareness of the need for women to have routine examinations. In the days leading up to the Susan G. Komen Mid-Michigan Race for the Cure, we are proud to continue the tradition of placing pink ribbons in the Romney building in downtown Lansing to show our support for this cause. The Race for the Cure is one of the largest events dedicated to this fight. My wife, Sue, and I applaud all who take the time to join this worthy cause. The more awareness we raise, the closer we come to finding a cure."
With the first lady a seven-year breast cancer survivor, the cause is near and dear to the Snyder family.
