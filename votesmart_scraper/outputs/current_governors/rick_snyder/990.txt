Snyder Responds to Bing's Address
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Nov. 16, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement in reaction to Detroit Mayor Dave Bing's Fiscal Crisis and Service Issues address this evening:
"I have consistently said that as we work to reinvent Michigan, the City of Detroit must thrive. Mayor Bing and I have worked closely over this past year and I remain supportive of the city's efforts to resolve its financial problems.
"As I have said previously on this issue, I want to avoid an emergency manager if at all possible. Based on the mayor's remarks tonight and the severity of the situation he described, we anticipate he will be submitting a request for a preliminary financial review in the near future."
