Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder's office today posted additional batches of Executive Office emails, accompanying documents and related materials from Snyder's briefings regarding the Flint water crisis from 2011 through Jan. 5, when the state declared an emergency in the city.
"After the previous 14 batches of emails were released, we continued to search for emails and materials related to the Flint water crisis as part of our ongoing effort to be transparent," Snyder said. "By making the information easily accessible, everyone can review it, and then we can all focus on working together to find solutions and ways to move Flint forward."
The release of these latest batches of emails is in addition to the release of Snyder's Flint-related emails on Jan. 20 and the initial release of the Executive Office's Flint-related emails on Feb. 26. All emails and corresponding documents that had been made available to requesting entities from state departments were also posted publicly on Feb. 12, and periodic additions continue to be made.
All materials being released are available today at www.michigan.gov/snyder.
