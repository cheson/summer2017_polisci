Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to ensure more effective and efficient use of taxpayer transportation dollars.
House Bill 5007, sponsored by state Rep. Patrick Somerville, transfers the ability to run performance audits of local road agencies from the Department of Treasury to the Department of Transportation.

"The state has a duty to confirm that local road agencies use state dollars effectively," Snyder said. "Transferring this duty to MDOT guarantees the best expertise in these audits."

The bill now is Public Act 298 of 2012.

The governor also signed H.B. 5146, sponsored by state Rep. Peter MacGregor, which clarifies the application of the use tax to a manufacturer who affixes its product to real estate. The bill now is P.A. 299.
