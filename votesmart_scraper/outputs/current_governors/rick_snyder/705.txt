Today, Governor Rick Snyder issued a Thanksgiving greeting to the people of Michigan -- and a call to action.
"I want to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving. It's a time to be thankful for family and friends, for the wonderful things we have in our lives, for our great state. Our future is brighter and our economy is growing. We can accomplish so much by working together."
"As part of the Thanksgiving season, we have a chance to give back too. So I'm encouraging all Michiganders to join the Michigan Ambassadors program through the Community Service Commission at DoSomethingMichigan.com."
"Do Something!' encourages citizens to volunteer in their communities. The program helps Michiganders get connected to volunteer opportunities, share their stories of volunteerism or successes in the state, and pledge to get others involved.
Volunteer opportunities can be found at the DoSomethingMichigan.com website. Users also may text "ACTION" to 25827 or call 1-855-440-6424 toll-free to get involved.
Governor Snyder delivered his Thanksgiving greeting from the floor of Focus: HOPE in Detroit on Saturday, where he helped package meals for seniors alongside volunteers from AmeriCorps, Detroit Young Professionals and State of Michigan employees. Governor Snyder says that this holiday season is an opportunity to take action.
"In addition to really enjoying family, friends and a big win for the Lions this Thanksgiving, we have a chance to give back, to help fellow Michiganders," he said.
