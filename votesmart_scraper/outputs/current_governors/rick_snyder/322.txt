Gov. Rick Snyder has signed legislation that will allow local governments to maintain electronic property tax rolls instead of requiring them to routinely print lengthy paper copies.
"Local governments are constantly finding new ways to streamline services and save taxpayer money," Snyder said. "Allowing them to use electronic property tax rolls is another great move to accomplish both goals."
