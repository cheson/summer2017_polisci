Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 1, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation authorizing funding for autism programs and family support systems at Eastern Michigan University, Michigan State University and Western Michigan University. The funding will help the universities to further develop and expand their existing programs, resulting in autism centers of excellence to increase the number of diagnostic centers available to help patients and their families.
"Giving universities the resources they need to help build a skilled workforce of behavioral science professionals is an integral step in having advanced options for diagnosing and treating autism," Snyder said. "l appreciate the universities being a partner in this collaboration as Michigan works to meet the needs of all of its residents."
Senate Bill 137, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Hildenbrand, shifts $3 million for the university autism programs from the Dept. of Community Health for Fiscal Year 2014-15.
Snyder today also signed a measure to allocate the resources needed to further the establishment of an efficient system of trauma care for crime victims. Senate Bill 138, also sponsored by state Sen. Dave Hildenbrand, extends funding from the Crime Victim's Rights Fund that can be used for trauma system development.
Both bills help to implement Executive Order 2015-5 issued earlier this year. The bills will take immediate effect and are now Public Acts 8 and 9 of 2015.
