Statement

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 percent while the state's workforce rose by 6,000 for the month of March.
"As we continue on the path toward our future, it is encouraging to see our state's unemployment rate go down while the number of Michiganders entering the workforce continues to rise. Not only are Michiganders showing increased faith in our state's reinvented economy, but more residents are successfully finding employment opportunities.
"While these latest numbers are certainly promising, we must not become complacent. Since 2010, more than half-a-million private-sector jobs have been created and more are on the way. Now we need to make sure Michiganders have access to the education and training necessary to work in the high-demand, high-wage careers now available."
