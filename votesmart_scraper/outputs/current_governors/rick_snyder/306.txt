To showcase the opportunities for skilled trades careers in Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder today kicked off a road show at the Kent Career Tech Center in Grand Rapids.
Snyder toured the tech center's campus and lab facilities to see the innovative projects being worked on by students and instructors. Following the tour, he joined Stephanie Comai, director of the Michigan Talent Investment Agency, Jay Dunwell, president of Wolverine Coil Spring in Grand Rapids, to talk with students about in-demand skills that can lead to successful, well-paying careers.
"The availability of a skilled workforce is one of the factors businesses use when determining locating or growing their business," Snyder said. That's why we are working to make Michigan the national leader in talent development. We need to make sure that students know what opportunities are out there for these respected, high-paying careers in growing and innovative industries."
