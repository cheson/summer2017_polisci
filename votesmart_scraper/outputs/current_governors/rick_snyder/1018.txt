Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement in observance of Labor Day:
"Michigan's greatness is a reflection of its people, especially the working men and women who built our state and continue driving it forward by contributing so greatly to their workplaces and communities.
"Our work force is unmatched in terms of dedication and skill. Working families simply need opportunities to use their talents and that's why we're committed to reinventing Michigan. In partnership with the Legislature, we are laying the groundwork that will create an environment in which jobs are created and opportunities abound. We also are committed to ensuring that the next generation of workers is ready and able to successfully compete in this global economy. The innovative education reforms we're enacting are critical to preparing students for life in this sophisticated, knowledge-based age.
"Many of the decisions we've made have been difficult. They are, however, necessary to help Michigan regain its national prominence as an economic powerhouse. Our state once again will be the envy of America if we continue moving forward together as one Michigan.
"This holiday weekend will be a great time to enjoy a true Pure Michigan experience. Best wishes to all Michigan residents for a safe, relaxing Labor Day."
