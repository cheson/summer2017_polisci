Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement in observance of Labor Day:
"Michigan is the comeback state, and our reinvention could not happen without the hard work and dedication of the women and men of our talented work force. Today we stand together stronger than we have in a decade. More Michigan residents are working and earning more, businesses and farms are producing and exporting more, and our state's population and economy continue to grow. These positive results have not come easily, but they reflect the collaboration and energy that abound in every corner of our state. We will continue to work with relentless, positive action to bring more and better jobs to our state and to provide a bright future for our kids. We observe Labor Day in honor of all of this hard work and I hope everyone throughout our great state enjoys a fun, safe Pure Michigan holiday weekend."
