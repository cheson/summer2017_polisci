After a departmental review of circumstances during the time period leading to the Flint water crisis, the former head of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality's Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance unit was officially terminated from state employment today, Gov. Rick Snyder said.
"Putting the well-being of Michiganders first needs to be the top priority for all state employees," Snyder said. "Anything less than that is unacceptable. The DEQ is working to change this culture and ensure mistakes that endanger our residents don't occur again."
This former supervisor was dismissed today after a disciplinary conference regarding performance. A departmental review of the actions of a second employee who was suspended last month are continuing.
