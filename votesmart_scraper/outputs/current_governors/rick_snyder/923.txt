Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 1, 2012
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation that makes it easier for eligible cities and townships to receive Economic Vitality Incentive Program (EVIP) dollars to fund employee compensation programs.
"Since we first implemented this program last year cities and townships across the state have been constantly coming up with innovative new ways to deliver services more efficiently and save taxpayers money. This change will help keep that positive momentum going," Snyder said.
The legislation also extends the deadline for compliance by a month from May 1 to June 1. To qualify, local units of government must develop a new plan for cost-savings in retirement and health care packages.
House Bill 5189, sponsored by state Rep. Amanda Price, is now Public Act 107 of 2012.
EVIP is an incentive-based grant program that replaces traditional statutory revenue sharing.
