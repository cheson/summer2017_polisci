Gov. Rick Snyder today offered the following statement of support after State Treasurer Nick Khouri approved the Receivership Transition Advisory Board's recommendation that additional executive powers be returned to the mayor of Flint.
"Last week, I agreed with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver's request for the powers and authority vested in the city administrator to be transferred to the mayor, and I support the RTAB's decision today to return additional executive powers to Mayor Weaver during this critically important time. This is a positive step forward for the city of Flint.
"Mayor Weaver will now have the authority to appoint the city administrator and all department heads. Today's action is the next step in transitioning to full, local control in Flint."
