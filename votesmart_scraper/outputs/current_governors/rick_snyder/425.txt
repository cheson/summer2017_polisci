Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: March 30, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement after the Coalition for the Future of Detroit Schoolchildren issued its recommendations for the future of schools in the city:
"I respect the work of the coalition and its many members who put so many hours into planning a new course for education in Detroit. These are ideas that sprouted from people across the city, including educators, union leaders, business leaders and the philanthropic community. Their common traits are a love for Detroit and its people and the belief that we can and must do better as we prepare the next generations of leaders. There must be higher standards for all schools. Detroit can only be a stronger, more vibrant city if its schools provide the opportunity for all students to be successful academically and in life.
"I share those beliefs. We will thoroughly review the coalition's recommendations as the state continues its work on a comprehensive approach to reform to present to our partners in the Legislature, looking for areas of alignment and common ground in the weeks ahead. I look forward to continuing our work in this area that is vitally important to our largest city and our state as a whole."
