Gov. Rick Snyder Requests Disaster Declaration From Small Business Administration
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Feb. 4, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today requested an Economic Disaster Declaration for Genesee County and the City of Flint, from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). A disaster declaration from SBA would pave the way for financial assistance for Flint residents and business owners impacted by lead-contaminated water in the City of Flint.
"While we continue to coordinate resources from all levels to ensure the health and welfare of Flint residents, we must also recognize that some Flint-area businesses have been impacted by this water emergency," Gov. Snyder said. "An SBA disaster declaration can help ensure that those businesses have access to federally subsidized loans."
If approved, the SBA disaster assistance program provides low-interest loans for small businesses and private, nonprofit organizations that "suffered substantial economic injury as a direct result of the contaminated public water supply," according to the Governor's request. The SBA tailors the repayment of each disaster loan to the borrower's financial capability.
Gov. Snyder declared a state of emergency on Jan. 5 for Genesee County. The declaration makes available all state resources in cooperation with local response and recovery efforts in the county as outlined in the Michigan Emergency Management Plan. On Jan. 28, the state of emergency was extended until April 14, 2016.
