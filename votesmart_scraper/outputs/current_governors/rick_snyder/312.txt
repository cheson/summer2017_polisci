Gov. Rick Snyder today issued an executive order creating the State of Michigan Retirement Board, which will consolidate the administration and oversight of the State Employees' Retirement System Board, the Judges' Retirement System Board and the Military Retirement Provisions.
Gov. Snyder signed Executive Order 2015-13 which locates the new consolidated board under the supervision of the Department of Technology, Management and Budget (DTMB), through its Office of Retirement Services. The board will provide oversight of the three systems that service nearly 88,000 active and retired employees.
"This action will help ensure the most coordinated and efficient management of these functions and provide the best service for members of the retirement systems while streamlining government," Snyder said.
