Snyder Signs Bill to Enhance Law Enforcement in Pictured Rocks Park
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 2, 2012
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to allow for better law enforcement inside Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore near Munising.
Senate Bill 617, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Casperson, allows National Park Service law enforcement rangers in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore to use state law to respond to crimes against people. This ensures immediate law enforcement within the park and relieves state and county officials from responding to all incidents.
"Part of protecting our state treasures is ensuring the National Park Service has the authority necessary to provide public safety inside the park," Snyder said.
The bill now is Public Act 116 of 2012.
In addition, Snyder signed five other bills:
House Bill 4346, sponsored by state Rep. John Walsh, and S.B. 428, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Hildenbrand, alter the timing of when the state receives use and sales tax payments from businesses with a total tax liability in the previous calendar year of $720,000 or more. The bills now are P.A.s 117 and 118 of 2012, respectively.
H.B. 4751, sponsored by state Rep. Joel Johnson, deletes all references to the Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Board, which was eliminated in 2007, from the correlating statute. The board's previous duties now are the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. The bill now is P.A. 119 of 2012.
H.B. 4845, sponsored by state Rep. Frank Foster, defines standards for a Boater's Safety Certificate and requires that boat operators aged 12 or younger possess a certificate and be supervised by someone of at least 16 years old. The bill now is P.A. 120 of 2012.
H.B. 4974, sponsored by state Rep. Amanda Price, fixes the spelling of Sgt. Gordon Yntema's name in a state law designating a portion of U.S. 31 as the Medal of Honor Recipients Highway. The bill now is P.A. 121 of 2012.
