Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today thanked the U.S. House of Representatives for passage of the Water Resources Development Act, which includes millions of dollars for water infrastructure funding for Flint and other cities nationwide.
"The House's action today moves us one step closer to additional federal funding to help move Flint forward," said Gov. Rick Snyder. "This money would complement the state's ongoing efforts to help the families of Flint recover. I encourage the House and Senate to reach a compromise in conference committee as soon as possible."
The governor has worked extensively with leadership in both chambers of Congress since January to put together a federal aid package that will build on the state's ongoing response efforts.
The city of Flint has been allocated $27 million to date from state taxpayers to replace lead service lines in the city. This is part of the total of $234 million committed by the state to provide health care services and clean water resources for residents of Flint.
Resources from the House WRDA bill would help with other infrastructure improvements, and includes the authorization of $170 million for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. The DWSRF would be available for use in states which have an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act related to contaminants in drinking water.
