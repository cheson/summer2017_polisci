Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Bill Extending Help to Firefighters Facing Cancer
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed a bill providing Michigan firefighters with support if they develop cancer on the job.
"We all value the important work our firefighters do each and every day," Snyder said. "Firefighters face significant, and frequently unidentifiable, hazards on the job. This bill recognizes the potential health risks they face, especially in terms of cancers, and simplifies the claims process so stricken firefighters can get assistance they need."
Senate Bill 211, sponsored by state Sen. Tory Rocca, allows firefighters who meet certain conditions to qualify for compensation through a First Responders Fund. Snyder wrote in a letter to state lawmakers that he has some concerns that the bill did not include a funding mechanism for the program, and called on lawmakers to identify a stable, long-term source in the new legislative session. It is Public Act 515 of 2014.
