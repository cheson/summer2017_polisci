Michigan's 40-year-old campaign finance laws have been updated to bring an unprecedented level of transparency and openness to the state's political system through bills signed into law by Gov. Rick Snyder.
The new law will, for the first time in Michigan, require important identifying information be included in political ads, robocalls and mail.
SB 661, sponsored by state Sen. Arlan Meekhof, R-West Olive, makes sure that voters have up-to-date information on who is contributing money to candidates and how candidates are spending that money. This new, unprecedented level of transparency will give Michiganders valuable information on a timely basis, helping to preserve the integrity of the state's electoral system.
"For nearly four decades, organizations could anonymously publish or broadcast ads, make countless phone calls to voters at their homes, and send piles of mail without any identifying information," Snyder said. "Voters wouldn't know which organization was behind the effort, and they certainly wouldn't be able to contact that organization. Thanks to these new reforms, that anonymity will be no more."
These reforms result in greater transparency, while preserving the Freedoms of Speech and Association, enshrined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In the political system, Americans exercise those rights my making contributions to candidates whom they strongly believe in and by speaking out on issues of public importance.
The reforms update limits on how much an individual can contribute to a candidate, though the figure is still less than the rate of inflation from the prior law. That strikes a balance between a voter's right to contribute to the political process while preserving necessary limits to ensure the integrity of the electoral system.
