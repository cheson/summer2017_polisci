Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to ensure better safety standards for Michigan food.
House Bill 5130, sponsored by state Rep. Cindy Denby, updates the Michigan Food Law to adopt the latest federal food safety standards. To ensure access to fresh foods in urban areas, the legislation gives the state better tools to enforce the longstanding requirement that food establishments accepting Bridge Cards offer wholesome foods from multiple food groups. Other diverse changes include adopting federal standards for egg safety, ensuring shellfish producers' certification meets federal guidelines and preventing children from ordering undercooked hamburgers from a children's menu.

"Ensuring the safety and quality of Michiganders' food is a key government role," Snyder said. "I appreciate the Legislature's commitment to encompassing federal guidelines and the most up-to-date food safety standards."

The bill now is Public Act 178 of 2012.

The governor also signed Senate Bill 723, sponsored by state Sen. Jim Marleau. The legislation creates a Peace of Mind registry, a voluntary online registry for citizens' advance health care directives. It will be created and maintained by the Department of Community Health. The bill now is P.A. 179.
