Governor Snyder Signs Order Updating Commission on Community Action and Economic Opportunity
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 11, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed Executive Order 2014-9 simplifying the appointment process for the Commission on Community Action and Economic Opportunity.
"The commission plays an important role in enhancing the quality of life for Michigan's low-income families," Snyder said. "This reorganization will enable members to work more smoothly."
The commission is housed in the Department of Human Services and works with community action organizations to lessen the causes, conditions and effects of poverty. The commission also promotes social and economic opportunity, encouraging self-sufficiency for low-income people.
"This action will allow the commission to do a better job of helping Michigan's needy families and individuals without making it necessary for all new members to get up to speed every third year," said Michigan Department of Human Services Director Maura Corrigan.
Currently the commission is composed of six to 15 members who serve concurrent three-year terms. Under Executive Order 2014-9, the commission will have 12 members who will serve staggering terms, supporting efficiency of resources by reducing the need for a full orientation process every third year.
The new board will be composed of 25 percent public officials, 25 percent private sector representatives, 25 percent low-income residents and 25 percent community action agency staff or board members.
