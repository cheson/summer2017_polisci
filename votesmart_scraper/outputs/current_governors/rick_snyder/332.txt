Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Sept. 16, 2015
Location: Frankfurt, Germany

Daimler North America Corporation, the holding company for all of the company's business units in the United States, will move its headquarters to Michigan from New Jersey, Gov. Rick Snyder announced as he completed an investment mission trip to Japan and Germany.
"Michigan is the world's automotive leader, and Daimler's decision to increase its presence in state is another indication that we intend to hold that position for generations to come," Snyder said. "This company has long been a valued member of our business community. Michigan is leading the United States in creating new auto jobs and our leadership extends across all parts of the industry -- manufacturing, R&D, engineering and technology development."
After meeting with Daimler executives at the 66th Frankfurt Auto Show, Snyder said the headquarters relocation will bring 30 jobs to Michigan in central office functions including treasury, legal, accounting and executive staff.
Snyder also announced Michigan is expanding its international presence with the opening of a Michigan Europe Center to promote trade and export development between the state and European markets.
"Having a European center will help Michigan businesses by expanding and strengthening partnerships and business opportunities between our state and European nations," Snyder said. "This new venture will help promote Michigan made-products while spurring investment to enhance our engagement in the $17.6 trillion European market, creating more and better jobs here at home."
