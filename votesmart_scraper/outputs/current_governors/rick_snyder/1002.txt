Parole Notification Bill Signed Into Law
Press Release

Prosecutors will receive written notice when a prisoner is paroled under legislation signed into law by the governor on Tuesday.
House Bill 4703, sponsored by state Rep. Paul Scott, R-Grand Blanc, will help protect communities by ensuring parole boards send notice to prosecutors when a prisoner is set to be released. Notice must be sent to prosecutors both in the area where a prisoner committed a crime as well as the area where the prisoner will be released.
Although this information is already shared with local sheriffs, under current law prosecutors cannot easily get access to information about upcoming parole hearings or prisoner release dates, a problem that has prompted some prosecutors to sue the state. With this change, written notice must be provided to prosecutors within 10 days of the parole board's decision.
"This is an important change that will better protect our communities and give crime victims peace of mind," Gov. Rick Snyder said. "I want to thank Representative Scott for working with both Republicans and Democrats to get this done."
Scott worked with Genesee County Prosecuting Attorney David Leyton to help win approval of the legislation, which was approved by lawmakers with strong bipartisan support. Scott's bill is now Public Act 165.
