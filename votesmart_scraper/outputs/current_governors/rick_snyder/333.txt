Gov. Rick Snyder released the following statement after U.S. Rep. Dan Benishek announced he will not seek another term.
"Congressman Dan Benishek has dedicated his life to helping the people of Northern Michigan. He has been a doctor in Iron Mountain for nearly 30 years, much of that time spent treating veterans. That passion for helping the men and women of our armed forces was a key factor in his decision to run for the U.S. House of Representatives, and he's doing an outstanding job working for them -- and for all of our state.
"On behalf of all Michiganders, I thank the congressman for his lifetime of service and dedication to our state. Knowing how hard Dan works, I'm sure he'll continue to be active helping people in his beloved Upper Peninsula."
