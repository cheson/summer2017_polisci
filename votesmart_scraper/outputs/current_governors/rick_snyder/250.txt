Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder is seeking to expand Medicaid for those up to age 21 and pregnant women who have been served by the city of Flint's water system, and today submitted a request to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
"Children, teens and young adults exposed to lead need more coverage to get testing and the treatment they need," Gov. Rick Snyder said. "Expanding these services and lead abatement efforts will mitigate the risks of lead exposure and result in better identifying any long-term health challenges, including behavioral issues."
Approval of the waiver request would mean an expansion of Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program services to about 15,000 more Flint residents.
In his letter, Gov. Snyder said the state of Michigan would dedicate case managers to help individuals with:
* Coordinating primary care physicians and behavioral health providers, Medicaid health plans and others to ensure access to all necessary health services;
* Providing nutrition support;
* Improving access to educational and social supports and services that may be available in the community to assist them with their individual needs.
