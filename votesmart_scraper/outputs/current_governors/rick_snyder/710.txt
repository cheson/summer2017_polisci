Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation allowing cities to classify a fire arson investigator as a police officer.
Currently, only cities with a population of 750,000 can do so. In addition, the new law extends state police officer certification to a person employed as a police officer in another state within the past year of the state has substantially similar certification standards to Michigan.
"This allows cities to continuing making the most efficient and effective use of their law enforcement resources," Snyder said.
House Bill 4344, sponsored by state Rep. Thomas Stallworth, now is Public Act 170.
Snyder also signed two other bills.
HB 4156, sponsored by state Rep. Phil Potvin, establishes a special volunteer license for retired health care professionals who volunteer at health clinics that provide free or low-cost medical services for indigent or uninsured individuals and families. The retired health professional must have practiced a profession that is licensed, registered, or otherwise authorized and would be included in a limited liability exemption. It is now PA 171.
HB 4704, sponsored by state Rep. Pete Pettalia, restricts legal challenges to a county's annual budget so only an elected official heading a branch of county government or the chief judge of a court funded by a county could bring the challenge to court. The measure establishes the state Court of Appeals as the only venue for such suits, and a legal presumption that the amount appropriated is sufficient. It is now PA 172.
