Gov. Rick Snyder Confirms Financial Emergency in Wayne County
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: July 30, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today confirmed his earlier determination that a financial emergency currently exists in Wayne County.
"I remain in agreement with the conclusion of the independent financial review team's report," Snyder said. "As I noted previously, ofÂ­ficials have taken steps to begin addressing the county's crisis, but there can be no disputing that a financial emergency currently exists and must be addressed swiftly and surely to ensure residents continue to receive the services they need and deserve and the county can continue its economic recovery."
Snyder initially determined that a financial emergency existed on July 22, following a review of the county's finances, originally requested by Wayne County Executive Warren Evans. The preliminary review and review team report can be viewed here.
Under Public Act 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, the county commission now has seven days (until 5 p.m. on Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015) to pass a resolution selecting one of the four statutory options to address the emergency; a consent agreement, an emergency manager, neutral evaluation, or Chapter 9 bankruptcy.
