Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for August fell to 7.4 percent.
"Michigan continues to make solid progress and I'm encouraged to see the gains we have consistently made over time. August's unemployment rate declined to 7.4 percent, matching the April rate -- which was our state's lowest since 2008. The changes we have made are working and are moving forward.
"But we have more to do because we are focused on long-term success. We must continue setting the environment for businesses to grow and thrive, creating more and better jobs. We must continue strengthening our schools and universities to make sure students are learning in-demand skills that will prepare them for careers of today and long into Michigan's bright future."
