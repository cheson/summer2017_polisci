Location: Lansing, MI

"Today we recognize the countless contributions from Michigan's talented, hard-working men and women. They have helped reinvent this state, and we will keep working together to continue our remarkable comeback.
"While we should be proud of how far we've come, we must strive for more. We need to continue to create more and better jobs. We need to encourage more entrepreneurship. We need to close the skilled trades gap. And we need to do our best to retain young talent.
"Our state is responsible for several significant accomplishments that transformed the world, but I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. On Labor Day, we appreciate the strong work ethic of Michigan's hardest workers and look ahead as we prepare Michigan's workforce for the jobs of the future.
"My family and I wish all Michiganders a safe and enjoyable holiday weekend."
