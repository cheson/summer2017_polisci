Gov. Rick Snyder today signed four bills sponsored by state Rep. Kenneth Kurtz that help funeral directors and families by allowing funeral directors from neighboring states to practice in Michigan.

This so-called courtesy card legislation also affords Michigan funeral directors the same rights in other states that have enacted similar laws. To date, that includes Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin. Funeral directors will be able to participate in document signing as well as the process for removing and transporting the deceased.

"These are important measures that make sure Michigan families and those in surrounding states that have courtesy card laws can continue to employ the services of their chosen funeral director when dealing with the death of a loved one," Snyder said.

House Bill 4303 allows the state Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs to issue a courtesy license to engage in the practice of mortuary science. It is now Public Act 77 of 2013.

HB 4329 amends the State License Fee Act to allow for the creation of a courtesy mortuary science license fee. It is PA 78.

HB 4330 amends the Public Health Code to allow a courtesy mortuary science licensee to certify a deUnknownath record. It is PA 79.

HB 4574 requires all funeral homes to register under the Pre-paid Funeral and Cemetery Act when applying for or renewing a license. It is PA 80.
