Date: March 26, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement today, after it was announced Michigan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped to 7.7 percent in February, the lowest the rate has been since May 2008. The state's labor force grew by 21,000 during the month as well.
"Michigan is the comeback state, and the trend of reduced unemployment and more and better jobs continues, with six consecutive months of job growth. More than a quarter million people are working today than were just three years ago in our state. While this is good news and a positive trend, our work is not done. We are going to keep our foot on the gas as we work to reinvent Michigan."
