Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement on Equal Pay Day:
"I have always strongly supported equal pay for equal work. Equal Pay Day brings awareness that pay equity between men and women results in true equality. Nearly half of all new businesses are started by women, demonstrating the fact that women are crucial partners in our efforts to reinvent Michigan's economy. I look forward to the day when Equal Pay Day is no longer needed because pay inequity has been successfully addressed."
