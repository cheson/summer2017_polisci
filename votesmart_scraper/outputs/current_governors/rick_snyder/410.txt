The financial emergency in the city of Flint has been resolved and a Receivership Transition Advisory Board has been appointed to ensure a smooth transition to local control and continued financial stability for the city, Gov. Rick Snyder said.
"I was pleased to receive and accept Jerry Ambrose's recommendation that the financial emergency in Flint has been sufficiently addressed," Snyder said. "This is a new day for Flint and the city is ready to move toward a brighter future. These are important steps as we work together to transition back to local control in the city."
Snyder said Ambrose, and those who preceded him, worked diligently to finalize several critical reforms in the city, so it can return to local control. The Receivership Transition Advisory Board appointed today will work closely with local leaders to ensure Flint continues on a path toward long-term financial stability.
