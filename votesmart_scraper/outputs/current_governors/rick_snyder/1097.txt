Michigan needs to be reinvented, and business growth and tax reform are the keys.
Republican gubernatorial nominee Rick Snyder delivered that message to 125 people who crowded into the historic Chelsea Depot for an hour-long town hall meeting on Tuesday evening. A campaign staffer said about 70 people had received personal invitations, although the event was open to the public.
In Snyder's first campaign appearance since winning the Aug. 3 primary, the Ann Arbor businessman reemphasized his 10-point formula for revitalizing Michigan and called for fire and passion from his supporters.
He said his corporate management experience would tame the state bureaucracy and create public-private partnerships to fill in when state funding fell short.
"One of the things I'm proud of is, I think I'm the first real manager running for office in a long time," he said.
In addition to his private business background, Snyder referred to his experience as the first chairman of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation "under Governor (John) Engler, when it worked well--it was actually one of the leaders in the country." He also mentioned his role in the creation of Ann Arbor SPARK.
