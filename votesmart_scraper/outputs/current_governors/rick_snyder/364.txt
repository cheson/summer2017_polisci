Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Bill to Extend Job Training Programs
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: July 22, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to extend a program that allows community colleges to partner with employers to establish and fund jobs training programs. The Michigan New Jobs Training Program began in 2010, and has since been utilized by dozens of community colleges statewide.
"Employers grow and come to Michigan because of our skilled workforce," Snyder said. "Programs that help workers develop the skills they need will continue to make our workforce the best in the nation and accelerate economic growth."
Senate Bill 69, sponsored by state Sen. Darwin Booher, postpones the sunset on the law, currently Dec. 31, 2018, to Dec. 31, 2023. It also clarifies the definition of the state minimum wage under the program in light of recent minimum wage increases.
The new law takes immediate effect, and is now Public Act 130 of 2015.
