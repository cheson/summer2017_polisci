After attending the Republican Unity luncheon in Lansing today, Rick Snyder released the following statement regarding his receiving the support of his opponents from the primary election:
"I want to thank my fellow Republicans for showing unity today and for their commitment to helping us transform our state into a leader in innovation, job growth and government efficiency. Our message of reinvention for Michigan requires Michiganders of all political affiliations to commit to turning our state around. The mission is bigger than the ambitions of a single individual or organization, and it is vital for our long-term prosperity. Having my four primary opponents' support is a great first step towards uniting the entire state behind our first goal - a new Michigan with more and better jobs and a flourishing economy."
