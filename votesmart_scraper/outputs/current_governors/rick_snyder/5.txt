Those who serve jury duty will receive increased compensation and reimbursement for expenses incurred under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Michiganders who serve as jurors play an important role in ensuring fairness in our state's judicial system, and these bills help make sure they are reasonably compensated for their service," Snyder said.
House Bill 4209 and 4210, sponsored by state Rep. Peter Lucido, requires that after April 1, 2018, the current reimbursement rate for jury duty increases to $15.00 for half a day and $30.00 for a full day. Second and subsequent days will increase to a minimum of $22.50 and $45.00, respectively. HB 4210 authorizes the State Court Administrator to allocate money from the Juror Compensation Reimbursement Fund for jury management software designed to ease the process and time commitment of jury service. The measures are now Public Acts 51-52 of 2017.
Snyder also signed six additional bills:
House Bill 4211, sponsored by state Rep. Peter Lucido, amends the Michigan Penal Code to allow expert testimony as to the behavioral patterns of human trafficking victims to be admissible in court in a prosecution. It is now Public Act 53 of 2017.
HB 4532, sponsored by state Rep. Mary Whiteford, eliminates the requirement of listing a male grantor's marital status to instruments recorded before April 6, 2017, when the common law right of dower in Michigan was abolished, removing the male grantor's marital status requirement. It is now Public Act 54 of 2017.
