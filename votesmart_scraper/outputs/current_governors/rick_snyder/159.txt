Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 20, 2016
Location: Flint, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed Executive Order 2016-9 creating the Child Lead Poisoning Elimination Board to develop a long-term, statewide strategy to help prevent some of Michigan's most vulnerable residents from being exposed to lead from all sources.
Snyder signed the order in Flint during a meeting of the Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee.
"Childhood lead exposure is a problem across our state and people are rightly concerned about potential sources," Snyder said. "Protecting Michigan's children from lead exposure is a vital component for ensuring a healthier, brighter future for young Michiganders."
The 12-member board will include experts in the prevention and mitigation of child lead poisoning, and may include representatives from pediatric hospitals, local government, education, nonprofit and health agencies.
The new board will replace the Michigan Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention and Control Commission, which the independent Flint Water Advisory Task Force appointed by Gov. Snyder recommended re-establishing. That Commission ceased to exist in 2010 per the legislative sunset put in place when it was created in 2004.
Lt. Gov. Brian Calley will chair the new board that will be composed of seven gubernatorial appointees and the directors of four state departments or their designees.
"By looking at lead exposure through a statewide lens, we hope to identify and reduce the hazards and impact to protect all children," Calley said.
