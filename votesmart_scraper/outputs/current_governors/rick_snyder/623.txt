Snyder Signs Bill Improving Care for Mobile Dentistry Patients
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 10, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder recently signed legislation supporting patient protection and higher care standards for patients of mobile dental facilities.
"Good dental health contributes to good overall health. Children and seniors are among our most vulnerable residents and they are also the most common customers of mobile dental facilities," Snyder said. "Raising the quality of care delivered by these facilities will help ensure all Michiganders receive the services needed to live healthy lives."
Mobile dental facilities travel to schools, head-start centers and nursing homes on a regular basis delivering diagnostic and preventative services to patients. However, they often do not return to the same locations and local dentists have experienced difficulty contacting them to retrieve X-rays, patient information and payment records.
House Bill 4865, sponsored by state Rep. Peter MacGregor, requires mobile dental facilities to establish relationships with local area dentists to ensure patients are referred for proper follow-up dental procedures and improved treatment. Owners of these facilities must apply for a permit through the Department of Community Health. The bill also defines appropriate equipment and supplies for a mobile dental facility.
The bill is now Public Act 100 of 2014.
