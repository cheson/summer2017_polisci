Gov. Rick Snyder: State Will Not Appeal Court Decision On 300 Same-Sex Couples Married in March
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Feb. 4, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder said today he will not appeal U.S. District Court Judge Mark Goldsmith's ruling recognizing the validity of the approximately 300 same-sex couples married in four counties of Michigan on March 22, 2014 and issued the following statement:
"The judge has determined that same-sex couples were legally married on that day, and we will follow the law and extend state marriage benefits to those couples.
"I appreciate that the larger question will be addressed by the U.S. Supreme Court this year. This is an issue that has been divisive across our country. Our nation's highest court will decide this issue. I know there are strong feelings on both sides of this issue, and it's vitally important for an expedient resolution that will allow people in Michigan, as well as other states, to move forward together on the other challenges we face."
