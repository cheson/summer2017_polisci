Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Sept. 3, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued an executive order creating the Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board and announced an agreement with Enbridge Energy Co. to further preserve and protect Michigan's environment including our lakes, rivers and other world-class resources.
Executive Order 2015-11 establishes the 15-member board to ensure safety, upkeep and transparency of issues related to the state's network of pipelines. It will also be charged with advising state agencies on matters related to pipeline routing, construction, operation, and maintenance.
The board, consisting of industry, environmental and conservation representatives, cabinet members and members of the public was one of 13 recommendations included in the Michigan Petroleum Pipeline Task Force's July report and will be housed in the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.
"While pipelines are an efficient way to deliver necessary energy to power our homes, our communities and our economy, pipeline spills also have negatively impacted our natural resources in the past," Snyder said. "We remain fully committed to protecting our Great Lakes and natural resources, and this board will be charged with continuing the important work of safeguarding our environment while ensuring safe, affordable and reliable energy."
In addition, the state and Enbridge Energy Co. today signed an agreement preventing the future passage of heavy crude oil through Enbridge's Line 5 pipelines running under the Straits of Mackinac. The agreement was signed by MDEQ Director Dan Wyant, Michigan Department of Natural Resources Director Keith Creagh and Attorney General Bill Schuette.
