Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement saluting Michigan State Troopers James Leonard and Rick Carlson, along with Ostego County Sheriff's Deputy Justin Holzschu, for their Thursday rescue of a 2-year-old child from a burning house in Bagley Township near Gaylord:
"It's tragic for a family to lose its home and belongings in a fire. But it is truly inspiring to hear of the life-saving acts by our state's public safety officers.
"First to arrive on the scene, these men fearlessly charged into the burning home to rescue a toddler without hesitation and without a moment to spare as the child was not breathing and had no pulse. The troopers then performed CPR to revive the boy outside the home, saving his life.
"These men are heroes. I applaud their bravery. And this is yet another example of the courageous work performed every day by the Michigan State Police and local law enforcement officers throughout our state. They put their lives on the line every day, protecting and serving Michiganders."
