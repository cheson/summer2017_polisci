Snyder Signs Bully Bill
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Dec. 6, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Michigan will become the 48th state to require schools to develop and enforce policies to protect students from harassment, intimidation and physical violence under anti-bullying legislation signed by Gov. Rick Snyder today.
The governor called on lawmakers to pass the legislation as part of the education reform plan he proposed in April, saying students need to feel safe in the classroom so they can focus on learning.
"This legislation sends a clear message that bullying is wrong in all its forms and will not be tolerated," Snyder said. "No child should feel intimidated or afraid to come to school."
The governor said having a clear policy in place will give teachers and administrators the tools they need to deal with bullies, but he added that parents can help by ensuring their own children do not engage in or encourage others to bully.
House Bill 4163, sponsored by state Rep. Phil Potvin, is known as "Matt's Safe School Law" in honor of Matt Epling, a Michigan teen who ended his life in 2002 after enduring severe bullying. The legislation gives schools six months to develop clear anti-bullying policies so they will be in place by the start of the 2012-2013 school year. The bill is now Public Act 241 of 2011.
