More people will have access to boating sites on state owned land during free fishing weekends, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
House Bill 4983, sponsored by state Rep. Bruce Rendon, allows vehicles without a recreation passport to enter state parks and use boating sites in areas where there is an opportunity to fish on free fishing weekends.
"Michigan has unparalleled fishing opportunities," Snyder said. "This bill will give visitors and residents the opportunity to enjoy one of Michigan's favorite pastimes at no added cost."
Recreation passports are generally required for access to state parks, forest campgrounds, forest trails, and scenic and boating access sites. The bill is now Public Act 1 of 2016.
Snyder also signed HB 4604, sponsored by state Rep. Brett Roberts, bringing the state's soil and sedimentation permit requirements for farming activities in line with federal policy. Under the legislation, farmers can construct and remove fences, remove trees and shrubs, install drainage or electrical lines and build ponds under five acres in size without first obtaining a Part 91 permit from local units of governments. The permitting requirements under other state laws still remain in place. The bill is now PA 2 of 2016.
