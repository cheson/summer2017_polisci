Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Sept. 22, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder is part of a bipartisan delegation of U.S. governors that met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and six Chinese governors in Seattle to discuss economic development opportunities that can help both nations.
The event comes a month after Snyder visited China for an investment mission, meeting with government and business leaders to discuss opportunities to sell more Michigan-made goods overseas, spark Chinese investment in the state and promote Michigan as a tourism destination.
"We can take pride in Michigan's efforts to build strong relationships with China," Snyder said. "There are many ways we can work together. We certainly have much to offer in terms of quality products that are grown, built or designed here. And we have a workforce known for its talents and innovation -- qualities companies consider when they look for places to grow and invest."
