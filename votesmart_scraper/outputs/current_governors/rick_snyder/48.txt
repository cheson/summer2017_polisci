Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Jan. 18, 2017
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's workforce growth rate is at its strongest point since 1999.
"Last night in the State of the State address, I talked about how we now have a clear path toward our future - a future that includes more good-paying jobs and outstanding career opportunities for all Michiganders. Our expanding labor force demonstrates that Michigan's residents are more confident in the state's growing economy.
"The last jobs report of 2016 showed that our workforce is now growing at its fastest rate in 17 years. We will celebrate that, especially as we work to grow our population to more than 10 million people by the end of 2020. We can achieve that goal because people from all over the world recognize that Michigan is the place to be. More people are seeing new opportunities in Michigan. This includes residents who are finding great ways to advance their careers and former residents who can come home to be with their families because of jobs being created. Working together, we will continue our efforts to make this state an even better place to live, work, and play for everyone."
