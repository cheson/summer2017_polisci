Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding the recent deaths of three law-enforcement personnel in Michigan:
"The past few days have been especially tough for our law enforcement community and I send my condolences on behalf of all Michiganders whom they have sworn to serve and protect. Whether they are patrolling a beat, maintaining order in a correctional facility, or helping returning citizens stay on the right path for a better future -- we appreciate the work they do every day. My thoughts and prayers are with the families, friends and colleagues of Kent County Corrections Officer Russell Stonehouse, Norton Shores Police Officer Jonathan Ginka, and Michigan Department of Corrections Probation Agent Candice Dunn. The outpouring of support and fond memories from people who knew and worked with these professionals shows how much each of them will be missed in their communities."
