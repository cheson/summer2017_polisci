Gov. Rick Snyder: Michigan's Falling Unemployment Rate is Something to Be Proud of
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: March 9, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for January fell to 4.9 percent.
"Our falling unemployment rate shows that when Michiganders work together to solve difficult challenges, we can have outstanding results. In December 2010, Michigan's unemployment was one of the worst in the nation, but today, it's at its lowest point in 15 years. That's something we should be proud of," Snyder said.
Nearly 440,000 private sector payroll jobs have been created since Snyder took office.
"Now we need to look to the future and focus on solving the problems still facing Michigan. We need to work together in order to help Flint move forward, improve education for students in Detroit, and create more high-skilled talent for in-demand jobs. We have come a long way, but we cannot be satisfied. We will continue to work to find long-term solutions to improve our state for everyone who has chosen to make Michigan their home."
