Gov. Rick Snyder has signed bipartisan legislation that will direct funding to the City of Flint's emergency water services to reconnect the city's water supply to the Great Lakes Water Authority until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is completed.
"This funding is a coordinated response to a serious problem and I'm pleased so many parties came together to help deliver safe drinking water to the city of Flint," Snyder said. "Reconnecting to the Great Lakes Water Authority is only the first step, as the state will continue testing and inspections to ensure Flint families and children have clean water in their homes and schools."
