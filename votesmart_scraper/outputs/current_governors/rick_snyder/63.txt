To build a stronger Michigan, we must build a healthier Michigan
My vision is for Michiganders to be healthy, productive individuals, living in communities that support health and wellness, with ready access to affordable, patient- centered and community-based system of care. Health and wellness are important across the continuum of life from prenatal care, to providing children and adults with opportunities for nutritious food and physical activity, to the option of home-based long-term care for seniors who need it.
