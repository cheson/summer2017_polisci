Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state has added 461,900 private-sector jobs since December 2010. The state's unemployment rate in April remained below the national average at 4.8%.
"Today marks another positive chapter for the story of Michigan's resilience. Our labor force continues to grow and more Michiganders are headed back to work. With more than 461,000 new private-sector jobs, it is clear that our efforts to reinvent Michigan have moved our state in the right direction.
"Michigan has an outstanding future, and we can make it even stronger by working together to find innovative, long-term solutions to the challenges still facing our state. This year, I have called for new 21st Century Commissions tasked with helping to strengthen our economy, improve education, and ensure our state's infrastructure is updated and efficient. All of those initiatives will help create more exciting chapters in Michigan's comeback story."
