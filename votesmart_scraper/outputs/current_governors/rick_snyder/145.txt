Gov. Rick Snyder: a Fresh Start for Education in Michigan's Comeback City
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 9, 2016
Location: Unknown

"The legislation approved tonight represents an unprecedented investment for the education of Detroit's children. The district's debt will be fully repaid and the new funding will be used to support teaching kids in their classrooms, instead of being diverted to pay off decades of legacy costs.
"This is a new Detroit Public School district. The debt will be gone. The emergency managers will no longer be needed. Local control will be restored, so that new leaders for the district can be chosen this fall by Detroit voters. The same financial review commission that works with the city will assist with making strong investments as the school board stands up the new district.
"This work represents a fresh start with more money in the classrooms for Detroit's students, career stability for Detroit's teachers, and fiscal accountability for all Michigan taxpayers. This is a new day for education in Michigan's comeback city."
