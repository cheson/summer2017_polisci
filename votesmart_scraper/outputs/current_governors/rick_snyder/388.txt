Veterans and active duty members of the military working their way to a bachelor's degree at a Michigan college or university will be eligible to receive academic credits for some of their military experience, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Bridging the gap between military service and civilian life is one way we are constantly striving to do better for our veterans and active duty members of the armed forces," Snyder said. "There are many areas in which military experience overlaps with education taught in college courses, and this new law will help ensure that credit is granted for that knowledge, allowing service members to receive their degree in a shorter period of time so they can embark on their new career."
House Bill 4060, sponsored by state Rep. Holly Hughes, requires collaboration between the American Council on Education Registry of Credit Recommendations and the Department of Defense, identifying where military experience coincides with certain courses so that veterans can receive credit for those courses. The governor last year signed legislation applying these requirements to community colleges.
The bill also requires the schools to inform active duty or veteran applicants of their eligibility to receive the academic credits. It is now Public Act 44 of 2015.
