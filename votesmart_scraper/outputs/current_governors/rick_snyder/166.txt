Press Release

Location: Detroit, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder Tuesday welcomed a delegation of senior Chinese government officials from Guangdong Province and its City of Shenzhen, as both sides signed six memorandums of understanding designed to boost two-way direct investment, and established the Michigan-Shenzhen Trade, Investment and Innovation Cooperation Center.
Among the memorandums signed during the visit was a sister state agreement with the Guangdong Province, the first agreement of its kind to be signed between the state of Michigan and a province of China since 1982.
The delegation included Politburo Member and CPC Secretary of Guangdong province Hu Chunhua, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai, and Shenzhen Mayor Xu Qin. Joining Snyder were Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, U.S. Consul General to Guangzhou Charles Bennett, and members of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.
During the signing ceremony, Snyder spoke of how the agreements, the new trade, investment and cooperation center, and the recently established Michigan-China Innovation Center all serve to further enhance the goal of increasing foreign direct investment from Chinese businesses and investors. In addition, the partnerships help create new opportunities for exchanges around innovation and product development between Michigan and China.
"Michigan was one of the first states to begin a formal relationship with China, and we are committed to a partnership that allows that to thrive," Snyder said. "The unique vision that these agreements and innovation centers serve will add to Michigan's already unprecedented commitment to helping businesses and people in both of our countries."
