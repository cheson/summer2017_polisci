Six bills signed by Gov. Rick Snyder today will modernize the Michigan court filing system by taking it online, and provide efficiency and cost benefits to local municipalities.
"Modernizing state government is a major priority, and as inefficiencies are identified, they are being addressed," Snyder said. "Enacting an e-filing system statewide for local courts is a common sense change that saves residents a trip to the courthouse when they need to file a document and eases the burden on employees."
