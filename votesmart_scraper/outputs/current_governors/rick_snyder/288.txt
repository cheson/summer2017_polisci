Legislation signed by Gov. Rick Snyder today will modernize the structure of Michigan's tax code to ensure treatment of data center inputs more closely aligns with treatment of manufacturing inputs and tax laws in other states.
"Michigan has a long tradition of innovation and talent, and is quickly becoming known as an ideal place for high tech jobs and growth of the emerging technology industry," Snyder said. "It's imperative that our tax policies continually develop and evolve to meet the needs of the jobs of tomorrow. The world constantly changes in how we make things, and we need to adapt and ensure we remain a state that continually draws on innovative commerce and new opportunities for Michiganders."
