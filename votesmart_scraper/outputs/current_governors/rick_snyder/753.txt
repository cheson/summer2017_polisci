Snyder: Wayne County Jail Relocation Offers Significant Economic Benefits and Should Move Forward Quickly
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Aug. 14, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement today in support of a proposal to relocate the Wayne County Jail complex:
"This proposal recognizes the resurgence of downtown Detroit and the significant economic benefits that would come from having the jail's prime downtown location available for private sector development. Freeing up that location for private development, such as offices, hotels, and restaurants, would expand the ongoing revitalization of downtown Detroit.
"Development along those lines would create construction jobs, then long-term jobs, and expand the city's tax base for years to come. This downtown location should be recognized as an area of potential economic development because of the significant benefits that it could bring to the city, county, and state.
"My team and I are ready to work with Wayne County officials and put this proposal to relocate the criminal justice facilities to Mound Road on a fast track. We can work cooperatively to develop an integrated criminal justice center that would reduce the county's future operating costs. There's a growing recognition of the operational and cost benefits of creating such a criminal justice center that would include the jail and the present intake system plus criminal courts and the appropriate operations of the county sheriff and the county prosecutor.
"The sooner we start that process, the better. I'm confident that by working together we can find a way to make this proposal a reality."
