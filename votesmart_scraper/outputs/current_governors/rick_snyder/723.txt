Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement today after the state Senate approved a resolution supporting the Common Core Standards.
"Michigan students will be better prepared to compete for jobs in our state and beyond as our partners in the Legislature took another key step to support the Common Core Standards.
"There is strong, bipartisan backing for the Common Core, an effort developed by states, for states, to set clear expectations about what students need to learn in math and English language arts to be college and career ready.
"Michigan is among 45 states, four territories and the District of Columbia in adopting the standards, which still rely on our local school districts and teachers to determine how the subjects will be taught.
"The standards are supported by educators and the business community alike, recognizing that Michigan's students need to be prepared to meet the new and challenging jobs emerging here in Michigan and in the global economy.
"I'm grateful to the leadership of Majority Leader Randy Richardville, Sen. Howard Walker, Speaker Jase Bolger, and Reps. Tim Kelly, Bill Rogers, and Lisa Posthumus Lyons for leading the thoughtful debate on this topic."
