Michigan's older adult population is growing rapidly. By 2030 nearly one in four Michigan residents will be age 60 and older. Residents are also living longer. The fastest growing segment of Michigan's population is age 85 and older.
"We want Michigan to be a state where we live well and age well," Governor Snyder said. "Ensuring that more older adults have the opportunity to be healthy, independent and productive individuals in "age-friendly' communities that support their needs will be critical as the state plans for the future. The simple truth is Michigan has more work to do to prepare for its aging population. It's time to reinvent the way we think about aging in a positive way."
In his Special Message on Aging, the governor focused on four critically important areas that will improve the quality of life for Michigan's older adults: Living a healthy lifestyle, remaining active and engaged, ensuring financial security during retirement, and retaining independence and choice.
