Improving Michigan's education system to better prepare students for a global economy is the main focus of the 21st Century Education Commission formed today under an executive order by Gov. Rick Snyder.
Executive Order 2016-6, creates the commission which was announced in Snyder's State of the State address in January. The commission will be responsible for analyzing top performing education systems in the nation, identifying issues impacting Michigan's academic success, and recommending changes to restructure Michigan's education system.
"All students deserve a 21st Century education to prepare them for success in today's economy," Snyder said. "This commission will focus on long-term improvements that can enhance student achievement and prepare our students for in-demand careers in our state and around the world."
Serving as an advisory body within the Executive Office, the commission must complete its work and issue a final report no later than Nov. 30, 2016.
The 25-member commission will include individuals representing the education, business, government, and nonprofit communities who have a particular interest or expertise in education. Members will need to possess expertise in education system design at the state, regional, and local levels. The group will focus on how Michigan's system of public education is organized, governed, funded, and held accountable for successful education outcomes.
Membership will consist of 16 gubernatorial appointees, four legislative appointees, the State Board of Education president or his designee, and four state department directors or their representatives.
