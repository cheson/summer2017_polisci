Location: Lansing, MI

Lt. Gov. Brian Calley is expanding his Special Education Listening Tour, seeking additional input from parents and teachers statewide on their experiences in Michigan's special education programs.
Since April, Calley has listened to concerns at forums in Traverse City, Dexter, Indian River, Grand Rapids, Benton Harbor, Center Line, Lansing, and Troy. Calley will finish the tour this summer before compiling and sharing results with state officials working on reforms.
To ensure everyone has the opportunity to share their thoughts, Calley is also asking families to take an eight-question online survey related to their experiences.
"We need to hear about what works and what can be improved. Every family has different views and experiences with our special education programs, so it is important to visit as many areas of the state as possible to make sure everyone's voices are heard," Calley said. "The online survey hopefully provides another and convenient way for even more Michiganders to participate and offer their feedback and insight."
The tour and survey will be completed in September and results will be shared with school districts and the Michigan Department of Education and will be used to develop proposals to improve outcomes for some of Michigan's most vulnerable residents.
