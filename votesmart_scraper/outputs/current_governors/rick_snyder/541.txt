Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation allowing Michigan residents to pay for some Driver Responsibility Fees by doing community service.
"While we are ultimately phasing out Driver Responsibility Fees, this program gives Michiganders the opportunity to give back by volunteering as an alternative way to pay their fines," Snyder said.
Senate Bill 633, sponsored by state Sen. Bruce Caswell, gives residents with certain unpaid Driver Responsibility Fees an alternative method to settle the debt. Under the legislation, drivers can complete 10 hours of community service as payment for each violation including operating a vehicle with an expired or invalid license and operating without insurance or proof of insurance. The bill is now Public Act 283 of 2014. The Department of Treasury, which administers the program, will begin accepting applications for community service in January 2015.
Snyder previously signed legislation in June 2014 to lessen and ultimately phase out Driver Responsibility Fees by October 2019.
The governor also signed four other bills:
SB 758, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Hildenbrand, allows county treasurers to collect delinquent hotel taxes in the same manner unpaid special assessments are collected. Currently county treasurers can only use impractical criminal sanctions to attempt to collect overdue hotel taxes. These provisions allow the treasurer to foreclosure on the property if delinquent payments are not made. It is now PA 284.
SB 92, sponsored by state Sen. Mike Green, protects the health of Michigan citizens by ensuring that all pharmacy technicians are property certified. The bill creates standardized licensing requirements for pharmacy technicians in Michigan. It is now PA 285.
SBs 959 and 960, sponsored by state Sen. Roger Kahn, extend the sunset on six fees that pay for Michigan's Hazardous Waste Management Program required by the federal government. The program is responsible for regulating the transfer, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste in Michigan. The bills allow for the continuation of collection of $1.1 million in user charges from Michigan's 6,500 hazardous waste generators to support the program. They are now PAs 286 and 287.
