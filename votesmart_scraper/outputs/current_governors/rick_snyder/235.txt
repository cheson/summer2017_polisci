Location: Lansing, MI

Flint residents will be hired to assist with water distribution at clean water resource sites across the city through a partnership between the state and GST Michigan Works!, Gov. Rick Snyder announced today.
The partnership initially creates 81 temporary, full-time, paid positions available for qualified Flint residents. Once hired, participants will fill leadership and general team member roles.
"Flint families deserve quick and easy access to bottled water, filters and testing kits until the water is determined safe to drink," Snyder said. "Members of the Flint community continue to support each other and there is no better group to assist in this effort. The partnership with Michigan Works! is another step toward ensuring Flint residents benefit from relief efforts in multiple ways."
As part of a longer-term solution to the Flint water crisis, the partnership aims to provide talent-based assistance to the city and employment opportunities for local residents as part of a federal jobs training program through Michigan Works!
"Not only will people have the opportunity to help others at water distribution sites, but they will begin the process of preparing for future careers by working closely with our staff, who will help them build skills for the job market," Jody Kerbyson, CEO of GST Michigan Works! said.
Employees will be trained by members of the Michigan National Guard who currently manage resource distribution sites.
Available positions will be open to all qualified applicants. Each position will be posted separately and those with matching qualifications are encouraged to apply for each position.
