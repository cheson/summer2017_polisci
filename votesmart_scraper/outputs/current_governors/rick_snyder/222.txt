Results from round two of Sentinel Site water testing in Flint shows fewer sites are over the federal action level for lead than were found in round one, but concerns remain, Gov. Rick Snyder said today.
The state is continuing to monitor, analyze and respond to results on scientific water testing in Flint with updated data being collected regularly from approximately 600 Sentinel Sites.
Results from round two show 91.6 percent were at or below the federal action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb) and 8.4 percent were above 15 ppb. These are better results than round one, which had 90.4 percent at or below 15 ppb, and 9.6 percent above the federal action level of 15 ppb.
"The constantly updated information helps determine the quality of the water as it comes into people's homes," Snyder said. "This information also helps to get immediate attention to homes with high lead or high copper results, so we can investigate issues further and work quickly with residents to address health concerns."
Sentinel Sites are locations across the city that are continually tested to gather scientifically sound data needed to determine when the water quality will be restored for the people of Flint. The sites were established by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and endorsed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in cooperation with residents.
While the data demonstrates there are still concerns -- which are being immediately addressed by the state residential response teams -- the lower number of samples over the federal action level shows results are trending in the right direction.
