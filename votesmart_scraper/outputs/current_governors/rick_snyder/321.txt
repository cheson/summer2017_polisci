Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Oct. 14, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that Michigan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for September fell to 5.0 percent -- which is below the national average of 5.1 percent. This is the first time Michigan has been below the national average since August 2000.
"We need to stay focused on our goal, but it also is important to look back to see how far we've come. Michigan's unemployment rate was once the worst in the United States. Today we are below the national average for the first time since August 2000. This means more people in Michigan are able to use their skills and are finding fulfilling jobs to support themselves and their families, making our cities and our communities stronger in a variety of ways.
"We can be proud of what we have accomplished together. It's exciting. But more exciting is thinking about how we can keep improving. Together, we will continue working to bring opportunity to every part of our state, helping people get the education and assistance they need to reach their potential and build on the foundation we've created. The Michigan story is a great one, and our best chapters have yet to be written."
