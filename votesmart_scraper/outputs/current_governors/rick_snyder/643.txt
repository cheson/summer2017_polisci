Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement about the state House of Representatives' approval of HB 4369, which expands local involvement in the state educational reform efforts charged with turning around the state's most struggling schools.
"We know that a strong public school system is critically important for Michigan's comeback, and, unfortunately, some of our schools were failing too many students for too many years. In 2009, a statewide education reform system was created. This bill gives additional tools to more effectively face these challenges and improve the quality of learning and life for these children.
"The legislation expands opportunities for intermediate and local school districts to be involved in turnaround efforts as well as offers innovative options like the Education Achievement Authority and charter public schools.
"These changes will encourage innovation, including longer school days and calendars, to help students in struggling schools reach their full potential.
"There are no quick fixes in education. We have more work to do. Turning around schools that have let down students and their families for many years cannot be done overnight. But we must continue to work to ensure that all Michigan children have equal opportunities for a bright future."
