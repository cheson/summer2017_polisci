Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder recently signed legislation to simplify the process for low-income residents seeking a poverty tax exemption on their home.
House Bill 5178, sponsored by state Rep. Rashida Tlaib, makes it easier to apply for a poverty exemption on a principal residence, ensuring Michigan's neediest residents get the help they need. The bill allows residents to file an affidavit to claim the exemption, rather than requiring federal and state income tax returns.
"This exemption must be easily available to families needing assistance," Snyder said. "Low-income residents who are not required to file state and federal taxes should not need those documents to receive the exemption."
The bill now is Public Act 135.
The governor also signed two other bills.
Senate Bill 393, sponsored by state Sen. Rick Jones, allows cities in less populous counties to recoup costs incurred in housing convicted inmates in a county jail. Counties can bill municipalities for incarceration expenses, but certain communities - Ann Arbor, East Lansing, Flint, Lansing and Ypsilanti Township - previously were prohibited from seeking reimbursement from inmates. The legislation rectifies this unfair and difficult financial situation for these communities. The bill now is P.A. 136.
H.B. 5186, sponsored by state Rep. Kenneth Kurtz, ensures Kellogg Community College will not encounter any conflicts with current conveyance acts for its intended educational uses of land received from the Branch Intermediate School District. The bill now is P.A. 137.
