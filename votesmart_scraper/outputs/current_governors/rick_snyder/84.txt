Those who operate a motorcycle without a motorcycle endorsement on their driver's license will pay higher fines under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"This bill stiffens the penalty for operating a motorcycle without the proper endorsement, helping to ensure both motorists and motorcyclists stay safer on Michigan's roads," Snyder said.
House Bill 4651, sponsored by the late state Rep. Julie Plawecki, increases the penalty for operating a motorcycle without a motorcycle endorsement on the operator's license from $100 to $500. This is the first Public Act to bear the name of Rep. Plawecki, who passed away in June. The measure is now Public Act 318 of 2016.
Snyder also signed one additional bill:
HB 4388, sponsored by state Rep. Mike McCready, permits voters of a school district to approve a property tax for the purpose of creating a "sinking fund" for costs associated with security and technology needs. The measure is now PA 319 of 2016.
