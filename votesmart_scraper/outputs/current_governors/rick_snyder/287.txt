Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Dec. 28, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today activated the State Emergency Operations Center due to the hazardous winter storm expected to affect the entire state of Michigan from Monday, Dec. 28, through Tuesday, Dec. 29.
The National Weather Service is forecasting about a foot of heavy, wet snow for the Upper Peninsula and freezing rain with a quarter- to half-inch of ice accumulation for some areas of the Lower Peninsula. Power outages are likely to occur.
"The safety of all Michiganders is our top priority, and the heavy snowfall and freezing rain could create hazardous conditions in much of our state," Snyder said. "Residents should pay close attention to advisories and stay off the roads if at all possible. State authorities continue to closely monitor the situation and are sharing information and coordinating with communities to keep everyone as safe as possible."
