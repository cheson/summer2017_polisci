Gov. Snyder:
"Justice Young's time on the Supreme Court will long be remembered for how he brought people together to discuss how the judicial branch could better serve the people of Michigan. He helped make the court system more affordable and more accessible for all Michiganders. And he was a leader in the formation of a specialty court system that has helped address the cause of people's crimes to prevent future offenses. His steadfast leadership of the judiciary in Michigan will be missed but never forgotten and I wish him well on the next chapter in his outstanding career."
Lt. Gov. Calley:
"Justice Young has faithfully stood for the rule of law on the Michigan Supreme Court every day of his tenure. His leadership strengthened Michigan's highest court, exemplifying what it means to uphold our Constitution and achieve justice for Michiganders. Thank you, Justice Young, for making the people of Michigan proud and we wish you well in your future endeavors."
Gov. Snyder will now work to review and consider possible candidates to appoint to Justice Young's seat, with the goal of minimizing any gap that might occur should a new justice not be appointed prior to Young's retirement date of April 30.
