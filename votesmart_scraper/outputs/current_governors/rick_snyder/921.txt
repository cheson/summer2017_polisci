Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 1, 2012
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder signed legislation today to amend the procedure for the cleanup of contamination caused by leaking underground storage tanks, creating realistic standards for site cleanup, which will allow the state to remove some 4,000 backlogged sites to restore them for productive economic uses.

"By establishing reasonable, yet rigorous procedures for contaminated site cleanup, Michigan communities can more efficiently and effectively restore them for economic redevelopment," Snyder said.

The six-bill package includes:
S.B. 528, sponsored by Sen. Tom Casperson;
S.B. 529, sponsored by Sen. Darwin Booher;
S.B. 530, sponsored by Sen. Phil Pavlov;
S.B. 531, sponsored by Sen. Arlan Meekhof;
S.B. 532, sponsored by Sen. Mike Kowall, and
S.B. 533, sponsored by Sen. Mike Green.

"The new site-specific and risk-based approach will target resources to sites that are more in need of attention, ensuring that dollars spent today will save money in future cleanups," said Casperson. "This is not only good for our natural resources, but for the economy as well."

The measures are now Public Acts 108-113 of 2012.
