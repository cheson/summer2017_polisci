Gov. Rick Snyder and Michigan CIO David Behen recently were recognized as being among the Top 25 Doers, Dreamers & Drivers of 2013 by Government Technology magazine and the Center for Digital Government.

Since 2002, Government Technology has honored outstanding state and local government officials for innovation in using technology to improve services. The magazine grouped the 2013 honorees into four categories: tech experts, innovators, streamliners and collaborators. Snyder was named an innovator, while Behen was recognized as a tech expert.

"It's always exciting when Michigan's work is recognized by distinguished authorities such as Government Technology magazine and the Center for Digital Government," Snyder said. "This recognition validates Michigan's approach to enhancing customer service through innovation and technology."

The magazine recognized Snyder's record of improving customer service in government and providing budget funding for updates to critical information technology systems, as well as his experience in the private sector. Behen was praised for his implementation of these IT updates, including several multiyear initiatives focused on replacing legacy systems and enhancing automation.

"Receiving this accolade is a true honor and a testament to the great work Michigan is doing," Behen said. "Gov. Snyder and DTMB Director Nixon understand the important role that information technology plays in making government more efficient and improving services to Michiganders. It's a privilege to work with such a great team."
