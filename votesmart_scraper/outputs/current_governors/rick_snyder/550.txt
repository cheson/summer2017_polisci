Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Sept. 9, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement on the groundbreaking agreement between the city of Detroit, Oakland, Macomb and Wayne counties and the state to work toward the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority.
"Michigan's continuing comeback is driven by people working together to do what is best for residents, communities, the region, and our state. I salute Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson and Public Works Director Jim Nash, Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel, and Wayne County Executive Bob Ficano for their leadership in taking important steps toward creating a water authority that will benefit 4 million Michiganders.
"Federal Judge Sean Cox should be commended for his skillful efforts as a mediator, working with elected leaders on this plan. While this is a critical first step, there is still much work to do. We are committed to helping make that a reality.
"The extraordinary bipartisan cooperation is aimed at creating a sustainable, regional water system that also provides necessary and crucial updates to the aging infrastructure, brings relief to residents and taxpayers by capping future rate increases and creates a fund to help customers in need throughout the region.
"This move also reflects the commitment to the reinvention of our state as a whole and the recognition that our largest city and the entire Southeast Michigan region are made stronger by this collaboration."
