Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Patrick Beal is proof that Detroit's economic renewal can be measured one person, one business and one commitment at a time. Beal is the type of millennial-age entrepreneur who sees opportunity where others see blight -- literally.
Beal's Detroit Training Center, which trains and certifies workers in blight removal, is among four Detroit-based businesses that received loans totaling $231,000 as part of the Pure Michigan Micro Lending Initiative launched in November 2013 by Gov. Rick Snyder, and based on a partnership between Michigan Economic Development Corporation and Huntington Bank.
"A vibrant Detroit requires a commitment by developers of large-scale projects along with the growth of small businesses throughout the city," said Snyder. "Creating a climate and the financial means for small businesses to thrive is beginning to foster further investment and job growth in Detroit's revival. And equally important, people are taking pride in starting a business and want to be a part of the city's growing and diversifying economy."
The program lends from $5,000 to $100,000 for early-stage and established businesses with a critically reviewed plan by nonprofit micro lenders Detroit Development Fund (DDF), Detroit Micro Enterprise Fund and Michigan Women's Foundation. The collaborative provides mentorship, consulting services and much-needed capital to borrowers who might be considered a risk by conventional private-sector lenders. The New Economy Initiative provides grants to DDF.
To attract the private bank lender, MEDC guarantees to cover loan losses up to 20 percent of the total fund, or the equivalent of up to $1 million.
