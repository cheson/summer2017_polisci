Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for April fell to 7.4 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in Michigan since April 2008.
"Michigan continues to move forward. April was the eighth consecutive monthly decline in the unemployment rate. We're reinventing Michigan, and the positive changes are taking root and producing results. We're seeing more and better jobs created across the state in a variety of fields, with a quarter million new private sector jobs added since the end of 2010. In the last year, we've seen significant gains in fields including scientific and technical services, engineering services, construction and transportation. "Today's data also reveals that the labor force expanded by 11,000 people in the month, showing that more Michiganders are feeling optimistic and re-entering the work force.
"We're making solid progress, but we have more to do. Our goal is long-term success for Michigan. It's important to keep focusing on creating the environment for businesses to grow and thrive and to work with our educators at all levels to make sure students are graduating with in-demand skills to fill the jobs of today and tomorrow."
