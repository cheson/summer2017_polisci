Snyder Streamlines Parole Board
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Feb. 7, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Governor Rick Snyder today signed an executive order taking responsibility for parole decisions out of the governor's office and handing it back to the Department of Corrections. The move is aimed at streamlining government and allowing more efficient implementation of corrections policies by the department director.
"We need to let the professionals in the corrections department determine whether it's appropriate to release prisoners," Snyder said. "This change will remove an unneeded layer of bureaucracy and save taxpayers money."
Executive Order 2011-3 abolishes the Parole and Commutation Board and Executive Clemency Advisory Council, both of which were created under former Governor Jennifer Granholm, and creates a new Michigan Parole Board within the Department of Corrections. The new board will return to the 10-member structure outlined in state law as opposed to the 15-member structure of the current board. Members serving on the parole board will be appointed by the corrections department director instead of by the governor.
Executive Order 2011-3 takes effect April 15.
