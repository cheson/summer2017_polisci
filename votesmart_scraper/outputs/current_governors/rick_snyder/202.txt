Flint Water Quality Showing Improvement, More Progress Needed, Say Government and Independent Water Quality Experts
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 8, 2016
Location: Flint, MI

A recent review of test results by state, federal and independent water quality experts shows the water quality in Flint is improving. In addition, the protective coating is being restored to Flint's pipes, which is an important measure needed to provide quality water until lead pipes can be replaced.
Today data was presented to the Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee by officials from the state Department of Environmental Quality and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The conclusions presented represent a consensus reached by officials from the DEQ, EPA, and Virginia Tech University. The group met in Chicago and presented their findings to each other and to city of Flint officials at the EPA's regional headquarters. They reviewed recent data collected from Flint homes and the city's water system.
"Whenever we see a positive trend in Flint's water quality, that's good news but we still have much work to do to get people the quality of water they need and deserve," said Gov. Rick Snyder.
The experts noted that there are still random locations where high lead levels are a concern, but much of that can be attributed to the presence of small pieces of lead that have broken off from pipes and may be caught in a home's plumbing system.
