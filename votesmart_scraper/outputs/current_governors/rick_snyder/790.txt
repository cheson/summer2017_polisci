Snyder Statement on the Need for Respect, Civility in Public Discussions
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 3, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement today about the need for respect and civility in public discussions:

"The primary focus of public officials should be on serving their customers, the people of the state of Michigan, and working together to get that job done. The public benefits from a vigorous discussion of each issue as long as that discussion is conducted in a constructive, respectful manner.

"Public officials won't agree on every issue, but there should be universal agreement that everyone should be treated with respect and with civility. There have been several instances in Michigan recently where the rules of respect and civility have been ignored. The old saying applies here: We can disagree without being disagreeable.

"Personal attacks and remarks that aren't constructive or respectful of others only divert attention from the ultimate goal, which is serving the 10 million people of the state of Michigan. Michigan can show the rest of the country how to restore respect and civility to the political process. All it takes is a commitment from each and every public official in the state to be a true leader and follow the rules of respect and civility at all times.

"I'm calling on every public official in the state to say, "We can do better,' and to make a personal commitment to help establish Michigan as a national leader in restoring respect and civility to the political process."
