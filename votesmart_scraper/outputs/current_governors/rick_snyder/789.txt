Snyder Signs Bills to Better Manage Michigan Wildlife
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 8, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Legislation authorizing the state Natural Resources Commission to designate game species in Michigan was signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.

Senate Bill 288, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Casperson, gives the commission the responsibility to establish managed open season hunts for wild game and authority to regulate the taking of fish. It exempts the taking of mourning doves, pets and livestock. The Legislature maintains its ability to both add and remove species on the list.

"This action helps ensure sound scientific and biological principles guide decisions about management of game in Michigan," Snyder said. "Scientifically managed hunts are essential to successful wildlife management and bolstering abundant, healthy and thriving populations."

Additionally, the measure allows members of the military to obtain hunting and fishing licenses free of charge and eliminates a requirement that the military member be stationed outside of the state.

Snyder also signed SB 289, sponsored by Casperson, which guarantees the legal right to hunt and fish in the state.

SB 288 and SB 289 are now Public Acts 21 and 22 of 2013. Both measures are strongly supported by key wildlife conservation organizations.
