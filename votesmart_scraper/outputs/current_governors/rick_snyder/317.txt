Location: Lansing, MI

Michigan residents who use service animals will have better access to public spaces, such as restaurants, retail stores and health care facilities after Gov. Rick Snyder today signed a bill package to modernize state law and advance the use of these animals. The bills were spurred in part by recent incidents of people being turned away from businesses because they were accompanied by service animals.
"This small change in state law will have a widespread, positive impact on the lives of those assisted by service animals," Snyder said.
Gov. Snyder today also signed a bill package that seeks to address the incidence of civil asset forfeiture by creating new reporting requirements and a higher standard of evidence for seized property.
"Michigan residents deserve transparency from government, and these new reporting requirements will raise the bar so that a fair balance is struck between private property rights and law enforcement's effective ability to do their job in pursuing criminal activity," Snyder said.
