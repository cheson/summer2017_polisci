Gov. Rick Snyder has joined President Barack Obama's call for all United States flags to be lowered to half-staff within the state Capitol complex in observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 30. Snyder posted a video in remembrance of Michigan's fallen soldiers. Watch the video above.
"Memorial Day is a time to pay respect to those courageous men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice fighting for our freedoms," Snyder said. "They made a true difference, and we will never forget those heroes. We will always keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers."
This flag order is in accordance with Executive Order 2013-10. Michigan residents, businesses, schools, local governments and other organizations also are encouraged to display the flag at half-staff.
On Memorial Day, the flag is displayed at half-staff until noon and at full-staff from noon to sunset.
When flown at half-staff or half-mast, the U.S. flag should be hoisted first to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff or half-mast position. The flag should again be raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day.
