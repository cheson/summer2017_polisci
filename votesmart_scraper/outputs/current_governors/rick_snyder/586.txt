HARLOW: The "Washington Post" calls him, quote, "one of the most hard to pin down Republicans in the country." Michigan Governor Rick Snyder was among those who believed that bankruptcy was the right move for Detroit. $18 billion in debt, it is the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history but now the same governor is one of the biggest advocates for an aid deal worth almost $200 million trying to pull Detroit out of bankruptcy.
Despite a pretty tough political fight, it passed with broad bipartisan support. Later this morning, he is headed over to sign it. Sign that aid package into law. He joins me now from Detroit.
Governor, thank you for being here. We appreciate it.
GOV. RICK SNYDER (R), MICHIGAN: It's great to be with you, Poppy. It's an important day to sign these bill, it's another step on getting Detroit on the path to being a great exciting city again.
HARLOW: You know, I've covered Detroit really extensively. Spent a lot of time there up with you in Lansing. This is a big step. It's frankly unprecedented, according to analysts that cover bankruptcies like this that I've talked to.
But the road ahead for Detroit is still very long. You have a big fight between pensioners, creditors and the city.
Do you see a successful exit from bankruptcy for Detroit come this fall, as you're hoping for?
