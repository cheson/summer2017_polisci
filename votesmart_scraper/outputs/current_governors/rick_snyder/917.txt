Snyder Signs Bill to Promote Efficiency in Ballot Printing
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder recently signed legislation to require voting instructions be printed on privacy sleeves rather than directly on ballots.
House Bill 4992, sponsored by state Rep. Eileen Kowall, promotes efficiency by requiring voting instructions to be printed on each ballot privacy sleeve or contained in a pocket on the front of the sleeve. Printing instructions directly on the ballots adds cost and length to ballots.
"As we approach the primary and general elections, I look forward to the most efficient and cost-effective voting process possible," Snyder said.
The legislation also allows common law names to appear on the ballot, and in 2012 only, requires state political party conventions to meet at least 58 days before the general election rather than 60 days before to avoid a conflict with Labor Day.
The bill now is Public Act 128.
