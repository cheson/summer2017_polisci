Statement

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement after the Michigan Legislature adopted measures to change how the state's largest health insurance provider is regulated. Snyder called for the modernization of the Blues in his September 2011 Special Message on Health Care.
"The health and well-being of Michigan residents is an essential part of our state's reinvention. The Legislature's reforms to transition Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan to a nonprofit mutual company will play an important role in providing better access to quality health care and investment in the health of all Michiganders. I thank Senate and House leadership for their commitment to reinventing health care in Michigan, and I look forward to signing these reforms soon."
