Lt. Gov. Brian Calley has signed legislation to stiffen penalties against the crime of arson and revise sentencing guidelines, creating an improved structure for dealing with arson crimes. In 2011, there were 10,552 arson and suspicious fires in Michigan, accounting for one out of every three fires in Michigan. The loss of life and property caused from arson crimes require aggressive action.

"Arson cases are too often treated as nonviolent offenses, with sentencing that is not hard enough for such a serious offense," said Calley. "This legislation restructures the way we deal with these crimes and provides for more appropriate penalties."
House Bills 5692 - 5695, sponsored by state Reps. John Walsh, Kevin Cotter, Joseph Graves, and Stacey Erwin Oakes, revise provisions relating to the crime of arson by increasing penalties and sentencing guidelines. They are now Public Acts 531 - 534.
