Gov. Rick Snyder has traveled around the globe to tell the story of Michigan's food and agricultural products, and the work in paying off through increased sales around the world.
Michigan's overall food and agricultural exports continued to grow in 2013, reaching $3.53 billion annually, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
That's an 8.9 percent increase from the year before. Agricultural exports doubled since 2010, in line with Gov. Rick Snyder's goal to double the exports by 2015 to $3.5 billion.
"These new figures highlight the high consumer demand for top quality and diverse agricultural products Michigan offers in the worldwide marketplace," Snyder said. "Exports continue to play a vital role in growing our economy as numerous Michigan food and agriculture companies are expanding into new global markets."
The food and agriculture industry is one of Michigan's "big three," and Snyder has spoken about the quality of state products on trade missions to Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
The 2014 South Korea trade mission led to $1.4 million in anticipated sales in the next 12 months, and three Michigan companies reported 42 contacts with new international buyers.
The top five export markets for Michigan agricultural exports in 2013 were Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and China. The top agricultural exports were other plant products, soybean and soybean meal, dairy products, wheat, as well as processed fruit and nuts.
