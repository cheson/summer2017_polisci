One of Michigan's most pressing responsibilities is ensuring that students are prepared to enter the work force and to take advantage of the new opportunities as our economy grows. Michigan's future is absolutely dependent on making our education system a success for our students, our teachers, our parents and our economy.
Our education system must position our children to compete globally in a knowledge-based economy. To prepare and train the next generation of workers, Michigan needs a capable, nimble and innovative work force that can adapt to the needs of the emerging knowledge-based economy and compete with any nation.
