Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: March 11, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today called for an immediate and full joint investigation of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services by the state's Auditor General and the DHHS Inspector General.
The investigation will look at the way the department handled public health issues related to elevated lead levels in blood tests in Flint, as well as the uptick in cases of Legionnaire's Disease in Genesee County in 2014 and 2015.
"The public health issues the people of Flint and Genesee County are facing warranted an internal review of how the state handled these situations," Snyder said. "That preliminary internal review warrants an immediate and thorough investigation. I want some answers."
Snyder has asked Michigan Auditor General Doug Ringler and DHHS Inspector General Alan Kimichik to complete a joint investigation as soon as possible without sacrificing the thoroughness of the work they need to do.
The Governor has offered any assistance they might need from his office and has alerted the Attorney General's Office to the investigation, as well.
When completed, the results of the full investigation will be shared with the public, as well as interested parties at the local, state and federal level.
