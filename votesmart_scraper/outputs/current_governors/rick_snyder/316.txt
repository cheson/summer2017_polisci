Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Oct. 21, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory task force charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer recommendations for future guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents.
Task force members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and environmental protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence Reynolds of Mott Children's Health Center in Flint.
"Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water Authority is a good first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it's not the last step," Snyder said. "Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents in Flint and all of Michigan."
