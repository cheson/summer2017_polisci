Gov. Rick Snyder today offered the following comments on the life and legacy of former South African President Nelson Mandela:
"Nelson Mandela set out to transform a nation. In doing so, he made our entire world a better place. Through his convictions, courage and vision, he led the reforms that abolished the shameful policy of apartheid and established multiracial elections in South Africa. He suffered greatly because of his principles, yet was undeterred in his lifelong mission to combat poverty and other social ills stemming from decades of racial segregation.
"President Mandela was a man of great strength who saw the wisdom of peace. He used his office and international influence to heal a wounded nation. But his impact was felt far beyond the borders of his own country. His advocacy and leadership shined a much-needed spotlight on human rights issues across the globe, making a difference in countless lives. President Mandela advanced the causes of human dignity and equality around the world and rightfully has been recognized by honors such as the Nobel Peace Prize and the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.
"The people of Michigan join the global community in mourning the loss of President Mandela, who will be remembered as one of the world's great leaders. We offer our humble appreciation for the work of this remarkable man, whose legacy as a statesman, reformer and peacemaker has left a better world for us and our children."
