Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Dec. 22, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today accepted emergency manager Brad Coulter's recommendation that the financial emergency in Lincoln Park has been resolved. For the first time in 15 years, no Michigan city is being overseen by an emergency manager.
Snyder also appointed a Receivership Transition Advisory Board to ensure a smooth transition to local control and continued financial stability for the city. A solid financial foundation will help the city provide residents with better services and improved quality of life.
"This is a great day, not only for the city of Lincoln Park but for the entire State of Michigan," Snyder said. "Brad has provided a shining example of how the system can work; first, collaborating with local leaders to address the city's financial emergency, then working to enhance economic development to help ensure continued financial stability for Lincoln Park."
