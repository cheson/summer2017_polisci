Presidential Primary Bill Signed Into Law
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Oct. 4, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation designating Tuesday, Feb. 28, 2012 as the date of the Michigan presidential primary election. The date, which falls one week before Super Tuesday, aligns with other previously scheduled elections in Michigan, sparing taxpayers the expense of holding a special presidential primary election.
"Holding the presidential election before Super Tuesday helps ensure Michigan is relevant in the selection process," Snyder said. "It also means presidential candidates will have to focus on the economic issues that are most important to our state."
Senate Bill 584, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville, is now Public Act 163 of 2011.
The governor today also signed three other bills:
House Bill 4349, sponsored by state Rep. Kurt Heise, gives police departments more flexibility by allowing proceeds from the sale of forfeited property to be used for any law enforcement purpose. Previously, proceeds from confiscated property could only be used to support drug enforcement efforts. The legislation is now P.A. 161 of 2011.
S.B. 77, sponsored by state Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker, sets a two-year limit for suing architects, engineers and professional surveyors for malpractice. A lawsuit may still be brought after the two-year limit if action is taken within six months after a defect is discovered. The legislation is now P.A. 162 of 2011.
H.B. 4915, sponsored by state Rep. Eileen Kowall, extends air quality fees that had been set to expire in 2011 for another four years, and increases fees for some facilities. Funds generated from the fees are used to support the Department of Environmental Quality's Air Quality Division. The legislation is now P.A. 164.
