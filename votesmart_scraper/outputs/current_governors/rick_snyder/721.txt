Snyder Signs Unemployment Insurance Reforms
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Oct. 29, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed a package of bills that reforms unemployment insurance in the state, which will help ensure financial assistance gets to those truly in need and improve the process to help reduce fraud.
"These are necessary updates to make sure Michigan is in line with federal requirements," Snyder said. "They will also help strengthen the unemployment insurance system by reducing fraud."
The main bills in the package prioritize the prevention and recovery of improperly paid unemployment benefits, bringing Michigan law in line with federal regulations. The measures provide the state with a greater ability to reclaim payments made as a result of fraudulent claims. Additionally, they authorize the state Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) to charge an employer for failing to provide required information, and change how recovered funds are credited.
