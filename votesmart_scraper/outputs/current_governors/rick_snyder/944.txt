ov. Rick Snyder has signed legislation ensuring the proper use of public funds and resources by prohibiting schools from deducting union dues or service fees from employees' paychecks.
House Bill 4929, sponsored by state Rep. Joe Haveman, also requires that unions representing public employees file with the Michigan Employment Relations Commission an independent audit of expenditures attributed to the cost of collective bargaining, contract administration and grievance adjustment. The commission must make the audits available to the public on its website.
"This legislation furthers the goal of good government by promoting greater transparency and ensuring that public resources are used solely for their intended purposes," Snyder said. "It is essential that state public school resources be devoted to the education of our children. This continues the fiscal reforms designed to save schools money and help them operate even more efficiently."
Schools currently collecting dues or service fees under collective bargaining agreements may continue to do so until the contract expires or is terminated, extended or renewed.
H.B. 4929 now is Public Act 53 of 2012.
