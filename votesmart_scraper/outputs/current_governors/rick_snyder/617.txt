Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 16, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for March fell to 7.5 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in Michigan since April 2008.
"Getting Michiganders back to work has been my focus since I came to Lansing. Today's numbers are further evidence that our state's economy is turning around and the Michigan comeback is well underway. While the current trend is heading in the right direction, we cannot take our foot off the gas. We can do better and we will do better.
More than a quarter million private sector jobs have been created since December 2010. Michigan's per capita income growth rate in 2013 ranked 9th in nation and it's our highest ranking in nearly 20 years. We've created opportunities for Michiganders by setting the environment for businesses to grow and thrive. We've built a rock-solid foundation and I'm confident we can continue to build upon it."
