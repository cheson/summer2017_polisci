Snyder Issues Executive Order Establishing Arab and Chaldean American Affairs Council
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 6, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued Executive Order 2013-9 to create the Michigan Council on Arab and Chaldean American Affairs, which will be housed within the state Department of Civil Rights. The new council replaces the Advisory Council on Arab and Chaldean American Affairs.
"By reducing the size and enhancing efficiencies, this restructured council will better serve the needs of Arab and Chaldean Americans in Michigan," Snyder said.

The 10-member council will advise the department on issues relating to the Arab and Chaldean communities in Michigan as well as promote awareness of their culture and history. The executive order repeals EO 2004-33, which created the 33-member Advisory Council on Arab and Chaldean American Affairs.

Appointments to the new council will be made after the executive order takes effect.

EO 2013-9 takes effect 60 days after filing, on Aug. 6.

The full text of EO 2013-9 is available at www.michigan.gov/snyder.
