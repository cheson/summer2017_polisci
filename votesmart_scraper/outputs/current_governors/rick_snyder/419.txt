Gov. Rick Snyder: Governor's Talent Investment Board will Help TIA Grow a Talented Workforce
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Michigan continues its focused efforts to become a national leader in developing a talented workforce, with the Governor's Talent Investment Board being moved to the new Michigan Talent Investment Agency, Gov. Rick Snyder said.
Snyder signed Executive Order 2015-11 to locate the board within the agency, rescinding a prior order that housed the board within the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.
"Michigan's unemployment rate continues to fall but there are still jobs going unfilled because employers can't find people with the right skills," Snyder said. "We need to ensure the talent is there to match the in-demand skills required to fill those jobs. This executive order is part of our overall goal to make Michigan a leader in the nation for talent development."
The order rescinds Executive Order 2011-13, which originally established the investment board within the Workforce Development Agency under MEDC. When Snyder created TIA in December 2014, the Workforce Development Agency was transferred to the agency as well.
Under Executive Order 2015-11, the Governor's Talent Investment Board will be charged with advising and assisting the governor regarding compliance with the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. The board will bring together employers, organized labor and community-based organizations, including apprenticeship programs, to make recommendations on how to best develop workforce talent across the state.
