Location: Lansing, MI

YFS Automotive Systems, Inc. is expanding its U.S. manufacturing footprint and creating 160 new jobs in Detroit, investing $26.9 million in a new facility to design, test, and manufacture automotive fuel system components.
The company will receive a Michigan Business Development Program performance-based grant through the Michigan Strategic Fund, approved on Tuesday.
"YFS locating in Detroit is a reaffirmation of Michigan's competitive business climate," said Gov. Rick Snyder, who met with YFS during his 2014 investment mission to China. "Our strong economy combined with our top talent makes investing in Michigan ideal for local and international businesses to locate and thrive."
The Michigan Strategic Fund approved the $1.3-million MBDP incentive to bring the project to Michigan rather than Ohio. The move was announced Tuesday by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.
"Strong collaboration between the MEDC, the Detroit Regional Chamber and the DEGC/City of Detroit proved to be vital in attracting a global manufacturer like YFS," MEDC Chief Executive Officer Steve Arwood said. "This company could have chosen any number of places in the U.S. to invest and grow and the fact that they chose Michigan is a testament to our growing economy and outstanding workforce."
YFS Automotive Systems is a Tier 1 supplier of fuel tanks and urea systems for automotive OEMs. The company was established in 1997 as ABC Group Fuel Systems, Inc. and was purchased in 2014 by the Rongshi International, a Chinese-owned automotive supplier. The company plans to acquire approximately 30 acres of vacant industrial property in Detroit to construct a 150,000 square-foot manufacturing facility.
