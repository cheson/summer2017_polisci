New criminal penalties are now in place for those who solicit the sale of ingredients used to manufacture methamphetamine or who manufacture meth near libraries or schools, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Taking these steps to reduce the production and sale of dangerous drugs like methamphetamine is essential to protecting the lives and futures of our children and the safety of Michigan families," Snyder said.
Senate Bills 409-410 and House Bills 4864 and 4769, sponsored by state Sens. Margaret O'Brien and Tom Casperson and state Reps. John Kivela and Ed McBroom, respectively, make changes to penalties and guidelines relating to the solicitation of methamphetamine.
SB 409 authorizes up to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine for attempting to persuade a person to purchase ingredients that will be used to manufacture methamphetamine. It is now Public Act 125 of 2016.
SB 410 establishes sentencing guidelines for the penalties proposed by Senate Bill 409. It is now PA 126.
HB 4864 imposes a five-year "stop sale alert" on individuals convicted of attempting to persuade a person to purchase ingredients that will be used to manufacture methamphetamine. It is now PA 127.
HB 4769 increases the penalties for manufacturing methamphetamine near a school or library. It is now PA 128.
