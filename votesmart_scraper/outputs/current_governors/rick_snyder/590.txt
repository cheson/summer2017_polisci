Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement after the resignation of Education Achievement Authority Chancellor John Covington. Dr. Covington is leaving to help care for his ailing mother and start a consultancy to help schools develop student-centered learning plans.
"We created the Education Achievement Authority because we know that a strong public school system is essential for Michigan's comeback, and some of our schools have failed students for too many years. We needed an innovative approach that would help students grow academically while helping them and their families with some of the outside of school challenges that can impact learning.
"Dr. Covington embraced the tremendous challenge of building such a school district. His student-centered approach, with individualized learning plans, longer school days and longer school years allowed children to make great strides. With passion, he built a solid foundation for the work of the EAA to continue and thrive, helping thousands of our young people now and into the future.
"I appreciate Dr. Covington's vision and hard work and wish him the very best with his family and in his new role.
"I have every confidence the EAA Board of Directors will manage this change effectively and ensure a seamless transition for students and their families."
