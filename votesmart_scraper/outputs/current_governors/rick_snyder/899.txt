Snyder Commends Indigent Defense Advisory Commission for Work
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 22, 2012
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today thanked members of the Indigent Defense Advisory Commission for completing its mission of offering improvements to ensure cost-effective, consistent and qualified legal counsel is provided to low income criminal defendants across Michigan.
"I appreciate the commission for developing its recommendations to help overcome the decades-long challenges that have impeded Michigan's public defense system," Snyder said. "I will review the recommendations and look forward to working with the Legislature to ensure that all criminal defendants, regardless of ability to pay, receive effective legal representation in our state."

The diverse 14-member commission, which includes four legislators and 10 members appointed by Snyder, came together to produce its recommendations nearly one month before the July 15 deadline.

Snyder created the commission in Executive Order 2011-12, issued last October, and reiterated the need to reform indigent defense in his March special message on public safety.
