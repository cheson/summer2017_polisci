Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 21, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder's office today posted additional batches of emails and corresponding documents from state departments regarding the Flint water crisis. The documentation represents requests fulfilled to date by the Department of Environmental Quality, the Executive Office, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Michigan State Police, the Department of Talent and Economic Development, the Talent Investment Agency, the Department of Technology, Management and Budget, and the Department of Treasury.
"After the initial batches from state departments were released in February, we continued our search for emails and other materials related to the Flint water crisis as part of an ongoing effort to increase transparency and make information more accessible to the public," Snyder said. "Residents can read these materials for themselves, and then we can continue to work together to help Flint families recover from this crisis."
This release will be the final posting of documents in this manner; all other requests of documents from state departments will be handled through the standard FOIA process moving forward. Since releasing Snyder's emails in January, the Governor's Office has released nearly 180,000 pages of materials related to Flint water.
