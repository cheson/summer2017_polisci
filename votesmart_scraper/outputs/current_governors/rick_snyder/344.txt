Gov. Rick Snyder today ordered U.S. flags within the State Capitol Complex and on all state buildings to be lowered to half-staff on Tuesday, Sept. 1, in honor of Michigan State Police Trooper Chad H. Wolf, who died from injuries sustained while on duty, Friday, Aug. 28.
"Trooper Wolf gave the ultimate sacrifice in service to our state and his fellow Michiganders. Despite possible risks, he felt the duty to serve and went to work every day to keep our communities safe," Snyder said. "On behalf of the entire state, I sincerely thank Trooper Wolf for his service and join with his family, friends and colleagues in mourning his tragic loss."
Wolf, 38, was a seven-year veteran of the Michigan State Police, serving in the Second District and based in Taylor. He was a member of the Motor Unit. He was an active member of the community, serving as the youth leader at Great Lakes Baptist Church. He earned his bachelor's degree from Pensacola Christian College in Pensacola, FL. Wolf is survived by his wife and four young children.
Visitation will be held today, Aug. 31 from 2-5 p.m. and 7-9 p.m. at Sharp Funeral Homes in the Fenton Chapel at 1000 Silver Lake Rd. The funeral ceremony will be held Tuesday, Sept. 1 at 1 p.m., at Fenton High School.
This flag order is in accordance with Executive Order 2013-10. Michigan residents, businesses, schools, local governments and other organizations also are encouraged to display the flag at half-staff. Flags should be returned to full-staff on Wednesday, Sept. 2.
When flown at half-staff or half-mast, the U.S. flag should be hoisted first to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff or half-mast position. The flag should again be raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day.
