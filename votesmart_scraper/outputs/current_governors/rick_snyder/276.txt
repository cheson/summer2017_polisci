Gov. Rick Snyder Appeals Denial of Federal Major Disaster Declaration for Flint
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Jan. 20, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today submitted an appeal to President Barack Obama following the denial of a major disaster declaration, a move that could potentially bring additional and much-needed resources to help the people of Flint.
"The situation in Flint is a disaster and in need of a federal declaration," Snyder said. "This situation poses an imminent and long-term threat to the people of Flint. We appreciate the support of the White House through the earlier emergency declaration. But additional federal resources are needed for the work that must be done."
In the appeal to President Obama, Snyder said the severity of the disaster warrants special consideration for all categories under the Individual and Public Assistance Programs, as well as the Hazardous Mitigation program in order to facilitate recovery.
Snyder said this disaster is similar in scope to a flood, given that qualities within the water over a long period of time damaged the city's infrastructure in ways that are not immediately detectable. The problems will contribute to years -- and potentially decades -- of health problems and economic loss as well as require repairs to the infrastructure that neither the city, county nor state has the capacity to carry out.
President Obama denied the disaster declaration for Flint while approving an emergency declaration on Saturday, Jan. 16.
