Public Statements
Bill Signed to Help Law Enforcement Investigate Child Abuse
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 4, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed House Bill 4050, which allows the state's Office of Children's Ombudsman to share information from investigations related to child deaths with law enforcement officials.
The bill, sponsored by state Rep. Ken Kurtz, also restores subpoena power to the ombudsman through the attorney general's office to aid in investigations.

"This is a good bill that will help law enforcement and the Children's Ombudsman to better protect children and bring justice to those who abuse them," Snyder said.

HB 4050 is now Public Act 38 of 2013.

The governor also signed HB 4177 and HB 4705.

HB 4177, sponsored by former state Rep. Jim Ananich, corrects a technical error in existing law that could prevent prosecutors from successfully prosecuting criminals who have abused vulnerable adults. It is now PA 39.

HB 4705, sponsored by state Rep. Ed McBroom, resolves a problem whereby a school district inadvertently collected taxes for a millage that was no longer outstanding. Excess collections will be transferred to the state Treasury Department and property owners will receive a State Education Tax credit on their next property tax bill. It is now PA 40.
