Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that Michigan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for August fell to 5.1 percent -- which also is the national average. This is the lowest monthly rate since July 2001.
"More people are working in Michigan because, together, we are doing the right things to help Michiganders and the companies that invest in the people who live and work here. I've recently had the opportunity to tell the Michigan story to businesses and government leaders around the world. They know of Michigan's comeback, our outstanding work ethic and the quality products we design, build or grow. While I proudly tell them what we've done, I stress that we aren't resting.
"It's remarkable that Michigan's unemployment rate has reached this 14-year-low. It's an exciting time in Michigan. But we strive to do even better. We remain focused on solving problems. We are creating opportunities for children and adults, helping them overcome challenges they face and build the skills they need to become successful today and into the future."
