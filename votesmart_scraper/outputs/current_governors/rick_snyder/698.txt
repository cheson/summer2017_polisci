Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed bipartisan legislation to help strengthen penalties for owners of blighted property.
"This is a good plan that will give more tools to communities throughout Michigan that are fighting blight," Snyder said. "Blight is more than just a visual problem. It also negatively affects our economy by reducing property values, making it harder to bring more and better jobs to our state, and also threatening public safety. These new laws will help communities continue the positive changes they are already making in the effort to eliminate blight."
Senate Bill 35, sponsored by state Sen. Virgil Smith, authorizes additional penalties for failing to pay fines imposed by administrative hearing bureaus that many cities are allowed to create for enforcing blight violations.
"These blight bills will go a long way in giving communities the tools they need to clean up and retake their neighborhoods. I'm excited to see them become law," said Smith.
The bill is now PA 188 of 2013.
SB 36, sponsored by state Sen. Bert Johnson, allows local governments to deny zoning authorization for property owners who have failed to pay fines imposed for blight violations. It is now PA 189.
SB 37, sponsored by state Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker, allows local governments to ban building permits for property owners who have failed to pay fines imposed for blight violations. It is now PA 190.
