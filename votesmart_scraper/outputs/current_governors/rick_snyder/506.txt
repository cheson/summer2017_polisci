With the arrival of winter weather, Gov. Rick Snyder today encouraged Michigan residents to make emergency preparedness a priority.
"Last winter, Michiganders endured hardships due to frigid temperatures, heavy amounts of snow and a statewide propane shortage," Snyder said. "Now is the time for families to take a few extra steps to ensure they are prepared in the event of another severe winter season."
Severe winter weather poses health and safety concerns with extremely cold temperatures, freezing pipes, potential propane shortages and power outages. The Michigan State Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division (MSP/EMHSD) offers several steps that families should take to prepare for the winter season.
