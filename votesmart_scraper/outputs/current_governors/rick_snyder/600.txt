Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder this evening signed bipartisan legislation responsibly raising Michigan's minimum wage to $9.25 an hour by 2018, a move he said will help hard-working residents without hindering the state's improving economy.
Senate Bill 934 increases the minimum wage from $7.40 an hour to $9.25 over the next four years and would be adjusted to the rate of inflation or 3.5 percent, whichever is lower, starting in 2019.Tipped employees would have a rate that is 38 percent of the minimum, or about $3.51 an hour.
"I commend my partners in the Legislature for finding common ground on a bill that will help Michigan workers and protect our state's growing economy," Snyder said. "Michigan is the comeback state, and our goal always should be long-term success for our residents and our state as a whole."
Snyder said the bill represents a compromise and responsibly raises the wage. The number of jobs filled in Michigan has increased steadily since the start of 2011, with more than a quarter-million new private sector positions created. The state's unemployment rate has dropped to 7.4 percent, its lowest rate since 2008.
"At the same time, there are tens of thousands of jobs available for people with in-demand skills," Snyder said. "Our focus has been and will continue to be on helping people obtain the skills they need to be successful and improve the quality of their lives. That includes strengthening our education system, building career tech programs and connecting job-creators with schools and colleges. Through the Community Ventures program, we are also helping structurally unemployed adults gain the skills they need to find meaningful jobs."
