Gov. Rick Snyder today issued Executive Order 2012-7 to establish a criminal investigations subunit within the state Gaming Control Board, enhancing the unit's ability to conduct investigations.
"By creating a new subunit with expanded access to state and federal criminal justice information, the board will be better equipped to do its duty," Snyder said.
The Criminal Investigations Subunit is charged with investigating any criminal activity relating to any matter under the jurisdiction and authority of the Michigan Gaming Control Board. Its duties include conducting fingerprint-based background checks for applicants seeking a gaming license, investigating claims of unlawful gaming, and sharing and reviewing records and information with other criminal justice agencies to assist in the enforcement and investigation of all matters under the authority of the board.

The executive director of the Michigan Gaming Control Board will be responsible for the subunit's operation
