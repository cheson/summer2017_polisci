Statement

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for September fell to 7.2 percent. The rate is the lowest in the state since March 2008.
"The continuing drop in our unemployment rate is another indication that the hard work of Michigan's reinvention is helping our working families. We are generating the trends we want and need to see. There are more and better jobs, and our labor force is growing as people see opportunities. Across our state, there is improvement and optimism.
"This dropping rate brings us very close to Michigan's pre-recession levels. While we are unquestionably headed in the right direction, there is still more to do. We will continue working with our partners in the Legislature and the business community to create the environment for job creators to grow and thrive. We will continue working with -- and investing in -- our education community at all levels to build a workforce empowered with the skills for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
"We are encouraged by the gains we have made, but our focus remains on the long-term vision for Michigan's increasingly bright future."
