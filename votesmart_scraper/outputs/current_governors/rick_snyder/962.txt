Gov. Rick Snyder has proclaimed Thursday, Jan. 26 as Michigan Statehood Day, commemorating 175 years since the state was admitted to the Union as America's 26th state.
"Michigan has a great past but its best days are yet to come," Snyder said. "The innovative spirit that built this state will take us to new heights in the 21st century and beyond. It's an honor to be a Michigander and as we celebrate this Michigan milestone, I encourage every resident to take a moment and reflect on the beauty, greatness and promise of our state."
The proclamation highlights Michigan's rich history and invites citizens to take part in Statehood Day activities on Saturday, Jan. 28 at the Michigan Historical Museum.
"The Michigan Historical Museum has celebrated Statehood Day for decades with pioneer crafts and skills," said Sandra Clark, director of the Michigan Historical Center. "Saturday, as we look back 175 years, we also look forward to Michigan's future, and the museum's future, as we experiment with motion-aware games that may soon add a new level of interactivity to experiencing history."
The Michigan Historical Museum, located in the Michigan Library and Historical Center in Lansing, offers five levels of permanent and changing exhibits that tell Michigan's story. Throughout the year, citizens can experience the museum's exhibits which include interactive computers, audio-visual presentations and hands-on elements.
