Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding the agreement reached today by the Regional Transit Authority:
"The Regional Transit Authority is about getting people to jobs and making sure seniors and those with disabilities can live independently. It's also about growing our economy to benefit everyone. I had a chance to speak with regional leaders about the importance of the plan and I want to thank them for coming together and reaching an agreement for the good of Southeast Michigan. Regional transit is vital to this region and to our entire state. I look forward to future steps being taken to ensure Michiganders have solid access to transportation across the state."
