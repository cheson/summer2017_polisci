Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Bills Improving Access to In-Home Stair Lifts for Michigan Residents
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 21, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation that will give seniors, disabled veterans and mobility-impaired individuals greater access to in-home stair lifts.
"Expanding the pool of contractors who install residential stair lifts eases the burden on Michigan residents, especially those on a fixed income," Snyder said. "Outdated regulatory restrictions imposed unnecessary costs and delays for Michiganders needing mobility assistance, and now they will no longer face those obstacles."
House Bills 4162 and 4163, sponsored by state Reps. Aric Nesbitt and Al Pscholka, respectively, exempt residential stairway lifts from regulations written for commercial elevators and lifts and allow individuals who are not licensed elevator contractors to install lifts as long as they are certified by the manufacturer.
The bills expand the pool of qualified installers and lower the cost of installation. They are now Public Acts 34 and 35 of 2015.
