Recognizing the ever-increasing need for citizens, businesses and governments to prepare for attacks through the Internet, Gov. Rick Snyder has proclaimed October as Cyber Security Awareness Month in Michigan.
The Internet's growing role in our lives exponentially increases the need for individuals, businesses, law enforcement and governments to remain vigilant against cyber threats, and to continue learning about the latest advances in cyber security.
"The Internet touches virtually every aspect of our lives, making cyber security more important than ever," Snyder said. "Let's use Cyber Security Awareness Month as an opportunity to become better informed of cyber threats and how to avoid them as families, job providers and government leaders. Michigan has emerged as a leader on this critical issue and we'll continue our commitment to enhancing the security of residents and their personal information."
Data theft and security breaches cost businesses worldwide an estimated $1 trillion annually, and the state of Michigan blocks more than 500,000 hacking attempts each day on its networks. Michigan has taken many proactive steps to address the constant attempts on the state's systems and networks.
Enhancements have been made to the Michigan Security Operations Center to guard against cyber and physical threats to state facilities and systems. The Michigan Cyber Range, launched in 2012, provides a world-class training facility for cyber security professionals to hone their skills in a safe environment. Continued collaboration with state, local and federal agencies, as well as private sector partners has led to advances in early detection and rapid responses to cyber incidents.
