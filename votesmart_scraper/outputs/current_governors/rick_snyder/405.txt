Michigan residents who retired from state government service will be able to contract on cases with the Attorney General's office they may have specialized expertise on without forfeiting their retirement pay, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Allowing retirees to contract on cases is a cost-effective option for state government," Snyder said. "Not only is this a great way to harness the expertise of former employees with specialized knowledge, it costs less than hiring and training a new employee."
Senate Bill 12, sponsored by state Sen. Rick Jones, allows retired state workers to contract with the Attorney General's office as a witness, expert or consultant for litigation involving the state without forfeiting their retirement allowance during the period of the contract. The bill is now Public Act 20 of 2015.
