Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to guarantee all public school children the opportunity to recite the Pledge of Allegiance every day.

"This legislation provides one more way to help introduce students to the importance of civics," Snyder said.

The requirement takes effect for the 2013 school year. All children will have the opportunity to say the pledge, but no one will be required if they or their parents object.

The legislation also calls for a U.S. flag to be hung in each classroom where the pledge will be recited. Both the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars have offered to help furnish flags, within their resources, for schools that cannot afford them.

Senate Bill 637, sponsored by state Sen. Roger Kahn, and House Bill 4934, sponsored by Kevin Cotter, now are Public Acts 320 and 321 of 2012.
