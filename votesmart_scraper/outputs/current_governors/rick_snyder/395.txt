Gov. Rick Snyder: Continuing rop in unemployment shows Michigan is growing stronger, building on success
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 20, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for April fell to 5.4 percent -- which also is the national average. This is the first time that Michigan has been at the national average since September 2000.
"Reaching the national average after being dead last has been a priority as we've worked to reinvent Michigan. To appreciate how far we've come, we need to remember where we began -- ranked No. 50 in the nation. We've cut Michigan's unemployment rate by more than half since the end of 2010, creating nearly 400,000 private sector jobs.
"The national average is an important milestone but we now must set our sights on surpassing that mark. We will continue to build upon our success. From creating a talented work force to improving education to helping every person reach their potential through the River of Opportunity, we will be the place where companies look to grow and create more and better jobs. And we should be loud and proud about what we, together, have accomplished as other states look to Michigan's continuing success."
