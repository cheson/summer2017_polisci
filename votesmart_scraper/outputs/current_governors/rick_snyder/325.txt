Flint residents need to have access to safe, clean, water now and long into the future, Gov. Rick Snyder said, announcing a comprehensive action plan created with state, federal and city leaders to address concerns about drinking water.
The action plan focuses on increasing water testing, offering additional precautions for families with lead plumbing in their homes, and providing long-term solutions to address the city's water infrastructure challenges. The plan was created at Snyder's direction by the Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Health and Human Services (DHHS), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the city of Flint.
"We are focused on helping ensure safe, clean, accessible drinking water and addressing and mitigating concerns and protecting public health," Snyder said. "Today's action plan builds upon ongoing work with local, state and federal agencies and our partnership with city and community leaders. Together, we are working to ensure that all Flint residents have accurate information and know that help is available to address potential problems."
