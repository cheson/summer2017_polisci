Snyder Signs Bill to Allow Easier Cell Phone Service Expansion
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder recently signed legislation to allow cell phone service providers to expand facilities without additional fees or special use permits.
Senate Bill 1064, sponsored by state Sen. Mike Kowall, allows wireless communication providers to expand existing facilities without obtaining special use permits or paying extra fees. This creates a consistent regulatory environment across all local jurisdictions.
The bill requires the new equipment be added to an existing compound, increasing its width by no more than necessary and its height by no more than 20 feet or 10 percent of its original height, whichever is greater. Expansions that do not meet these requirements will need a special land use permit, costing no more than $1,000 for the application fee.
"Michigan needs to invest in infrastructure, and creating an environment for greater cell phone service is a step in the right direction," Snyder said.
The bill now is Public Act 143 of 2012.
The governor also signed House Bill 4563, sponsored by state Rep. Aric Nesbitt. It exempts certain intangible property actively in transaction between businesses from the requirement that companies turn over to the state any property belonging to a third party that goes unclaimed for a specific period of time. The bill now is P.A. 144.
