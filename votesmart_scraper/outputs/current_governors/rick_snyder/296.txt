Gov. Rick Snyder today applauded the Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund board of trustees' recommendations to the Legislature to fund recreational development projects across the state. The recommendations encourage outdoor activity and further support the state's tourism industry.
The board's recommendations total nearly $28 million to fund land acquisition and development projects in 2016.
"Michigan's world-class natural resources and recreation opportunities play an important role in driving our state's reinvention," Gov. Snyder said. "The Trust Fund board's vision builds on the appeal of Michigan's great outdoor spaces, strengthens our economy, and improves the quality of life in our communities."
