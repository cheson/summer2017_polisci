Gov. Snyder Signs Bill Eliminating Straight-Party Ticket Ballot Option, Asks Legislature to Enact No-Reason Absentee Voting
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation that will update election law, aligning Michigan more closely with other states by eliminating the option for voters to select a straight-party ticket on the ballot.
"Michigan is one of only 10 states that allows residents to vote for just a party affiliation rather than individual people. It's time to choose people over politics," Snyder said. "To alleviate concerns that this change could lead to longer wait times for voters, I'm asking the Legislature to enact secured no-reason absentee voting."
