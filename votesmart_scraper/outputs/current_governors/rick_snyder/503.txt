Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for October fell to 7.1 percent. The rate is the lowest in the state since January through March 2008.
"There is optimism and opportunity in Michigan as our state's economy continues to move forward. More people are working and our labor force is growing as companies create more and better jobs. Our reinvention is helping working families and we are seeing results.
"But while we can recognize this accomplishment, there is more to do to fulfill our goal of the brightest possible future. We need to continue creating an environment for success, and that includes building a workforce with in-demand skills -- and making sure a pathway to those skills is available for Michigan students and adults."
