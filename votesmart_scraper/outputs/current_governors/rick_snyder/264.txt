Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed Executive Order 2016-4, establishing the Office of Performance and Transformation to help streamline administration and improve delivery of government services.
The OPT, housed within the State Budget Office, will be responsible for working with all state departments to establish a more effective system of customer service, performance measurement and regulatory and business practices. The order also moves the Office of Regulatory Reinvention and the Office of Good Government into the OPT.
"This reorganization builds a stronger network that will allow offices and departments with similar goals to better work together," Snyder said. "By creating a venue for these groups to support each other, it ultimately helps ensure both Michigan residents and state employees have improved access to accountable and effective government services."
In addition, the OPT is charged with creating the Center for Reinventing Performance in Michigan. The center will facilitate lean process initiatives and serve as a place for state and agency employees to receive coaching, mentoring and performance management feedback. The directors of the OPT, Budget Office and Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs will work together to establish OPT protocols and operations.
