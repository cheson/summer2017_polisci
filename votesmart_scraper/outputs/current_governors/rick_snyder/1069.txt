Governor Snyder Unveils Recommended Budget to Provide Foundation for Michigan's Reinvention
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Feb. 17, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Governor Rick Snyder today presented to the Legislature his 2012 executive budget and a 2013 projected budget that brings state spending into line without any one-time funding fixes and creates a tax system that is simple, fair and efficient for both businesses and citizens.
Snyder, Lieutenant Governor Brian Calley and State Budget Director John Nixon outlined the recommendation to a joint session of the House and Senate appropriations, finance and tax policy committees.
"This is a comprehensive plan to lay a new, sound foundation for Michigan's reinvention and put an end to the significant budget deficits that state has experienced for the past decade," Snyder said. "It reflects difficult but necessary decisions that will result in a shared sacrifice, but ultimately will benefit citizens, families and communities through the economic growth and job creation that is generated. By stimulating the economy while preserving core, essential services and ensuring a safety net for those who are vulnerable, we'll all move forward together."
The Snyder plan restructures Michigan's tax system, which includes the promised elimination of the Michigan Business Tax, to be replaced with a flat Corporate Income Tax set at 6 percent. The plan includes the scheduled reduction in the individual income tax rate from 4.35 percent to 4.25 percent. Because Michigan is one of only three states in the nation that exempts most or all of earned pension income, Snyder's plan will broaden the base of taxpayers by including those earning private and public pensions. In addition, the plan eliminates all credits and deductions related to the individual income tax with the exception of the personal exemption, homestead property tax credit and other minor subtractions.
