Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation authorizing nearly $38 million in Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund grants to support 99 recreation and land acquisition projects.
House Bill 5364, sponsored by state Rep. Eileen Kowall, reflects recommendations of the trust fund board. The bill now is Public Act 283 of 2012.

"These projects allow us to preserve the places that make Michigan such a special place to live, work and play," Snyder said. "They provide diverse, high-quality recreational opportunities for residents and tourists alike. I appreciate the trust fund board's work in identifying and evaluating these projects so that the economies and quality of life in communities across our state are enhanced."

Total cost of the projects is $65 million when matching funds of more than $27 million are combined with the $38 million appropriated by the legislation.

The trust fund is a restricted fund established in 1976. It provides a funding source for public acquisition of lands for resource protection and outdoor recreation. Revenue is derived from royalties on the sale and lease of state-owned mineral rights. In 1985, voters made the trust fund part of Michigan's Constitution, ensuring the program's future.

Since its creation, the fund has awarded more than $900 million for land acquisition and public outdoor recreation development projects for communities in every county.
