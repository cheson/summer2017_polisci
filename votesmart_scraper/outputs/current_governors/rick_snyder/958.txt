Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to prevent protests and disruptions at funerals and other memorial services.
The two-bill package makes it a felony to protest or otherwise engage in disorderly conduct within 500 feet of a funeral, memorial service, viewing, procession or burial. The felony will be punishable by up to two years' imprisonment, a $5,000 fine or both. Subsequent offenses could garner up to four years' imprisonment, a $10,000 fine or both.

"The death of a loved one is a devastating loss, and this is particularly so for the family and friends of Michigan's military heroes," Snyder said. "Michigan families should be able to celebrate life and mourn death in peace without such disrespect or interruption."

House Bills 4284 and 4745, sponsored by state Reps. Bruce Rendon and Kurt Damrow, respectively, now are Public Acts 5 and 6.
