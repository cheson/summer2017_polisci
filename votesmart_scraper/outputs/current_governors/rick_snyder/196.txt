Aging Michiganders will now have the opportunity to designate their post-hospital caregiver and ensure that person receives proper medical training on the tasks they will need to perform at home, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"This new act will support the needs of Michigan's growing senior population," Snyder said. "Not only will this help patients in need, it will also ensure caregivers will receive the education and information they need to safely provide care for their friend or loved one once they return home from the hospital."
Senate Bill 352, sponsored by state Sen. Margaret O'Brien, requires hospitals to offer patients or their legal guardian the opportunity to choose a designated caregiver to provide care after the patient is discharged from a hospital. In addition, the bill requires hospitals to ensure caregivers understand proper care and treatment instructions.
