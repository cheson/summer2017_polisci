Michigan has gained more private sector jobs than any other Midwestern state since the end of 2010, and the state's unemployment rate has dropped to 5.9 percent -- the lowest in 14 years, Gov. Rick Snyder said Wednesday.
Michigan has created nearly 400,000 private sector jobs since late 2010, with the unemployment rate now nearly cut in half since that time, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Michigan has created the fifth-most private sector jobs in the country, trailing only California, Texas, Florida and New York -- all larger states, according to the most recent data available.
"We should be proud that our hard work in reinventing Michigan is showing results, with companies tapping our talent and legendary work ethic as they create more and better jobs," Snyder said. "But we can't just be satisfied with being a leader in the Midwest. We're working to lead the nation in developing the skilled trades, creating an environment for businesses to grow and thrive and building on the entrepreneurial spirit that is known around the globe."
Statistics released Wednesday show Michigan's unemployment rate to be the lowest since October 2001. The state has gained nearly 400,000 private sector jobs since December 2010, including 105,000 in manufacturing. There have been nearly 100,000 private sector jobs created overall in Michigan in the past year alone.
The job growth in the last 12 months is reflected over a variety of fields with significant increases in professional and business services; manufacturing; construction; trade, trade transportation and utilities; education and health services; and leisure and hospitality services.
