After surveying the flooded areas, Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement related to the flooding damage in Southeast Michigan:
"The amount of rain Southeastern Michigan was hit with on Monday has caused severe issues on our roads. The state of Michigan promptly activated the State Emergency Operations Center and I want to thank Michigan State Police, Michigan Department of Transportation, local officials and countless first responders who are hard at work to help alleviate these serious problems in the region.
"We understand that area residents are eager to return to normal life, but the cleanup from this incident will take some time and I ask for everyone's patience. To ensure public safety, our roads, bridges, sewers and other infrastructure must be inspected to make sure they are safe for travel before officially reopening. If you must navigate the roads, I urge citizens to take precautions, check for flooded areas first, and adhere to barricades or posted warnings."
Safety reminders:
-Do not to drive in flooded areas: Six inches of water can cause loss of control of a vehicle and two feet can sweep away a vehicle.
-Do not drive around a barricade or take short cuts: Barricades are there for your protection, turn around and take another route. Stick to designated roads as shortcuts may be blocked.
-Avoid contact with flood waters: They can be contaminated by hazardous liquids and may contain sharp debris.
-Be cautious of areas that were flooded: These roads may be weakened or washed out.
-Report and avoid downed power lines: Stay at least 25 feet away for your safety.
-If your home is flooded: Turn off all utilities and disconnect electrical equipment.
