Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation updating Michigan's school safety drill requirements to ensure students are better prepared in times of emergency.
"This legislation will help give parents peace of mind in knowing their children and school officials are trained and prepared for possible school emergencies," Snyder said.
House Bill 4713, sponsored by state Rep. Joe Graves, updates the types of drills schools must conduct and requires school districts to post documentation of completed safety drills on their websites within 30 days of completion. The detailed reports must remain online for at least three years.
The bill also makes changes to the types and frequency of required safety drills. Schools must:
Conduct five fire safety drills spaced throughout a school year, with three before Dec. 1;
Hold two tornado safety drills, including one in March, and
Stage three "lockdown" drills, which prepare for possible school intruders. One of the three drills must be conducted during a lunch-recess period.
Additionally, the chief administrator of a K-12 school must provide a list of scheduled drill days to the county emergency management coordinator by Sept. 15. Schools must also adopt and implement a cardiac emergency response plan.
