Gov. Rick Snyder: We Are All Grieving With Dallas
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: July 8, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

"My heart is with the Dallas Police Department, the Dallas Area Rapid Transit police, and the communities they serve. Sue and I are offering up prayers for the victims of this senseless tragedy, their colleagues and their families. People sign up to be police officers to protect and to serve the public. This attack on the men and women who work to keep us safe was an attack on all of us, and we are all joining in their sorrow.
"I was notified today that one of the fallen officers in Dallas is a Michigan native who previously worked in law enforcement in Southeast Michigan. We didn't need this tragedy to be brought home to feel its impact, but still it hurts more this way.
"I cannot imagine what went through the minds of law enforcement officers across the nation this morning as they woke up to prepare for work. I want them to know that Michigan stands with each of them who bravely reported for duty today to continue protecting and serving in the wake of this tragedy.
"To the families and colleagues of the officers killed in Dallas, we grieve with you. We will always be grateful for your sacrifice. We will not forget."
