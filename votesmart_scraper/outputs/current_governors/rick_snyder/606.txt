Snyder Applauds Continued Progress on Road Funding Solutions
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 8, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding today's House passage of a proposed road funding initiative:
"The House has taken an important and welcomed step in addressing the deteriorating condition of Michigan's roads. Modern, well-maintained roads are essential to Michigan's economy and quality of life. Further neglect will only cost taxpayers more in the long run and deter economic investment across the state.
"The House package reflects a serious commitment to tackling this issue. It continues the critical dialogue as we work together to reach the ultimate solution that includes a stable, sufficient, long-term funding source. I commend Speaker Jase Bolger and his colleagues for their work on this initiative and for being responsive to the concerns expressed statewide by motorists and job providers. It's important to keep this momentum alive and the efforts of our House partners do just that."
