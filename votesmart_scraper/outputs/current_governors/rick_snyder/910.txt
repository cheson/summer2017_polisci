Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation allowing taxpayers to donate through their income tax return to Special Olympics Michigan.
House Bill 4632 and Senate Bill 381, sponsored by state Rep. Kevin Cotter and state Sen. Rick Jones, create a tax checkoff to benefit the Special Olympics. The events are funded entirely through donations and offer children and adults with intellectual disabilities the opportunity for sports, competition and socialization.
"The Special Olympics allow more than 20,000 Michigan athletes to compete in 23 different sports at no cost to them or their families," Snyder said. "I am pleased this legislation will allow generous Michiganders to donate to this worthy cause."
The bills now are Public Acts 154 and 155 of 2012.
The governor also signed two other bills.
H.B. 4653, sponsored by state Rep. Anthony Forlini, prohibits the names of elected and appointed officials from any material temporarily appearing in a polling place on Election Day. Candidates currently cannot display campaign material within 100 feet of a polling location, and including lawmakers' welcome signs and the like in this ban upholds the spirit of fair voting space. The bill now is P.A. 156.
H.B. 5119, sponsored by state Rep. Rick Outman, helps clerks find enough elections inspectors to assist with elections by removing the residency requirement. Instead of only being able to serve in their county or municipality, inspectors will be qualified throughout Michigan. This also helps clerks in primarily Republican or Democratic districts find a balance in the partisan makeup of inspectors. The bill now is P.A. 157.
