Statement

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement after the state House and Senate approved a comprehensive plan to address Michigan's infrastructure challenges.
"The state House and Senate today approved a fiscally responsible, comprehensive transportation plan that provides a long-term solution with new revenue that also provides long-term tax relief. This is the largest investment in Michigan roads and bridges in more than half a century, making them safer for Michiganders long into the future.
"I commend my partners in the Legislature for their resolve and their willingness to compromise. These are difficult decisions. If left unaddressed, our infrastructure problems would have grown more expensive to fix, there would have been greater damage to our vehicles and, more importantly, more drivers left to face unsafe conditions.
"The plan approved today includes new revenue generated by people and businesses using the roads -- including non-residents. It helps with public transportation that is vital for many to get to work and school. And it's good for our economy, strengthening the network of local, state and federal roads that is vital for all of our job-creators. It also allows us to continue investing in our core priorities that help Michiganders and fuel our state's comeback.
"This plan also shows people around the country and around the world that Michiganders face our toughest problems and solve them. Preserving our roads and bridges has been a priority, and is another important step we've taken to make our state a better place to live and work."
