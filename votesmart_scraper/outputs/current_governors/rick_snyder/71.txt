Governor Rick Snyder presented his Criminal Justice Special Message, citing the importance of addressing root causes of criminal behavior and preparing prisoners for reentry into their communities.
We know that most criminals who go to prison will be released one day after they complete their sentence. Governor Snyder believes that we can create a safer, stronger Michigan if when offenders return to their communities, they earn a job and become productive members of society-- instead of turning back to a life of crime.
"We have to do better at preparing these individuals for life outside those walls so they can return to their communities as productive members of society," Governor Snyder said.
Let there be no doubt: Protecting the public is the primary purpose of our criminal justice system. Safety and security are essential to a strong economy and a free society. Our system can protect public safety by deterring crime and separate dangerous individuals from society at large. But if we focus on crime and punishment alone, we ignore the opportunity to help break the cycle of crime that plagues too many communities.
Preparing prisoners for reentry into society, addressing the root causes of criminal begavior and improving the juvenile justice system are all part of creating a safer Michigan.
There are important steps we can take to help victims, prevent crimes before they occur, and provide better outcomes for Michigan.
