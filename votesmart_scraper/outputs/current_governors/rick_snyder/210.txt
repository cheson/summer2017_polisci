Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: March 29, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

All Detroit Public Schools will have the funding to remain open through the end of the current school year, after Gov. Rick Snyder today signed a bill to fund operating costs and teacher salaries through June 30. The governor also signed legislation expanding the role of the Financial Review Commission that works with the city of Detroit on its finances to include the school district as well.
"There was a pressing need in Detroit that lawmakers from all across the state came together to address, and they got it done quickly," Snyder said. "This continues to demonstrate that the challenges at DPS aren't just Detroit's problem, they are concerns for all of Michigan. We are committed to academic improvement and long-term financial stability at DPS."
"Judge Rhodes and Interim Superintendent Alycia Meriweather, who both have come in during a challenging time, did a good job identifying and conveying the needs of the district, both financial and educational. They continue to work with us on finding long-term solutions that will serve everyone well --students, their families and educators."
House Bill 5385, authored by state Rep. Earl Poleski, expands the authority of the Michigan Financial Review Commission to include education districts. It would not apply to a district that is under the oversight of an Emergency Manager. If the FRC is extended to a district, the superintendent and school board chairman would become members of the commission. The bill is now Public Act 53 of 2016.
HB 5296, authored by state Rep. Al Pscholka, provides $48.7 million to Detroit Public Schools for the current fiscal year. It is now Public Act 54.
