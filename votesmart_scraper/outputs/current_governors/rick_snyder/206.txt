New Flint Water Resource Distribution Sites to Open in Wards 1, 3 and 6
Statement

Location: Flint, MI

Flint residents will have improved access to clean water resources as new distribution sites are established in city neighborhoods to provide bottled water, filters and testing kits.
There will be nine new water distribution sites total -- one in each ward of the city. The additional six locations are slated to open within the next month. The fire station distribution centers will eventually close to restore normal operations for the firefighters stationed there.
"Adding new water distribution sites will make it easier for people to get clean water and filters closer to where they live within the city," Gov. Rick Snyder said. "The Flint Fire Department deserves a big thank you for all the work it has done to assist with this crisis by providing distribution sites. These locations were never intended to be a long-term solution and it's time to move our operations to new sites."
Mayor Weaver said: "This change addresses some of the needs for residents that we've been asking for. We know it has been more difficult for some citizens to get the bottled water and filters being provided, because they aren't able to get to the fire stations themselves and need it delivered. With these new sites opening in various neighborhoods, we hope it allows more residents to get these essential water supplies. We also know Flint residents need jobs. This addresses that as well, and more jobs and training for residents will be coming soon as the Flint WaterWorks initiative gets underway."
