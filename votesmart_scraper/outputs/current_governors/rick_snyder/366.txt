Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the Windsor Detroit Bridge Authority issued a request for qualifications for the Gordie Howe International Bridge project.
The request is the first stage in the procurement process to select the private sector partner to complete the design and construction of the project, with a goal of finishing the bridge in late 2020.
"Progress on the Gordie Howe International Bridge continues, and today's announcement is a major step in the process. This is a historic project that will continue Detroit's revitalization, strengthen the economy of Michigan and the region while creating thousands of jobs.
"The span will be a transformational part of Michigan's infrastructure, but also will serve as a symbol of the economic and cultural connection with our neighbors in Canada. The bridge will build upon the already tremendous trade relationship between our countries, expanding opportunities in Michigan and beyond."
