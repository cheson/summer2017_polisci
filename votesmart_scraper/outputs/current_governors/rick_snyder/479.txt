Gov. Rick Snyder today signed Executive Order 2015-1, dissolving the Michigan Long-Term Care Supports and Services (LTCSS) Advisory Commission, which was formed as a forum for the discussion of issues relating to the provision of long-term care supports and services in Michigan.
Established in 2005, the LTCSS Advisory Commission was tasked with providing a series of recommendations to improve Michigan's long-term care system. Last year it provided 13 recommendations to the governor, completing its charge.
"I thank the commission for providing thoughtful and focused recommendations that provide a clear direction for improving care for Michigan's residents. We look forward to continuing our work to put people above programs," said Gov. Snyder.
The commission's recommendations call for an elimination of duplicate services across the state, which will allow the government, nonprofit, and the private sector to better serve people in need. The Michigan Office of Services to the Aging will be responsible for coordinating efforts to implement the commission's recommendations, and create a system more responsive to the needs of Michigan's residents.
"After having time to review all of the work that the commission has done since it began, it was clear that our work was finished," said LTCSS Advisory Commission Chair Reginald Carter. "I want to thank all of the commission members, both past and present, for their outstanding work and commitment to making Michigan's long-term care system more person-centered."
