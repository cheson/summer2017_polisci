Location: Lansing, MI

The Michigan National Guard Tuition Assistance Fund can now distribute money to both the National Guard member or his or her academic institution under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Those who serve to defend and protect our state deserve the ability to also reach their academic goals," Snyder said. "This bill gives greater flexibility to the National Guard Tuition Assistance Fund in order to provide tuition assistance to those who bravely serve their state and nation."
HB 6013, sponsored by state Rep. Bruce Rendon, amends current law to give the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs more discretion as to whether National Guard Tuition Assistance Fund money is distributed to the individual person or the academic institution. It is now Public Act 531 of 2016.
Gov. Snyder also signed 13 additional bills:
Senate Bills 754-755, 763, and 765-766, sponsored by state Sens. Phil Pavlov, Marty Knollenberg, Wayne Schmidt, Dale Zorn and Goeff Hansen, respectively, save money for school districts across Michigan by removing unnecessary reporting requirements for local schools. The measures are now Public Acts 532--533, 534 and 535-536 of 2016.
SBs 756-757, 759-762, 764 and 767, sponsored by state Sens. Darwin Booher, Jim Stamas, Ken Horn, Peter MacGregor, Mike Shirkey and Margaret O'Brien, respectively, help make state statutes more consistent by removing a number of obsolete education-related laws. The measures are now Public Acts 537 --538, 539-542, 543 and 544 of 2016.
