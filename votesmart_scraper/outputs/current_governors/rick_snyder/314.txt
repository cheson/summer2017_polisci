Gov. Rick Snyder: International Company Arauco to Build Manufacturing Facility in Grayling Township
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Oct. 27, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

About 250 jobs will be created when a new facility manufacturing particleboard is built on a 600-acre Grayling Township site, bringing a major boost to the north-central Michigan regional economy while diversifying the state's multi-billion-dollar forest products industry.
Arauco -- a maker of a range of composite panels, premium plywood and lumber -- will invest $325 million and create a projected 250 jobs upon completion of a particleboard manufacturing plant by the end of 2018. Construction on the site is expected to begin by spring of 2016. Arauco obtains all wood fiber supplies from sustainably-managed forests or post-industrial sources, and does not use wood from native forests in their products.
"This is great news for northern Michigan, in terms of job expansion and new growth in the skilled trades," Gov. Rick Snyder said. "Arauco's presence in Michigan will be a significant contribution to the state's forestry product industry, and have a positive impact on the economy throughout Crawford County."
