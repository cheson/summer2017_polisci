Parents who do not require their children to attend school could see a drop in their cash assistance benefits if interventions from the state and school authorities fail, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Much like the Pathways to Potential program, this legislation brings together parents, schools and the state to determine obstacles that keep students from being in school and how to overcome them," Snyder said. "To break the cycle of poverty, kids need an education to position them for future success. We have to do everything we can to see that they are regularly attending school."
House Bill 4041, sponsored by state Rep. Al Pscholka and approved with bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, codifies existing Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) practice, which is to include school attendance as an eligibility factor in cash assistance benefits. Under the measure, DHHS will have to meet with the family to identify barriers that result in truancy before any discontinuation of benefits, and will reinstate benefits if the student meets 21 days of regular attendance. It is now PA 56 of 2015.
The new law builds on the Pathways to Potential program, which puts caseworkers in schools across the state to identify obstacles to success in school and reduce truancy.
