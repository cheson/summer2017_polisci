Gov. Rick Snyder Issues Statement on Michigan's Existing Energy Emergency
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 13, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement on Michigan's existing energy emergency.
"Due to the recent closure of the Westshore Pipeline, the federal government has granted a request to extend the energy emergency in Michigan until July 13," Snyder said. "The extension ensures gas stations are able to continue to meet the needs of Michiganders."
The federal waiver extends the energy emergency in Michigan by waiving the hours-of-service requirements for motor carriers and drivers transporting fuels. This allows these individuals to exceed the number of hours and consecutive days in which they can operate a commercial motor vehicle in Michigan and any other state they must drive through to get needed supplies.
The initial emergency declaration, Executive Order 2016-10, was issued May 24, 2016 following the shutdown of a fuel pipeline in Wisconsin. An extension was issued under EO 2016-12 on June 3, 2016.
