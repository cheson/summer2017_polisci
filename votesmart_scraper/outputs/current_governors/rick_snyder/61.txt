Immigration reform will help Michigan's economy grow stronger and to create more jobs for our state.
Governor Snyder has called for immigration reform in order to help Michigan's economy grow stronger and to create more jobs for our state.
Immigrants with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) are powerful job creators. In fact, research shows that "an additional 100 foreign-born workers in STEM fields with advanced degrees from US universities is associated with an additional 262 jobs among U.S. natives."
"We need to focus on legal immigration and make sure people know Michigan is the most welcoming place, and I'm intent on moving forward with that," Governor Snyder said in his 2014 State of the State Address.
Creation of the Office for New Americans
Governor Snyder established the Office for New Americans to attract global talent to our state and promote the skills, energy, and entrepreneurial spirit of our immigrant communities.
The Michigan Office for New Americans will coordinate the state's efforts to welcome immigrants and their entrepreneurship; lead efforts to encourage foreign students getting advanced degrees to stay in Michigan, build companies here, and employ Michiganders; and ensure that needed agricultural and tourism workers come to our state.
