Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement after an 11-bill package addressing the state's contribution to a proposed settlement that would protect pensioners and keep the city on its path toward revitalization was approved in the state House of Representatives today.
"Today we saw lawmakers from across our state coming together to help make a brighter future for Detroit -- and all of Michigan. I thank state House of Representative members for their bipartisan work on a settlement that will help Detroit pensioners and ultimately save taxpayers millions of dollars. This is a thoughtful plan that provides key safeguards protecting Michigan's taxpayers while helping resolve Detroit's long-standing challenges.
"I especially appreciate the leadership of Speaker Jase Bolger, House Democratic Leader Tim Greimel, Rep. John Walsh , and Rep. Thomas Stallworth III. I'm looking forward to consideration of the package in our state Senate.
"This settlement will allow us to more quickly resolve the bankruptcy issues, and create a solid, sustainable fiscal foundation to support Detroit's continuing turnaround. This is essential for the city's 700,000 residents, who are seeing improved vital services and quality of life. But these efforts are about helping all of our state. Detroit is an important part of Michigan's identity. Let the city's resurgence show the world that Michiganders are standing together and growing stronger as we accelerate our continuing comeback."
