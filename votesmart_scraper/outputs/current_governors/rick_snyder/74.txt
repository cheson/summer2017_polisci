"A Michigan police officer who responded to a call for help last night is today fighting for his life. Sue and I send our thoughts and prayers to Wayne State University K9 Officer Collin Rose, his family and his colleagues. When people dial 911, it's because they are afraid and in need of assistance. Officer Rose is one of those brave individuals who will answer that call without hesitation. We should all be thankful that such dedication exists throughout Michigan's law enforcement agencies. Our police officers need our support and appreciation. This recent wave of violence against those sworn to protect and serve must end. Let's hope Officer Rose can make a full recovery and let's never forget the sacrifice he has made in service to his state."
