Gov. Rick Snyder today urged propane customers in Michigan to get their tanks filled before the heating season starts.
"Last winter was one we'll all remember," Snyder said. "This is especially true for some propane customers who found it challenging to find additional propane as cold temperatures lingered. That's why now is the time to get an early fill, lock-in prices ahead of the heating season and get on a budget payment plan, if available."
Snyder announced that various state agencies are ready to assist propane customers, should the upcoming winter put a squeeze on propane supplies again.
"To marshal every state resource, I have directed multiple state agencies to continue working together to protect the health and safety of Michigan residents as we approach the heating season," he said.
Heating Assistance
The Michigan Energy Assistance Program, administered by the Michigan Department of Human Services, offers assistance to low-income utility customers, including propane customers. Residents in need of heating assistance with deliverable fuels are asked to call 2-1-1 or visit Michigan.gov/heatingassistance for help.
