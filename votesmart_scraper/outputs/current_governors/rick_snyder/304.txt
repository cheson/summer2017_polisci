Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement in honor of Veterans Day.
"Serving our nation is a noble and selfless decision. Today, we honor those courageous individuals who have defended and continue to defend our nation in the Armed Forces, remembering the sacrifices they and their families have made to protect our freedoms.
"We will never forget those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice.
"Today, over 660,000 veterans choose to call Michigan home, and we are working hard to fulfill our obligations to these brave men and women. The state of Michigan is making it easier for veterans to transition from military life to civilian life, providing them improved access to the resources they need for success.
