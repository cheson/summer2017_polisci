Individuals with an out-of-state commercial driver's permit can now be tested in Michigan to obtain a commercial driver license under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"These bills help make Michigan more competitive in attracting residents from across the country by allowing those with an out-of-state commercial driver's permit to receive testing to obtain a commercial driver license in our state," Snyder said.
House Bills 5656-5657, sponsored by state Rep. Marilyn Lane and the late state Rep. Peter Pettalia, establishes a pilot program for individuals who hold non-Michigan commercial driver permits to receive commercial driver license testing if they have trained at a Department of State-approved school. The measures are now Public Acts 321 and 322 of 2016.
Snyder also signed four additional bills:
House Bill 4047, sponsored by state Rep. Joel Johnson, names a portion of highway M-18 in Gladwin County between northern Beaverton and southern Gladwin as the "Veterans Memorial Highway". It is now PA 323 of 2016.
HB 4588, sponsored by state Rep. Kurt Heise, permits a private college security officer, under certain circumstances, to have the same authority and power as a police officer in order to enforce state and local laws. It is now PA 324 of 2016.
HB 4911, sponsored by state Rep. Kathy Crawford, helps streamline the process for direct placement adoptions in regards to birth parents seeking to relinquish their parental rights. It allows a court, in lieu of a mother's live testimony, to accept an affidavit or a verified written statement from the mother as evidence of the identity and location of the child's father. It is now PA 325 of 2016.
