Michigan is more business friendly than ever and eager to build upon the state's many longstanding productive relationships with Japanese businesses, Gov. Rick Snyder said today in remarks at the 2013 Midwest U.S.-Japan Association Conference.
"We are reinventing Michigan through bold reforms and moving forward with a new economic certainty that is very attractive to investors and businesses making new location and investment decisions," Snyder said. "We have come to open new doors for trade and business between our state and Japan. We see many great opportunities ahead for all of us to do more business together."
Snyder delivered his remarks at the opening session of the conference in Tokyo, attended by Midwestern U.S. governors and Japanese officials and business leaders.
Snyder also highlighted the significance of Michigan's presence in the global economy and encouraged foreign businesspeople to consider investing here.
"With more than 1,000 divisions, affiliates and subsidiaries of overseas-based companies, Michigan offers a launching pad for global companies in any business," he said. "Michigan and the Japan-based companies doing business in our state have enjoyed long and mutually beneficial relationships, and we look forward to continuing to partner with you as our reinvention continues."
Also during the conference, Snyder reaffirmed the sister state agreement with Gov. Yukiko Kada of Shiga Prefecture, Japan, further strengthening the partnership for education, business development and tourism.
