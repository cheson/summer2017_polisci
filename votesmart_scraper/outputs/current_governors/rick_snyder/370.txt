Gov. Rick Snyder today ordered U.S. flags within the state Capitol complex and on all state buildings to be lowered to half-staff on Thursday, July 9, in honor of Senior Chief Petty Officer Jason P. May, of Chesterfield.

May, 38, served in the Navy for 18 years before he died of non-combat related causes, Monday, June 29, while aboard the USS Essex.

"On behalf of all Michiganders, my thoughts and condolences go out to Jason's loved ones," said Snyder. "We are thankful for his nearly two decades of service to our country and in defense of our freedom."

The Essex, an amphibious assault ship, was deployed at sea as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

Visitation will be on Wednesday, July 8 from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Lee-Ellena Funeral Home in Macomb. The funeral service will take place the following day at 11 a.m.

This flag order is in accordance with Executive Order 2013-10. Michigan residents, businesses, schools, local governments and other organizations also are encouraged to display the flag at half-staff. Flags should be returned to full-staff on Friday, July 10.

When flown at half-staff or half-mast, the U.S. flag should be hoisted first to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff or half-mast position. The flag should again be raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day.
