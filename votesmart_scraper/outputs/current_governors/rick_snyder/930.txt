Gov. Rick Snyder has signed legislation to exclude from the definition of public employee those who receive a government subsidy for private employment.
Senate Bill 1018, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Hildenbrand, amends the Public Employment Relations Act to reflect the original intention of the Legislature. It now is Public Act 76.
"Those employed by private individuals cannot become public employees simply by receiving government dollars," Snyder said. "I am pleased this bill will return the interpretation of the law to its initial intent."
The need for the law was underscored by a 2005 Michigan Quality Community Care Council vote that recognized a labor organization as the bargaining representative of Home Help Services workers, who are funded through the Department of Community Health but employed by individuals.
