Gov. Rick Snyder: Robert Griffin's Life was Devoted to Public Service
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 17, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement after the passing of Robert Griffin, who represented Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate and served as a justice on the Michigan Supreme Court.
"Robert Griffin's life was devoted to public service. After serving in the U.S. Army, he went to Washington, D.C. to work on behalf of our state and its residents in both the House and Senate for more than 20 years. A low-key but highly effective leader, he later served eight years as a justice on the Michigan Supreme Court.
"But not quite as high profile was his mentoring of many young attorneys who looked to him for advice, grooming the next generations of leaders in Michigan and beyond.
"Sue and I extend our condolences to the entire Griffin family."
