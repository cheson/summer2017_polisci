Gov. Snyder: Honor Patriot Day and Remember Those We Lost
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Sept. 11, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement:
"Twelve years ago, terrorists struck our nation. Today we join our fellow Americans in remembering those who were lost on September 11, we pray for the victims and their families, and we carry on the spirit that Patriot Day stands for -- the spirit that is at the core of our country.
"It is a spirit of heroism and bravery, sacrifice and generosity, compassion and kindness.
"We saw that spirit in the firefighters and rescue workers who charged into the World Trade Center. We see it carried on today in our armed forces who defend our freedoms around the world, and here at home in the first responders who put their lives on the line on behalf of their neighbors.
"And that's what Patriot Day is all about --- remembering those who perished on 9/11, while also honoring their memory by carrying on in service to each other.
"Today, the State of Michigan will lower its flags to half-staff in honor of Patriot Day and the victims of 9/11. I ask you to join in by doing the same at your home or workplace. As the flags are lowered, let's hold our heads up high -- remembering those we have lost, and resolving to live their spirit in all we do."
