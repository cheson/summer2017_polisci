Statement

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for July fell to 5.3 percent -- which also is the national average. This is the lowest monthly rate since August 2001.
"The hard work we've done together in Michigan to boost our economy and create more and better jobs continues to pay off. While it's important to recognize how far we've come, we must never lose sight of where we want to be. We can be proud that more than 420,000 private sector jobs and opportunities for Michiganders have been created since the end of 2010, but we must not be satisfied. We can, and will, continue to grow and thrive.
"Our challenge is to build upon our successes. We are focused on improving education so all of our students -- children and adults -- have the opportunity to succeed and graduate with the skills that will allow them to reach their goals. We can help every person reach their potential through the River of Opportunity. And we can continue to be the place where employers want to grow or locate, and where people want to live. We will continue looking forward, with momentum, so that Michigan's success can continue long in to the future."
