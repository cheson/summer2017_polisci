Governor: Michigan is 'Getting it Right, Getting it Done' as Reinvention Continues
Press Release

Michigan's economy is moving in the right direction and 2012 must be devoted to continuing the state's reinvention by taking care of unfinished business, addressing other critical challenges and emphasizing good government, Gov. Rick Snyder said in his second State of the State address.
The governor presented an optimistic but realistic assessment of Michigan's condition. While numerous indicators underscore Michigan's economic progress, the state clearly has more work to do on various fronts.
"We made large strides to make Michigan great again," Snyder said. "Michiganders came together and worked with relentless positive action to deliver the meaningful change that is getting our state back on its feet. Thanks to the leadership of our legislative partners, we've taken bold but thoughtful action to do what's right for Michigan. We're getting it right and getting it done. But this is no time to let up. Job One is still jobs. Ensuring bright, prosperous futures for working families and their children demands a steadfast commitment to Michigan's reinvention."
The foundation for economic success was laid by getting the state's fiscal house in order and through policy reforms such as the elimination of the job-killing Michigan Business Tax.
As promised in last year's address, Snyder reviewed key measures of the Michigan Dashboard at www.michigan.gov/MiDashboard.
Michigan's unemployment rate fell from 11.1 percent in December 2010 to 9.3 percent in December 2011, bringing it to the lowest rate since October 2008. Michigan also added nearly 80,000 private-sector jobs last year and these jobs are higher paying than the national average.
