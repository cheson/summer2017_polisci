Gov. Rick Snyder made the following statement today with regards to the state House's approval of $30 million to provide relief for a portion of Flint residents' water and sewer bills going back to April 2014:
"Flint residents should not have to pay for water they cannot drink. I have continually said that the crisis will be solved by everyone coming together with solutions, and I would like to thank the Legislature for being a strong partner on getting immediate funding for recovery to the city," Snyder said. "Politicizing this issue has not yet delivered any solutions for Flint's families, but with passage of today's $30 million, Michigan lawmakers have helped to aid Flint residents with nearly $70 million in state funding in the past four months. The Legislature's continuing support demonstrates the positive results that come from putting people above politics."
