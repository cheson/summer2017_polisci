Additional communities will have the opportunity to establish need-based scholarship programs for local students following designation as a Michigan Promise Zone under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"This common-sense reform could provide Michigan students in financially distressed communities with the financial resources to pursue a college education," Snyder said. "This public-private partnership model not only helps students and families, it ultimately makes our communities economically stronger by attracting residents to those areas."
Senate Bills 539 and 540, sponsored by state Sens. Goeff Hansen and Jim Ananich, respectively, create a process to dissolve an existing Promise Zone, if necessary, while establishing a new zone in its place. The bills clarify that a dissolved zone would not count toward the limit of 10 zones allowed under existing law. The bill also creates additional reporting requirements for current zones, including the number of students receiving financial aid, and the graduation rates of students.
