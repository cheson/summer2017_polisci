More business owners will be able to obtain conditional liquor licenses, providing them with the ability to more quickly launch and operate their establishments under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"This bill helps remove some barriers for Michigan employers by expanding opportunities for them to obtain conditional licenses in order to get businesses up and running faster," Snyder said.
Senate Bill 981, sponsored by state Sen. Wayne Schmidt, expands the eligibility of liquor license applicants to obtain a conditional license to operate their business. The measure is now Public Act 315 of 2016.
SB 903, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Casperson, modifies the requirements for agreement by mineral owners and producers before an operator can request approval of a plan for joint operation of multiple wells in an oil or gas reservoir. The measure is now PA 316.
House Bill 5572, sponsored by State Rep. Mike McCready, amends the Motor Fuel Tax Act to permit certain alternative fuel commercial users to calculate the fuel tax due on Compressed Natural Gas based on a revised equivalent. The measure is now PA 317.
