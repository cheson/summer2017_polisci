Gov. Rick Snyder, in Beijing, China today, joined with Chinese Ministry of Commerce Vice Minister Zhong Shan in a pledge to strengthen cooperation and expand economic activity between Michigan and China in hopes of boosting trade and investment, and creating more and better jobs.
As part of his fifth trade mission to China, Snyder and Shan presided over the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Michigan and representatives of four of China's provinces and one of its major cities. The four provinces -- Guangdong, Sichuan, Hubei and Zhejiang -- and city of Chongqing have combined populations of nearly 195 million people, or more than 19 times that of Michigan.
Michigan is one of only five of states and cities to have reached agreement with five major industrial regions of China. The agreement aims to strengthen friendly contacts between Michigan and each province or city. It enables the jurisdictions to increase cooperation and carry out exchanges in industry and agriculture, economic activities and trade, science and technology, culture and education, sports and health, travel and tourism, and other fields.
"Today's memorandum of understanding is an important accomplishment and we will see its value in coming years," Snyder said. "We can take pride in our state's legacy as one of the first in the nation to formalize relations with China. We build upon that with today's agreement and mutual commitment to continue our friendship and further promote the economic and cultural development of the state of Michigan and these regions of China."
To further enhance relationships between China and Michigan, Snyder also met with Yang Jiechi, State Councilor of China, and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship Foreign Countries Chairwoman Li Xiaolin.
