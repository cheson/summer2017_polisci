Momentum continues to build as more Main Street businesses show support for Rick's 10-point plan to Reinvent Michigan
Rick Snyder today snagged another big-name endorsement in his campaign for governor, this time from the Michigan Retailers Association. Rick welcomed the endorsement, which he said reflects the support his 10-point plan to Reinvent Michigan is receiving from small businesses across the state.
The endorsement comes less than a week after the Chamber of Commerce endorsed Rick's 10-point plan to Reinvent Michigan, and shortly after the Small Business Association of Michigan voiced its support.
"We need to make Michigan a more inviting place to do business, so that we can create more and better jobs for everyone," Snyder said. "This endorsement is another sign that Main Street businesses recognize the need for fresh leadership in Lansing and are committed to helping make that happen."
The Michigan Retailers Association is the nation's largest state trade association of general merchandise retailers. It has nearly 5,000 members who operate more than 12,000 stores across the state.
Although Rick welcomed the Michigan Retailers Association endorsement, he again vowed to not accept political donations from any special interest group.
