Gov. Rick Snyder Promotes Michigan Opportunities to Japanese Auto Industry Leaders
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Sept. 11, 2015
Location: Toyota City, Japan

Gov. Rick Snyder told leaders from Japanese auto companies that Michigan is -- and will continue to be -- the global leader in the automotive industry and is an ideal place for companies to invest and grow.
Snyder and a delegation from Michigan met with leaders from three leading Japanese companies with Michigan ties -- Toyota, DENSO and Aisin -- talking about the state's growing skilled workforce and economic comeback.
Snyder toured Ecoful Town, a model future city that harnesses the latest advances in mobility, environmental considerations, safety and convenience that is located in Toyota City.
"The automobile industry was born in Michigan and we're working to ensure that our state will always be the leader in this dynamic and essential field," Snyder said. "It's been said that vehicles will change more in the next decade than in the last 100 years, and Michigan will be at the center of these changes. Toyota and its sister companies will play a vital role in these innovative changes, and it is fascinating already to see the vision of the city of tomorrow."
