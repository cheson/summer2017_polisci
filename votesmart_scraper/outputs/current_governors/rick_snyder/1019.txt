Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Aug. 9, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement on the death of Focus: HOPE co-founder Eleanor Josaitis:
"Eleanor Josaitis was an inspiring woman whose spirit and determination helped transform a city. Eleanor and Father William Cunningham founded Focus: HOPE at a time when the city of Detroit was in turmoil and their words and their deeds brought out the best in anyone who knew them or was associated with them.
"She was a tireless and devoted leader who served the entire state of Michigan by bringing people together to solve problems and providing opportunities for those who had none. Her compassion and resolve live on through the work of Focus: HOPE and the countless men, women and children whose lives were forever changed for the better because of her. My sympathies go out to her family and friends and the Focus: HOPE family."
