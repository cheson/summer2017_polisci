By: Rick Snyder
Date: Jan. 28, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued a proclamation calling for an extension to the emergency declaration in the city of Flint and Genesee County.
"The emergency response in the city of Flint has been critical to ensure every Flint family has access to bottled water, filters, and testing kits. While these efforts have a big impact in the short term, there is still much more work to be done.
"Extending this emergency will help us continue these efforts while working on long-term solutions to help Flint recover from this tragedy."
The Michigan House and Senate approved the request today, extending the emergency until April 14, 2016. The extension coincides with the current Presidential Emergency Declaration.
