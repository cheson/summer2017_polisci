Gov. Rick Snyder today issued a statement in observance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
"We celebrate and recognize Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, an important time to remember one of the outstanding leaders in American history.
"Dr. King inspired us to help those in need, to respond when we saw injustice, and to speak up against all forms of discrimination. He fought for justice and opportunity for every American. He demonstrated the value of peace, honesty, freedom, equality, and community service. Still to this day, Dr. King's vision of a more perfect union encourages and guides us in addressing the challenges of our communities.
"We come together as Michiganders to honor Dr. King's dream of a better world, where every person is treated with the respect and dignity that they deserve."
