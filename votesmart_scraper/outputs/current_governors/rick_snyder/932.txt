Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 9, 2012
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding the Detroit City Council's approval of a proposed consent agreement:
"The council has acted responsibly to put Detroit on the path to financial stability. Approval of the consent agreement is a positive opportunity for the city and our entire state. It's a clear message that we will move forward - and win - as one Michigan. We all want Detroit to succeed. This agreement paves the way for a good-faith partnership that will restore the fiscal integrity taxpayers expect and ensure the delivery of services that families deserve.
"While the council's action is a positive step, there's no doubt that much work remains. The magnitude of the city's financial challenges means that many difficult decisions lie ahead. We must build on this spirit of cooperation and be willing to act in the city's long-term interests.
"I appreciate the countless hours that Mayor Dave Bing and his staff, the City Council, the Financial Review Team, state Treasurer Andy Dillon and the rest of my team have devoted to achieving this agreement. Because of their tireless work, Detroit is poised to move toward being a great city again with improved services for its citizens and a foundation for future growth."
