Gov. Rick Snyder today offered the following statement after the Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference:
"Friday's Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference confirmed that the economic experts forecast a bright future for our state and the steps we have taken to grow our economy are working. Our actions, combined with the hardworking and entrepreneurial spirit of Michiganders, companies and communities across the state, have created an economic climate that is fostering more and better jobs. Because of that, Michigan is well positioned and stronger as we move forward.
"The conference also reflects challenging news that tax credit promises, made largely in the past, will create shortfalls in both the current budget as well as the upcoming 2016 fiscal year budget. These budget shortfalls will be addressed and we remain committed to investing strategically to build upon the firm financial foundation and ensure our comeback continues.
"Upon taking office in 2011, we moved away from these types of tax credits due to their uncertain impact in future years. We replaced them with an incentive system that has much greater transparency and predictability. Unfortunately, we are still addressing problems from past practices."
