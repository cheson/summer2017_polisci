Governor Rick Snyder today issued the following statement following the death of former First Lady Nancy Reagan:
"Today the state of Michigan mourns the death of former First Lady Nancy Reagan, a well-respected, devoted leader who used her role as First Lady to advocate for those less fortunate in our country. To this day, her "Just Say No' campaign impacts the way this country talks about the dangers of drug abuse.
Nancy's determination to helping those in need will always be an inspiration to us all. Sue and I extend our heartfelt condolences to those grieving for Nancy, and we keep them in our thoughts and prayers."
