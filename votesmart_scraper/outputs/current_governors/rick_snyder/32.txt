Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: March 22, 2017
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's workforce rose by a net 23,000 in February. From February 2016 to February 2017, total employment increased in Michigan by 1.8 percent while the state's workforce rose by 2.2 percent, in comparison to the national growth rates of 1 and 0.7 percent, respectively.
"Michiganders continue to be encouraged by our state's reinvented economy. Even as we saw a slight increase in Michigan's jobless rate, it's attributed to more workers entering Michigan's job market at rates faster than the national average, which shows people have more faith in finding a job here."
"Our job creators have added nearly 500,000 private-sector jobs over the past six years and there are nearly 97,000 jobs currently available in Michigan on www.mitalent.org. I'm confident our growth will continue as industries significantly add jobs in Michigan and we work to ensure we have the best training for workers available anywhere."
