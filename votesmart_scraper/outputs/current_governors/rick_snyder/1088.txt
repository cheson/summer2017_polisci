Snyder will meet Bernero on statewide debate hosted by the Center for Michigan
Rick Snyder today said he has agreed to meet his opponent at a traditional debate hosted by the Center for Michigan. The debate will take place at 7 p.m. on Oct. 10 in Wixom, and will be made available to television stations around the state. Snyder and his opponent agreed to the debate during a one-on-one meeting held in Lansing.
"I look forward to talking about my positive vision for Michigan future and debating my opponent on the issues that are truly important to Michiganders," Snyder said. "This debate format will give voters across the state a chance to listen to each candidate live on the same stage, answering the same questions."
The Center for Michigan will host the hour-long debate. Nolan Finley, editorial page editor of the Detroit News will serve as one of the panelists along with Stephen Henderson or Ron Dzwonkowski, editorial page editor and associate editor, respectively, of the Detroit Free Press. The format will allow for opening and closing statements by the candidates and questions chosen and posed by the panelists. Candidates will each have a set amount of time to answer questions and for rebuttal.
In addition to the traditional debate, Snyder will continue talk directly with voters during his Reinvent Michigan Town Hall tour, of which he's held 59. He will also speak and take questions at the Detroit Economic Club's Candidate Forum on Oct. 7 and is working with other television and radio stations interested in broadcasting his town halls meetings.
