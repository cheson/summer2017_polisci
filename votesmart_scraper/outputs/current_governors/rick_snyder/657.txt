Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the Obama administration announced the American Lightweight Materials Manufacturing Innovation Institute (ALMMII) was selected as one of three new manufacturing innovation institutes to be announced this year.
"Today's American Lightweight Materials Manufacturing Innovation Institute announcement further affirms Michigan as the comeback state. That Michigan was selected serves as a testament to the great manufacturers, universities and workers who make our state the global leader of innovation. Michigan has led the nation in manufacturing job growth and we are the place to be for automotive manufacturing and research and development with 75 percent of the entire industry's R&D happening right here in our state. More than 60 of the top 100 auto suppliers are already located in Michigan, and the institute will be able to draw from one of the largest concentrations of educated and highly-skilled manufacturing talent in the world.
"Simply put, Michigan is perfectly positioned to help drive the new technologies and materials that will revolutionize the transportation industry for decades to come. We are proud to be part of this collaborative effort with our industry, university and local, regional and federal partners to help attract new investment and more and better jobs."
