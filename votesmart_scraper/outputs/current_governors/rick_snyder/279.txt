Gov. Rick Snyder: Additional Powers Should Be Returned to Flint's Mayor
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Jan. 15, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder offered the following statement supporting a request to return more executive powers to the mayor of Flint.
"We've been working closely with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver as we address the challenges facing the city. The Flint city charter establishes a mayor-centric form of government. Flint is headed by the mayor who serves as the city's chief executive and the City Council, serving as the city's legislative body. The city currently is in receivership, and the city administrator is responsible and accountable for the day-to-day city operations.
"Mayor Weaver has requested that the powers and authority currently vested in the city administrator be transferred to the mayor. I agree with her, and have asked the Receivership Transition Advisory Board to support that resolution.
"Flint is in financial distress and will remain in receivership until I am convinced that the city is on strong financial standing. Both the RTAB and the state will support Mayor Weaver and her team to navigate the financial challenges ahead."
