Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Nov. 5, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today, announced the addition of Homer A. Mandoka, chairperson of the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi to the Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board.
Executive Order 2015-14, rescinds and reissues Executive Order 2015-12 which originally created the Pipeline Safety Advisory Board in September. The update accounts for the addition of a board member representing an elected official of a tribal government located in Michigan that is eligible to receive services from the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs.
"Michigan's tribal governments play a vital role in the preservation of our state's world-class resources," Snyder said. "I am confident Chairman Mandoka's passion and work ethic will be an asset to the board and I thank him for his willingness to help ensure our lakes, streams and rivers are protected for years to come."
