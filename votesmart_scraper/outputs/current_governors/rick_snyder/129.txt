Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding the announcement today by federal officials that filtered Flint water is safe for everyone, including pregnant women and children under 6:
"This good news shows the progress we are making with overall water quality improving in Flint but also proves further that the filters provided by the state to alleviate risks to Flint residents are very effective.
"I drank filtered water from Flint for over a month; President Obama drank filtered Flint water and encouraged others to do so. People using filtered water instead of bottled water can relieve a significant burden on themselves because they don't have to deal with transporting and storing it. By using filters, they also are helping to move more water through the system, which independent experts say is necessary to continue improving water quality.
"We have worked closely with our partners at all levels of government to restore the water in Flint and help the people of Flint recover from this crisis. The people of Flint deserve a lot of credit, as well, because many of them helped with the water system recovery by participating in the flushing program.
"By continuing to work together, we can move Flint forward with good water and a healthy outlook for its future."
