A federal program designed to track at large suspects who have injured or killed a police officer will be created in Michigan, under bipartisan legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Public safety is of utmost importance in Michigan, and law enforcement is on the front lines every day protecting us," Snyder said. "The Michigan Blue Alert Act ensures there will be a plan in place to broadcast essential information to the public if an officer is harmed, when every moment is critical in apprehending a suspect."
