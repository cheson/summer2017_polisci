Gov. Rick Snyder Vetoes Bills That Could Have Exposed Domestic Abuse Victims to Violence, Intimidation

Gov. Rick Snyder today vetoed two bills that would substantially change the state's process for issuing a license to carry a concealed pistol, saying the measures include some reforms he supports, but include changes that might inadvertently increase the risk of violence and intimidation faced by domestic abuse victims who seek court protection.
Snyder said there are a number of reforms in Senate Bills 789 and 790 that he supports, and said he wants to work with the Legislature on new bills that could make the necessary changes without putting domestic abuse victims at risk.
"We simply can't and won't take the chance of exposing domestic abuse victims to additional violence or intimidation," Snyder said. "There are certainly some reforms that can improve the way Michigan issues concealed pistol licenses and we support the rights of law-abiding firearm owners, but it's crucial that we leave in place protections for people who already have endured challenges and abuse."
The bills, sponsored by state Sen. Mike Green, would have eliminated the 83-county level boards for issuing concealed pistol licenses. The Michigan State Police and county clerks would have assumed administrative functions.
Snyder, in his veto letter, said he was concerned by the fact that SB 789 would have allowed a person who is the subject of a personal protection order to obtain a concealed pistol license. Under current law, no person who is subject to such an order may obtain such a license. The bill would have amended the restriction, preventing the issuance only if the prohibition was specifically spelled out by the court.
