Michigan Leaders Support Gov. Snyder's Immigration Plan
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Jan. 17, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder announced in his fourth State of the State address a bold vision for attracting global talent to bring more and better jobs to Michigan, and a growing group of more than 30 educational leaders, elected officials, business leaders, nonprofit groups and other community leaders offered their support for the governor's plan.
"Making Michigan even more welcoming to immigrants with advanced academic degrees or entrepreneurial aspirations will not only provide them with great opportunities to grow," Snyder said. "It will also benefit Michigan by bringing their countless skills, talents and contributions to help create more and better jobs in our state."
Snyder said he will issue an executive order to create the Michigan Office for New Americans, which will drive strategies for attracting immigrants to Michigan. Snyder also urged Congress to approve Michigan's application to become only the second state with a state-sponsored EB-5 visa regional center. The EB-5 is a tool for attracting investment and creating jobs for U.S. workers.
