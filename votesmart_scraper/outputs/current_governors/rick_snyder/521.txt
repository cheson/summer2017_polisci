Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation allowing Michigan police officers and firefighters to receive full wages and benefits when agreed upon during contract negotiations.
House Bill 5097, sponsored by state Rep. John Walsh, gives police officers and firefighters the opportunity to negotiate to receive retroactive pay and benefits for time worked in between contracts. Under the legislation retroactive wages and benefits would reflect new contract terms. This technical fix aligns all areas of the Michigan Public Employment Relations Act.
"Police officers and firefighters risk their lives daily to protect citizens across our state. This legislation helps ensure these first responders continue to receive full compensation regardless of the status of their contract," Snyder said.
The bill is now Public Act 322 of 2014.
Snyder also signed HB 4624, sponsored by state Rep. Joe Haveman, which allows public fire department employees to work on a volunteer, part-time or on-call basis at another fire department as long as the extra employment does not conflict with their full-time position as a firefighter. The legislation adds firefighting to the list of suitable part-time or volunteer positions allowed for firefighters within their collective bargaining agreements. It is now PA 323.
