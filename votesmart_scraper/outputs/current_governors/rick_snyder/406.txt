Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 2, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

The U.S. Geological Survey today confirmed that a 4.2 magnitude earthquake affected the state of Michigan 5 miles south of Galesburg at 12:23 p.m.
At this time, there are no reported injuries or damages. Individuals who have damages from the earthquake are encouraged to report them to local emergency management officials.
"It's rare for Michigan to experience earthquakes, but as we were reminded today, it does happen," Gov. Rick Snyder said. "There are no immediate reports of injuries or damage because of today's earthquake, and that's fortunate because we are acutely aware of the challenges posed by such natural disasters in other parts of the world recently. The Michigan State Police is ready to assist in any emergency that strikes our state."
The state -- via the Michigan State Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division continues -- continues to closely monitor the situation and stands ready to assist Michiganders and local communities as needed.
