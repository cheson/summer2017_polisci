Gov. Rick Snyder on Wednesday will continue a series of informational meetings on the urgent need for the state Senate to act on the proposed Healthy Michigan plan. The plan would expand health care coverage for nearly half-a-million Michigan residents while encouraging healthier lifestyles that reduce health care costs.

Called "A Conversation with the Governor," the meetings are being conducted with various audiences across the state. Wednesday's meetings begin at Pennock Hospital in Hastings. The governor plans to talk with area physicians and business leaders about the benefits of the proposal for small, rural hospitals. Later Wednesday Snyder will visit the Family Health Center in Battle Creek. Other sessions will be announced as they are finalized.

"The Healthy Michigan plan is vital to the health of our families and the economic success of our state," Snyder said. "The state has too many uninsured people. Michigan hospitals face $820 million a year in uncompensated costs. As a result, individuals and businesses pay higher health care premiums. This legislation would help control medical costs, even as it improves the state's economy and business climate. The time is past for the Michigan Senate to act on this compassionate, cost-saving bill. Senators should take a vote, not a vacation."

The state is projected to save $206 million in the 2014 fiscal year by providing Healthy Michigan plan benefits to those now receiving services paid for with general fund dollars.

The legislation, House Bill 4714, has been approved by the Michigan House with bipartisan support. The Michigan Senate adjourned last week without taking action on the legislation.
