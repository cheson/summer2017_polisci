Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 3, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement on Senate approval of the state's contribution to a proposed settlement to mitigate cuts to Detroit retiree pensions and keep the city on its path toward revitalization:
"People around the world know of our largest city's proud past as well as the struggles of its difficult but necessary bankruptcy. May this proposed settlement now cast Detroit forever as an example of a community and a state pulling together and making tough decisions to create a brighter future.
"Today we saw lawmakers from across the state stepping up to approve legislation that helps Detroiters -- and all Michiganders. This settlement plan will allow Detroit to build a solid fiscal foundation for its continuing comeback. The bipartisan package shows the commitment of our partners in the Legislature to assist Detroit pensioners, ultimately save taxpayers millions of dollars and improve the quality of life for the city's 700,000 residents.
"Many people worked hard to make this happen. I appreciate the efforts of Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville, Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer, House Speaker Jase Bolger, Democratic Leader Tim Greimel, state Rep. John Walsh and state Rep. Thomas Stallworth III, as well as Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones and Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr. I also thank U.S. District Judge Gerald Rosen and the mediation team for guiding the mediation process."
