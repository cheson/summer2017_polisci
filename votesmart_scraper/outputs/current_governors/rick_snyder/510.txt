Statement

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement regarding the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision on same-sex marriage:
"When I became governor, I took an oath to support and defend our state constitution, without exceptions. My obligation to carry out that oath is not a matter of personal preference. As I have said throughout this process, I will respect the court's decision as it examines the legality of same-sex marriage.
"The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the language in our state's constitution. This means there is no change in Michigan's marriage laws. As I have previously stated, the same-sex couples who married at county clerk offices in the period between U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman's ruling in March and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' temporary stay of that ruling, were legally married.
"However, the Court of Appeals decision does not allow for state benefits of marriage for those same-sex couples in accordance with our state constitution. That decision only can be changed if today's Appeals Court ruling is overturned."
