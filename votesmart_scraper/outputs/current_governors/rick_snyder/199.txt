Location: Lansing, MI

The city of Flint and Genesee County will remain under a state declaration of emergency for up to the next four months, after the state Legislature today approved an extension requested by Gov. Rick Snyder. The state and federal declarations are now in effect until August 14.
"The approval of the emergency extension further demonstrates the state is committed to continue working with the city to provide strong support and continue drawing on all resources available to support Flint residents during the city's recovery," Gov. Snyder said.
Extension of the state's emergency declaration until August 14 coincides with the federal emergency declaration extension and enables federal, state and local partners to continue coordinated efforts for using all available resources for the people of Flint.
The state House and Senate both approved the Governor's extension request today by approval of a concurrent resolution. The existing declaration was set to expire April 14.
Prior to the Jan. 5 state declaration of emergency, the state authorized $9.3 million for the city of Flint to connect back to Detroit water as well as provided faucet filters and blood lead level testing for residents and public awareness of state-funded resources available. Since the declaration, the state has already committed nearly $67 million in state funding to help the people of Flint and the Governor has proposed a total of $230 million in state funds to continue moving Flint forward.
