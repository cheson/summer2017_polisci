Gov. Snyder: 'Sales Tax on the Difference' Brings Tax Relief in Vehicle Sales, Boosts Economy
By: Rick Snyder

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder released the following statement after state House and Senate approved bills affecting sales tax on vehicle purchases.
"Sales tax on the difference' will bring needed relief to hard-working taxpayers while boosting Michigan's economy and maintaining the state's fiscal responsibility.
"This solution replaces an outdated system of having consumers being unfairly taxed twice. This change -- passed with strong bipartisan support -- brings Michigan in line with the vast majority of states. It's another example of how we can make Michigan's tax structure fairer while fueling our continued comeback. Money saved by Michiganders will make getting a new car more affordable for many people, including those who need a vehicle of their own to get or keep a job.
"This plan strikes a smart, fiscally responsible balance. The amount saved would be phased in gradually, offering families some immediate tax relief while spreading out the impact on the state budget."
