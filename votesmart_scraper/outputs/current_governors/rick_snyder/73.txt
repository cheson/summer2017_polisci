Governor Rick Snyder understood that for Michigan to be a great state once again, Detroit had to become a great city once again. In June 2013, he decided that enough was enough. Because of decades of neglect and mismanagement, the city faced a nearly unsolvable financial hole.
Working with private organizations, foundations, and the public sector, Governor Snyder forged a bipartisan coalition called the 'Grand Bargain' to reduce cuts to retiree pensions and ensure city services were maintained. Today, Detroit is on the path to recovery, and that's why we call it America's Comeback City.
