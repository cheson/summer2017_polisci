Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 7, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Signatures on petitions seeking to amend the Constitution or initiate legislation will no longer be valid if made more than 180 days before the petition was filed with the Secretary of State, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Establishing reasonable time limits on when signatures can be collected helps ensure the issues that make the ballot are the ones that matter most to Michiganders," Snyder said.
Senate Bill 776, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Robertson, establishes a 180-day deadline for collection of petition signatures for initiated legislation or constitutional amendments. The bill codifies what has been the existing practice for 30 years. It is now Public Act 142 of 2016.
Snyder also signed four additional bills:
Senate Bill 458, sponsored by state Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker, closes a loophole in current statute that will enable a custodial parent and their spouse to adopt the child under custody more quickly if the non-custodial, biological parent does not meet certain conditions currently in statute. It is now PA 143.
SB 606, sponsored by state Sen. Mike Shirkey, clarifies that a homeowner may retain their principal residence exemption if they are deployed on active military duty, so long as the owner establishes intent to return to the property. It is now PA 144.
SB 738, sponsored by state Sen. Darwin Booher, provides additional transparency to the public by requiring an executive summary on unfunded liabilities be included in the state retirement systems report. It is now PA 145.
SB 818, sponsored by state Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker, will exempt yoga teacher training from existing state licensure requirements for trade or vocational schools. It is now PA 146.
