Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding the capture of Michael David Elliot by Indiana law enforcement. Elliot, who is serving a life sentence for multiple murders, escaped from the Ionia Correctional Facility on Sunday.
"The swift apprehension of this dangerous criminal is a credit to law enforcement and corrections officials in Michigan and Indiana, and our partners with the U.S. Marshals Service. Their courage, diligence and professionalism reminds us how fortunate we are to have such men and women who are willing to keep our communities safe.
"This collaborative operation transcended state boundaries. It was teamwork at its finest and we all appreciate that it resulted in the capture of this dangerous escapee. I especially want to recognize the men and women of our neighbor Indiana's law enforcement community for bringing this fugitive into custody. It was a job well done.
"Now that we are assured the public is safe, we will turn our attention to thoroughly reviewing the situation that led to the prisoner's escape. We will demand an exhaustive assessment of the incident and take whatever appropriate action is needed to prevent future incidents."
