Residents of Michigan who contact their county treasurer's office to obtain property tax information will no longer have to pay exorbitant fees for those records, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Any Michigan resident who wants to obtain property tax information should be able to do so, easily and without high cost," Snyder said. "This new law ensures real estate transactions will be affordable and transparent statewide."
House Bill 4075, sponsored by state Rep. Bruce Rendon, caps the amount county treasurers can charge for an electronic copy of a record at 25 cents per record, and caps the total at $1,500.
The legislation updates a state statute that hasn't been revised in 120 years and was the result of a workgroup that convened to bring fairness and uniformity to property tax dissemination in all 83 Michigan counties.
