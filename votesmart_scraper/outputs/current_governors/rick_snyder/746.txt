Snyder: After 50 years, Dr. King's 'I Have a Dream' Speech Continues to Inspire Michiganders
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Aug. 28, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech:
"It was Dr. King's dream, but it was also a challenge. He called on Americans to embrace our Founding Fathers' concept that we are created equal and said we should be judged by the content of our character and not by the color of our skin.
"Dr. King recited his "I Have a Dream' speech at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial 50 years ago today, but his words still echo in our hearts and minds in Michigan today.
"Inspired by Dr. King's words, we have come far during the last 50 years. And we have more work to do. Let us pause to reflect on Dr. King's dream, and continue striving for peace, justice and equality here in Michigan and beyond."
The Michigan Department of Civil Rights coordinated the state's participation in "Let Freedom Ring!" a national commemoration of the address, delivered as part of the 1963 March on Washington.
