Governor Signs Legislation Transferring Geological Mapping Responsibilities to WMU
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Oct. 11, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation transferring geological mapping responsibilities to Western Michigan University.
Senate Bill 507, sponsored by state Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker, transfers geological mapping and evaluation duties to WMU from the Department of Environmental Quality. WMU has frequently covered the state's share of matching funds needed to receive federal dollars for the program.
"This is a great example of government cooperation, and I want to thank university officials for working with the state to make this happen," Snyder said. "In addition to enhancing WMU's academic program, this change will also save taxpayers money. It's win-win."
S.B. 507 is now P.A. 167 of 2011.
The governor today also signed legislation that eliminates the state's 1.8 percent tax on alcohol that is sold for off-premise consumption, such as beer or wine sold at a supermarket. This change is being made so retail stores can stay competitive with restaurants that cater off-premise events using their own supply of alcohol, which is not subject to the 1.8 percent tax. S.B. 331, sponsored by state Sen. Joe Hune, is now P.A. 166 of 2011.
