Statement

Location: Lansing, MI

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder today made the following statement regarding the weekend shooting in Arizona:
"I would like to offer my support and prayers for Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, the other victims of the horrific shooting in Arizona and their families.
"The senseless, despicable act of violence that our nation witnessed over the weekend tears at the very fabric of our democracy. But, as we all know, Americans rally together in the face of tragedy and adversity. Our spirit will not be broken. We will emerge from this horrible incident stronger and more committed than ever to move our nation forward. As the president requested, Michigan will demonstrate its respect for the victims by flying all U.S. flags at half-staff through Friday.
"I will call Arizona Governor Jan Brewer later today to share these sentiments and to let her know that the people of Michigan are praying for the rapid recovery of Congresswoman Giffords and the other victims.
"I know the hearts of every Michigander are with the Congresswoman, the victims, their families and the people of Arizona."
