Flint residents will be hired to assist with water testing under a new partnership forged Friday between the state and Flint human service groups, Gov. Rick Snyder announced today.
The partnership with Orchards Children's Services and Flint YMCA's Safe Places Program will help hire and train 50 residents this month to fill jobs on teams helping conduct water tests across the city.
"The people of Flint deserve timely action on emergency efforts to help the city move toward recovery," Snyder said. "We realize our water testing teams need more manpower to get the job done. There is no one better suited to help the city bounce back than Flint residents themselves and we appreciate Orchards Children's Services and the YMCA for helping connect Flint talent with this important positions."
Snyder said this hiring is part of a larger and ongoing effort to ensure Flint residents benefit from opportunities created by relief efforts in response to the water crisis.
"Orchards Children's Services and the YMCA are committed to serving children and families in Flint as we have done long before this crisis and will do long after," said Michael Williams, president of Orchards Children's Services. "The solution to this situation should involve the people of Flint and that is why we are partnering with the state to strengthen our community for the future."
