Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Sept. 25, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the actions by the Detroit City Council and Mayor Mike Duggan facilitating the orderly transition of responsibilities from the emergency manager.
"Detroit continues to move forward. Today's transition of responsibilities is a reflection of the continuing cooperation between the state and its largest city. Leaders are working together for the best interests of Detroit and all of Michigan. Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr's expertise and counsel to the mayor and City Council are vital in guiding the city toward a successful conclusion of the bankruptcy process.
"Together, we have confronted problems that have lingered for decades. There have been difficult decisions and sacrifices. Hard work is still ahead of us. We remain focused on improving the quality of life for all residents and building a strong and sustainable financial foundation for the city. Better days are ahead for Detroit -- and all of Michigan -- as a result of this work and the collaboration that I know will continue."
