Year-round schools and early childhood education both can help Michigan students get the best education possible, and both are getting a boost from the supplemental school aid bill Gov. Rick Snyder signed recently.
HouseBill4295providesstateschoolaidsupplementalappropriationsforfiscalyear2014, which runs until October.
The bill covers a variety of measures affecting education, including an investment that helps high-achieving low-income students take Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, which helps them prepare for college.
The bill also provides assistance for school districts that took on students when another district was dissolved.
"We know that a solid public school education is an essential part of Michigan's continuing comeback," Snyder said. "Studies show low-income students may lose as much as three grades of reading comprehension due to the traditional summer break. I want to support innovative districts voluntarily looking to move to the balanced calendar to help students build a strong educational foundation for a lifetime of learning."
Gov. Snyder called for the year-round school pilot as part of his fiscal year 2015 budget. The supplemental law moves funding ahead to fiscal year 2014 so that districts can prepare over the summer and offer the new calendar in time for the next school year.
