Snyder Signs Bills to Standardize School Board Elections, Save Districts Money
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation that will save school districts millions of dollars by standardizing school board election dates.
Senate Bill 427, sponsored by state Sen. Patrick Colbeck, and House Bill 4005, sponsored by state Rep. Kurt Heise, require school districts to hold elections during the general elections in November of even-numbered years beginning Jan. 1. Estimates show this move could save some school districts upward of $8 million over a two-year election cycle.
"Utilizing a standard election cycle will cut administrative costs and help schools maintain focus on educating students," Snyder said. "This change also allows for more consolidated elections so voters have the best opportunity to make their voices heard."
Since 2004, districts have had the option of conducting school board elections during the odd-year general election, the odd-year May regular election, the November regular election in even and odd years, or the May regular election in even and odd years.
The bills now are Public Acts 232 and 233 of 2011.
