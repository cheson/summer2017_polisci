Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation boosting Michigan's economy and helping local businesses by requiring shoppers to pay sales tax when purchasing items online from websites with a physical presence in the state.
"This Main Street Fairness legislation levels the playing field for local businesses, helping Michigan job providers better compete with online retailers," Snyder said. "Local, brick-and-mortar businesses drive our economy and without implementing this fix, they will continue to serve as showrooms for online retailers."
Senate Bills 658 and 659, sponsored by state Sen. Jim Ananich, makes Michigan's tax code more fair and efficient by allowing the state to collect sales tax for purchases made through online retailers that have a physical presence in Michigan. This legislation, which has been enacted in 22 other states, is expected to bring in an additional $60 million in Fiscal Year 2016. The bills help to reduce the competitive disadvantage brick- and-mortar retailers face against online competitors; however federal action is needed to completely solve this issue. The bills are now Public Acts 553 and 554 of 2014.
