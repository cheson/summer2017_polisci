Gov. Rick Snyder Vetoes Senate Bill 363, Directing the Deq to Review Fee Schedule for Residential Harbors
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today vetoed Senate Bill 363, which would have reduced permit fees for noncommercial residential harbors on the Great Lakes but negatively impacted the state's ability to process permits in a timely manner.
"The bill's broad application of lower fees to large multi-resident noncommercial harbors does not generate adequate revenue for the DEQ to process permits appropriately," Snyder said. "I look forward to working with the DEQ and Sen. Casperson to focus on the original problem the legislation was intended to solve -- more affordable fees for single family harbors."
In his official veto letter, Gov. Snyder indicated his support of the efforts Sen. Tom Casperson's legislation sought to address and directs the DEQ to review its fee schedule and offer recommendations on appropriate changes.
