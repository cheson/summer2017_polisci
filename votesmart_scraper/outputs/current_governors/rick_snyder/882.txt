Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Lt. Gov. Brian Calley today signed House Bill 4723, making it illegal for prisoners to receive Bridge Cards.
"Preventing prisoners from receiving Bridge Cards is a common-sense way to reduce fraud, save taxpayer dollars, and help ensure assistance is given to those who are truly in need," Calley said.
In addition, the measure requires the termination of Bridge Card access to incarcerated individuals who had previously been issued one. The state Department of Human Services must also perform a monthly incarceration match to help determine Bridge Card eligibility. The law codifies policies already in place within the department.
HB 4723, sponsored by state Rep. Bob Genetski, is now Public Act 281 of 2012.
Calley also signed Senate Bill 582, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Casperson.
SB 582 eliminates the current maximum number of axles on trailers more than 50 feet in length, and allows vehicles designed and used to haul boats from manufacturers to be 75 feet long rather than the previous 65 feet. Weight limits have not changed. The bill is now PA 282 of 2012.
Article V, Section 26 of the Michigan Constitution gives authority to the lieutenant governor when the governor is outside the state.
