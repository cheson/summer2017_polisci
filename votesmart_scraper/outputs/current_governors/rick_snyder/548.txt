Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement in honor of Patriot Day and calls for the lowering of U.S. flags in remembrance of those lost on September 11:
"Thirteen years ago, our country awoke to the tragedy of 9/11.
On Patriot Day, we remember the lives lost in the terrorist attacks and the sacrifices made. And we keep the innocent victims and their families in our thoughts and our prayers.
On September 11, 2001, and in the days that followed, our country saw selflessness and compassion, acts of heroism and generosity. First responders led the charge, as did ordinary men and women. They put their lives on the line for their fellow Americans, and that spirit lives on today.
We're thankful for the first responders who walk in their footsteps. They serve all of us, each and every day. We're grateful, too, for the men and women in the armed forces who have paid the ultimate price for freedom, those serving today, and our brave veterans. Thank you for your service.
The State of Michigan lowers its flags to half-staff in honor of Patriot Day and the victims of 9/11. I hope you join in doing the same as we remember together."
