Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement regarding last night's shootings in Kalamazoo:
"The victims and their families -- and the entire Kalamazoo area -- should be in everyone's thoughts today. Members of the community and law enforcement officers from the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety, Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department, Kalamazoo Valley Community College and Michigan State Police who quickly came together are to be commended for their cooperation and swift response. Their actions resulted in the suspect being caught before he was able to harm anyone else through these senseless and apparently random acts of violence."
