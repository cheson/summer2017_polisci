Statement

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement in observance of Veterans Day:
"Michigan is proud to be the home of nearly 700,000 veterans. As we observe Veterans Day, let us reflect on their sacrifices as well as those of our men and women currently in uniform.
"Just as they bravely fulfilled their duties to us, we must meet our obligations to them. It is a commitment that we take seriously and are stepping up. Agencies across the state, including the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and the Veterans' Services Division of the Michigan Workforce Development Agency, are working hard to ensure that our veterans' transition to civilian life is as smooth as possible and that they have resources and opportunities to successfully access programs and compete in the job market.
"Our veterans are wonderful role models, not only for their military service but also for their contributions to our communities upon their return. While we can never fully repay our debt to them, let us make sure they know how much we appreciate their service to Michigan and America. I ask all Michiganders to join me in thanking our veterans for ensuring the liberties and quality of life that we enjoy."
