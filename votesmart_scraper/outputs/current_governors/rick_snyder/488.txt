Gov. Rick Snyder is taking executive action to continue Michigan's climb as a national leader in talent development and investment in skilled trades.
Through an executive order, Michigan is leveraging its ability to build talent with in-demand skills while helping state businesses grow and thrive by putting job creation and economic development efforts under one new department.
Snyder on Thursday announced an executive order creating the Department of Talent and Economic Development and the Michigan Talent Investment Agency, as well as a restructuring that includes several state departments.
"One of my top priorities has been to make Michigan a national leader in talent development by focusing on workforce training for the jobs of today and tomorrow," Snyder said.
"That effort will require a comprehensive, unified approach to best help Michiganders while working to retain and attract businesses to create more and better jobs. Our state has made great strides. Now is the time to keep moving forward, taking the next steps to ensure Michigan's resurgence will continue long into the future."
Under the executive order, the Michigan State Housing and Development Authority will be under the new department, along with the Michigan Strategic Fund and any associated programs. The executive order authorizes the director of the Talent and Economic Development Department to become the MEDC CEO if the MEDC executive committee makes that determination.
