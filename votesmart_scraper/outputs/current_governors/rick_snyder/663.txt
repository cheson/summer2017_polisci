Gov. Rick Snyder today signed a package of bills prohibiting convicted felons from possessing ammunition until certain conditions are met.
House Bill 4715, sponsored by state. Rep. Kurt Heise, prohibits convicted felons from possessing ammunition under any circumstances until three to five years after they have paid all fines, served their full term of imprisonment and successfully completed probation or parole. Ammunition is defined as any projectile that in its current state can be expelled from a firearm. The bill is now Public Act 4 of 2014.
"Closing this loophole in our state firearm laws is a common-sense adjustment that creates consistency, simplifies sentencing and ultimately benefits public safety," Snyder said.
