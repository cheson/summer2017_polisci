Gov. Rick Snyder has proclaimed a moment of silence tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. to honor the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn.
Snyder is honoring the request made by Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy to governors nationwide.

"Last week's unthinkable tragedy in Newtown has left a mark of sadness in the heart of every American," said Snyder. "My thoughts and prayers continue to go out to the parents, families, friends and community members forever affected by this horrible event."

The moment of silence will take place one week after the senseless tragedy in which 20 students and six educators died. Gov. Snyder and Gov. Malloy have also asked places of worship and government buildings, which have the ability, to ring bells 26 times during this moment to honor each of the lives lost.
