Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement on the statewide release of Michigan Educational Achievement Program scores on Friday:
"It's encouraging to see academic improvements in our state, especially in reading. That's key, because this vital subject is the foundation for mastering many other subjects and lifelong learning.
"We know we have more to do, which is why I've committed to continue to strategically invest in in education so Michigan students are prepared for colleges and careers.
"Our P-20 approach is bolstered with an increase in early childhood education, so our youngest learners are ready for kindergarten and beyond. We're working on more effective evaluations so our hard-working teachers and administrators get the help they need. We've strengthened the high school and college connection, especially with regard to the STEM fields that will lead students to careers in in-demand fields.
"We are in the early stages of the Education Achievement Authority, but already there is progress.
"The EAA is for schools in our state that, for years, were struggling the most. The authority's innovative and holistic approach focuses on bringing back on track children who had fallen far behind grade-level work with tailored learning and programs helping address the root causes for their academic struggles.
"Overall, 38.2 percent of the EAA students tested on the MEAP made progress toward or beyond proficiency in reading, and 21.4 percent improved in math.
"The results show we are making solid progress, but by no means are where we want or need to be. We have more work to do as we help our most-challenged children and all Michigan's students".
