Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 5, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement reflecting on recent reports from the Michigan Venture Capital Association and MiQuest, a nonprofit affiliated with the Small Business Association of Michigan, showing that Michigan's entrepreneurial environment has dramatically improved.
"Innovation and entrepreneurism are important elements of Michigan's continuing comeback. We should be proud of the progress we've made in creating the environment for people and companies to be creative, look to the future and take advantage of the tremendous opportunities our state has to offer.
"It's important to remember that some of the Michigan-based brands known around the world started with someone's idea to try something different, bigger or better. That Pure Michigan spirit continues to thrive today. Our entrepreneurs are job-creators, reflected in the quarter million private sector jobs created here since the end of 2010. We need to continue nurturing this vision so Michigan can continue to grow and thrive -- and lead."
