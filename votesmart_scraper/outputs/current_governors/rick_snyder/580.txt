Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Bills to Support Breast-Feeding Mothers
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation to prevent discrimination against breast-feeding mothers.
"Breast-feeding is a natural act with many proven benefits," Snyder said. "By supporting new mothers we help ensure good infant health, reduce infant mortality rates and prevent obesity."
Senate Bill 674, sponsored by state Sen. Rebekah Warren, establishes the Breastfeeding Antidiscrimination Act. The act ensures that women have the right to breast-feed in a public place. The bill will help ensure breast-feeding mothers do not face discrimination and are allowed full and equal enjoyment of a public accommodation or service while breast-feeding.
House Bills 5591 and 5592, sponsored by state Rep. Amanda Price, specify that a mother breast-feeding in a public place is not guilty of indecent exposure or obscene conduct. The bill aligns Michigan with the laws of 27 other states.
The bills are now Public Acts 197-199 of 2014, respectively.
