The Rick for Michigan campaign continues to build momentum as it takes its positive message of Reinventing Michigan to voters across the state
Rick Snyder today welcomed the endorsement of the Small Business Association of Michigan, saying he is honored to be supported by the voice of Main Street. SBAM represents more than 10,000 small businesses across the state.
"We need to give small businesses the support they need so they can grow and create jobs and help our communities thrive. Unfortunately, what we've had for the past eight years is a government that often seems like it goes out of the way to stop small businesses from growing," Snyder said. "I've got a 10-point plan to Reinvent Michigan and once again make our state a leader of innovation and job creation."
Rick has been sharing his 10-point plan to Reinvent Michigan at town hall meetings across the state -- he's held 53 so far. At the town hall meetings, Rick talks directly with voters and answers their questions about how to transform Michigan's economy and create more and better Michigan jobs. Rick's 10-point plan to Reinvent Michigan is also available online at www.rickformichigan.com.
Rick has a proven record as a job creator, turning small startups into success stories and running a Fortune 500 company. He also helped found Ann Arbor SPARK, which is one of the most successful community-based economic development programs in the country.
Although Snyder welcomed the SBAM endorsement, he renewed his pledge to not accept PAC money or contributions from special interests.
