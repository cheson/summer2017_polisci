Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: March 5, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for January fell to 7.8 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in Michigan since May 2008.
"Since day one we've worked relentlessly to bring more and better jobs to Michigan, and today's announcement is further evidence that we are the comeback state. Gone are the days when Michigan was known for joblessness, low incomes and population loss. In fact, our economic recovery has gone farther and faster than most every other state. We've added more than 255,000 private sector jobs since December of 2010. We are tied for No. 1 among Great Lakes states and seventh in the nation for per-capita personal income growth. People are staying in Michigan and our labor force is growing. Michigan is now the place to be.
"While this is great, positive news for Michiganders, we cannot simply sit back and enjoy the headlines. We have come a long way in three years, but the reinvention of Michigan is not complete. What we have accomplished are building blocks for future success and we aren't going to stop. The comeback continues."
