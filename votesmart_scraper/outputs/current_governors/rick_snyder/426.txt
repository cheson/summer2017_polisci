Gov. Rick Snyder Orders Flags Lowered to Half-Staff on Monday to Honor Service of Fallen Marines
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

U.S. and Michigan flags at the state Capitol and all state buildings will be lowered to half-staff on Monday, March 30, 2015, to honor the service and sacrifice of Marines killed during a training exercise earlier this month, including three from Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder said.
Snyder said the helicopter crash that claimed the lives of the Marines, including Staff Sergeants Marcus Bawol of Warren, Trevor Blaylock of Lake Orion and Andrew Seif of Holland, is a tragic loss for our country and our state.
"The crash is a reminder that the men and women serving our country make tremendous sacrifices and put themselves in harm's way every day to keep us safe and protect our freedoms," Snyder said. "We join their families and communities in mourning their loss and also recognizing with pride their bravery and dedication to our country. They are, unquestionably, heroes."
The Marines were killed in a crash off the Florida coast on March 10, with their funerals or memorials services held on different dates.
Snyder said he wants to review long-standing flag protocols to determine if there should be changes. Existing flag protocols were developed with input from the Michigan Department of Military Affairs and call for flags to be lowered across the state when members of the armed forces are lost in combat.
