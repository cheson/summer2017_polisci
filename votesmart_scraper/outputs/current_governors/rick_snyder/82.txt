Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Nov. 11, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

"We need to come together to celebrate the democracy that so many have fought and died for to defend and promote. I have said that Michigan will be the model in showing Washington, D.C. how to come together, work together, and move forward together. That must be more than just about policies. Michiganders are a welcoming people. So let us now show Washington, the nation, and the world how Michiganders can be civil, forthright and just in promoting the ideals on which this country was founded.
"We must not just tolerate an exchange of ideas and differences of opinion, but embrace them. And we must embrace our neighbors as we work together to solve the many issues facing the state and this nation. Any differences - be they in race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality - should not be seen as pillars that divide us but rather as building blocks upon which we can all construct a stronger state and nation together."
