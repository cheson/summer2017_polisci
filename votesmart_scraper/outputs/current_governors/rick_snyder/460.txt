Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for December fell four-tenths of a percent to 6.3 percent. The rate is the lowest in the state since November 2002.
"The continuing drop in Michigan's unemployment rate is both an affirmation and a call to action. Finishing the year with the lowest unemployment rate in more than 12 years shows we are on the right path as our economy is growing stronger with an environment that is creating more and better jobs. The number of unemployed people in our state dipped below 300,000 for the first time since October 2001. That's good news.
"But we also know that we can and will do better. During Tuesday's State of the State address, I discussed how we can do more to help our residents reach their potential. We are changing the way we deliver services, focusing on people and their needs. We also know that companies struggle to fill some jobs because they can't find people with the right skills. Businesses grow and thrive where they can tap a skilled workforce. Our aim is for Michigan to become a leader in the skilled trades, ensuring that our economic success and quality of life will continue to improve long into the future."
