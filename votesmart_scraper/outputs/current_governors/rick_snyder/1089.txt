The Michigan Association of REALTORS® today endorsed Rick Snyder for governor.
"The housing market won't fully rebound until our economy is running strong, so it's important we elect the candidate who is completely focused on the economy and has a proven record of creating jobs," said Michigan Association of REALTORS® PAC chairman Jeff Thornton. "Rick also firmly believes in keeping property taxes affordable. If you are a homeowner or one day want to own a home, vote for Rick Snyder."
Snyder said he welcomed the REALTORS'® support and said fixing the economy is the key to restoring property values.
"A strong housing market is essential to reinventing Michigan," Snyder said. "Eliminating the MBT and removing regulatory burdens will help businesses create more and better jobs, and that will strengthen Michigan's housing market."
