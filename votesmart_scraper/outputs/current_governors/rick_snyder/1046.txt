Governor Signs Legislation Ensuring Retired Police Officers, Firefighters Have Voice on Detroit Pension Board
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 10, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation that ensures retired Detroit police officers and firefighters will have representation on the city's pension board, in accordance with the city charter.
The bill is the first piece of legislation sponsored by a Democrat lawmaker Snyder has signed into law.
"I am committed to working with lawmakers from both parties to reinvent the state," Snyder said. "Making this change to state law so that retired Detroit police officers and firefighters have a say in how their retirement system is administered will make sure the concerns of retirees are taken into account. I want to thank state Rep. Fred Durhal for his leadership on this issue."
The City of Detroit adopted a new city charter in 1996 requiring a retired member of the police or fire department to serve on the Detroit Police and Firefighters Retirement Board of Trustees, but legal challenges have prevented a member from being added. House Bill 4135, sponsored by state Rep. Fred Durhal, modifies the Public Employment Relations Act so that if the charter of a city with a population of more than 500,000 requires a retiree to serve on the pension board, then the seat must be filled.
H.B. 4135 is now Public Act 25 of 2011.
