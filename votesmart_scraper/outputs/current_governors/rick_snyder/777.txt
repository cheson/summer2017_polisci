Snyder Signs Bill to Reduce Bridge Card Fraud
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 5, 2013
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder signed a bill today that will help reduce fraudulent use of Michigan's food assistance program.

"This is a common-sense bill that will continue efforts to save taxpayer dollars by helping keep the Bridge Cards that are intended to help people in need from reaching the hands of criminals," Snyder said.

House Bill 4042, sponsored by state Rep. Tim Kelly, requires the state Department of Human Services to check incarceration records and deactivate the Bridge Cards of recipients who are in prison. The legislation also requires the state to routinely check and terminate card access for recipients found in the U.S. Social Security Death Index database.

Both practices are already part of the department's policy.

HB 4042 is now Public Act 41 of 2013.
