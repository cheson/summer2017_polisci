Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for February fell to 4.8 percent, which is lower than the national average, and private-sector jobs have increased by more than 444,000 since December 2010.
"Michigan's falling unemployment rate is a great example of our state's continued success and a strong indicator of our future potential. More Michiganders are working as the state continues to move forward," Snyder said. "In 2010, Michigan's unemployment was among the worst in the nation and today it is below the national average. This is great news but now is not the time to rest.
"We need to continue working to ensure people of all backgrounds, in all corners of the state, have access to quality education and training opportunities for high-demand jobs. With collaboration across the business and education communities, Michigan can and will be the leader in developing, attracting, and retaining highly skilled talent. "
