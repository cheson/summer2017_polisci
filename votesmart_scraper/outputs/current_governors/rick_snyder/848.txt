Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement today after the state Senate approved measures to change how Michigan's largest health insurance provider is regulated.

"Today's passage of our plan to reform Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan with such strong bipartisan support of the state Senate is an important step in improving the health and wellness of Michiganders," Snyder said. "The demands of a modern health care system have outpaced the regulations of old, and transitioning Michigan's largest health insurer to a nonprofit mutual company will help foster healthier lifestyles and provide better access to health care with unprecedented levels of investment in the health of citizens, including our most vulnerable.

"I thank Senator Hune and Majority Leader Richardville for their leadership, and my administration will continue to work with our legislative partners and the health providers to reinvent health care in Michigan so it can be a positive economic driver in our state's comeback."
