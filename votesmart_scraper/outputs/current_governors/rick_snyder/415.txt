Unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, will be banned from interfering with hunting and fishing on Michigan lands, under bills signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Hunting and fishing are some of Michigan's most revered pastimes, and a major driver of our economy thanks to continued participation from residents and out-of-state visitors," Snyder said. "Using electronic devices to manipulate the sport is disruptive and a misuse of the natural resources we are blessed with."
Senate Bills 54 and 55, sponsored by state Sens. Tom Casperson and Phil Pavlov, respectively, prohibit the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for taking game or interfering with hunting or fishing. Using a drone to harass someone who is hunting is also banned under the bills. The bills are now Public Acts 12 and 13 of 2015.
