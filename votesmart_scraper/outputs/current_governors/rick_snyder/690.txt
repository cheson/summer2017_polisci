Location: Lansing, MI

Michigan's ongoing turnaround was fueled in 2013 by an unrelenting emphasis across the state on policies that created more jobs, stronger families and a revitalized education system, Gov. Rick Snyder said today.
Snyder released a compilation of 2013 highlights that underscore the progress being made as Michigan continues to earn the title of America's comeback state.
"Michigan is at its best when men and women in every corner of our state pull together for a more prosperous future," Snyder said. "That's what we saw in 2013 and the results are apparent. Whether it's growth in private-sector jobs or an increased investment in education, the foundation we've laid for Michigan's reinvention is delivering real results for real people. I commend my partners in the Legislature for their leadership and look forward to continuing this positive momentum in a thoughtful, fiscally responsible manner in the year ahead."
"We can all be proud of these accomplishments but we can't slow down," Lt. Gov. Brian Calley said. "There's too much work that still needs to be done. Families are counting on us to help create an environment for more and better jobs, and to make Michigan a place of exciting opportunities for the next generation. Michigan has come a long way in the past three years but we still have an ambitious agenda that will keep our state driving forward."
The year's highlights include:
CREATING MORE AND BETTER JOBS
* Job creation: More than 220,000 new private-sector jobs were created since December 2010.
* Community Ventures: More than 1,000 structurally unemployed Michigan residents were placed in jobs through the Michigan Economic Development Corp.'s Community Ventures program, a partnership between businesses and community groups.
* Supporting small businesses: A $20 million partnership was unveiled that will bring the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses initiative to Detroit. The initiative will help create jobs and spur economic growth.
* Assisting our veterans: Laws were enacted that allow veterans to more easily apply their skills
so that they qualify for employment.
REVITALIZING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM
* Increased funding: Funding for K-12 education was increased by reducing schools' long-term Legacy costs. The amount of funding per student has increased by $632 per student since 2011.
* Enhancing pre-kindergarten education: Funding for early childhood programs was increased by $65 million, and put up to 18,000 new children into high-quality preschool programs.
* Pathways to Potential: The Pathways to Potential program was expanded to 155 schools, bringing state services directly to those in need. The original 21 schools in the program showed a reduction in chronic absenteeism from the previous year.
REINVENTING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
* Dental care for kids: The successful Healthy Kids Dental program was expanded to cover 64,000 additional children, bringing the total to a half-million across 78 counties.
* Healthy Michigan: Health care access will be provided to 470,000 Michiganders in need. The state also created an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan in which the company will contribute nearly $1.6 billion over 18 years to promote the health of Michigan residents.
RESTORING OUR CITIES
* Restoring neighborhoods: The state's largest residential blight removal effort was launched, which involved $25 million in state funds and $100 million in federal funds for Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Pontiac and Saginaw.
* Returning Detroit to greatness: The governor authorized Detroit's filing for bankruptcy protection so the city can emerge from its crushing debt and provide quality services.
REINVENTING GOVERNMENT
* Balanced budget: The state's budget was balanced and presented months ahead of the constitutional deadline for the third year in a row.
* Cutting red tape: A milestone was passed when the state eliminated more than 1,500 antiquated or needlessly burdensome rules, while still ensuring strong consumer safeguards.
STRENGTHENING FAMILIES
* Cutting taxes: Taxes were cut for middle-class families by reducing taxes for new and used vehicles and boat purchases at the time of trade in.
* Stronger families: Michigan's finalized adoption rate for eligible children and youths reached 88 percent statewide, a record number going back nearly 20 years.
PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT
* Caring for our Great Lakes: Michigan hosted the Council of Great Lakes Governors summit for the first time in 30 years, resulting in several significant agreements that will benefit the lakes and the region.
* Supporting the outdoors: The hunting and fishing licensing system was simplified, reducing license types from 227 to about 40. The resulting revenue will be invested in protecting and enhancing our natural resources.
