Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation requiring the Department of Environmental Quality to extend permit processing deadlines at the request of the applicant.
Senate Bill 744, sponsored by state Sen. Mike Kowall, requires the DEQ to allow an additional period of 120 days to a year for a permit to be processed, if requested by the applicant.
The flexibility in the review time allows applicants to resolve issues including property disputes, off-site impacts, zoning regulation disputes and project design plans. The extended review period will avoid unnecessary denials of permits.
"This opens up the lines of communication between the DEQ and permit applicants with diverse needs," Snyder said. "The review process will further enhance DEQ's great record of customer service."
The bill is now Public Act 164 of 2012.
The governor also signed two other bills.
S.B. 300, sponsored by state Sen. John Gleason, is part of a legislative package addressing the use of credit scores in personal insurance, including guaranteeing insurance companies cannot use credit information to deny or cancel a personal insurance policy. S.B. 300 provides the definitions of terms for the package. It now is P.A. 165.
S.B. 937, sponsored by state Sen. Joe Hune, maintains Michigan insurers' access to low-cost loans through the Federal Home Loan Bank by ensuring the bank will be allowed to collect higher collateral in cases of insolvency. It is now P.A. 166.
