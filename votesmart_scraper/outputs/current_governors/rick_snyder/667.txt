Governor, Attorney General Announce Investigation of Prisoner Escape
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Feb. 7, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and Attorney General Bill Schuette today announced the Department of Attorney General will lead an investigation into the recent escape of a prisoner from the Ionia Correctional Facility.
"Ensuring public safety is paramount," said Snyder. "Thankfully no one was physically injured in this dangerous prisoner's escape and apprehension, but we must have an exhaustive investigation into the circumstances that led to this incident and take whatever appropriate action may be necessary to prevent future occurrences. That's why I asked the Attorney General to look into this matter. I appreciate his willingness to take this critical role on. While I have full confidence in Michigan Department of Corrections Director Dan Heyns' internal affairs investigation underway, this additional step will supplement and be independent from that to ensure we have the most thorough and comprehensive information possible."
"We will conduct an aggressive investigation, without fear or favor," said Schuette. "Prisons are built to keep dangerous criminals locked away from society, but in this case a violent murderer escaped. This will be an exhaustive investigation. We'll follow the facts to find out what happened and why. We will issue a full and complete report."
Michael David Elliot, who was serving a life sentence for multiple murders, escaped from prison on Feb. 2, 2014. Elliot was apprehended by Indiana authorities the next day, in cooperation with the U.S. Marshals Service. Elliot is expected to face criminal charges in both Indiana and Michigan related to the escape.
