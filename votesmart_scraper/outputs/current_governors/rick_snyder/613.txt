Date: April 24, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally unadjusted regional unemployment rate fell in every Michigan region:
"Michiganders all across the state should be proud of the work they have done and the direction we are heading. Today's seasonally unadjusted unemployment rates show declines in unemployment throughout every region in Michigan. The comeback is happening and it's not isolated to one region or industry. It truly is a comeback for all of Michigan. While this reduced unemployment in every regional labor market continues the positive trend, we still have more work to do. These positive job reports prove that we are the Comeback State, but we must continue to build on our successes.
