Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Bills to Increase Penalties for Drive-By, Occupied Building Shootings
Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation increasing penalties for unlawful use of firearms.
"The safety and wellbeing of all Michiganders is and always will be a top priority," Snyder said. "These bills will help keep our residents safe while encouraging smart decision making with regard to firearm use."
Senate Bill 582, sponsored by state Sen. James Marleau, redefines and increases the maximum penalties for unlawful use of a firearm for cases involving drive-by shootings and shootings that occur on the property of a home or business.
Under the law signed today, discharge of a firearm from a motor vehicle, ORV, or snow mobile is a crime without the need to prove that the shooting endangered the safety of another individual, as was required under previous law. Also under SB 582, the discharge of a firearm within a potentially occupied structure is now a crime without the need to prove that the structure was actually occupied at the time of the shooting. For both types of unlawful use of firearms, the maximum penalties escalate based on the degree of risk and injury caused.
SB 583, sponsored by state Sen. Jim Ananich, incorporates the new penalty provisions into the sentencing guidelines set forth in the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The bills are now Public Acts 191 and 192, respectively.
