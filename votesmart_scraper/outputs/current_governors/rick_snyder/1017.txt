Snyder Issues Statement on EPA Ozone Standards
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: Sept. 2, 2011
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today a statement in response to President Barack Obama's decision directing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to suspend implementation of its proposed new rule for ozone standards.
The proposed rule, established in 2008, would have reduced the ozone standard from 75 parts per billion to 60 ppb. Most states in the country, including Michigan, would be out of compliance. Achieving compliance with the new standard would have been nearly impossible for most states, and would have dealt a devastating blow to the nation's manufacturing sector.
Snyder issued the following statement:
"The President made the right decision to stop this move by the EPA. The present ozone standard was last reviewed a mere three years ago. Michigan companies have worked hard to meet the standard, because we all support a healthy environment.
It is important to balance environmental goals with the need for economic development, particularly as Michigan and the rest of the nation work to recover from the recession. The proposed rule would have placed attainment standards out of reach. Hundreds of Michigan companies would have been forced to limit commercial activity. New companies would have been forced to look beyond Michigan, the Great Lakes Region or even the U.S. for growth opportunities.
In July, my office asked the administration to reconsider this decision at this time. We are grateful the president recognized the importance of balancing environmental protection with economic recovery in this instance."
