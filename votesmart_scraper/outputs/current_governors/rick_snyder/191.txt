Families are encouraged to take advantage of additional preschool programming now available to local children thanks to state funding being provided to help the people of Flint recover from the water crisis, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley said while visiting the Summerfield Early Education Center in Flint today.
"Early education and intervention is key to overcoming the impact of lead exposure in young children," Calley said. "The Genesee ISD is a great partner in efforts to quickly open additional preschool opportunities in the area and I want to encourage parents to sign children up for these programs. This funding ensures that Flint families wanting to enroll their children in preschool programs have the ability to do so."
As a result of the state funding this year, Genesee Intermediate School District will open seven new Great Start classrooms with the district. Five of the classrooms will be at Atherton Community School District's Van Y building in Burton and two will be at Summerfield Early Education Center in Flint. One new classroom has already opened at each location, with a second opening at Van Y next week. Each Great Start classroom can include 16 full-day students.
"These additional opportunities are providing high-quality preschool programs which open the door for positive educational experiences for young children and their parents, we are thrilled to offer them all summer," said Dr. Lisa Hagel, Genesee ISD Superintendent.
To date, $900,000 has been allocated for early education expansion in Flint.
Preschool programs do run through the summer months. Registration information for families is available at geneseepreschool.org or by calling 810-591-KIDS.
