Gov. Rick Snyder offered the following statement after the Michigan Legislature approved the fiscal year 2017 budget:
"For the sixth straight year, Michigan has completed a balanced, fiscally responsible budget months ahead of schedule. This budget provides significant resources for Flint's recovery while continuing to pay off debt, save money for our future, and make needed investments in critical areas.
"Flint's families deserve access to clean, safe drinking water. That's why we are investing $234 million to help provide both short-term and long-term solutions that will move the city forward.
"We also remain committed to providing our children and young adults with the education they need to succeed in the 21st century. The budget adds $150 million for K-12 education for a total of nearly $12.1 billion in state funding. That's an increase of $1.4 billion since fiscal year 2011.
"In addition, we are investing another $25.6 million for the Healthy Kids Dental program, allowing us to provide quality dental care to more than 826,000 children in all 83 counties. This is an important step to help ensure a lifetime of better health.
"The fiscal year 2017 budget is one that we should be proud of. It reflects the fact that we are one great state willing to work together to solve significant challenges. As we look to continue our state's remarkable comeback, we need to remain focused on overcoming obstacles, creating more and better jobs, and making smart investments for everyone's future."
