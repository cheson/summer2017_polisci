Gov. Rick Snyder: Another Denial of Federal Funding for Flint Residents is Disappointing
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: March 16, 2016
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today released a letter detailing federal denial of a request that could have brought more federal funding and much-needed resources to help the people of Flint.
"It is disappointing that the federal government has rejected yet another request for funding to help Flint residents with the city's recovery from the water crisis, including needs both now and in the future," Snyder said. "This denial is especially frustrating as it would have provided aid to individual households in Flint.
"The Flint water crisis is the result of failures at all levels of government and the success of the response and recovery absolutely requires a continued effort from local, state, and federal partners."
In the March 3 letter to the Federal Management Emergency Agency, Snyder specifically requested funding from the Category B program for emergency protective measures and the Individuals and Households Program. To date, the state has delivered nearly $70 million in state funding to Flint for immediate clean water resources and ongoing follow-up work.
