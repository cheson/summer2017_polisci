Snyder Signs Bill Improving Motorcycle Safety Standards
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: May 6, 2014
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation encouraging motorcycle operators to apply for a full operating endorsement rather than a temporary permit.
"This bill will help prevent abuse of the current motorcycle permitting process, ultimately ensuring more motorcyclists are trained to operate their vehicles in the safest manner possible," Snyder said.
House Bill 4781, sponsored by state Rep. Brad Jacobsen, allows a motorcyclist to apply for a temporary training permit only twice during a 10-year period. The permit enables a motorcyclist to ride for a period of 180 days, during daylight and without a passenger under the supervision of a fully endorsed motorcycle operator.
Previously, there was no limit to the number of times a person could be granted a temporary permit. Many operators would apply every riding season as an alternative to obtaining their full cycle endorsement.
It is now Public Act 120 of 2014.
Snyder also signed one other bill.
Senate Bill 622, sponsored by state Sen. Darwin Booher, clarifies the application of the state use tax on manufacturers who connect their product to real estate. The bill extends the original use tax exemption an additional year to Jan. 1, 2005, to cover all firms that should have been covered by the previous Jan. 1, 2006, extension. It is now PA 121 of 2014.
