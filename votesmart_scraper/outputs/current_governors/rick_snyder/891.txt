Snyder Orders Creation of Autism Council
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 28, 2012
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed an executive order establishing within the state Department of Community Health an Autism Council to oversee Michigan's Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) State Plan.
"It is important that we work together to identify autism disorders as soon as possible. The sooner the diagnosis, the quicker patients can receive treatment, and the likelier they are to reaching their fullest potential," Snyder said. "Effective coordination is necessary to achieve these goals, and the Michigan Autism Council will help ensure our state plan becomes a reality, so individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and their families can live better lives."
Executive Order 2012-11 creates the council as an advisory body to review, adopt and implement the State Plan. The plan will provide for comprehensive, lifespan supports to individuals with ASD and their families through access to information and resources, coordination of services, and implementation of evidence-based practices. The council must also update the plan every year.
Snyder said having a plan is key when implementing coverage, enabling the entities that are engaged in research, education, and treatment to be better aligned and work more efficiently toward more effective outcomes for people with ASD.
The group will consist of 12 members appointed by the governor; four members appointed for terms expiring on Sept. 30, 2014, four members appointed for terms expiring on Sept. 30, 2015, and four members appointed for terms expiring on Sept. 30, 2016. After the initial appointments, members of the council will serve four-year terms.
The council is similar to what other states have implemented.
