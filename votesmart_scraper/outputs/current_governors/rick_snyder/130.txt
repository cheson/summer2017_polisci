Press Release

Location: Lansing, MI

Complaints filed by resident veterans, their family members or legal guardians or a legislator will be reviewed and investigated by an appointed ombudsman under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Ensuring that our veterans have their voices heard and receive the quality care they deserve is critical," Snyder said. "By creating this office, veterans and their families can have their concerns addressed."
Senate Bill 809, sponsored by state Sen. Peter MacGregor, creates the Office of the Michigan Veterans Facility Ombudsman within the Legislative Council. The bill requires that the Council appoint an ombudsman to investigate complaints filed by resident veterans, their family members or legal guardians or a legislator and report findings and recommendations to the Legislative Council. It is now Public Act 198 of 2016.
Snyder also signed 21 additional bills:
HBs 5332-5348 and HBs 5548-5551, sponsored by state Reps. Barrett, Rutledge, Glenn, Hughes, Cox, Vaupel, Lucido, Bizon, Theis, Kosowski, Sheppard, Inman, Chatfield, Cole, Leutheuser, Whiteford, and Howell, update and create a standard definition of the term "veteran". The new definition of "veteran" is now "an individual who served in the United States armed forces, including the reserve components, and was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable." The bills are now PAs 199-215 and 216-219.
