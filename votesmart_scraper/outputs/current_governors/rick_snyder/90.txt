Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that 11,000 additional Michiganders were employed in September. The state's unemployment rate -- now at 4.6 percent -- remains below the national unemployment rate, which increased to 5 percent.
"More Michiganders are joining the labor force again to look for jobs, demonstrating the strength of our state's remarkable comeback. Residents are now more confident they can find something as they begin looking for new careers. The 463,000 private-sector jobs created in Michigan prove that our efforts to reinvent the state are paying off, but there is more to do.
"As more and more Michiganders conduct job searches, we need to ensure they have the skills necessary to fill those available opportunities. Nearly 100,000 jobs are available right now on www.mitalent.org. By creating more high-skilled talent for in-demand jobs, we can fill those jobs, accelerate our economic comeback, and ensure a brighter future for every Michigander."
