Gov. Rick Snyder Signs Bill Lowering Cost of Detroit Debt Repayment
Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 22, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed legislation that will reduce the amount of interest the city of Detroit will pay on its financial recovery bond repayments.
"We need to ensure Detroit's debt is repaid under the terms of the bankruptcy to allow the city to continue its recovery," Snyder said. "The savings from lower interest costs will allow Detroit to reinvest in critical areas like public safety and municipal services."
Senate Bill 160, sponsored by state Sen. Darwin Booher, is a technical fix putting a statutory lien on Detroit income taxes to increase the credit worth of Detroit's bonds. This change will help secure exit financing related to the bankruptcy, which could save between $20 and 30 million over the life of the bond. In addition to the cost savings, it is expected to improve the bond rating.
