Michigan residents who participate in amateur mixed martial arts (MMA) events will have a safer environment to compete in, under two bills signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Participation in amateur mixed martial arts has grown considerably in Michigan, and it's important to consider public health and safety so the participants know they are protected when they enter competitions," Snyder said.
