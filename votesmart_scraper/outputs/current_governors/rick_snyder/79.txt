Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that 487,900 private-sector jobs have been created since December 2010. The state's unemployment rate -- now at 4.7 percent -- remains below the national unemployment rate.
"This month's jobs report demonstrates the strength of Michigan's economy as more private-sector jobs are created and more Michiganders join the labor force. Over the past six years, more than 487,000 jobs have been created, allowing our residents to feel more confident as they look for new career opportunities.
"We should be proud of our comeback to this point, but our efforts to create more well-paying jobs need to continue. During my investment mission to China, we're telling Michigan's comeback story and making the case that there is no better place in the world for companies to expand and create jobs than in Michigan. We will continue to proudly tell the story of Michigan's reinvention as we work to improve our economy for all Michiganders."
