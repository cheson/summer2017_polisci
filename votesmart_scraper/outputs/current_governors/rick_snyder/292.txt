The Healthy Michigan Plan will continue for nearly 600,000 residents, now that the state has obtained waiver approval from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Gov. Rick Snyder said today.
The Healthy Michigan Plan, launched April 1, 2014, extends health care coverage to eligible residents with incomes equal to up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Approval of the second waiver was required by state law before Dec. 31, 2015, for the program to continue.
"The Healthy Michigan Plan has provided Michiganders with the opportunity to improve their health and wellness by enrolling in health care coverage," Snyder said. "I'm proud of this program, our residents, and Michigan's continued leadership in health care innovation. I appreciate the work of the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and thank it for its partnership and approval of our unique approach to keep Michigan moving forward."
