Press Release
By: Rick Snyder
Date: June 6, 2012
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued a proclamation ending an outdoor burning ban in 49 counties and a fireworks ban in Luce and Schoolcraft counties.
Both bans were imposed under a proclamation issued May 25 in response to the wildfires that destroyed more than 20,000 acres of land and more than 100 buildings in the Upper Peninsula.

"The state Department of Natural Resources has determined, based on rainfall amounts and other metrics, that the extreme fire hazard conditions have subsided and so we are lifting the outdoor burning ban," Snyder said. "I also commend the firefighters, conservation officers and National Guard troops who continue to provide needed assistance in containing the fires."

The 49 counties included in the outdoor burning ban were:

Alcona, Alger, Alpena, Antrim, Arenac, Baraga, Bay, Benzie, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Chippewa, Clare, Crawford, Delta, Dickinson, Emmet, Gladwin, Gogebic, Grand Traverse, Houghton, Iosco, Iron, Isabella, Kalkaska, Keweenaw, Lake, Leelanau, Luce, Mackinac, Manistee, Marquette, Mason, Mecosta, Menominee, Midland, Missaukee, Montmorency, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, Ogemaw, Ontonagon, Osceola, Oscoda, Otsego, Presque Isle, Roscommon, Schoolcraft, and Wexford.
