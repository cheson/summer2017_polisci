As part of continued efforts to improve the efficiency and transparency of state government, Gov. Rick Snyder Tuesday issued an executive directive calling for a formalized process for all purchasing done by the state.
"Strong management of taxpayer dollars continues to be a priority as we work to ensure smart, cost-effective and transparent procedures," Snyder said. "The efficiencies gained from coordinating purchasing across departments will allow state government to focus more resources on serving Michigan residents."
Under the directive, the state will further formalize procurement operations across all state departments, led by the chief procurement officer within the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget. Each department currently has its own procurement executive who will now have reporting responsibility to the chief procurement officer, ensuring purchasing objectives are aligned and best practices are shared and utilized.
"This directive is a necessary first step in a larger reinvention of the state's procurement process," said DTMB Director David Behen. "Developing a connected, integrated procurement team will enable increased collaboration and standardize the purchasing process leading to greater savings."
