Gov. Rick Snyder: Michigan's Unemployment Rate Near National Average, but State has Greater Goals
Statement
By: Rick Snyder
Date: April 15, 2015
Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following statement after the announcement that the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for March fell to 5.6 percent. The rate has now been cut in half from 11.2 percent in December 2010, and is one-tenth of a percent behind the national average.
"We have momentum as Michigan's unemployment rate continues to drop. In December 2010, Michigan's unemployment was nearly 2 percent above the national average. Today, we are one-tenth of a percent behind. In the last year, just two other states can show a larger drop in unemployment.
"That shows how far we've come, but doesn't reflect where we want our state to be. Merely reaching the national average shouldn't be our goal. We're on a path for Michigan to be a national leader in terms of developing talent. Michigan will be a place where companies look to grow and continue creating more and better jobs. But we also will be an example for leaders in other states as they look to as they look for ways to build a talented workforce so everyone has the opportunity to reach their potential and be successful."
