Cursing in front of women or children or playing the national anthem out of tune will no longer be criminal acts punishable by jail time in Michigan, under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"Modernizing state government is an ongoing effort," Snyder said. "I appreciate the work of the legislature in analyzing the criminal code and eliminating statutes that no longer make sense in the 21st century."
