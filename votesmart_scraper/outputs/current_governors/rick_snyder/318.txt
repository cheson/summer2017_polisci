Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today discussed a legislative package focused on reversing longstanding problems faced by public schools in Detroit and giving families more quality educational options.
The historic academic and financial struggles faced by public schools in the city will require a new approach, developed in collaboration with city and state elected and community leaders to create the brightest future possible for all of Detroit's children, Snyder said.
"There is no question that Detroit children need a solid education so they can compete in a global economy but also for their city to accelerate its revitalization," Snyder said. "This is an opportunity to recast a structure that isn't meeting the needs of the city's families for a variety of reasons. Starting with a plan presented by community leaders, we have crafted a new approach that will give families quality public school options while stabilizing district finances."
