Several outdated and unnecessary laws impacting Michigan's food and agriculture industry have been repealed under legislation signed today by Gov. Rick Snyder.
"The food and agriculture industry is one of Michigan's largest and most successful industries," Snyder said. "These bills help reduce burdensome rules and regulations, boosting food and agriculture's ongoing growth in Michigan."
House Bills 5050-5055, 5059-5060, and 5392, sponsored by state Reps. Dave Pagel, Edward Canfield, Triston Cole, Holly Hughes, Martin Howrylak, John Bizon, Tom Barrett, Jason Sheppard and Brett Roberts, respectively, update livestock breeding, taxation, animal identification, disease and pest control, silo treatment, started pullets, livestock and poultry remedies and seed testing regulations. The measures are now Public Acts 250-255, 256-257 and 258 of 2016.
Snyder also signed nine additional bills:
Senate Bill 477, sponsored by state Sen. Mike Green, updates state statute to reflect new federal standards related to regulating the health and safety of dairy products. It is now PA 259.
SBs 651 and 652, sponsored by state Sen. Darwin Booher, and SB 653, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Casperson, allow eligible landowners to transfer commercial forest property into the Qualified Forest Program without penalty until Sept. 1, 2021, and provides a phase-in of the applicable tax rates following transfer. Qualified Forest Program participants are eligible for certain tax benefits if they designate their land solely for forestry purposes, and manage the property according to a department-approved forest management plan. The measures are now PAs 260-262.
SB 899, sponsored by state Sen. Jim Stamas, enhances protection of assets for farmers who deliver grain to licensed dealers who go bankrupt. It is now PA 263.
SB 900, sponsored by state Sen. Joe Hune, better aligns farm producer insurance premiums with the economic market and current number and size of grain facilities. It is now PA 264.
HBs 5189 and 5190, sponsored by state Reps. Dan Lauwers and Brett Roberts, respectively, help support farmland preservation by streamlining rules for the Farmland and Open Space Preservation Program. The measures are now PAs 265 and 266.
HB 5191, sponsored by state Rep. Dan Lauwers, requires the state to provide "bonus interest" payments if Farmland Preservation Credit returns are not processed on time. It is now PA 267.
