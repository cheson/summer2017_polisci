Location: Lansing, MI

The Battle Creek Air National Guard base is one of four locations in the United States chosen for a new Cyber Operations Squadron to help detect and protect against cybersecurity threats, Gov. Rick Snyder said today.
Michigan and Battle Creek, chosen by the U.S. Department of Defense, were selected to host the newest cybersecurity unit because of their pre-existing work to train both military members and civilians in strategies to defend against the increasing number of cyber breaches.
"Cyber-attacks are an unfortunate reality of a world that is becoming increasingly more dependent on technology," Snyder said. "I'm proud of the work we've done to establish Michigan as a national leader in this field. The new cyber unit will help ensure we remain on the forefront of this mission and provide new and future opportunities for growth."
