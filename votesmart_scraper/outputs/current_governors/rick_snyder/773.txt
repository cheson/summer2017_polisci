Location: Lansing, MI

Gov. Rick Snyder today signed a three-bill package to streamline the election process by transferring the role and responsibilities of local canvassing boards to the county level.

"By consolidating village, city and township canvassing boards at the county level, voters will get more value for their tax dollars through a more efficient elections process," Snyder said.

House Bill 4171, sponsored by state Rep. Brad Jacobsen, amends the Michigan Election Law and repeals parts of the act, in order to eliminate references to local boards of canvassers in cities, villages and townships. The bill would assign the duties and responsibilities of the local boards of canvassers to the boards of county canvassers. It is now Public Act 51 of 2013.

The companion bills are HB 4169 and HB 4170.

HB 4169, sponsored by state Rep. Dave Pagel, amends the General Law Village Act to specify that the results of an election on a proposed disincorporation must be canvassed by the board of county canvassers, in the county in which the village is located. It is now PA 52.

HB 4170, sponsored by state Rep. Kevin Cotter, eliminates references in the Community College Act of 1966 to a "board of city canvassers" or "board of township canvassers" to reflect changes in HB 4169. It is now PA 53.

Snyder also signed these other bills:

HB 4127, sponsored by state Rep. Joel Johnson, gives judges the ability to assign GPS tethering devices to criminal defendants who are on bail for assault crimes. It is now PA 54.

HB 4360, sponsored by state Rep. Gail Haines, suspends or revokes the liquor license of any store or bar that allows the use of a Bridge Card for the purchase of liquor or other non-eligible items. It is now PA 55.

HB 4361, sponsored by state Rep. Roger Victory, suspends or revokes the state lottery sales license of a merchant that allows the use of a Bridge Card for the purchase of lottery tickets. It is now PA 56.

Senate Bill 165, sponsored by state Sen. Jim Marleau, which is referred to as the Medical Good-Faith Provisions Act. It requires a health facility or agency, when requested, to disclose any written policies related to a patient or resident or the services a patient or resident may receive that involves life-sustaining treatment or non-beneficial treatment. It is now PA 57.

SB 335, sponsored by state Sen. Roger Kahn, extends a 1 percent tax on health insurance claims that was set to expire Jan. 1, 2014 to Jan. 1, 2018. It is now PA 58.
