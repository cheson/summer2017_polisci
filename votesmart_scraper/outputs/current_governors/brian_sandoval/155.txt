Governor Brian Sandoval released the following statement today after learning of the death of former University of Nevada, Las Vegas men's basketball coach, Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee and Nevadan, Jerry Tarkanian.
"Jerry Tarkanian was the patriarch of the legendary UNLV Runnin' Rebels who built a dynasty that will leave a lasting legacy within college athletics. He was an innovative coach who mastered the amoeba defense and had an eye for talent having recruited some of the league's greatest players and helped these superstars achieve their full athletic potential and realize the capacity of their gifts. Coach Tarkanian will be forever memorialized by sports fans across the nation as an iconic figure who changed the sport. Nevadans will remember him as a man who brought fame to our young UNLV and a wonderful husband, father, and grandfather. His wife Lois, and the entire family, will remain in my thoughts and prayers," said Governor Brian Sandoval.
