A new weatherization program offers Nevada senior citizens an opportunity to reduce monthly energy costs through energy efficiency measures at no cost to owner-occupied dwellings.
The Home Energy Retrofit Opportunities for Seniors (H.E.R.O.S.) weatherization program, funded by the Governor's Office of Energy and administered by the Nevada Housing Division, provides an energy assessment of a qualifying senior's home and installation of recommended weatherization measures. Efficiency measures can include services such as installation of solar screens and insulation, HVAC repairs, and emergency replacement of failed heating and cooling equipment, up to a value of $6,000 per home.
"The H.E.R.O.S. weatherization program offers Nevada's low-income seniors a way to save money, conserve energy, and live in healthier, safer homes. I encourage all eligible Nevadans to take advantage of this free resource and I thank the Office of Energy for instituting this important program to help serve our senior population," said Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval.
H.E.R.O.S. has four general requirements. The senior must:
-Be aged 60 and better,
-Be an NV Energy electric customer,
-Have an income at or below 200% of federal poverty guidelines, and
-Own and reside in the home.
"A major goal of the Office of Energy is to promote energy conservation in Nevada," GOE Director Paul Thomsen explained. "The H.E.R.O.S. program does that by funding measures that will save energy at the homes of low-income seniors."
In addition to the energy and cost benefits to having a more energy efficient home, the assessment tests can save lives by identifying dangerous carbon monoxide levels. The program's benefits to seniors are many, diverse, and free.
"This is an amazing opportunity for Nevada seniors to realize immediate monthly cost savings," said CJ Manthe, Housing Division Administrator. "Qualified homeowners can be assured that the services provided by our nonprofit partners under the H.E.R.O.S. program do not involve any out-of-pocket expenses, hidden costs or fees."
