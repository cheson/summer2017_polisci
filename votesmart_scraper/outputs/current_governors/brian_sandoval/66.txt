Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement after hearing of the passing of former First Lady of the United States of America, Nancy Reagan. Nancy Reagan was the wife of Ronald Reagan, the 39th President of the United States.
"Nancy Reagan was the loyal pillar of strength, support and confidence for one our nation's greatest presidents. The storybook romance between Nancy and President Reagan can be defined as one of the great love stories of the century. Fiercely committed and dedicated to her partner in life, President Reagan, she served as a source of grace through adversity, strength in the face of doubt and comfort during times of grief," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "Today, the Sandoval family joins with millions across our nation as we remember Nancy Reagan, a champion in the war on drugs, a breast cancer survivor, and a frequent visitor to Nevada during the Reagans' long friendship with former Senator Paul Laxalt. I pray that President Ronald Reagan and his First Lady find eternal peace together in their final resting place."
