Governor Brian Sandoval today made the following statement after signing Senate Bill 303, driver's privilege card:
"I am proud to sign SB 303, the driver privilege card, into law. Applicants for the card must pass a driving test and understand traffic laws. In addition, those who successfully obtain a driver's privilege card must have insurance. The privilege card will not be accepted as identification. Allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver's privilege card will increase the number of drivers on Nevada's roads that are insured and aware of traffic rules and regulations. I thank Senator Denis for his work on this issue."
