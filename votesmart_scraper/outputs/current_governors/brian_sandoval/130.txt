Governor Brian Sandoval released the following statement today after the United States Supreme Court issued its decision on the King v. Burwell case.
"Throughout this matter, we have remained confident that the thousands of Nevadans who rely on our Silver State Health Insurance Exchange would not be impacted and coverage will not be affected because from the beginning we initiated state control of our marketplace by setting up a state-based exchange. Today's decision affirmed that this was the best choice for Nevadans. We remain committed to state control of our marketplace and assuring affordable health plans are available to reduce the number of uninsured Nevadans," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "I am proud of the work that has been done to improve the access to quality healthcare for Nevadans. Since 2013, we have cut our uninsured rate in half from 22% to 11%, the 6th strongest decline in the nation. This drop in our uninsured rate has helped the neediest among our communities by leveraging federal resources and saving precious state dollars. I remain committed to working with our state and federal partners to continue improving access to healthcare services in order to achieve our overall goal of a healthy citizenry."
