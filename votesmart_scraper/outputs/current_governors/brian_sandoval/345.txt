Amnesty
I oppose amnesty. As a Federal Judge, I saw both sides of the immigration issue. It was my duty to sentence undocumented immigrants for their crimes, but it was also my honor to swear in new Americans and to see the smiles and pride on their faces as they completed the process of becoming a citizen.
We must be able to verify that those individuals who work in our country are here legally and are eligible for work. Businesses who knowingly hire illegal immigrants should be held accountable.
I believe that we must enforce our laws, secure our borders and respect the efforts of those who have become a citizen through the proper legal process.
The American Dream is alive and well, but it must be pursued legally.
Driver's Licenses For Undocumented Immigrants
I oppose giving driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. Nevada law requires proof of legal residency and a social security number to obtain a driver's license. I support the law and oppose any changes to the law.
