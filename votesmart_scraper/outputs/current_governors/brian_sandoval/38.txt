Governor Brian Sandoval today released the following statement after the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee held its meeting and voted on final recommendations.
"I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the members of the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee and its Technical Advisory Council for their tireless efforts and dedication to completing the recently approved recommendations. I would especially like to thank Director Steve Hill for his leadership and perseverance in ensuring Nevada's best interests were always the top priority in this process. I will begin my review of the Committee's recommendations and will also begin discussions with legislative leadership, local stakeholders, and my cabinet to clarify any outstanding questions. I will not move forward until all questions have been resolved," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "More than one year ago, I signed an Executive Order bringing together many of the brightest minds in gaming and hospitality as well as community leaders in an effort to identify the untapped potential and unfulfilled demands in the Southern Nevada tourism industry. Nevada has served as the standard bearer for global tourism, gaming, and conventions for decades. In order to remain the top destination, we must explore potential opportunities and push forward to lead this international industry into the next generation of travel and tourism. I am hopeful the work completed by this committee will serve as a roadmap to Southern Nevada's unrivaled and continued success."
