Sandoval Statement on Economic Forum
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement after the Economic Forum made their projections for the coming biennium:
"Today's news from the Economic Forum is a strong signal that our economy is continuing on the road to recovery. The Forum projected $217 million in additional revenue. In addition, the Budget Office projects that Local School Support Tax will generate $113 million, for a total of $330 million. When we adjust for changes in property tax forecasts, the state will have $274 million for the state budget.
"In accordance with my previously stated desire to put additional funding to education, I pledge that the $274 million increase will go directly to public education. We must, however, realize that while today's news is welcome, our state's economy is still fragile. As the Legislature continues to close budgets, it is of the utmost importance to maintain our business-friendly climate to help foster job growth and put our fellow Nevadans back to work."
