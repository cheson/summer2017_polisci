Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced a successful launch to a major school choice initiative, the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program, also known as Opportunity Scholarships. Sandoval introduced tax-incentive scholarship legislation during his first term and has continued to champion school choice throughout his tenure. After calling for legislation in his 2015 State of the State Address, he worked with the Legislature to see the Choice Scholarship bill through final passage.
"More than 350 students from across Nevada have now chosen their own path to an education that best suits their academic needs. This is a great win for parents and students in the Silver State," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "This past Legislative Session we made an unprecedented investment in Nevada's public education system and implemented structural reforms which will modernize and improve our delivery of education. Choice Scholarships give many Nevada students a chance to pursue an education they may not otherwise be able to obtain. I am confident that with time, this important school choice measure will help more children to unlock their full potential and reach greater scholastic heights."
