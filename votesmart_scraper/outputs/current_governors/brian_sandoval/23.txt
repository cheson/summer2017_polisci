Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced that federal assistance will be made available to the State of Nevada in order to help state, tribal, and local public infrastructure recovery efforts in response to severe weather events from February 5 -- February 22, 2017. The approval for public assistance and hazard mitigation support follows a formal request sent from Governor Sandoval to President Donald Trump and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Individual assistance for Washoe County and Elko County is still under review.
"Many of our neighbors, friends, and loved ones were directly affected by the severe weather events of this past winter. These funds will help our local governments rebuild so that our communities can be made whole, once again." said Governor Brian Sandoval. "I am grateful for the cooperation from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, FEMA, and the recognition of the urgency of the situation. We will continue to work with our federal partners as they evaluate individual assistance needs but the Nevadans who are still suffering will continue to remain a state resources priority,"
"This Presidential Major Disaster Declaration is the second of 2017, and signifies the beginning of an extraordinary year in our state," said Caleb Cage, Chief of the Nevada Division of Emergency Management. "It also signifies the continued commitment to preparedness, response, and recovery by local, state, tribal, and federal partners."
