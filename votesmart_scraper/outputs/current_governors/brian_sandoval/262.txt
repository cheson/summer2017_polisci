Governor Brian Sandoval today made the following statement regarding former Navy SEAL Tyrone S. Woods, a Henderson resident who tragically lost his life in the attack at the American Embassy in Libya on Tuesday:
"As a Navy SEAL, Tyrone bravely fought for our country and as a security officer in Libya, Tyrone made the ultimate sacrifice. A registered nurse and paramedic, Tyrone stepped forward when his country asked him to. Kathleen and I extend our deepest sympathies to Tyrone's wife Dorothy and to Tyrone's three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter and Kai.
"I have directed Capitol Police that the flag of the State of Nevada fly at half-staff until sundown on Sunday in honor of Tyrone and all victims of the Libya tragedy, consistent with the Presidential order issued Wednesday."
