Governor Brian Sandoval today announced that Nevada has achieved double-digit export growth over the previous year. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, in 2012, Nevada was one of 11 states to achieve double-digit growth, ranking third out of eleven. Just this week, Governor Sandoval met with the Canada's Consulate General David Fransen to discuss Canada-Nevada trade. Canada-Nevada bilateral trade was $2.1 billion in 2011.
"As the first Governor to lead a Governor-led trade mission last year, I am very pleased with this news. Expanding Nevada's global footprint has been a priority for my Administration and it is a sign that Nevada's economy is moving in the right direction," Governor Brian Sandoval said. "The Governor's Office of Economic Development, along with the restructured regional economic development authorities, have worked diligently to help expand businesses in Nevada and bring new businesses to our state. Our efforts have helped to create new jobs, open new markets for Nevada businesses and expand opportunity. Today's news is an indication we must continue to build upon this work."
In 2012, Nevada recorded 28 percent growth in the export market. Businesses in Nevada who are looking for assistance in expanding or who have questions regarding exports may contact the Governor's Office of Economic Development at 800.336.1600.
