Location: London, United Kingdom

Governor Brian Sandoval worked to strengthen the ties between the State of Nevada and the United Kingdom in discussions with government officials and business leaders today in London. With over $170 million in exports to Nevada in 2014, the United Kingdom is the State's eighth largest trading partner.
"As one of our Top 10 trading partners, the UK has become a focus of our international outreach efforts," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "With a new focus on water technology and commercialization, and through my discussions with government officials and business investors, I am confident there are ways for the State of Nevada and the United Kingdom to further enhance our bilateral trade partnership for the mutual benefit of both parties."
Governor Sandoval met with The Right Honorable Andrew Mitchell, Member of Parliament, The Right Honorable Sir Greg Knight, Member of Parliament, and The Right Honorable Lord Anderson, Member of Parliament, and Lord Francis Maude, Minister of State for Trade and Investment, to discuss strengthening ties between the United Kingdom and the State of Nevada.
Governor Sandoval also met with British Water, the lead representative and business development organization for the supply chain of the UK water industry and Isle Utilities, a London-based consultancy group focused on water research and innovation, to discuss partnership opportunities with the Nevada Center of Excellence.
The Nevada Division of Tourism hosted a reception where Governor Sandoval highlighted the diverse travel and tourism opportunities found only in Nevada from the world-famous Las Vegas Strip to the unique annual cowboy poetry festival and our vast wide open spaces. This reception was the first such event that the Division has held in England with the intent of fostering new relationships in the United Kingdom and promoting Nevada as a world-class destination unrivaled in its amenities and accommodations.
