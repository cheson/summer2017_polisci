Press Release

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced that the United States Department of Interior will invest $39.1 million to fund more than 40 projects across Nevada. These funds will be implemented in Nevada to improve recreation areas, reduce the risk of wildfires, enhance conservation efforts, and support wildlife habitat restoration. The funds are made available through the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act (SNPLMA) which allows proceeds from the sale of public lands in Clark County to fund a range of projects throughout the State of Nevada.
"This is a great day for Nevada, more than $39 million stemming from the sale of Nevada's public lands will be infused directly into the management, conservation, and improvement of some of our most precious natural resources," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "The Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act is a great example of how public land going into private ownership is compatible with conservation and preservation efforts. SMPLMA will help spur economic development in the private sector and provide the necessary resources for conservation and habitat restoration and to reduce the risk of wildfires."
