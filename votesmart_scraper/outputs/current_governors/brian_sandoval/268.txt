Governor Brian Sandoval made the following statement this morning after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the Affordable Care Act:
"America is a nation of laws, and checks and balances. While I may not agree with the Supreme Court's decision in this case, I respect the process envisioned by our founding fathers. The implications for Medicaid costs are still unclear, but Nevada will prepare to meet the serious financial implications of this decision. I believe the Congress should act to reform this law and ease the serious burdens it places on the states and the nation's businesses. The American people remain deeply divided on the wisdom of this law and they are still entitled to see it changed."
