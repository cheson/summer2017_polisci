Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Sept. 9, 2011
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval this morning signed a proclamation declaring this Sunday, September 11th, as "Patriot Day in Nevada."
"This year marks the tenth anniversary of 9/11 and it is fitting and proper to continue to mark this day as one of remembrance and solemn consideration," Governor Sandoval said.
The first "Patriot Day" was declared on September 11, 2002, at Congress' request, by President George W. Bush. The day is Congressionally-mandated each year.
Joining the White House's call, the Governor also signed an executive order lowering the flag to half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Patriot Day. The Governor's order will keep flags at half-staff on Saturday as well in honor of the three National Guard personnel killed this week.
