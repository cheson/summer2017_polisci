A company that is moving to Northern Nevada will produce 1,650 all-electric utility vehicles by the end of the year at a $20.1 million, 150,000-square-foot production facility in Sparks.
Marianne McInerney, executive vice president of Cenntro Motor, told the Governor's Office of Economic Development board Thursday that the first Kombi EV vehicle would roll of the assembly line by late August or early September.
The company will offer 100 jobs and is moving its corporate headquarters to Sparks.
"I'm thrilled about this," Gov. Brian Sandoval said at the meeting, where the board approved $1.2 million in property tax deferrals and training grants as incentive for the move. "This is a great company that is going to do nothing but grow."
