By: Brian Sandoval
Date: April 2, 2013
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced that due to cost savings and negotiations with the Federal government, $25 million is available to advance important Health and Human Service initiatives and restore some general funds to critical programs.
"Caring for our most vulnerable populations while meeting the health care needs of Nevada's citizens has been among the most important priorities of my administration," Governor Sandoval said. "This funding will assist families, children and Nevada's mentally ill citizens while working towards an educated and healthy citizenry. I thank the Budget Office and the Department of Health and Human Services for their hard work on these important initiatives."
In a budget amendment to be submitted this week, the Sandoval administration will restore additional funding to child care subsidies totaling $4 million in the upcoming biennium and $11 million to Medicaid providers by increasing reimbursement rates. The budget amendment will also provide approximately $6 million in relief to Nevada counties by reducing the costs counties pay for Medicaid coverage to their citizens.
Working to protect public safety and continuing to create safe and livable communities continues to be a priority for the Governor. As such, in order to ensure Nevada's mentally ill population has access to needed services, the budget amendment will also contain $4 million to advance a jail and prison re-entry system to ensure seamless delivery of mental health services.
