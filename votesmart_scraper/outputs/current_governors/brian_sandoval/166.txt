Governor Sandoval's Statement on President Obama's Executive Order on Immigration
Statement

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval released the following statement after President Obama announced he would sign an executive order on immigration.
"Our immigration system is broken and it is without question that comprehensive reform is necessary. However, any solution to the greater problem must be a legislative solution, not a unilateral decision made by the executive branch. This announcement gives false hope to the millions of people across America who will continue to wait for a permanent solution. It represents dreams delayed by patchwork progress and expediency over good government. I encourage Congressional Leadership and President Obama to rise to the occasion of this challenge and work toward passing a bipartisan solution."
