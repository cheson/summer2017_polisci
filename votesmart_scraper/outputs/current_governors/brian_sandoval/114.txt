The Department of Defense announced more than $2 million in funding from the Military Services' Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Program for the sage lands habitat collaboration, a multi-agency partnership aimed at enhancing, restoring and protecting the sagebrush ecosystem around Naval Air Station Fallon's aviation training ranges.
The award will leverage more than $4 million in partner funding to protect over 11,000 acres of prime greater sage-grouse habitat underneath the Fallon Range Training Complex's (FRTC) 13,000 square miles of training airspace. Partners of the REPI proposal include the Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW), Naval Air Station Fallon, the Nevada Land Trust, The Nature Conservancy, the Nevada Conservation Districts Program, the Bureau of Land Management and the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service.
"This unique partnership between the military and environmental partners is the first of its kind in Nevada, and I appreciate having the military as a new partner in our efforts to protect sagebrush habitat and the greater sage-grouse," said Governor Brian Sandoval.
