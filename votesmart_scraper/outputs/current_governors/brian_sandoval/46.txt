Sandoval Extends Deadline for Southern Nevada Stadium Discussions
Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: July 13, 2016
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today signed Executive Order 2016 -- 21 amending Executive Order 2015 -- 09 which created the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee (SNTIC). This action was originally requested by SNTIC Chairman and Executive Director of the Governor's Office of Economic Development, Steve Hill.
The order extends the deadline for SNTIC to submit its final recommendations to Governor to September 30, 2016, giving the committee an extension of 60 days. The order also provides that the Committee may submit recommendations related to law enforcement needs associated with tourism infrastructure projects. The Governor released the following statement announcing the extended deadline:
"I created this body one year ago to bring community leaders together with many of the brightest minds in the gaming and hospitality industry to explore and prioritize projects and funding mechanisms to enhance Southern Nevada's ability to compete in an increasingly competitive market. The Committee has done an outstanding job in managing and pursuing a robust and complex agenda but its work is not complete. The additional time will allow the Committee to thoroughly evaluate sites for a potential stadium and work with private partners to finalize any recommendations for legislative action, and provides the opportunity for recommendations concerning the law enforcement needs of Southern Nevada. I would like to thank all of the members and the Southern Nevada community for hosting an open dialogue focused on maintaining Nevada's rightful place as the international standard bearer for global tourism, gaming, and conventions."
