Press Release

Governor Brian Sandoval made the following statement today after learning of the charges filed against online poker companies:
"Earlier this week I wrote to the Legislature about the need to preserve the integrity of gaming regulation, and today's federal action is a reminder of the complexity of this issue and the need for strict enforcement of the law. Nevada is the regulatory standard-bearer and we must continue to guard against any semblance of wrong-doing in our most important industry. While the allegations made today against these three companies are of grave concern, I remain committed to the prospect of federal legislation that will provide for Internet gaming in a way that applies the same rigorous standards to online companies that we apply to traditional gaming institutions. I have asked Nevada's gaming regulators to closely monitor the federal case."
