Nevada Selected to Host Ground-Breaking National Geothermal Test Site
Press Release

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) selected a site near Fallon, Nevada for their Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE), and $2 million in federal funds to launch the ground-breaking research project. FORGE will allow scientists and engineers to develop, test, and accelerate breakthroughs in enhanced geothermal technologies and techniques.
"Nevada's proud history of innovative geothermal development perfectly matches the FORGE concept to enable cutting-edge research, drilling, and technology testing," said Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval. "Being selected as a host state for FORGE confirms Nevada's status as a leader in geothermal energy."
FORGE will build on recent successes in structural modeling, drilling, CO2 sequestration, and enhanced geothermal systems that have attracted a cluster of geothermal excellence to Nevada and the Nevada System of Higher Education.
One of FORGE's long-term goals is to enable domestic access to a carbon free energy resource on the order of 100 gigawatts, or enough to power about 100 million homes. An open data policy will make the research project a leading resource for the broader scientific and engineering community studying geothermal energy.
"Nevada is blessed with tremendous geothermal resources and streamlined permitting processes that speed development," said Paul Thomsen, the Nevada Governor's Office of Energy Director. "The Geothermal Energy Association ranks Nevada #1 in the U.S. in installed geothermal per capita, and we are excited to add the ground breaking FORGE project to our rapidly growing portfolio of clean energy production projects."
