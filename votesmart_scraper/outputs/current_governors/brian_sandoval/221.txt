Sandoval Statement on Yucca Court Decision
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Aug. 13, 2013
Location: Las Vegas, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement in response to today's ruling by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia directing the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to restart the licensing process for the moribund Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository project:
"I am very disappointed that court saw fit to order the NRC to resume the Yucca Mountain licensing proceeding. Forcing the NRC to revive the effort is an exercise in futility, a waste of money, and an unproductive distraction from promising new efforts to find real, workable solutions. I remain opposed to the Yucca Mountain project and will aggressively pursue actions to prevent its construction."
