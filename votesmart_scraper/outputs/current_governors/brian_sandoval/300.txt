Governor Sandoval Statement on Redistricting
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: June 9, 2011
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement on reapportionment:
"Today, I signed AB570 creating new districts for the state Board of Regents. The bill, based on maps drawn by staff of the Nevada System of Higher Education, complies with the Voting Rights Act.
"The 2011 Legislature also presented me with two Congressional and legislative plans which were vetoed because of their failure to provide for the fair representation of the people of the state of Nevada and comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In my State of the State address, I said that legislative and Congressional districts should be drawn for a fair representation of all constituents--and that they be consistent with the law. On this important issue, I remain resolute in my determination to see that the new districts are fair and lawful. I am disappointed other available plans were not considered by the Legislature.
"As the Legislature has now adjourned sine die and failed to adopt an acceptable plan, I do not intend to call a special session to handle Congressional reapportionment and Legislative redistricting."
