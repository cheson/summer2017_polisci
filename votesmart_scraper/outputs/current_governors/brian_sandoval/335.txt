Sandoval Statement On Economic Forum Projections
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Dec. 1, 2010
Location: Reno, NV

Governor-elect Brian Sandoval made the following statement after the Economic Forum meeting today:
"Based on the agency submissions I have begun to review, state government will need to make approximately $1.2 billion in reductions.
"While the decisions which lie ahead will be trying, we must commit ourselves to them. Nevada families and businesses are suffering and our budget cannot worsen the problem. State spending cannot get in the way of economic growth by imposing new taxes.
"I recognize there will be challenging decisions ahead and I pledge to continue to work hard every day."
