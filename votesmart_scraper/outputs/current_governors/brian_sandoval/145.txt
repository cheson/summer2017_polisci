Governor Brian Sandoval today hosted a press conference at Washoe Lake State Park to address the water challenges and current drought conditions across Nevada. Sandoval opened the event by signing an Executive Order that will establish the Nevada Drought Forum. John Entsminger of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, John Foree of the Truckee Meadows Water Authority, Leo Drozdoff of Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and other state officials joined the Governor.
"Drought affects all Nevadans and we must work together to ensure a path to sustainability for future generations," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "The Nevada Drought Forum will bring together some of the best minds in the water science, conservation, government and industry sectors to ensure that Nevada's path forward is clear. The Forum will provide an opportunity for all Nevadans -- urban and rural, north and south -- to come together to help address this most critical challenge."
The drought forum will consist of members of local water municipalities, state government, higher education, and climate experts. The Forum will also call for affected industries, communities and local and federal partners to join in the conversation.
