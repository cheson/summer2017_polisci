Statement from Governor Sandoval on Yucca Mountain
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: March 16, 2017
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement after the release of the White House's fiscal budget plan which included funds to restart licensing for the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump in Southern Nevada.
"Regarding Yucca Mountain, let me make my position clear -- for the remainder of my term I will vigorously fight the storage of high-level nuclear waste in Nevada. Any attempt to resurrect this ill-conceived project will be met with relentless opposition, and maximum resources. Continuing down a path that seeks to force this unsafe and unwanted project on Nevada is a waste of time and money and only gets the country farther away from solving its nuclear waste problem.
I encourage the President to give the nuclear waste problem the same review process he has successfully applied to flawed contracts and government proposals so far. The private sector has demonstrated that they can address the problem of spent nuclear fuel more efficiently, at far less expense to the federal government, and they can do so in partnership with willing host states."
