Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval released the following statement after United States Senator Harry Reid announced he will not seek re-election.
"From humble beginnings in Searchlight to the United States Senate, Senator Reid's story is one that represents the Nevada and American dream. He is one of Nevada's native sons, a pioneer of the West who has always worked tirelessly to fight for Nevadans with a gritty determination, a testament to his early years. Senator Reid has been an influential voice in Congress on behalf of Nevada's interests, particularly on issues such as Yucca Mountain and renewable energy development. His service to Nevada as a State Legislator, Lieutenant Governor, Congressman, and Senator spans almost half a century and his legacy will last for generations. I would like to thank Senator Reid for his service to our state. I appreciate the opportunity to have worked closely with him to strengthen Nevada and remain committed to continue that work as he completes his final term," said Sandoval.
