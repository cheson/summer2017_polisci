Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Dec. 20, 2012
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced he will join with the state of Connecticut and states across the country in observing a moment of silence at 9:30am PT tomorrow, Friday morning, the 21st of December.
In a letter to Governors across the country sent on Tuesday, Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy asked his colleagues to observe a moment of silence and remembrance in their respective state in honor of the victims of last Friday's horrible tragedy in Newton, Connecticut. Governor Malloy's letter asks that the moment of silence occur at 9:30am in each state's respective time zone.
"I ask all Nevadans to join me in this moment of silence tomorrow," Governor Brian Sandoval said. "Observing a moment of silence is a fitting tribute to the lives taken much too soon last Friday."
Similarly to Governor Malloy, Governor Sandoval is asking places of worship and government buildings which have the capability, to ring bells twenty-six times in honor of each life lost during the moment of silence.
