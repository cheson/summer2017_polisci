Statement

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval released the following statement today in response to questions about refugee resettlement programs.
"Like many of my fellow governors, I am concerned first and foremost with the security of my state in the aftermath of Friday's tragic events in Paris. It is in the interest of all Nevadans and the millions who travel to our state annually to insist on extensive evaluations of any potential risk individuals may pose to Nevada or our national security. Earlier today, I asked state agencies to help determine the total number of refugees currently in Nevada. I have also contacted the White House and will follow up with a letter to President Obama requesting a review of the refugee eligibility, security, funding and notification processes for resettlement programs conducted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U. S. State Department and related agencies. We must balance our nation's role as an international leader with the safety and security of our citizens and visitors."
