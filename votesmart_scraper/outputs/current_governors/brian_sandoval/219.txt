Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Aug. 19, 2013
Location: Carson City, NV

Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval and California Governor Jerry Brown today issued a joint proclamation reaffirming a strong bi-state effort to protect people, property and natural resources in the Tahoe Basin through continued strong cooperation on wildfire preparedness and response capability. The joint wildfire proclamation focuses on continuing the work started by the 2008 California-Nevada Tahoe Basin Fire Commission created following the Angora Fire. A copy of the proclamation has been included with this release.
"This proclamation signals our ongoing support for integrated federal, bi-state and local activities related to wildfire prevention, as well as the importance of coordination should an incident occur," said Governor Sandoval. "Equally important in the proclamation is the commitment to provide outreach to residents and visitors alike to offer crucial information on how the public can help protect the Tahoe Basin from catastrophic wildfire."
The state chief executives signed the joint proclamation prior to the 17th Annual Lake Tahoe Summit where they gave remarks on the two states' shared responsibility for Lake Tahoe and its surrounding environment.
