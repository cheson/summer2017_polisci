Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today signed Executive Order 2012-15, establishing the Governor's Interagency Council on Veterans Affairs.
"Over the last decade, our country has been engaged in military conflicts around the globe and veterans returning to our state from these conflicts face significant hardships while transitioning back into civilian life," Governor Brian Sandoval said. "It is incumbent upon us as a society to provide the best level of service we can to our veterans and increased formalization of the State's approach to coordination between existing efforts is necessary and important."
Sandoval's order creates the council to work to identify and prioritize the needs of Nevada's veterans. The council "shall further work towards increasing the coordination of State government's efforts to meet the needs of veterans with the efforts of Federal and local governments, non-profit organizations and any other entities working towards meeting the needs of veterans."
"The Governor's Interagency Council on Veterans Affairs is a crucial aspect of our efforts to optimize the delivery of veterans' services in Nevada," Caleb Cage, Director of the Office of Veterans Services said. "Governor Sandoval's leadership on this and other veteran and military related issues will greatly improve our ability to coordinate statewide services for veterans and their families, and we appreciate his foresight in enacting this order."
Members of the council will be appointed by the Governor and the Director of the Office of Veterans Services will serve as Chair. The council will meet at least four times before December 31, 2013 and will deliver a report to the Governor on or before that date.
