Governor Brian Sandoval tonight issued the following statement after the Nevada State Legislature concluded the 78th Legislative Session.
"Over the past 120 days, representatives from across Nevada have worked tirelessly to set Nevada on a new course toward prosperity and opportunity. This session we enacted generational reforms that will transform the way we deliver education, made an unprecedented investment in our public education system, and implemented policies that will further propel our economic recovery. Most importantly, we have demonstrated that Nevada is ready to lead," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "I would like to thank Legislative Leadership and the members of the Nevada State Legislature for their commitment to our state and for their tireless work. I would especially like to recognize Minority Leader Marilyn Kirkpatrick and Assemblyman Harvey Munford who completed their final term this session. Assemblywoman Kirkpatrick has been a champion of working Nevadans and sound public policy. Assemblyman Munford has always been a friend to my office and I thank him for his support throughout the years. The efforts of the 2015 Legislature will be remembered as a proud chapter of the Nevada story. The legacy left by this body has laid the foundation for the New Nevada which will improve our state for generations to come."
