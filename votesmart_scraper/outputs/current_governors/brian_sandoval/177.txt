Governor Brian Sandoval, under constitutional and statutory authority, issued a state declaration of emergency today at 5:05 p.m. The declaration qualifies local governments for state and federal assistance associated with the excessive floodwater damage in Clark County and the Moapa Paiute Tribe Reservation. It also enables the state to move expeditiously on requests made by local jurisdictions. Prior to the declaration, Governor Sandoval directed a State Technical Assist Response Team (START) to determine the amount of damage to public infrastructure and work with the local community to determine private property damage in accordance with state and FEMA damage assessment criteria.
"My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been and remain affected by the floodwaters. My office will continue to monitor the situation and I have requested continual updates. The Nevada Department of Emergency Management and Department of Transportation have engaged with local authorities and will remain onsite with local responders," stated Governor Sandoval.
