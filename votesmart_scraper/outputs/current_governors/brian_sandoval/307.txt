Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement after Democrats released their tax plan:
"This morning, Senator Horsford and Speaker Oceguera briefed me on the Democratic plan for raising over a billion dollars in taxes. We had a frank discussion about our differences of opinion concerning the impact of raising taxes, and I restated my belief that raising taxes in this economy would be a mistake. Nevada is just beginning to demonstrate signs of economic recovery and this proposal would bring job growth to a halt, at a time when we have proven that growing our way out of this crisis can address our budgetary needs. In the last three months, we have been able to restore nearly half a billion dollars to the state budget, including millions for public education."
