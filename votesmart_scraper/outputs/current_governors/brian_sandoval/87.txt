Sandoval Statement on Solarcity Layoffs Announcement
Statement

Location: Carson City, NV

The Governor also responded to recent statements by Mr. Rive who encouraged the Governor to "do the right thing" with regard to the PUC's decision.
"I attempted to call Mr. Rive on Christmas Eve regarding his layoff of 550 SolarCity employees. Mr. Rive did not answer my call and I was later advised that he was in Mexico and unavailable. I am also unsure what Mr. Rive meant by his statement for me to "do the right thing.' If such a statement suggests that I somehow influence the PUC's decision Mr. Rive knows, or should know, that such conduct is inappropriate."
"My suggestion is that Mr. Rive respect the process and pursue his legal options which include seeking reconsideration of the order or ultimately judicial review. I have also called for the Nevada Consumer Advocate to engage in the case, which it has done."
"During my time as Governor, I have signed legislation benefitting the rooftop solar industry and supported an award of $1.2 million in economic development funds to SolarCity for employment and workforce development programs. I also signed legislation in 2015, with the public support of Mr. Rive, which initiated the very process at the PUC that he now disagrees with."
"I will continue to support the renewable energy industry in Nevada and capitalize on our state's incredible resources for solar, wind, and geothermal power. I will also respect the process at the PUC provided by law and, most importantly, assist the 550 employees SolarCity has laid off," concluded Governor Brian Sandoval.
