Brian's Education Plan
Press Release

This morning, I released my education plan. The education system in Nevada does not measure up and is not providing all our children with the world class education they deserve. With our graduation rates the lowest in the nation, it's time to get serious about reform and challenge the status quo.
It's time for a fundamental change from the ground up and the top down. We must fight for our kids with focused accountability, real consequences, expanded opportunities for choice, and more local control over funding. This is my commitment to every parent. You deserve nothing less.
Read my plan.
