Sandoval Issues Executive Order
Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: April 12, 2011
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval has signed Executive Order 2011-09 creating the Sunset Task Force, established to review the necessity of existing nonstatutory Executive Branch advisory bodies created by prior governors or department heads.
"Advisory bodies were last reviewed in 1977, and some advisory bodies have outlived their original mission and no longer provide valuable service for the people of the state of Nevada," Governor Sandoval said. "It is my belief that a systematic review of nonstatutory Executive Branch advisory bodies is required to ensure we eliminate those that are unnecessary to the service of the people of the state."
Composed of three members, the Task Force is chaired by former Senator Bill Raggio and the other two members are former Senator Bernice Mathews and former Senator Ann O'Connell. All members will serve without compensation or per diem. Staffing will be provided by the Governor's Office.
According to Governor Sandoval's executive order, the Task Force will complete its work by June 30, 2011 and submit a report to the Governor's Office no later than July 15, 2011.
"I am pleased that Senators Raggio, Mathews and O'Connell have agreed to intensively study this issue on behalf of their fellow Nevadans," Sandoval added. "Each has served our state well and I look forward to hearing their voices again."
