Governor Brian Sandoval this morning issued the following statement on the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech:
"Dr. King's "I Have a Dream' speech was a remarkable moment in history. In the midst of civil unrest, Dr. King stepped forward and confidently spoke about his dream for America's future. The promise of hope he offered millions was a call to action and a turning point in the civil rights movement. Today's anniversary marks a day cherished and honored by all Americans and I encourage Nevadans and all Americans to pause today and reflect on Dr. King's dream."
