Date: July 9, 2015
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today released the following statement after passage of United States Senator Dean Heller and Senator Joe Manchin's amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act. This amendment requires governors of states to be consulted during the development of their state's federal education plan which is a prerequisite to receive federal funding. Governor Sandoval currently serves as the Chairman of the National Governors Association Education and Workforce Committee which worked with Senators from both parties to develop a bipartisan coalition supporting the role of governors in determining education policy in their states.
"Strong collaboration between governors and chief state school officers is in the best interest of students, parents and educators in every state. I applaud Senators Heller and Manchin for their leadership on this important amendment and thank them for working with governors and chief state school officers to make this important change in federal education policy," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "The jobs of tomorrow require students to graduate from our schools both college and career-ready. A comprehensive education plan that coordinates local, state, and federal efforts will help ready our children to meet the demands of our emerging 21st century economy."
