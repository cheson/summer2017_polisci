Governor Brian Sandoval released the following statement after the Nevada State Senate passed Senate Bill 483, the Nevada Revenue Plan. This measure was approved by the Assembly last night and will now move through the enrollment process and to the Governor's desk for final signature. This measure will provide the necessary revenue to fully fund the Governor's budget which includes an unprecedented investment and reforms in education through targeted programs aimed at boosting student achievement.
"This vote symbolizes the turning of a page to a new chapter in the incredible story of the Nevada family. I would like to thank Majority Leader Michael Roberson for his leadership and dedication to facilitating a meaningful revenue discussion this legislative session. I also thank this bipartisan and remarkable group of legislators who worked to get this passed, especially Minority Leader Aaron Ford and State Senator Patricia Spearman for their persistence to get this accomplished. This plan is a blend of the very best ideas forged from bipartisan compromise with the vision of working toward fulfilling the principles and priorities of the New Nevada and the Nevada Blueprint," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "The legislature faced many challenges this session but none greater than the task of changing our education system to ensure that every child is given the opportunity to receive a first-class education. The passage of this bill begins a new era of public education in Nevada, a time when our students and schools are a priority in our communities."
