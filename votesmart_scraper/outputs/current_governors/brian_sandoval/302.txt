Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement after meeting again with Legislative leadership to discuss Nevada's state budget:
"We have been working diligently throughout the weekend and budget talks are ongoing. Since Friday, we have met a number of times to discuss the impact of the Supreme Court's decision, the need for reforms in our state and the best possible route to completing the legislative process by June 6th.
