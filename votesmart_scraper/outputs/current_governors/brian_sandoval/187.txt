Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: April 11, 2014
Location: Las Vegas, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement regarding the Bureau of Land Management's roundup and reports of organized protests against it:
"Earlier this week, I advised the BLM not to limit or hinder the constitutional rights of Nevadans and be mindful of its conduct. The ability to speak out against government actions is one of the freedoms we all cherish as Americans. Today I am asking all individuals who are near the situation to act with restraint. Although tensions remain high, escalation of current events could have negative, long lasting consequences that can be avoided."
