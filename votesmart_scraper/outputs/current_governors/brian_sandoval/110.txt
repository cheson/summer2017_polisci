Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today requested that Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt use all resources available to seek an expedited hearing of Duncan v. State of Nevada, a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada challenging legislation that establishes the Education Savings Account program in Nevada.
"More than two thousand Nevada families have applied for an Education Savings Account in order to take control of their child's future in education. It is clear that parents want the freedom to choose the best school to meet the needs of their students. The uncertainty and legal gridlock created by this lawsuit will significantly impact student success. This will only hinder our efforts to equip every Nevada student with the tools they need to pursue the opportunities available in the new Nevada economy," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "I believe it is in the best interest of the state and our education system to avoid these costly legal battles by seeking an expedited hearing on this matter and, if necessary, a final ruling by the Nevada Supreme Court. This will allow students, parents, educators, and the state to move forward and properly direct our focus toward collectively creating a system that provides children with the resources and learning environment they need to thrive and succeed."
