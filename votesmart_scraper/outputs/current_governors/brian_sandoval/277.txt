Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Feb. 1, 2012
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Sandoval today announced Nevada's selection by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for this year's Community Cyber Security Maturity Model (CCSMM) program implementation for two of Nevada's communities. The DHS program assists communities in assessing their cyber security awareness and preparing for cyber security issues that cross both the public and private sectors.
"Cyber security is a growing issue in our state and our country and I'm very pleased Nevada has been chosen for this award," Governor Sandoval said. "As we grow our technology infrastructure, Nevada needs to maintain a leadership position in this area."
Administered by the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (CIAS), an extension of the University of Texas -- San Antonio, the program consists of a 14-month training and exercise program focusing on community cyber security prevention, response, and recovery.
In a highly competitive process, Nevada is one of two states to be chosen this year. Clark County and Washoe County/Carson City are the two Nevada communities chosen for the program.
The Chief Information Officers for both the state and Clark and Washoe Counties are the official points of contact with the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (CIAS) for program implementation. Initial contact meetings with community leadership will begin on February 28, 2012 in Washoe County and on February 29, 2012 in Clark County.
