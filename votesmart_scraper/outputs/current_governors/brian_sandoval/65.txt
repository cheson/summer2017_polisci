Nevada's unemployment rate fell from (a revised) 6.3 percent in December to a seasonally
adjusted 6.2 percent in January, down from 7.1 percent a year ago. This equates to 89,400 Nevadans unemployed, compared to 185,000 during the recession.
"This year is off to an encouraging start in the Silver State," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "January job levels are up, and unemployment continues to show improvement. Nevada's solid labor market recovery is evident in trends over the past half-decade. Relative to the prior month, job levels have increased in every month but six since the beginning of 2011. We must remain vigilant in our endeavors to attract new industry and sustain our current businesses in order to solidify Nevada's place as a top competitor in a global economy."
Nevada added 7,800 jobs in January, bringing the total 34,000 higher than a year ago, said Bill Anderson, chief economist for Nevada's Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. In percentage terms, construction continues to lead the way, with job growth in excess of 10 percent over the year. In absolute terms, professional/business services added 9,200 jobs over the year.
"All told, job levels are the highest since mid-2008 and the unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since that time," Anderson said. "In coming off of its recessionary high of 13.7 percent, the jobless rate has declined from the previous month, or held steady, every month since October 2010. At the height of the recession, in late 2010, job levels stood more than 14 percent below the all-time benchmark. January's reading falls just 22,000, 1.7 percent, below the all-time high established in May 2007."
