Sandoval Statement on EPA Ozone Rule
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Sept. 11, 2015
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its final rule on the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone.
"As Chairman of the Western Governors Association, I issued a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency asking for a holistic approach in its determination as to whether or not to adjust to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone. Unfortunately, the ozone rule released today appears detrimental to certain Nevada counties and may unfairly punish our state based on factors outside of its control. Nevada has always worked as a willing and active partner in regulating our emissions and promoting clean energy - both of which are factors that directly contribute to the state's ground-level ozone standards. Additionally, in order to address the sources that affect Nevada's ground-level ozone, which are outside of our control, I recently signed an Accord with governors from China to begin discussions that commit both U.S. and Chinese states to support clean energy technology and energy efficiency. This will have a significant impact on Nevada and the entire western United States. I have asked the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to thoroughly review the final rule but must reserve the option to pursue all avenues available to protect Nevadans from the irreparable harm this decision may potentially cause."
