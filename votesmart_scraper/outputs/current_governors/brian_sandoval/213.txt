Sandoval Statement on Federal Government Shutdown
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval this morning issued the following statement regarding the federal government shutdown:
"While the full impact of a federal government shutdown is not entirely known, the State of Nevada is well positioned to handle a short-term shutdown. With current available resources, Nevadans who receive SNAP benefits, unemployment benefits, or Medicaid should not see a disruption in services. Public safety will also not be affected.
"My Administration has been working with state agencies gathering information on potential impacts, and will continue to do so as more information becomes available. It is my hope that Congress can find a way forward to fund the federal government. However, if that does not occur the State of Nevada is prepared."
