Governor Brian Sandoval was today appointed by the White House to the Council of Governors. The Council, which consists of 10 governors and is appointed by the President, is intended to serve as a mechanism for governors and key federal officials to address matters pertaining to the National Guard, homeland defense and defense support to civil authorities.
"The Council of Governors was created to strengthen coordination between state and federal governments in the face of threats such as natural disasters and terrorism," Governor Brian Sandoval said. "This bipartisan council supplies critical information to the Secretary of Defense, and I am honored to receive this appointment."
The Council of Governors was created by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008 and formally established by Executive Order 13528, issued on January 11, 2010. The Council of 10 governors -- five from each political party -- appointed by the President, is co-chaired by two governors.
