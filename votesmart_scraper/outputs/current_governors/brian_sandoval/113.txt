Governor Brian Sandoval released the following statement after meeting with President Barack Obama in Las Vegas, Nevada.
"I would like to thank President Obama for taking the time to visit the great state of Nevada and agreeing to meet with me on behalf of all Nevadans. Today we discussed several pressing issues facing the mountain west including conservation, economic development, and renewable energy. Most importantly, we discussed the critical need for efforts to protect populations of the greater sage-grouse to responsibly align with ongoing development efforts, which I firmly believe is achievable through a conservation plan based on cutting edge science, common sense best practices and collaborative decision-making. I am hopeful that our meeting today will serve as a stepping stone as we continue to navigate this important issue. Working together, I'm hopeful that we can preclude the need to list the greater sage-grouse just as we have done with the bi-state sage-grouse," said Governor Brian Sandoval.
