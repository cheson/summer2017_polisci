Sandoval Statement on Judge Wilson's Order on Education Savings
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Jan. 12, 2016
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement after District Court Judge James Wilson granted a motion for preliminary injunction stopping implementation of Senate Bill 302, Education Savings Accounts. This order will prevent the Office of the Treasurer from carrying out the program until further court deliberations can take place.
"I firmly believe the best approach to fixing Nevada's struggling education system must include providing the resources necessary for our public schools to improve as well as robust options for school choice. I also respect the legal process and appreciate the promptness of Judge Wilson's decision. This ruling makes clear what I have believed all along: the best avenue is to obtain an expedited and final ruling by the Nevada Supreme Court. Thousands of parents across Nevada are waiting for an answer."
