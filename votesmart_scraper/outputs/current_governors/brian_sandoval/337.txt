Health Care Bill
The recently passed congressional health care bill fails to reduce costs on small businesses, increases costs to states and is completely at odds with the transparency promised by our country's leaders. For Nevada, penalizing businesses and individuals who cannot afford to purchase health care and raising taxes billions of dollars will further harm the economy of our state.
Health Care Lawsuit
As a strong state's rights advocate, I am disappointed by the Attorney General's refusal to join several other states in a suit against the federal government alleging the violation of state's rights under the U.S. Constitution.
The constitutional questions created by the health care bill are monumental in all future matters involving states rights and other constitutional issues. I believe they warrant review by the courts, and Nevada should be a party to that action.
