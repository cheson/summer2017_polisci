Sandoval Statement on President's ACA Announcement
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Nov. 15, 2013
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement after President Obama announced the federal government will not enforce selected portions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA):
"I opposed Obamacare from its inception. However, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld it, every state and every American was forced to abide by it. As a state, Nevada's only choice was whether to let the federal government control the process or manage the process ourselves. We rightly opted for the latter. Now, despite our best efforts to comply with this ill-conceived law, the failure at the federal level has made this effort in Nevada significantly more difficult or even impossible.
"Without a doubt, the President's actions this week are a direct acknowledgement that the law is unworkable. What's more, the announcement yesterday does not fix any problems and only adds more confusion. I strongly urge the President and Congress to reconsider this law."
