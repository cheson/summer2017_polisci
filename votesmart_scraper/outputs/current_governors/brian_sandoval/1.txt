Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: June 21, 2017
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement in response to United States Secretary of the Interior Rick Perry's opening remarks in front of the Senate Energy & Water Subcommittee.
"I appreciate Secretary Perry clarifying his comments and agree the issue of nuclear waste is one that has vexed the nation. I encourage the Secretary to pursue consent-based interim storage solutions, and to review Senate legislation, co-authored by Senator Heller, that lays out a politically and scientifically viable plan for a long-term, consent-based, permanent solution."
A copy of the transcript of Secretary Perry's remarks can be found below:
"I want to add some clarity to a statement I made yesterday in front of the House if I could, just a short clarification of remarks I made yesterday about nuclear waste and interim storage. And I want to be crystal clear with this committee and with others that while there are a number of options that we've talked about on how to deal with these issues, no decisions have been made at this time with respect to the timing or location, for that matter, of waste storage. There are no plans, I think it is appropriate to say, there are no plans for interim storage at this particular time for interim storage in New Mexico, Nevada or Texas or any other site. Any such plans would obviously require coordination with [Congress], with the federal, state and local officials. The waste issue is a dilemma that we have a responsibility to address and yesterday what I was doing was attempting to convey my interest in working with Congress to bring resolution to this issue and that's all I was saying. My point is, let's work together and find solutions to the challenges that vex us and have been in front of us for a while and I'm eternally optimistic, sir, that we can do that in a way that serves this great country."
