At the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association (WGA) in Park City, Utah, the WGA announced that Governor Brian Sandoval has been elected as Vice-Chairman of the organization.
"I am honored to have been chosen for the Vice-Chairmanship of WGA," Governor Sandoval said. "From natural resources to human resources, western states face unique challenges and the WGA provides a forum for Governors to listen and learn from one another. I am looking forward to expanding the ongoing discussions at WGA and I thank the WGA for this opportunity."
Established in 1984 through the merger of two Governors' organizations, the Western Governors' Association is an independent, non-partisan organization of Governors from 19 Western states, two Pacific-flag territories and one commonwealth. The Association was formed to provide strong multistate leadership in an era of critical change in the economy and demography of the West.
