Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement after the release of the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce's Tax Foundation study.
"The report issued today by the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce's Tax Foundation is utterly irresponsible, intellectually dishonest and built upon erroneous assumptions. I know I am not alone in expressing my disappointment in the Chamber's judgment especially for an organization that repeatedly claims to want to help move Nevada forward. Moreover, this act sits in direct contradiction to what the Chamber's leaders have expressed to me on several occasions privately in my office," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "The only good to come from this stunt is that for those of us who are working in good faith to solve Nevada's education challenges, it removes all doubt about where the Las Vegas Chamber stands. I believe the Chamber's leaders have done their membership a terrible disservice and have harmed the credibility of an organization that purports to stand for education," concluded Sandoval.
