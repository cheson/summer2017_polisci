Sandoval Statement on Basin and Range Monument Designation
Statement

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement today on President Obama's Basin and Range Monument Designation.
"Nevadans and our federal delegation have worked together for generations to conserve, protect, and maintain our precious natural resources. Where the federal government asserts ultimate jurisdiction, Nevada has been, and continues to be, a willing partner with federal agencies and administrative bodies. The Basin and Range Monument designation, however, bypassed Congress on a public lands issue in which Nevada and our entire delegation should have had a primary role in working collectively to build consensus as we have done successfully in the past," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "While we all share a common goal of preserving our lands for the use and enjoyment of generations to come, I would have preferred a more collaborative process when making such an important designation. I firmly believe our local ranchers, environmentalists, and community stakeholders are the best experts in ensuring Nevada's lands are preserved, protected and accessible."
