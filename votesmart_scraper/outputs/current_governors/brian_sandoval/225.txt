Governor Brian Sandoval today made the following statement regarding the Pedlar Fire near Silver City:
"On behalf of all Nevadans, I want to extend my deepest thanks to the fire personnel who have been working tirelessly and diligently since Sunday afternoon to contain the Pedlar Fire near Silver City. Their jobs are never easy and as they continue to battle this fire, I want them to be assured of our continued gratification for their service.
"The Nevada Division of Forestry currently has resources committed to the Pedlar Fire, the Willow Creek Fire, outside of Eureka County and the Goat Peak Fire. The Division has also committed resources to wildfires burning in Colorado. The Division and our state's Emergency Preparedness teams continue to monitor the weather and stand ready to move at a moment's notice. I thank them as well for their service to our state.
"As all Nevadans are aware, with the record-breaking heat and drought-like conditions our state has been experiencing, wildfire danger is always present. I encourage all Nevadans to be alert, be aware and educate themselves on how to prevent and prepare for a wildfire by visiting LivingWithFire.Info. Working together, I am confident we can be better prepared in the event a wildfire begins again in our state."
