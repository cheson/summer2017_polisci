Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced the appointed members of the Spending and Government Efficiency (SAGE) Commission for K-12 public education. Passed by the 78th Session of the Nevada Legislature and signed into law by Governor Sandoval, Assembly Bill 421 created the SAGE Commission as one of many public education spending accountability measures. The SAGE Commission represents a diverse group of leaders across the state with deep experience and expertise in K-12 and higher education, government, public policy, operations, finance, and community development.
"This legislative session, we made an unprecedented investment in Nevada's public education system and implemented systemic reforms and accountability measures. I believe that the pursuit of providing a high-quality education for all students should also include regular assessments of how we can best use our limited resources and maximize taxpayer dollars," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "I am confident that the Commission will bring a thoughtful diverse perspective and help identify areas of improvement to the state's delivery of education."
