Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Sandoval today received a briefing from Nevada Homeland Security and federal intelligence personnel concerning public safety after the death of Osama bin Laden:
"While there are no indications of advanced plotting efforts that impact Nevada directly, law enforcement will remain vigilant in the search for suspicious activity by radicalized individuals. Nevadans can do their part by reporting suspicious activity such as individuals loitering for no apparent reason to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available."
