Location: Las Vegas, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today met with leaders of veteran service organizations in Las Vegas to discuss how the state can better serve Nevada's veteran population. In a proclamation earlier this year, the Governor announced 2014 as the Year of the Veteran, and at this meeting signed an Executive Order establishing the Women Veterans Advisory Council.
"Our nation's veterans have selflessly served our nation, and have made tremendous sacrifices on our behalf. It is critically important that we do everything we can to support and care for our country's heroes once they return home," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "Today, I had the privilege to meet with leaders of a number of veteran organizations to discuss how our state can better serve our veterans and seek greater collaboration with the organizations that represent them."
At this meeting, Governor Sandoval also signed Executive Order 2014-08, which establishes the Women Veterans Advisory Council. This council will consist of five members appointed by the Governor from throughout the state to focus on issues impacting women veterans.
"It has been a priority for me and my Administration to make Nevada the most veteran friendly state in the country. The Women Veterans Advisory Council will help continue our commitment to Nevada's veterans by focusing on the unique needs of women veterans. This effort will build upon the work we have done, and help further our goals to provide the best services possible to our state's veteran population," added Governor Sandoval.
