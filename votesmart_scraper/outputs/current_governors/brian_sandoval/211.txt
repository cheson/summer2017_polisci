Governor Brian Sandoval today began a trade mission to Israel, focusing on three key areas of similarity between Nevada and Israel: water technology, indoor agriculture, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).
"With similarly arid landscapes and complimentary expertise in water resource technology and management, Israel and Nevada have already established a partnership that will help both of our States into the future," Governor Brian Sandoval said. "With Nevada's System of Higher Education playing an important role, this trade mission will help to solidify Nevada's presence in the world regarding water technology and will also introduce the opportunities for advancement in Nevada's UAV, indoor agriculture, and technology commercialization sectors."
In 2012, Nevada exports to Israel totaled $129,054,837 and Nevada imported a total of $144,041,317 from Israel. Israel is Nevada's tenth largest export/import country.
The gubernatorial-led delegation includes staff of the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development, members of the Nevada System of Higher Education and members of Nevada's business community.
