Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement on the 12th anniversary of 9/11:
"Twelve years ago today, our nation experienced the most callous attacks on our soil in history. While we were shocked, saddened, angry and shaken, over the last twelve years, we have remained vigilant, resilient and grateful for the sacrifices made that day and after. On this anniversary, we gather to remind ourselves of the responsibilities of being a free and enduring nation -- we are proud, patriotic, optimistic and resolute.
"All Nevadans are proud of the dedication, resilience and prowess of our military, those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and those who have served our great nation. I ask all Nevadans to take a moment today to remember those we lost on 9/11 and the service and sacrifice of all Americans who step forward and work to make our country greater every day."
