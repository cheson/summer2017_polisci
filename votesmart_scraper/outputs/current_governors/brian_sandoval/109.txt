Governor Brian Sandoval, Chancellor Dan Klaich, and Truckee Meadows Community College President Dr. Maria Sheehan today announced that the Northern Nevada College Apprenticeship Consortium was awarded $2.9 million from the U.S. Department of Labor, American Apprenticeship Award program. The Consortium is a partnership between Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC), which will serve as the grant administrator, and Western Nevada College (WNC).
The award will develop the career skills of 400 northern Nevadans for jobs at Tesla, Panasonic, and other manufacturing companies over the next five years. The program is aimed at developing the work skills and increasing workforce opportunities for members of underrepresented populations, lower-skilled or disadvantaged populations, and veterans.
"Developing a skilled workforce is a vital next step in ensuring Nevada's continued economic growth," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "This grant has been awarded at a time when so many Nevadans, especially our veterans returning from service overseas, are seeking opportunities to upgrade their skills and change careers. I commend TMCC and WNC for taking the steps necessary to prepare their students for the potentials found in the new Nevada economy."
