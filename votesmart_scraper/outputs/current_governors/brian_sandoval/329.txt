Governor Sandoval Statement on Nevada Unemployment Numbers
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Jan. 21, 2011
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval made the following statement today after learning that Nevada's unemployment has increased from 14.3% to 14.5%:
"The news this morning that Nevada's unemployment rate has increased is extremely distressing to me. My heart goes out to those struggling to find work, and at the same time I am reminded of the fragile nature of our economy. We must change course.
"The sheer number of unemployed in our state is exactly why I've said we cannot burden struggling businesses with tax increases, and why we cannot ask the struggling family to pay more. We must allow sunsetting taxes to expire at the end of June and provide businesses the environment in which to begin hiring again. I ask all leaders of our state to keep this in mind as the Legislature begins."
