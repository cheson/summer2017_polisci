Governor Brian Sandoval today received notice that an agreement has been reached between NV Energy, Solar City, the Nevada Public Utilities Commission (PUC), and the Bureau of Consumer Protection with regard to the PUC net metering rate case.
"I asked the major companies involved in the issue of net metering to work together and reach a resolution that benefits Nevada ratepayers and solar customers and ensures Nevada maintains its status as the national leader in clean and renewable energy. I am pleased with the result and believe it is in the best interests of all Nevadans. I am hopeful that the PUC will act quickly on this agreement. It is time to move on," said Governor Brian Sandoval.
