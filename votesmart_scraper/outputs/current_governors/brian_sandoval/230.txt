Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today released the following statement after learning of Senator Michael Roberson's legislation to strengthen existing gun law:
"As a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, I believe we must protect law abiding citizens' right to bear arms. However, I also believe that individuals with mental illness who have been determined to be a danger to themselves or the community should not have access to guns. It is critically important that we take steps to improve how Nevada reports these individuals. I want to commend Senator Roberson for his attention to this important issue and his efforts to strengthen existing law."
