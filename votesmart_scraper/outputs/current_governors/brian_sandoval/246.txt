Sandoval Statement on Sequestration
Statement

"Though I remain hopeful that federal leaders in Washington can come to the table to find a solution to avoid sequestration, I want my fellow Nevadans to know that I will do everything I can to mitigate the potential effects of sequestration on our state.
"Should sequestration go into effect, we must deal with the real world impacts of the cuts and guide Nevada through this period. Unlike elected officials in Washington, we must take swift action to mitigate the extensive consequences. My Administration started planning for sequestration last summer, knowing we may need a contingency plan should it go into effect. While we have worked to set money aside and have a plan to move forward, there are still some areas of the budget which will be affected.
"What's more, beyond our state budget, Nevada has a large federal presence. So whether you are a rancher who relies on the BLM for grazing permits or a traveler who relies on air traffic controllers, the potential impacts on our state's economy are great.
"We are continuing to plan for the effects of sequestration, but I know that Nevadans are resilient. I also know that even with sequestration looming over our country, Nevada will overcome and thrive because we will do what it takes to move our state forward."
