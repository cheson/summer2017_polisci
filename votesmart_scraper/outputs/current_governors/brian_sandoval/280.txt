Governor Brian Sandoval today made the following statement after the release of the news that Nevada has again made gains in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP):
"I was encouraged to hear this morning that our state has again made gains in reading and math proficiency in the fourth and eighth grades. It's no secret that over the last several years, Nevada has faced serious challenges which have led to funding reductions in our state's education system. The fact that despite our challenges we continue to make progress in our classrooms is good news for Nevada's students and parents. The commitment and resiliency shown by teachers and students alike is indicative of our Nevada spirit -- working together, we can and we will continue to improve education in our state."
