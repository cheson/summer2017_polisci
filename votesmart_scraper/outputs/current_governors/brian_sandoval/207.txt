Sandoval Announces Veteran Initiatives
Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Nov. 12, 2013
Location: Carson City, NV

During his speech at the Nevada State Veterans Home yesterday, Governor Brian Sandoval announced two new veteran initiatives.
The first will benefit military families, the veteran community and veteran service providers statewide through statewide surveys and the second, a state flag program, will benefit deployed service members.
"If Nevada is going to best meet the needs of our service members and veterans, then we need to ask them what they need most," Governor Brian Sandoval said. "These surveys will allow the military community to help shape efforts at the state level going forward. Regarding the state flag program, as Nevadans celebrate 150 years of statehood, I can think of no better way to honor our heroes than to send a small piece of home to them."
The Governor's Office has created the three online surveys to allow members of the military community input on state initiatives. The anonymous surveys are available on the Governor's website.
The flag program will make it so that friends, supporters, family members and others can request that a Nevada state flag that has flown over the Capitol building be shipped to a Nevada service member who is serving abroad. The program will be administered through the Nevada Department of Veterans Services at no charge.
