Governor Brian Sandoval today called for bridge funding for Washoe County School District following its announcement yesterday of a likely budget shortfall.
"Yesterday, my office and state fiscal experts worked with the legislative counsel bureau and WCSD to review where an alleged error in the formula may have occurred causing a potential shortfall in the WCSD budget. While there is no state error, I do believe bridge funding is necessary to avoid budget cuts that affect children and teachers in the upcoming school year. At the end of the day, and this late in the budgeting process, failing to respond to this fiscal problem will hurt students. This funding will give Washoe County time to reconsider its budgets. I hope the legislature will respond to this request prior to the close of session so WCSD can prepare for the upcoming school year."
