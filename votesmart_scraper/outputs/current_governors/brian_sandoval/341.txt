Economy & Taxes
Nevada has a business-friendly, low tax environment. As the only candidate for Governor to put forth a plan to help solve our state's budget crisis without raising taxes, I do not believe in raising taxes. If we plan to compete for new jobs, new industries and a more diverse economy, we must not change our low tax environment in Nevada. This means stopping a corporate income tax in its tracks.
Response To Nevada's Short-Term Budget Deficit
With Nevada facing a budget shortfall and difficult decisions, I felt it was important to present a plan to save more than $500 million without raising taxes and avoiding mass layoffs. We were the only campaign to do so.
