Thanksgiving is a time for all Nevadans to reflect and give thanks for the blessings of the past year and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. This time-honored tradition was inspired by the conclusion of the harvest and the breaking of bread between Pilgrims who came to America searching for freedom and new opportunity and Native Americans who introduced their customs and helped these first settlers adjust to a new world. We remember the merging of two worlds on that first Thanksgiving as a vital part of our great American history and summon their strength and spirit as we face the challenges of tomorrow.
As Nevadans and Americans, we have an abundance of reasons to be grateful. The golden west continues to be a beacon to the world. People from across the globe are drawn to our western spirit and we are thankful that so many talented and hard working men and women call Nevada home.
I am grateful for the men and women who dedicate their lives to public service and work tirelessly for all Nevadans. All of our state employees have committed themselves to make the Silver State the very best state and for that I give thanks every day. It is truly fitting that we take the time to celebrate this day as a day of thanksgiving.
On behalf of the state of Nevada, I wish all of you and your loved ones a safe, festive and happy Thanksgiving weekend.
