Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Aug. 24, 2015
Location: Las Vegas, NV

Governor Sandoval will hold a private meeting with President Barack Obama later this afternoon, at the Governor's request, primarily to discuss the potential listing of the greater sage-grouse as an endangered species. The meeting will take place following Governor Sandoval formally welcoming President Obama to Nevada at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas.
"I would like to thank Senator Heller for hosting Nevada and California leaders and stakeholders, in a spirit of partnership, to address the issues that are important to preserving our shared natural heritage in Lake Tahoe. While another critical issue has caused me to miss the Lake Tahoe Summit for the first time as Governor, my commitment to preserving this national treasure and my partnership with the Tahoe congressional delegation and Governor Brown could not be stronger," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "I am proud of what Nevada has accomplished this past year and look forward to continuing our work together, as we explore new and better ways to keep Lake Tahoe the most beautiful place in the world."
