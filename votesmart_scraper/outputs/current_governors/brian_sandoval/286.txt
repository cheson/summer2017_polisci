Governor Brian Sandoval today made the following statement after receiving a briefing from the National Transportation Safety Board regarding Friday's crash at the Reno Air Races:
"I appreciate the NTSB and all agencies involved in the response and investigation providing elected officials with a briefing today and I thank them for their work. Even as our community continues to mourn, it will be important to allow the NTSB time to fully investigate Friday's crash.
"The Reno community has risen up in the face of extreme challenges, a fact highlighted today when the NTSB described the response from first responders as "tremendous.' I could not be more proud of the outstanding response from the Nevada family."
