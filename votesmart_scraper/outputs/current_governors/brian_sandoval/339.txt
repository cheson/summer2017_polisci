Public Corruption - Created The Unit That Prosecutes Them
Elected officials must actively work to protect the trust placed in us by citizens. As Attorney General, I set up the first public integrity unit to investigate and prosecute officials who violated the public trust and I am committed to restoring honesty and integrity to state government.
Death Penalty
Individuals who violate the trust of our society should be punished for their actions. For those who commit the worst crimes, I support the death penalty.
