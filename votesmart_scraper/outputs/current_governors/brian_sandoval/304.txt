Sandoval Statement on Armed Forces Day
Statement

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Sandoval today issued the following statement in honor of Armed Forces Day tomorrow:
"Since 1950, a single Armed Forces Day has served to commemorate our men and women in uniform. The single-day celebration stemmed from the unification of the Armed Forces under one department, the Department of Defense. Armed Forces Day served then and now as an educational program for civilians, one in which there would be an increased awareness of the Armed Forces. It was designed to expand public understanding of the work and the role of the military in civilian life.
"By any measure, the men and women of the United States Armed Forces who have fought over the past decade have earned their place among the greatest of generations. The resilience of our War fighters and their families never fails to amaze me. They represent the best of America. As Governor, I am honored to work with the Nevada National Guard and I thank all of our Armed Forces for their service."
