For more than 150 years, Nevadans have celebrated this cherished holiday season filled with an abundance of traditions, festivities, and endless generosity.
In homes across the Silver State, many families place the final ornament on their Christmas tree and gather in celebration of the birth of a child more than 2000 years ago -- a child whose miraculous life and teachings changed the world.
Two weeks ago, I joined with members of our community to light the Capitol menorah to celebrate the Festival of Lights. This holiday is another celebration of miracles and a rededication to the faith which sustains so many Nevadans.
No matter what beliefs we hold true and dear, this is a time when we benefit from pausing in our daily routine to think of others. The message of goodwill toward men is a timeless one that speaks to people of all backgrounds and beliefs. The understanding that "to give is a greater blessing than to receive" is an enduring virtue that embodies the heart of this special season.
As the Sandoval family prepares for our celebration of Christmas, our thoughts turn to all Nevadans celebrating the joys and miracles of the holidays. Whether you are continuing generations-old family traditions or spending the holiday creating new ones, we hope that the spirit of the season fills your hearts and homes with happiness and peace. And for our troops at home and abroad, know that the entire Nevada family holds you in our thoughts and prayers now and all year long.
