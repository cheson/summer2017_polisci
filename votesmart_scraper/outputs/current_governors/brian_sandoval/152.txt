Press Release

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today signed the Homeowner Protections Act of 2015, Assembly Bill 125, an act relating to construction defect litigation. The Legislature approved the bill on Friday, February 20 for signature and final authorization. The bill makes numerous changes to Chapter 40 of the Nevada Revised Statutes which governs legal actions pertaining to construction defects.
"During my State of the State address, I challenged the Legislature with passing meaningful construction defect reform. They have met that challenge with the Homeowner Protections Act, which discourages frivolous litigation and strengthens Nevada's rebounding housing market. This piece of legislation incorporates bipartisan perspectives brought forth by policymakers and leaders of industry for more than a decade. I would like to thank Assemblyman Ira Hansen for leading on this issue," said Governor Brian Sandoval.
