Statement from Governor Sandoval on BLM Draft EIS on Proposed Mineral Withdrawal
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Dec. 29, 2016
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement after the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced the draft Environmental Impact Statement to withdraw a subset of lands that are in sage-grouse habitat from future mining claims.
"Today's announcement does nothing to protect the greater sage-grouse, but does cripple the mining and exploration industry. It is an unfortunate end to our collaborative efforts with this administration. I am hopeful the new administration will consider the limited ecological benefits of this withdrawal. I have consistently said that I believe a withdrawal is unnecessary and does not move the needle for the greater sage grouse, and will deliver the same message in the future. If the incoming Secretary of the Interior decides to continue with this withdrawal strategy, I would encourage the Department to adopt the Nevada plan which expands the habitat, protects the sage-grouse, and allows lithium development and the mining industry to remain vibrant."
