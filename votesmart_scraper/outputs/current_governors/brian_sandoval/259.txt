Statement
By: Brian Sandoval

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval this morning made the following statement regarding August's unemployment numbers:
"While I am disappointed that Nevada experienced another slight uptick in the unemployment rate, I am encouraged by the fact that we continue to see signs of modest economic improvement, measured on a year-over-year basis, in these numbers. The improvement, however, is not enough to sustain our economy, which is why we must continue to work to diversify our state's economy and bring jobs to Nevada."
