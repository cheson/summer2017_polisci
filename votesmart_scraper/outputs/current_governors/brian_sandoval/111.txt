Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval released the following statement after the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota issued an order granting a preliminary injunction in favor of Nevada and other states who are parties to the Water of the United States litigation.
"I am encouraged by the court's decision to issue a preliminary injunction against the Environmental Protection Agency's expansion of the Clean Water Act. The court's decision illustrates that the EPA's proposed rule poses irreparable harm to the state of Nevada and warrants immediate court intervention," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "Nevada continues to collaborate with the federal government on issues ranging from sage-grouse management to land conveyances, as demonstrated just this week in Yerington. However, on issues pertaining to intrastate water resource conservation and management, ultimate regulatory authority belongs with the state of Nevada."
