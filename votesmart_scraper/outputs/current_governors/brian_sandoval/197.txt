Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Jan. 7, 2014
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement on the Senate's procedural vote to move forward on Senator Dean Heller's bill (S. 1845) to extend unemployment insurance through March.
"It was with a heavy heart that I learned of the death of my friend, mentor and colleague Bernie Anderson. A graduate of Bishop Manogue High School and the University of Nevada, Reno, Bernie was also a member of the Nevada National Guard. Bernie dedicated his life and his career to education and received the Teacher of the Month award from the Reno/Sparks Chamber of Commerce in October 1985. I will always fondly recall his leadership as Chairman of the Assembly Judiciary Committee, his passion for his constituents and his respect for those who testified before the committee. Kathleen and I extend our deepest condolences to Bernie's wife, Clyda, their children, and his extended family and friends."
