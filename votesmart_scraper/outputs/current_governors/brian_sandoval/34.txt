Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Oct. 14, 2016
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement after final passage of Assembly Bill 1. This legislation enables the Clark County Commission to authorize a sales tax increase in order to exclusively fund more police officers for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.
"During the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee meetings, the issue of public safety was brought to the forefront due to the significant population increase across southern Nevada. Protecting Nevadans and the millions of visitors who travel here annually has always been a top priority for me. I would like to thank the members of the legislature for responding to the urgency of this request in order to provide the resources for our law enforcement officials to continue to keep our communities safe. Their approval of Assembly Bill 1 is another step toward an enhanced level of vigilance so that we are able to take every measure possible to prepare for the new threat levels in today's society."
