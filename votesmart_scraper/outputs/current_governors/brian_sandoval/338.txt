Issue Position

With three children in Nevada's public school system, I have a vested interest in education. I believe we must focus on accountability with consequences and expand opportunities for choice. We should no longer allow salary schedules based on tenure and seniority; instead, we should use pay-for-performance scales. I support school choice which would allow students to attend another public school or a private school. I support ending the social promotion of our children and expanding empowerment, charter and career and technical schools.
We must reform Nevada's teacher licensure laws to allow more professionals to enter the teaching field and expedite the process to allow educators from other states to become licensed here.
