Nevada Honors 9/11 Victims and Heroes
Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Sept. 11, 2014
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Sandoval ordered all flags at half-staff today in remembrance of the men, women and children who lost their lives on 9/11. Thirteen years ago today, nearly 3,000 innocent people were killed in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and on Flight 93 near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
"Many Nevadans remember with sadness exactly where they were when they learned of the horrific attacks that shook our nation thirteen years ago, and the tragic events of that day are forever etched in our national consciousness. The loss inflicted on our country on 9/11 was devastating, and with each passing year our commitment to remembering the fallen grows stronger. Today we hold their memory in our hearts and we honor the legacy of the first responders and heroes in uniform who set aside their own safety to protect the lives of others," said Governor Sandoval.
