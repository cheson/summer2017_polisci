Sandoval Signs First Two Policy Bills of Session
Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: March 17, 2011
Location: Carson City, NV

This morning, with Speaker of the Assembly John Oceguera and Director of Administration Andrew Clinger present, Governor Brian Sandoval signed the first two public policy bills of this Legislative session. Sandoval previously signed SB 1, funding the Legislative session, on February 11th.
Sandoval signed AB 127, a bill sponsored by Speaker Oceguera which eliminates the requirement that employees of the Senate and Assembly compile and prepare sets of books containing bills, resolutions, journals and histories during each legislative session. The information will now be published electronically using the Legislative website NELIS.
"I am proud to join 17 other states in our country in instituting paperless systems and I applaud the Speaker for taking the lead on this initiative," Governor Sandoval said. "Making information available electronically not only helps our environment, it gives Nevadans near-instant access to the facts and figures before committees and their representatives."
Sandoval also signed AB 15, sponsored by the Budget and Planning Division, which eliminates the requirement to produce the statistical abstract and the Biennial Report. The Biennial Report will be consolidated into the overall Governor's Priorities and Performance Budget publication. The Priorities and Performance Budget publication also contains the data previously published in the statistical abstract.
"This bill is a direct result of the Budget and Planning Division taking a hard look at its priorities and deciding to use our resources more effectively," Governor Sandoval added. "What's more, by consolidating information into one publication, we are making it easier for Nevadans to locate the data they are interested in and making government more responsive."
