Governor Brian Sandoval today released the following statement after receiving early reports of explosions late Wednesday evening in Panaca, Nevada.

I received briefing information late last night from the Nevada Department of Public Safety and the Division of Emergency Management. Due to the early reports, I have directed the Director of the Department of Public Safety Jim Wright and Chief of Emergency Management Caleb Cage to travel to the site to monitor the situation and deliver periodic updates to my office. The State Fire Marshall, Nevada Highway Patrol, and the Nevada Division of Investigations are also assisting. I will be in contact with Lincoln County officials this morning and will offer any and all additional state resources available should the local law enforcement and first responder community require them."
