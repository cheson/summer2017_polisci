Governor Brian Sandoval today made the following statement regarding the Clark County School District's Race to the Top application:
"I am deeply disappointed the leadership of the Clark County Education Association decided to block the Clark County School District's application for $40 million in federal funds through the Race to the Top grant. The Race to the Top federal grant can be used to hire additional teachers and provide much-needed support to some of our most at-risk students. I am particularly supportive of the District's plan to use technology and early-intervention strategies to help the District's growing number of English language learners catch up to their peers faster.
"In a conversation with U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan today, he advised me that the deadline for Race to the Top grant applications has been extended until this Friday, November 2, at 1:30pm PT. It is important we take advantage of every opportunity to provide much-needed relief to our schools and our children and I urge the Clark County Education Association to reconsider its position and work with the School District on Clark County's application. If necessary, I will personally meet with CCEA and the School District to get this done for our children."
