Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Nov. 4, 2015
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced counties in Nevada will receive more than $1.9 million in additional Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) funding from the United States Department of the Interior. These monies were appropriated by Congress and became available in October following the initial disbursement of more than $23 million in June of this year. This additional money brings Nevada's total 2015 distribution to more than $25 million which will help local government leaders provide basic public services to their constituents.
"PILT payments provide local governments with the necessary funds to pay for critical infrastructure needs in cities and towns across Nevada. Additionally, it allows local leaders to prepare to meet the demands of our growing communities," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "I would like to thank the members of our Congressional delegation for their hard work in securing this additional money. I would also like to recognize the Department of the Interior for fulfilling its obligation to compensate local communities for the land owned by the federal government in Nevada."
