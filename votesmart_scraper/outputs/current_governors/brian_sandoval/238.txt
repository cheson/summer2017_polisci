Sandoval to Meet with CA Governor Jerry Brown to Talk TRPA Energy
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: April 25, 2013
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval this morning will meet with California Governor Jerry Brown to talk about the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) and renewable energy production in Nevada.
The meeting, which has been scheduled for several weeks, will focus on Lake Tahoe. Both Governor Sandoval and Governor Brown have been discussing the management of the Tahoe basin since the 2011 Tahoe Summit. Today's face-to-face meeting will continue discussions on issues facing Lake Tahoe and TRPA. While in Sacramento, Governor Sandoval will also meet with State Senator Fran Pavley from California's 27th State Senate District on Lake Tahoe and TRPA. Senator Pavley is the sponsor of California's SB 630 which would remove CA from the TRPA.
"Nevada and California have a long history of collaboration, beginning with Governors Reagan and Laxalt and as we move forward on a new management plan for the Tahoe Basin, it is critical that both states have an open dialogue," Governor Brian Sandoval said. "Regional partnerships are important for both states. While responsible management of the Tahoe basin is a priority, we also share common interests in renewable energy production in Nevada and its transmission."
