Nevada Governor Sandoval and the Environmental Protection Agency's Administrator Pruitt Discuss Key Environmental and Economic Issues
Statement

Location: Washington, DC

First and foremost, I want to thank Administrator Pruitt. The meeting went great. There are some issues in Nevada associated with bonds on mines as well as a potential Superfund site. The Administrator and his staff were fantastic. Their willingness to listen, their willingness to give us face time, and their willingness most importantly to work with us and potentially visit Nevada, it's fabulous. It has a tremendous amount of meaning, particularly to our mining industry in Elko and Yerington Nevada for this potential Superfund site. Again, I think everyone out there in the state should be appreciative of Administrator Pruitt and his staff and their willingness to listen and their willingness to work with us and solve problems immediately.
