Governor Brian Sandoval released the following statement today after the Nevada Attorney General filed a motion seeking an expedited appeal of District Court Judge James Wilson's ruling which placed an injunction on implementation of education savings accounts.
"I would like to thank both Attorney General Adam Laxalt and Lieutenant Governor Mark Hutchison for working together and moving this issue forward in an expedited manner. I know that both parties firmly support school choice and I recognize the Attorney General is defending state law passed by a majority of the Legislature and the Lieutenant Governor is working to help Nevada families who are seeking a timely response. I am hopeful that a final decision on all legal challenges to the ESA program will be reached so that the thousands of Nevada families who are waiting to utilize this sweeping education reform receive certainty quickly."
