Sandoval Statement on Meeting with Secretary Rick Perry
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: March 27, 2017
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement after meeting with United States Secretary of Energy Rick Perry at the Supreme Court Building in Las Vegas, NV.
"Secretary Perry and I have a longstanding friendship which began prior to my first election as Governor of Nevada. He informed me that he would be in Nevada and requested a meeting. We met today in Las Vegas and had a frank conversation on an array of issues. This meeting was not the beginning of a negotiation with regard to Yucca Mountain. I reaffirmed my unwavering opposition to any potential progress toward developing the site as a potential destination for high-level nuclear waste. Nevada has always worked with our federal partners on issues that could affect the Silver State, but the storage of high-level waste at Yucca Mountain is not something I am willing to consider."
