Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: May 3, 2017
Location: Carson City, NV

"The safety of all Nevadans and the millions of visitors who travel on our highways and roads is always the top priority in applying a speed limit increase. I've traveled on every highway in the Silver State and have experienced the remote and quiet roads unique to Nevada. The Department of Transportation and Nevada Highway Patrol have concurred that this is a safe stretch of highway to increase the current limit and the state will continue to study other Nevada highways to possibly implement this policy,"
