Statement
By: Brian Sandoval

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced that the Nevada Department of Veterans Services has been awarded an approximate $3.5 million grant that will fund required maintenance to raise and align headstones that have begun to shift in the ground at the Southern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery. The Operation and Maintenance Grant, #NV-10-13, has been awarded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
"Our maintenance crews take immaculate care of the cemetery grounds on a daily basis," the Governor said. "But over time the soil has begun to give way around some of the older headstones. This grant will greatly assist us in the restoration of the proper posture of the markers. It represents another step Nevada is taking to honor those who have served our nation."
