MY FELLOW NEVADANS:
TODAY, WE MAKE HISTORY. TOGETHER, WE ARE FULFILLING THE PROMISE OF OPPORTUNITY MADE IN THE VERY BATTLE THAT CARRIED NEVADA INTO THE UNION. NEARLY 150 YEARS AGO, STATEHOOD CAME TO NEVADA IN THE MIDST OF CIVIL WAR -- A WAR TO PRESERVE THE UNION AND FOREVER BREAK
THE YOKE OF SLAVERY IN OUR NATION. AND TODAY WE REJOICE IN THE PROOF THAT VISIONARY PROMISES CAN BE KEPT.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, I AM HONORED TO HAVE SHARED IN THIS HISTORIC MOMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND THE EXAMPLE YOU SET FOR US ALL.
IF ONE PROMISE HAS BEEN KEPT TODAY, NEW PROMISES ARE BEING MADEPROMISES OF OPTIMISM AND CONTINUED OPPORTUNITY.
WE GATHER AS A PEOPLE TO REFLECT ON THE FUTURE BEFORE US.
BUT AS I BEGIN MY TERM OF OFFICE, I CANNOT HELP BUT LOOK BACK AS WELL.
I AM REMINDED OF THE STRUGGLES AND TRIUMPHS THAT HAVE SHAPED OUR STATE. I AM REMINDED OF OPPORTUNITIES REALIZED THROUGH THE COURAGE OF OUR FORBEARERS.
FROM THE HARD‐SCRABBLE LIFE OF THE EARLY PROSPECTORS AND MINERS, TO THE INNOVATIVE SPIRIT OF FARMERS WHO DARED TO IRRIGATE THE DESERTFROM THE COUNTLESS WORKERS WHO RAISED A WONDER OF THE WORLD IN THE HOOVER DAM, TO THE THOUSANDS WHO FLOCKED HERE TO FIND PROMISE IN THE HOSPITALITY AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIESNEVADANS BELIEVE IN OPPORTUNITY.
