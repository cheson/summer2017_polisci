"The gaming industry is changing and in order for Nevada's businesses to maintain a competitive edge internationally, we must enact policies that allow the industry to meet the demands of a younger, more technologically engaged gamer. The groundbreaking online gaming bill previously passed by the legislature provides local businesses with an environment where they can grow and prosper. This measure also ensures our regulatory bodies, which are considered the best in the world, will continue to develop policies that will ensure Nevada remains the global epicenter for gaming development," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "Furthermore, as a former Attorney General, Gaming Commission Chairman and someone who worked with the industry and the Legislature on Nevada's online poker legislation, I am very concerned that anyone representing the state's legal interests would speak out against current state law in our leading industry. At its core, this is a state's rights issue and I disagree with the Attorney General that a federal government one-size-fits-all solution is in the best interest of Nevada."
