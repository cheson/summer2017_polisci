Statement
By: Brian Sandoval

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval made the following statement this afternoon regarding the Nevada State Supreme Court's ruling in the Clean Water Coalition case:
"The Supreme Court decision in Clean Water Coalition v. The M Resort v. State of Nevada has far-reaching implications for how Nevada governors and legislatures will do business from this date forward. The ruling raises questions about certain assumptions in the proposed executive budget, despite some having been used in the past. As a former federal judge, I am cognizant of the legal issues. As governor, I am forced to deal with their ramifications and I am responding by reworking the state budget. I will announce a revised plan on Friday."
