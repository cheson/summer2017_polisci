Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: June 29, 2015
Location: Carson City, NV

Today, Governor Brian Sandoval authorized the Nevada Attorney General to file suit challenging the new federal "Waters of the United States" rule. Sandoval released the following statement after the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers issued a Final Rule which greatly expands the scope of waters covered by the Clean Water Act.
"Nevadans have worked together for generations to conserve, protect, and maintain our precious natural resources. Nevada has been, and continues to be, a willing partner with federal agencies and administrative bodies," Governor Sandoval said. "The Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Nevada Department of Agriculture and the Colorado River Commission of Nevada submitted significant comments on the Clean Water Act Proposed Rule: Definition of "Waters of the United States" prepared by USEPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Upon release of the Final Rule, it was evident that Nevada's comments were not addressed by the federal agencies. Therefore, I authorized the Nevada Attorney General to join in this lawsuit opposing the Final Rule."
