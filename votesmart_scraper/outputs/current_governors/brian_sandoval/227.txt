Sandoval Signs TRPA Bill
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: June 6, 2013
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today signed SB 229, the TRPA bill, which provides for the repeal of certain provisions set forth in S.B. 271 of the 2011 session, is a direct result of the compromise worked out between Governor Sandoval and California Governor Jerry Brown earlier this year.
"I was proud to sign SB 229 today," Governor Brian Sandoval said. "Nevada and California have a long history of shared partnership and this bill will continue that. This new law renews our commitment to work together to do what's best for the environment and economy of the Lake Tahoe region. Responsible management of the Tahoe Basin is a priority and I look forward to working with California to get Congressional approval."
SB 229, which repeals Nevada's threat to withdraw from the TRPA, is contingent on similar legislation be enacted in California before January 1, 2014.
