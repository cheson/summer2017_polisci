Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement in response to the reports of attacks in Paris.
"My heart is broken by the tragic news of today's horrific attacks in Paris. As Americans, this is a time of the year when we reflect on all that we are grateful for, and today's tragedy should remind us that life is precious, and that each day we are given with our loved ones is truly a blessing. In light of the unimaginable loss so many in Paris have suffered, the time I will spend with my family tonight will be all the more meaningful. I invite my fellow Nevadans to join me and my family as we reflect upon today's events and pray for peace for the victims and their families.
I have ordered the Office of Homeland Security and Department of Public Safety to monitor the situation and have requested continuous updates."
