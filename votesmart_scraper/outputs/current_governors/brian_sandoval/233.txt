Governor Brian Sandoval this morning issued the following statement after the release of April's unemployment numbers:
"I am pleased that we had solid job growth in April which included another decline in the unemployment rate. Our current 9.6 percent unemployment rate is significantly below the state's all-time high of 14 percent and compared to a year ago, our state has gained 20,000 jobs.
"Difficult circumstances, however, continue for many of our fellow citizens and Nevada still has a long way to go. We must continue to pursue sound workforce and economic development policies which help all Nevadans benefit from expanding job opportunities."
