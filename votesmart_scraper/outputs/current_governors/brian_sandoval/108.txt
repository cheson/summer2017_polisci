Sandoval Response to Lawsuit Threatening School Choice
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Sept. 10, 2015
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement today after a private group filed the second lawsuit against the state of Nevada's Education Savings Accounts program.
"My office was notified by Educate Nevada Now that its representatives would file an additional lawsuit against Nevada's sweeping school choice effort. My position has not changed. I strongly support school choice and I firmly believe that an expedited hearing and, if necessary, a final ruling by the Nevada Supreme Court is in the best interest of all parties," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "I hope that these cases will be consolidated in the interest of judicial economy because they both target the same legislation and potentially deprive parents of the opportunity to determine the educational future of their children. An expedited hearing will remove any uncertainty as parents and educators across Nevada work toward creating a stronger education system where students can succeed."
