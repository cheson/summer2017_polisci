Governor Sandoval Statement on Medicaid Expansion
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Dec. 11, 2012
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced he will include 78,000 additional people in Nevada's Medicaid Program and decrease the Modified Business Tax for Nevada businesses:
"Though I have never liked the Affordable Care Act because of the individual mandate it places on citizens, the increased burden on businesses and concerns about access to health care, the law has been upheld by the Supreme Court. As such, I am forced to accept it as today's reality and I have decided to expand Nevada's Medicaid coverage.
"My fiscal year 2014-2015 budget will provide 78,000 additional Nevadans with health insurance coverage through Medicaid, which is estimated to save the state general fund approximately $17 million dollars in mental health savings. My executive budget will also help Nevada businesses cope with the burden placed on them by decreasing the modified business tax. My decision to opt-in assists the neediest Nevadans and helps some avoid paying a health-care tax penalty. As part of my proposal, I will also call upon the Legislature to pass Medicaid patient responsibility cost-sharing measures.
"I will commit to working with the Legislature if anything changes at the federal level. At any point during the Legislative session, if there is any sign of change at the state or federal level, it may alter my support for expansion."
