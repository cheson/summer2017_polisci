Governor Brian Sandoval made the following statement this afternoon after being briefed by the Department of Administration on possible state funding available for the Caughlin Fire:
"I am satisfied the state has the ability to provide assistance to Reno and Washoe County following today's fire. The state has in excess of $3 million available for local government and state agency grants or loan reimbursement. The funding, subject to a process through the Board of Examiners and the Interim Finance Committee, can be used toward the 25% state match to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grant Nevada was approved for this morning.
"I would like to commend the work of local, state, federal and National Guard officials in responding to today's events. They have valiantly stepped forward to assist their fellow man today, exemplifying the resilient spirit of our state."
