Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Oct. 22, 2013
Location: Tel Aviv, Israel

As he begins the final day of his trade mission to Israel, Governor Brian Sandoval today addressed the Water Technology and Environment Control Exhibition and Conference (WATEC) in Tel Aviv.
"Nevada and Israel are both challenged by our arid regions and as a result we both recognize the opportunities our homelands have given us," Governor Brian Sandoval said. "New technologies and smart solutions are essential for Israel to meet the water demands necessary for a growing and vibrant population and industrial sector and the same can be said for Nevada. I look forward to continuing to work with Israel and WATEC to expand on the opportunities available to us."
Accompanied at the conference by representatives from the Desert Research Institute, the Governor spoke extensively about the planned Center of Excellence (COE) in Las Vegas. The COE will be based on coalescing and coordinating areas of excellence and expertise in specific technical areas that already exist at DRI, in collaboration with IBM computing and programs, and SNWA practical applications in water resources.
