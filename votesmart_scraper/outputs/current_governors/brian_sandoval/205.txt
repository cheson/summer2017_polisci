Sandoval Statement on Affordable Care Act
Statement

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement regarding the Affordable Care Act:
"The fact is the President misled the American people when he promised they could keep their insurance if they liked it. His statements last week did nothing to remove the Obamacare mandates that have resulted in cancelled insurance policies. Furthermore, those in Congress who supported this law should have known that implementing these mandates would result in cancelled policies. The very real and harmful consequences of this ill-conceived law are now being experienced by not just Nevadans, but people throughout the country.
"The only way to fix the problems resulting from this law is to change the law itself. So, I again call upon the President and Congress to act swiftly. I firmly believe Obamacare must be dramatically changed or repealed
