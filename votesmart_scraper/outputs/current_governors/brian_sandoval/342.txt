Yucca Mountain is the proposed site for the permanent storage of the nation's high level nuclear waste. As Attorney General, I opposed the project because the federal government could not demonstrate that the site could properly protect the health, safety and welfare of the men, women and children of Nevada. If there is a safe, alternative use for the site, I would welcome it.
