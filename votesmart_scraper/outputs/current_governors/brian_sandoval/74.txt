Public Statements
State, Community Leaders and EPA to Continue Discussions on Anaconda Site
Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Feb. 10, 2016
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval received the attached letter from District IX Regional Administrator Jared Blumenfeld of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in response to the Governor's January 29th letter which insisted on more time for the State to continue to meet and engage with local officials, tribal leaders, and stakeholders in order to reach a solution regarding the clean-up of the Anaconda Copper Mine site. Governor Sandoval issued the following statement in response to the letter:
"I am encouraged that the EPA will remain involved in the discussion related to the Anaconda Site and the Administrator has agreed to hear directly from the local stakeholders and leaders of the affected community. For more than a decade, this community and the State of Nevada have worked with the EPA toward achieving our shared goal of fully cleaning up the site. The health and well-being of the community remains my top priority and I have been assured by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection that there are no imminent concerns regarding the health and public safety of the residents. The fact that the EPA has consented to at least 60 days for Nevada's additional review indicates to me that the agency agrees we have time to get this right, without immediate risks to public health as some have alleged. I understand that the EPA believes there is a heightened sense of urgency due to regulatory timelines, yet we know that a Superfund designation on the National Priorities List will not guarantee funding and that the list has not been fully funded since 1995. I remain committed to working together toward achieving our shared goal of fully funding a comprehensive clean-up in a timely manner. I would like to thank Administrator Blumenfeld for his prompt response and sincerely appreciate his continued willingness to work with the State of Nevada on issues important to our residents."
