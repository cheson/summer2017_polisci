Senior Advisor to the Governor Dale Erquiaga today issued the following statement after the Legislature passed AB568:
"AB568 was introduced and passed under emergency procedures in a matter of hours.
"We believe the legislative budget process should be open and transparent, yet today's action is contrary to those goals.
"Because of this, the Governor will not comment until we've had a chance to review this legislation in full."
