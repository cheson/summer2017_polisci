Press Release
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: July 8, 2016
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today signed Executive Order 2016-19, ordering all flags at the State Capitol and State public buildings and grounds to be flown at half-staff effective immediately and until Tuesday, July 12, 2016 as a mark of respect and in remembrance of the victims in Dallas, Texas.
"Nevada joins the law enforcement community across the nation in grieving the loss of life following the horrific attacks last night in Dallas, Texas. These officers were defending democracy and ensuring peaceful protests, a cornerstone of our American values, when they were brutally targeted. There is no justification for any senseless murder or attack on an innocent victim. At the beginning of this week, we celebrated the birth of our nation, a place built on the promise and proposition of freedom, equality and independence for all Americans. This weekend, I hope all Nevadans reflect on the power of our history and consider the type of communities we are working to build, not only for ourselves but, most importantly, for the generations to come.
I have ordered the flags to fly at half-staff until Tuesday, July 12th as a silent tribute to those laid down their lives as a result of this tragic attack. My office is in constant contact with the Nevada Department of Public Safety and Division of Emergency Management and state resources will be available should local law enforcement request them in the wake of this tragedy," said Governor Brian Sandoval.
