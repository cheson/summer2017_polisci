Governor Sandoval Statement on the Economic Forum
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: May 1, 2015
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement after the Economic Forum made their final projections for the biennium.
"It is encouraging that Nevada's statewide job growth continues to increase at a robust rate and projections indicate this year we will outpace pre-recession job levels. The Economic Forum provided many positive economic indicators but in order to move Nevada forward, we must change our revenue structure," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "It is my job to be honest with the people of Nevada about our entire economic outlook. Our current revenue structure is not capable of fulfilling the demands of our growing population and not adequate to achieve the priorities and principles of the New Nevada. I remain committed to working with the Legislature on passing a budget that modernizes our schools and classrooms, directly invests in our students, and stabilizes our state revenue framework."
