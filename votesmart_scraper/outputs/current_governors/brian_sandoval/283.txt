Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian and First Lady Kathleen Sandoval participated in Pearson Foundation's Read for the Record Day by reading at schools in Reno and Las Vegas today. The book Llama Llama Red Pajama was read in schools throughout the state.
Governor Brian Sandoval read in Las Vegas at Our Lady of Las Vegas, Whitney Elementary School and Odyssey Charter School.
"Yesterday, I spoke in Las Vegas about my desire to end the practice of social promotion in our schools," Governor Sandoval said. "Reading is the most critical skill we can give students, and we must take steps to ensure they are proficient by the third grade and therefore better equipped for life-long learning. Today's reading program throughout our state emphasized this same commitment."
First Lady Kathleen Sandoval read at four Reno schools including Roy Gomm Elementary, Stead Elementary, Desert Heights Elementary and Mariposa Academy.
"Reading is such an important component of a student's learning process and it's vital to start early," First Lady Kathleen Sandoval said. "I enjoyed reading to kindergarteners and first graders in the Washoe County School District and I encourage them to read Llama Llama Red Pajama with their families tonight."
As part of Read for the Record Day, the Pearson Foundation, a national sponsor of the day, provided copies of the book to each student the Governor and First Lady read to.
