Governor Brian Sandoval this morning signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Governor Eruviel Ávila Villegas of Mexico to strengthen the relationship between the State of Nevada and the State of Mexico.

"Today, we are building on the foundation we laid in July," Governor Brian Sandoval said. "This MOU identifies specific ways we can promote tourism and artisanal, cultural and artistic exchanges between Nevada and Mexico. I am pleased that Governor Ávila wishes to continue our partnership and I look forward to the opportunities today's MOU presents."
The MOU signed today states that, "As a follow-up from the official visit of Governor Brian Sandoval to Mexico, in order to strengthen the relationship between the State of Nevada and the State of Mexico, due to the great similarities in several development sectors within both entities, as well as the social, cultural, and economic synergies which have been identified to further drive these mutual efforts;  Both leaders agree to coordinate exchanges with the municipal governments which are part of the State of Nevada and the State of Mexico, in order to partake further projects of this Agreement."
