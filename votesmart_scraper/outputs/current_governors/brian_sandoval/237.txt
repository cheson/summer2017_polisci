Sandoval Announces Further Action Taken at Rawson-Neal
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: April 29, 2013
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement on further disciplinary action taken at Rawson-Neal based upon internal investigations of patient discharges. Late last week, the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services concluded a review of all out of state transports between July 2008 and March 2013:
"Over the weekend, I reviewed the results of the investigation into patients transported out of state. All individuals who violated release policies have been or will be disciplined. These disciplinary actions include terminations effective today. While the investigation showed the vast majority of patient releases were done correctly, it also revealed policies were not followed by certain individuals. I will continue to evaluate the need for further action if necessary.
"In addition, we have obtained proposals from national experts in the mental health field to provide an objective and comprehensive analysis of our state facilities to ensure that best practices are being implemented and followed. As I have stated before, improperly discharging one patient is one patient too many. It is important to me and all Nevadans that we treat our most vulnerable members of society with dignity and care."
BACKGROUND:
Today's action comes after a full review of the roughly 1500 patients who were transported out of state since July 2008. In addition to the actions taken today, state-wide discharge policies for patients transported out of state have been strengthened, and a formalized chaperone policy has been instituted.
