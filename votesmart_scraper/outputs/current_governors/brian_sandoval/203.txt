Sandoval Statement on DOI Announcement
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement after the Division of Insurance announced that it does not have the discretion to rescind cancellation notices:
"In light of the confusion surrounding the President's announcement that individuals can keep their cancelled health insurance policies, the Nevada Division of Insurance sought legal guidance from the Attorney General's office, and it has been determined that the Division does not have the discretion to ignore the law. The only way to fix the problems resulting from Obamacare is for Congress to change the law itself."
