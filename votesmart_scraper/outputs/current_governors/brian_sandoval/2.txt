Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement in response to U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry's remarks during a House Appropriations Energy and Water Subcommittee budget hearing today. During the hearing, Secretary Perry doubled-down on his desire to make Nevada the nation's nuclear dumping ground by suggesting he would like to consider interim storage of high-level nuclear waste at the Nevada National Security Site in the short term.
"Today's comments by Secretary Perry suggesting he would consider storage of high-level nuclear waste at the Nevada National Security Site come as a complete blindside and I view this as a total disregard and failure to honor the historical process. The idea of storing high-level nuclear waste at the National Security Site is ill-conceived, irresponsible, and likely illegal," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "This is a prime example of federal overreach and Nevada will pursue every legal option at our disposal. Today, I've asked the Nevada Attorney General to review this misguided proposal and identify legal avenues to stop it. This is further than even the most fervent pro-Yucca advocates have gone and like Yucca Mountain, this idea is a non-starter. Let me be clear, no part of Nevada will be home to the world's most toxic waste and we will fight every effort that puts our citizens at risk."
