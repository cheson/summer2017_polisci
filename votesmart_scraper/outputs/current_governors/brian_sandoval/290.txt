Governor Brian Sandoval has returned to Carson City and was briefed by the Carson City Sheriff's Department, the Department of Public Safety, his Homeland Security advisor and the National Guard on this morning's shooting at the International House of Pancakes in Carson City. At the briefing, he was joined by Carson City Mayor Bob Crowell.
"Mayor Crowell and I wish to extend our sympathies to the victims of today's tragedy and their families," Governor Sandoval said. "The Mayor and I also want to assure all Nevadans and especially residents of Carson City that everything is being done to ensure the public's safety. All authorities on the local, state and federal level are cooperating effectively and appropriately."
While information will continue to flow through the Carson City Sheriff's Office, Sandoval has ordered activation of the state's Joint Information Center (JIC) to provide support. The JIC, a function of the state's Department of Emergency Management, will be staffed with a Public Information Officer to assist the Sheriff's Office. Additionally, the Sheriff's Office will hold a 3:00pm PT news briefing today.
Sandoval has also ordered flags to half-staff beginning today until Friday at dusk in honor of the two National Guardsmen who were killed. Details on the victims will be released by the National Guard.
