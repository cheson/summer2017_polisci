Nevada's unemployment rate ticked down to 6.7 percent in September, which is down 0.l percentage point from August, demonstrating the 55th consecutive month of annual declines. The unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since July 2008.
"I'm pleased that the jobless rate in Nevada continues to trend down. I am encouraged that more Nevadans continue to reenter our workforce as prospective job seekers while confidence in our economy continues to build," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "We remain on pace to reach our pre-recessionary record levels of employment in mid-2016. In fact, some sectors have already reached that threshold. Still, there remains room for improvement and I will continue to pursue opportunities that will help strengthen and diversify our economy," said Governor Brian Sandoval.
