Sandoval Statement on Sunset Taxes
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: March 13, 2012
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today made the following statement regarding budget instructions for the 2013 Legislative session:
"On Thursday, the Budget Office will be releasing budget instructions for the next biennium as we prepare for the 2013 Legislature. In order to avoid cuts to education and other essential services, revenues from the sunset taxes will need to be continued. While taking into account mandatory caseload growth, primarily in Health and Human Services, federal mandates such as the Affordable Care Act, and critical infrastructure needs, my budget instructions will call for "flat" budgets which will rely on some or all of the revenue from the sun setting taxes.
"Let me be clear, as I've said before, the economy is improving, but I believe we must begin this budgeting process with all the information available. In addition to avoiding further cuts to education, this decision means there will be no need for tax increases in the next session. Nevadans will pay no more than they are in the current biennium.
"The budget building process remains ongoing, but we must begin today."
