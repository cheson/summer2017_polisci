Governor Brian Sandoval made the following statement this morning after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Arizona v. United States:
"While I have always supported Arizona's tenth amendment right to enact laws to address its unique concerns with public safety and have said all along the law is not needed in Nevada, I understand and respect the Supreme Court's application of the Supremacy Clause. This decision makes it clear that the President and Congress must come together and reform our immigration system."
