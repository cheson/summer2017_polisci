2nd Amendment
As a former Federal Judge, I respect the rule of law. I strongly believe that the 2nd Amendment applies to individuals. I believe that all citizens have a right to firearms for sporting and self-defense purposes. I also support concealed carry laws.
States' Rights (10th Amendment)
I have a profound respect for the United States Constitution and believe it should be strictly interpreted. The Tenth Amendment, which is the foundation for the expression of state's rights, is extremely important in the face of continued federal intrusion upon state's rights. As Governor, I will aggressively protect Nevada's state's rights under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
