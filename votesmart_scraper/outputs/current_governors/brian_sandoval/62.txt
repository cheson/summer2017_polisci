Sandoval Proclaims April Autism Awareness Month in Nevada
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: April 4, 2016
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval has proclaimed the month of April Autism Awareness Month in Nevada. Sandoval signed this proclamation to highlight the state's ongoing efforts to provide resources, assistance, and support for children and families affected by autism. Since the beginning of his administration, Governor Sandoval has led the effort to increase overall funding for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) treatment from $1.8 million to $73 million. Assembly Bill 6, which the Governor signed into law in 2015 represents a significant component of these new resources. This legislation expanded coverage for applied behavioral analysis for children up to the age of 21 and adjusted the cap on insurance payments for treatment from $36,000 to $72,000.
In addition to proclaiming Autism Awareness Month in Nevada, the Governor's Mansion will participate in the international "Light It Up Blue" Campaign to recognize World Autism Awareness Day today, Saturday, April 2. This represents Nevada's continued support for autism research and early diagnosis. Governor Sandoval encourages all Nevadans to participate in similar efforts and join him in raising awareness concerning issues related to autism.
