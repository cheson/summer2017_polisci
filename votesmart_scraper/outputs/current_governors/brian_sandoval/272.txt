Sandoval Statement on Sage-Grouse Advisory Committee
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: April 3, 2012
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval made the following statement this morning after releasing an executive order establishing a Greater Sage-grouse Advisory Committee:
"Listing the Greater Sage-grouse as a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) would have significant adverse effects on our state. The courts have ruled that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service must re-evaluate the status of the Greater Sage-grouse by September 30, 2015 and the U.S. Secretary of the Interior has invited the eleven western states -- including Nevada -- to develop state-specific regulatory mechanisms to conserve the species and preclude the need to put the Greater Sage-grouse on the ESA list.
"As such, it is in the interest of our state to bring stakeholders and experts together to recommend a course of action that will provide for conservation measures sufficient to preclude the need to list the Greater Sage-grouse. I look forward to the work of the Advisory Committee and await receiving their recommendations no later than July 31, 2012."
