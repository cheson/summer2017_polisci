Sandoval Calls for Weighted Student Funding Formula Increase
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: May 1, 2017
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement after the Economic Forum made their final projections for the upcoming biennium which will begin July 1, 2017.
"Throughout Nevada we are witnessing expansive growth in traditional industries and robust development in diversification. It is reassuring that State revenues are also generating growth and keeping up with dynamic population increases. Today's projections add nearly $100 million to the State's bottom line for the next biennium. We do have unanticipated demands in corrections and emergency response, however I would like to see a majority of this new revenue go directly to education, specifically to students in K-12. I introduced the weighted student funding formula last session and this additional money provides a unique opportunity to invest directly in students who are economically disadvantaged, English learners, gifted and talented, and in special education. This is a student-first formula where funding follows a student and is based on their specific needs."
