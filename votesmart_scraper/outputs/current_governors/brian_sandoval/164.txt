Sandoval Statement on Economic Forum Projections
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: Dec. 3, 2014
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval issued the following statement today after the Economic Forum forecasted the state's projected revenue for the upcoming biennium.
"While I am encouraged by positive economic indicators such as job creation and the falling unemployment rate, I am also reminded that our traditional revenue sources are not keeping pace with our state's growth demands. Today's Economic Forum report reminds us yet again that our revenue structure is not built to meet the demands of our changing economy nor our continued increase in statewide population. Before I finalize and submit the state budget, I will ask my Cabinet to further scale back agency budget requests so that we can factor into account today's projections."
