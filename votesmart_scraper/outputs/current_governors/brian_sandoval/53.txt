Location: Carson City, NV

"I am very sorry to hear of the passing of Coe Swobe, a member of what I would call the Honor Guard of Nevada leaders who made invaluable contributions to our state," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "Driven by a passion to preserve Lake Tahoe and its pristine waters, Coe was instrumental in the creation of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. He worked with then-Nevada Governor Paul Laxalt and then-California Governor Ronald Reagan to ensure Lake Tahoe maintained its beauty and rightful place as a national treasure. Coe's legacy will live on in our state through his daughters Caryn and Jackie. Kathleen and I extend our deepest sympathies to the family and will keep them in our prayers during this time."
