Statements from Governor Brian Sandoval and Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto on Ninth Circuit Ruling
Press Release

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval and Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto released the following statements in response to the ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals today which struck down Nevada's same sex marriage ban.
"The ruling today confirmed my previous position that the State's arguments against same sex marriage are no longer defensible in court. The SmithKline decision in February changed the legal standard which is why we originally withdrew our appeal. I respect the decision of the Court," said Governor Brian Sandoval.
"We are encouraged by the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, although the Ninth Circuit has filed its decision in the case, it has not yet issued its mandate. The parties have 14 days to seek reconsideration or seek a stay to file an appeal with the United State Supreme Court. County clerks should work with their respective district attorneys on the appropriate course of action," said Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto.
