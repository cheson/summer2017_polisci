Governor Brian Sandoval today made the following statement after signing Assembly Bill 114, internet gaming legislation:
"This is an historic day for the Great State of Nevada. Today I signed into law the frame work that will usher in the next frontier of gaming in Nevada. This bill is critical to our state's economy, and ensures that we will continue to be the gold standard for gaming regulation.
"I want to thank Assemblyman Horne for his work on this very important issue, and Senate and Assembly leadership for making this legislation a priority. This effort shows what we can accomplish when we put our party labels aside and work together as Nevadans."
ABOUT AB 114:
The bill, heard by a Joint Judiciary Committee hearing this morning and approved by the Legislature this afternoon, removes the provision requiring federal legislation or Department of Justice approval before online gaming licenses are made active, effectively establishing online gaming in Nevada. The bill also requires the Nevada Gaming Commission to adopt regulations authorizing the Governor to enter into agreements with other states to conduct interactive gaming.
