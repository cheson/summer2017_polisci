Governor Brian Sandoval released the following statement today after the Nevada State Assembly passed the Nevada Revenue Plan. This measure will provide the necessary revenue to fully fund the Governor's budget which includes an unprecedented investment and reforms in education through targeted programs aimed at boosting student achievement.
"I am incredibly proud of the men and women of the Assembly who today affirmed that Nevada is ready to lead. This vote moves us one step closer to cementing the legacy of improving public education by both raising accountability as well as increasing investment in order to suit the needs of generations to come," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "The passage of this bill is a testament to the vision, dedication, and determination of the members of the Nevada State Assembly, and represents their commitment to doing what is best for our citizens. Their display of bipartisanship reminds us how effective we can be when we work together. I applaud Majority Leader Paul Anderson and Minority Leader Marilyn Kirkpatrick for their courage and leadership throughout this legislative session. Together, they refused to lose sight of the larger mission. I would also like to extend my gratitude to Assemblyman Derek Armstrong, the original author of this bill, who worked tirelessly to ensure our revenue plan complemented the needs of our growing and changing economy. I look forward to working with Senate Majority Leader Michael Roberson and Minority Leader Aaron Ford to pass this bill out of the Senate and finish the people's work on time."
