Statement
By: Brian Sandoval
Date: March 17, 2014
Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today released the following statement on the Bureau of Labor Statistics report citing Nevada's 3.4 percent job growth as the strongest in the nation:
"Nevadans are resilient, and together we have made great strides in our ongoing effort to rebuild our economy and get Nevadans working again," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "Over the past few years, we have increased our focus on job creation, economic development, and job training. As a result of our efforts, Nevada's 3.4 percent job growth over the last year was the strongest in the nation. While we continue to have positive economic news, there are still too many Nevadans out of work. Growing jobs in Nevada will continue to be one of my highest priorities."
