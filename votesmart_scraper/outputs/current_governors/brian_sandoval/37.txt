Statement from Governor Sandoval on ESA Ruling
Statement
By: Brian Sandoval

Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today issued the following statement after the Nevada Supreme Court issued its ruling on Senate Bill 302, Education Savings Accounts.
"Although the court found the current funding mechanism for Education Savings Accounts unconstitutional, there may be a path for a legislative solution. However, such a solution is complex and must be well thought-out to meet constitutional muster. I am still reviewing the full decision of the Nevada Supreme Court and it would be premature to speculate on the proper method to administer and fund this important program. I also believe it is important to consult with legislative leadership on this issue as we approach the 2017 legislative session."
