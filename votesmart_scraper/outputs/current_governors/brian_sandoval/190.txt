Statement
By: Brian Sandoval

Location: Las Vegas, NV

Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval was joined by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer today at the Hoover Dam to unveil road signs for the future Interstate 11. The proposed corridor between Las Vegas, Nev., and Phoenix, Ariz., would link together the two largest adjacent metropolitan areas without an interstate freeway.
"The I-11 corridor remains a crucial infrastructure project that will serve transportation, economic development, and commerce needs in Southern Nevada," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "The completion of this interstate freeway will attract trade and economic activity to Southern Nevada and provide much needed construction jobs. This project is critical to the future of our state and has my full support."
