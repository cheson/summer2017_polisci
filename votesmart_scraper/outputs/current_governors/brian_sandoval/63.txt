Location: Carson City, NV

Governor Brian Sandoval today announced, after receiving specific assurances regarding timeline and funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and working with local stakeholders on a community-led process, that he has agreed to conditionally concur with the EPA's recommendation to list the Anaconda Copper Mine Site near Weed Heights in Lyon County on the EPA Superfund National Priorities List (NPL). Governor Sandoval was joined in support of this designation by Yerington Mayor George Dini, Lyon County Manager Jeffrey Page, Chairwoman of the Yerington Paiute Tribe Laurie Thom, Chairman of the Walker River Paiute Tribe Bobby Sanchez, and other community leaders.
"The shared goal of the State of Nevada, the EPA and representatives of Lyon County has always been to fully clean up the site in a timely manner. The state worked to develop a community-based process which brought local and federal stakeholders together. Based on assurances given to the local officials during the EPA's visit to the site, the state will concur with the proposed designation and a plan for a rapid, comprehensive site clean-up will proceed," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "I would like to thank Regional Administrator Jared Blumenfeld for traveling to Lyon County and meeting with local and state representatives. The health and well-being of the community has always been my top priority and I continue to be assured by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection that there are no imminent concerns regarding the health and public safety of the residents. Today we have achieved a major milestone toward a full and swift clean-up of the site and I am grateful for the community's leadership and remain committed to seeing this process through to the end."
