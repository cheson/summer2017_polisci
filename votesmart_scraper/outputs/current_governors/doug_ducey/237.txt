Governor Doug Ducey Releases Summer Reading PSA
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: June 19, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey and First Lady Angela Ducey today showed their support for "Summer Learning Day" and Read On Arizona by releasing a summer reading video encouraging Arizona students to spend time every day reading and learning throughout the summer months.
The initiative, a partnership with Read on Arizona and other organizations dedicated to the cause of childhood literacy, encourages all Arizona children and families to visit their local public libraries and sign up for Arizona's Summer Reading Program.
"Educational excellence should be a priority year-round -- not just during the school year," said Governor Ducey. "Research shows that early-childhood reading proficiency is one of the highest indicators of a student's likelihood of graduating from high school. It also shows that summers without quality learning opportunities put our youth at risk of falling behind. Picking up a book for at least 20 minutes each day is an easy, fun way for kids to keep their minds active, prevent learning losses and keep all Arizona students on track for a successful future."
