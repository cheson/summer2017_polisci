Arizona continues to be at an increased risk for wildfires this weekend as Arizonans travel to escape the record heat that's expected in Maricopa County.

One of the biggest threats in Arizona during the wildfire season is abandoned campfires. Ensuring a campfire is built properly, knowing how to maintain it, and thoroughly and completely extinguishing it is critical to a safe environment and the protection of all Arizonans during wildfire season.

According to State Forester Jeff Whitney, there were 150 campfires left unattended last weekend in the Coconino Forest.

"Wildfire season can be deadly, and we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to prevent a wildfire from starting," Governor Doug Ducey said. "Campfires pose a significant risk, and putting yours out properly could be the difference between a devastating wildfire season and a minimal one. Arizona is one of the best states in the country for camping, fishing, hiking and outdoor recreation. Enjoy yourself and have fun, but always remember to be safe, look up weather conditions and fire restrictions before you go, and know what you can do to prevent a wildfire."
