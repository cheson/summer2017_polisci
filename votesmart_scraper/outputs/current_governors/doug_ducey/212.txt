As part of his first gubernatorial trip to the Navajo Nation, Governor Doug Ducey today traveled to Window Rock to participate in a parade and ceremony honoring the service and contributions of the Navajo Code Talkers during World War II.
"More than 430 Navajo Code Talkers answered the call of duty following the Pearl Harbor attacks," said Governor Ducey. "These were men who, in most cases, had never experienced travel, seen an ocean or been trained for military combat. But, like the millions of other brave service members who defended our country during World War II, they were committed to saving American lives and preserving American liberty. Their pride and patriotism were as unbreakable as the code that helped lead us to victory. For that, we are eternally indebted and forever grateful."
National Navajo Code Talkers Day was established through a presidential proclamation by Ronald Reagan on August 14, 1982. In 2014, Arizona passed legislation declaring every August 14 Navajo Code Talkers Day in Arizona.
