"Today, I'm directing state flags be lowered to half-staff to honor the life and service of Navajo Nation Officer Houston James Largo. Officer Largo was killed in the line of duty while seeking to keep others safe. His tragic loss reminds us of the dangers faced by law enforcement officers every time they put on the uniform. Our state mourns with the Navajo Nation for this fallen hero, and our deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones during this difficult time."
