Governor Doug Ducey Visits Phoenix Church to Highlight Session, Sign H.B. 2128
Press Release

Location: Phoenix, AZ

Continuing his recap of his first 100 days in office, Governor Doug Ducey this morning visited faith leaders and community members at La Senda Antigua, a church that will benefit from one of the many reforms enacted over the past few months.

The governor held a ceremonial bill signing for H.B. 2128, legislation that corrects a significant inequality in the way religious institutions are treated. According to a constitutional provision and long-standing state policy, churches that own their property are exempt from paying property taxes. Under this new state law, now churches that rent their property will qualify for the same exemptions. For faith-based institutions like La Senda Antigua, this will amount to savings of more than $100 per month.

"It was great to visit face-to-face with some of the many Arizonans who'll benefit from the positive reforms we've instituted these first 100 days," said Governor Ducey. "Churches provide enormous value to our communities - and whether they're rented or owned shouldn't dictate tax breaks they receive. I was proud to resolve this inequality this session, and appreciate the hard work of the sponsors and stakeholders who championed this measure. It's one more way we're keeping our pledge to ensure opportunity for all."
