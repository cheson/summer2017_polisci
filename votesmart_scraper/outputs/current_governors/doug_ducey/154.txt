Location: Phoenix, AZ

In honor of the life and legacy of former First Lady Nancy Reagan, Governor Doug Ducey has directed that flags at all state buildings be flown at half-staff beginning today, March 7, 2016 until the day of her interment, for which services are pending.
"Nancy Reagan was an icon of grace, poise, strength and service. As the 40th First Lady of the United States, she represented the office with integrity, loved and supported the President endlessly, and improved the lives of Americans infinitely," said Governor Ducey.
"Nancy was a loyal adviser, a devoted wife and a courageous advocate for the people of this nation. And while we are saddened by her loss, we take solace in knowing that she left this world having made it a better place -- and that she now rests for eternity with the love of her life, and one of the greatest presidents and public servants in history, Ronald Reagan. They and their family remain in our thoughts and prayers."
