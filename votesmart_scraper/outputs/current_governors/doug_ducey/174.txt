"This is truly an Arizona success story, and the American Dream in action. Big congrats are in order for the team at Four Peaks who worked hard for two decades to get to this moment. Now, people all across the country can experience what we in Arizona have been experiencing for a long time, an ice cold beer from Four Peaks Brewery -- made right here in our state.
"Innovation is key to the future of Arizona's economy, and Four Peaks has been at the cutting edge. Thanks to bipartisan efforts to modernize our laws, we'll continue to see Arizona's craft brewing industry grow and thrive."
