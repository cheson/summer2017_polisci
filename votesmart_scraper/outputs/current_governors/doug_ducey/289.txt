Statement
By: Doug Ducey

Location: Phoenix, AZ

"We are all devastated to learn of the death of Kayla Mueller. The hearts of all Arizonans are heavy today, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with her family. And while it may be of small comfort for such an unknowable loss, I pray that Kayla Mueller's parents find solace in knowing that this state and nation will forever remember their daughter, and the lasting impression she left. She did more good in her 26 years than many do in a lifetime. We should honor her by striving every day to follow her noble example."
