Date: July 15, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey this afternoon welcomed tribal leaders from throughout Arizona for a roundtable discussion on the high-priority issues and policy areas affecting the state, particularly as they pertain to our tribes.
Also in attendance were members of the governor's senior staff, the governor's office liaison for tribal affairs and several key policy advisers, who addressed the forum on matters related to the state of the budget, education, health and human services and natural resources.
"Arizona's come a long way in the past six months in terms of tackling our financial crisis, restoring structural balance to our budget and getting ourselves in a good position to deal with a number of other critical issues facing our state," said Governor Ducey. "As we move forward in our efforts to improve educational outcomes, reform health and human services and ensure the vitality and viability of our state's precious natural resources, tribal leadership will be a crucial part of the discussion. Issues that affect Arizona affect all of Arizona, and I'm keenly aware that there are also many challenges unique to our tribal nations. I want to ensure they always have a voice and a seat at the table, and I look forward to working with all of our state's tribal leaders in the weeks, months and years ahead."
