Governor Doug Ducey Praises Passage of Arizona's Bipartisan Balanced Budget
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: March 7, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today praised the passage of Arizona's Balanced Budget - a fiscally-responsible, bipartisan budget that sets priorities, makes real permanent decisions and solves the state's structural deficit while protecting essential services for vulnerable populations.

The first structurally-balanced plan since 2007, the budget reflects the governor's and Legislature's commitment to protecting classrooms, child safety and public safety - while eliminating the state's structural deficit by 2017 and protecting taxpayers from a tax increase.

"The people elected us to get the job done and that's what we've done," said Governor Ducey. "We've passed a balanced, bipartisan budget that prioritizes wisely, protects our most vulnerable and restores Arizona to a structurally-balanced budget by fiscal 2017. If we want to see meaningful and lasting improvement in our schools and economy, government must start living within its means and practicing fiscal responsibility. We recognize that families, businesses and taxpayers do this every day. This budget reflects my commitment to representing Arizonans - not special interests. I want to thank the Legislature, especially the leadership of President Biggs and Speaker Gowan, for working diligently to get this done for the people of Arizona. This is a budget that reflects our state's priorities and for that we should all be proud."
