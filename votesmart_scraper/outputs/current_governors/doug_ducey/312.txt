A strong and vibrant economy is essential to an Arizona that will provide opportunity for all. Arizona not only has a great business climate, but it's a great place to live. But there's more we can do. Governor Ducey wants Arizona to be the pace leader in the competition for the very best state in America to do business. A more competitive tax code will aid in attracting businesses already moving away from states like California and Illinois to Arizona. This will help middle-class families who have been hit hard in the current economy.
