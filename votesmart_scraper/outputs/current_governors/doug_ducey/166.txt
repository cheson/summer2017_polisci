Governor Doug Ducey Launches Special Team To Help Clear Rape Kit Backlog
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Jan. 26, 2016
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today announced the members of the Arizona Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit Task Force, a bipartisan coalition of victims advocates, law enforcement officials and policy makers tasked with addressing the injustice of untested rape kits throughout Arizona.
Throughout the country -- including Arizona -- crime labs struggle to keep up with timely testing of the kits, resulting in a backlog of 2,300 untested kits in Maricopa County alone.
"For too long, women across our state have awaited justice for the despicable crimes inflicted upon them, while predators evade the law looking for their next victim," said Governor Ducey. "We must do everything in our power to stand up for those who've been victimized -- and that means bringing to bear every resource and taking every necessary action to identify their assailants and lock them behind bars before they harm anyone else."
Governor Ducey charged the task force with multiple responsibilities, which include: providing legislative recommendations to ensure every kit is tested in a timely manner; developing a statewide standard process for testing protocols of the kits; developing a statewide tracking system for the kits; and development of a public education plan to assist sexual assault victims.
Governor Ducey established the task force by Executive Order on January 11, 2016 to address a key priority in his 2016 State of the State address.
Governor Ducey has appointed the following members to the task force:
Mark Brnovich, Arizona Attorney General
Representative Kate Brophy McGee, Arizona House of Representatives
Colleen Clase, Arizona Voice for Crime Victims
Christina Corieri, Office of Governor Doug Ducey
Sherriff Mark J. Dannels, Cochise County Sheriff
