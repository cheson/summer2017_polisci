"With Christmas upon us and a new year just days away, I want to take a moment to thank the people who've blessed my life and made 2015 one of the best years yet.
My family and friends, whose love and laughter make every day a celebration.
My fellow Arizonans, whose spirit and strength of character make our state great.
The women and men serving in our armed forces, whose patriotism and courage make our nation exceptional.
The families of our military members, whose sacrifice and selflessness are inspiring and extraordinary in their own right.
And our Savior, whose birth, life, death and resurrection give us reason to rejoice.
May He protect our heroes in uniform, watch over their loved ones and keep all of us safe and healthy in the New Year.
Merry Christmas, Arizona."
