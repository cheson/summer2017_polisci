Governor Doug Ducey today greeted the New England Patriots as they arrived in Arizona for their second Super Bowl appearance in the state.

"There's no question the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history. They are a pleasure to watch, and I'm looking forward to doing so this weekend. This is going to be an exciting week, and an incredible opportunity to showcase the best of our state to these teams, their fans and the world. I wish both New England and Seattle an unforgettable Super Bowl in Arizona."
