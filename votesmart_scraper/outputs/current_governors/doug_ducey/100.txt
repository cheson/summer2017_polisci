The safety of the residents, firefighters and first responders is of paramount importance, and my office -- along with the State Forester, the Department of Emergency and Military Affairs and the Department of Public Safety -- will remain in constant communication with local and federal fire officials and the public. As always, we are incredibly grateful for our partners in these ongoing suppression efforts, especially the brave women and men on the front lines fighting this and other fires in the state. I encourage all Arizonans to be vigilant and safe this wildfire season."
