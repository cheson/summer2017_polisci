Governor Doug Ducey today took action on three firearms bills. The governor signed SB 1266 (firearms; state preemption; penalties) and HB 2338 (educational institutions; firearms; rights-of-way).
Additionally, the governor has vetoed HB 2524 (uniform firearms transfer compact). His statement is below:
"Today, I was glad to sign Senate Bill 1266 and House Bill 2338 -- two pieces of legislation that protect our Second Amendment rights. Earlier this year I signed House Bill 2224 (private firearm transactions; prohibited encumbrances), reinforcing my commitment to allowing the exchange of firearms without government intrusion. I have signed several other firearms bills, with a commitment to safeguarding our liberties relating to firearms.
Arizona has led the nation in ensuring the right of our citizens to keep and bear arms, and I intend to preserve that status. That is why I'm vetoing House Bill 2524.
This bill is unnecessary. As a strong supporter of the Constitution, the Second Amendment and the Tenth Amendment, I believe it's important that Arizona continue to chart its own course and retain its sovereignty. I see no reason for Arizona to tie ourselves to other states' decisions on public policy relating to the transfer of firearms. We know what's best for our state, and I trust the citizens of Arizona and their elected leaders to continue to make wise decisions to protect our Second Amendment rights, whenever and wherever those rights are infringed."
