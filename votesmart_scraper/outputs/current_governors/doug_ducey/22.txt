Governor Ducey Signs Bill Guaranteeing Right To Earn A Living

Governor Doug Ducey today signed legislation to expand economic freedom by guaranteeing Arizonans the right to earn a living. Senate Bill 1437 empowers individuals to challenge in court unfair licensing requirements that limit competition and create unnecessary barriers to work.
"The opportunity to earn a living and pursue the American dream is a right promised to every citizen," said Governor Ducey. "But too often, government stands in the way, imposing unnecessary barriers meant only to serve entrenched interests. Today's bill is a positive step toward ending that unfair practice. As I've said before, professional licensing exists for one purpose and one purpose only -- to keep the public safe. We need real root and branch reform of boards and commissions that stifle economic opportunity and keep individuals from achieving their full potential. I look forward to continuing to work with the Legislature to achieve that goal."
Last week, Governor Ducey signed an executive order requiring regulatory boards to justify barriers that make it harder for Arizonans to find, keep, and create jobs.
