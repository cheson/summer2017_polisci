Governor Doug Ducey today issued a special recognition honoring Lujendra Ojha, the former University of Arizona student who helped discover evidence of flowing water on Mars.
"It isn't every day that evidence of flowing water is found on another planet, and I'm proud this significant discovery was made right here in Arizona," said Governor Doug Ducey. "Lujendra's findings are a tribute to his hard work and the dedicated facility and staff at the University of Arizona. The UofA is home to some of the best space exploration and observation laboratories in the country and works directly with NASA -- I'm glad they can add this to their list of accomplishments and will continue to make historic contributions to Mars research."
