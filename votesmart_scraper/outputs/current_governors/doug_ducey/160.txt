Governor Doug Ducey Reissues Moratorium on Regulatory Rulemaking
Press Release

Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey has issued an executive order renewing his moratorium on all new regulatory rulemaking by state agencies.
"This moratorium reaffirms my commitment to ensuring Arizona is the best place in the country for job creators to grow and thrive," said Governor Ducey. "Burdensome regulations are Arizona's worst enemy as we continue to expand our economy -- they inhibit job growth, economic development, and can be detrimental to small businesses and startups. Arizona is poised to lead the nation in job growth and I want to ensure government is doing all it can to get out of the way of business. Getting rid of unnecessary hoops that hinder a company's growth potential and bottom line helps Arizonans succeed."
Executive Order 2016-03 prohibits all state agencies from conducting any new rulemaking, except when changes to rules create efficiencies; protect public health and safety; are necessary to avoid violating a court order or federal law; and fulfill budgetary obligations.
Governor Ducey also issued this moratorium last year as his first official action as governor.
The executive order is effective until December 31, 2016.
