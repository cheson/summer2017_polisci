"Today, flags across the state of Arizona fly at half-staff in honor and remembrance of former Israeli President and Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
"Shimon Peres was born to lead a nation. His outstanding potential, recognized from the beginning by those who made Israel a reality, evolved into an unparalleled life of service. From war-torn Poland to the pinnacle of world affairs, few people have had such a positive effect on the State of Israel as has Shimon Peres.
"I had the great fortune of meeting Shimon Peres when I went to in Israel in 2015. I brought him an Arizona Diamondbacks hat. He didn't just say "thanks' and forget about it. He flashed his famous smile, grabbed the hat, and put it right on his head.
"Shimon Peres wasn't just a president, prime minister, and keeper of the peace. More than anything, Shimon Peres was a human being who loved being with people and who loved representing his country."
