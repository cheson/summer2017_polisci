Prudent Manager of State's Money and Investments
If elected, my first priority will be to act as a good and prudent manager of our state's money and investments. I will make sure that the Treasurer's office is professionally and competently run. That's the primary focus.
Total Financial Clarity to All -- Both State and Federal Funds
The second thing I'll do as Treasurer is bring total financial clarity to our state's finances. I will improve the current AZ Checkbook website, making it easily searchable and understandable. I will help turn data into information so that all Arizonans understand where our state is spending its money and can apply the proper pressure to the legislature and the Governor.
Champion for Job Creation & Business Relocation
I know something about creating jobs, and I know how entrepreneurs think. I'll use my experience to help whoever is our next governor to create good, new Arizona jobs.
