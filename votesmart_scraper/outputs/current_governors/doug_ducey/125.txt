Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed House Bill 2388, authorizing the development of a state program that will better allow individuals with disabilities in Arizona to save for their future.
"Too often, parents of children with disabilities face unique challenges and tremendous anxieties when it comes to the health and well-being of their kids. Ensuring their long-term financial security should not be one of them. This legislation will allow Arizona families who have a loved one with a physical or mental disability to save for their child's future through an account, similar to a college savings plan. Funds in these accounts can later be used to cover a variety of needs -- including housing, transportation, specialized education and healthcare -- without jeopardizing their access to Social Security and Medicaid. This will give parents a little more peace of mind while providing economic protection and greater opportunity to our most vulnerable citizens. I thank Rep. John Allen for his hard work on this bill and his compassion for thousands of kids and families across Arizona."
