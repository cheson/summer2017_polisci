Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today issued a proclamation declaring the month of September "Teen Suicide Prevention Awareness Month" in Arizona. The governor, along with several non-profit organizations across the state, are teaming up to raise awareness about Arizona's high prevalence of teen suicide, and to spread the word about the support services available for those affected by or struggling with the issue.
"Knowing that the occurrence of teen suicides is even more common toward the beginning of the school year, we all should take time to remind struggling Arizona teens and families that there is help, that there is support, that there are always other options and -- most importantly -- that they're not alone," Governor Ducey said. "All Arizonans can be a part of the fight against teen suicide, and I encourage everyone to do so. Any effort that could save one or multiple lives is an effort worthwhile."
