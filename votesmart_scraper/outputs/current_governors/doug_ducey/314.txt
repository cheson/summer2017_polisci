Governor Ducey is committed to creating more opportunity for all Arizonans by growing our economy, creating more jobs and improving our schools. The governor believes that to accomplish these goals, Arizona leaders will need to put politics aside and work together for all the people of the state. That's why he has reached out to legislative leaders on both sides of the aisle, as well as mayors and business and community leaders in all corners of the state to find areas of common ground.
