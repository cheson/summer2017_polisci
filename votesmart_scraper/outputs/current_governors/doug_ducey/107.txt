"Arizona is in mourning today over the passing of one of our finest -- Phoenix Police Officer David Glasser. His death is a tragic reminder of the daily sacrifices our police officers make to protect citizens, to enforce the law and to keep the peace in our communities.
"We are deeply and eternally indebted to Officer Glasser for his service and sacrifice on our behalf. It's times like this that we must remember that, for our men and women in blue, no call is routine. We must continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with those who serve under the badge.
"As we honor Officer Glasser, let us keep his family, the Phoenix Police Department and all law enforcement officers in our prayers.
"In his honor, I've ordered that all flags at state buildings be immediately lowered to half-staff."
