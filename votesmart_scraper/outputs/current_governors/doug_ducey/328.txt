THE ISSUE: THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T GET IT. ARIZONANS LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF A POROUS BORDER EVERY DAY. IT HAS TO STOP.
It all starts with securing the border. Any progress on illegal immigration starts with controlling our border and stopping the flow of illegal immigrants here. It is government's most basic responsibility, and yet it's one the federal government has completely botched.
I will protect Arizona's citizens. I will use every authority granted to the governor to hold the federal government accountable for its consistent failure to meet this urgent law-enforcement obligation. I will also commit significant new state resources to the prevention and prosecution of violent crimes by persons here illegally. Leadership is all about setting priorities, and ensuring our safety is at the top of the list.
Our immigration system is badly broken. The federal government must begin to do its job and get its priorities straight. Legal and thoughtful immigration is good for our country and part of what makes us different and exceptional. We are a nation of immigrants and we need this fixed.
