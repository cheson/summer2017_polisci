Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed a tort reform measure - H.B. 2603 - aimed at increasing transparency and fairness in asbestos litigation.

"Our administration is steadfastly committed to ensuring the tort process is fair for all parties involved," said Governor Ducey. "While victims are entitled to compensation, we must prevent double recovery from occurring in the process. I want to ensure we're doing everything possible to create an environment of transparency and fairness in Arizona's legal system, and I thank Rep. Borelli and the Arizona legislators for their leadership and partnership in this important effort."
