Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today welcomed the Seattle Seahawks as they arrived in Arizona for the Super Bowl.
"As a Cardinals loyalist first and foremost, it's hard not to forget what happened last time the Seahawks were in town," said Governor Ducey. "Joking aside, it was a pleasure welcoming the team back to Phoenix. They've built a great franchise with class-act players and coaching staff, and pulled off a remarkable playoff comeback to earn their spot in the Super Bowl. I wish them luck next Sunday -- and at the very least, a few days of Arizona sunshine and hospitality."
Governor Ducey will meet with the New England Patriots upon their arrival in Phoenix tomorrow, January 26.
