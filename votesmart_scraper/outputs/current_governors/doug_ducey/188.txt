"This is a great day for Arizona kids, families and teachers. We all know there is plenty of gridlock and partisanship in politics, but through this effort, we have proven that if we work together, in a spirit of good faith, we can improve the lives of Arizonans. I want to thank the leaders in the Legislature and the education community for working tirelessly to make this happen, and the bipartisan coalition of legislators who voted for it.
With this permanent infusion of dollars into our schools that schools can spend as they see fit on their needs, educators will finally have the resources they have been asking for, and our students will have greater opportunities to succeed. This is a loud message that Arizona's top priority is our kids. And we've done it in a bipartisan, fiscally responsible manner that keeps our budget balanced and doesn't raise taxes. Thanks to the work of all, the trend line of funding for our schools has dramatically shifted upward, and that will make a meaningful difference in the everyday lives of our kids and teachers."
