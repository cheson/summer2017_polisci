Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey will officially kick off National Red Ribbon Week, an annual awareness campaign aimed at educating Arizona communities about substance abuse and the stigma associated with addiction, this Thursday at the state Capitol.
The event will highlight substance abuse as a significant public health crisis, and will focus on the importance and availability of prevention, early intervention and treatment.
"Every one of us knows someone who has experienced or been impacted by substance abuse or addiction," said Governor Ducey. "If we're going to be successful in our efforts to combat this disease, we must remove the stigma and eliminate community denial about what addiction is and who it affects. It's time to turn the discussion to prevention, early intervention and treatment, and to let those suffering know that they're not alone, and that recovery is possible."
The event, hosted by the Governor's Office of Youth, Faith and Family, will take place on Thursday, October 22, 2015, from 8:30 until 11:30 a.m. on the Arizona State Capitol Senate Lawn. All Arizonans are encouraged to attend.
In addition to a keynote address by Governor Ducey, speakers will include Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery and Colonel Frank L. Milstead, director of Arizona Department of Public Safety
