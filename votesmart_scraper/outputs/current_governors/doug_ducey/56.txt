When Governor Ducey took office, he inherited a $1 billion dollar budget deficit. To bring Arizona back into the black and put the state on sustainable path forward, government needed to stop spending money it didn't have. The Governor and the legislature worked together to pass a budget that put Arizona on a path to structural balance for the first time since 2007. Governor Ducey is committed to being responsible with our budget, investing in the future, and allowing the people to keep more of the dollars they earn.
