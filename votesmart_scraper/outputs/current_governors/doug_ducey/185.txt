"On Veteran's Day, we pause to pay tribute to the women and men who've served and sacrificed in defense of our nation's freedom, security and democracy.
"We're reminded on this occasion how blessed we are to live in the freest, most prosperous nation on earth. More importantly, we're reminded of the soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coastguardsmen throughout history who've risked everything to make that possible.
"From the courageous patriots who secured our independence nearly two and a half centuries ago -- to the brave service members who, at this very moment, are fighting in distant and hostile lands to preserve it for centuries to come -- thank you. We owe you a debt that can never be repaid.
"As we honor our nation's veterans, let us remember that courage and sacrifice are not confined to the battlefield. Courage and sacrifice live in every home that has ever sent a child off to war, in every hand that's felt the weight of a folded flag and in every prayer sent for a loved one's safe return. The families of all our nation's veterans and military members are forever in our thoughts and prayers.
May God Bless and protect them all."
