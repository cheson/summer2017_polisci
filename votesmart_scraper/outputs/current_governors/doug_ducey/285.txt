Governor Doug Ducey Signs Bipartisan Legislation to Aid Apple Expansion in Arizona
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey

Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed House Bill 2670, bipartisan legislation to assist companies planning large-scale investment and expansion in Arizona.

The bill will extend renewable energy tax credits and exemptions that will benefit companies like Apple, Inc., who recently announced its plans to bring a 1.3 million square-foot global command center to Mesa. Apple's expansion in Arizona amounts to a $2 billion investment in the state - one of the largest in company history - as well as 150 full-time jobs and 300 to 500 construction jobs annually.

"The bill I signed today reflects my commitment to proving to the world that Arizona is open for business," said Governor Ducey. "Growing our economy is something we can all agree on, and this bipartisan legislation will enhance our ability to compete for and attract high-wage companies in the global economy. Not only is Apple bringing significant investment and hundreds of quality jobs to our state, but its move also will create a ripple effect - boosting businesses already here. This is a huge win for Arizona, and I want to thank the legislators, particularly Speaker Gowan and President Biggs, for working swiftly and across the aisle to get it done.
