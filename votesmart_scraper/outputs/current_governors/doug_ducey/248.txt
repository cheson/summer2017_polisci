Standard & Poor's, one of the world's largest credit-rating agencies, has upgraded Arizona's credit rating from AA- to AA, with a stable outlook. This improvement -- which arrives on the heels of a similar upgrade from Moody's Investor's Services -- represents Arizona's most positive credit outlook position since 2008.

"It's no accident that, in the past month, two of the world's top credit ratings services have improved their outlook of Arizona's financial condition. There's a reason our ratings are moving in a positive direction, while states like Illinois continue to appear dismal," said Governor Ducey. "It comes down to good decision-making, fiscal responsibility and a fulfilled promise to balance the state budget once and for all. That's what we've done in Arizona, and that's the playbook we're going to continue to follow."

S&P's attributes its outlook improvement primarily to "Arizona's good fund balance position, on a budgetary basis, and expected near structural budget balance in fiscal 2016, based on recent above-budgeted growth in tax revenues," according to a Standard & Poor's credit analyst. The report also credits the upgrade to Arizona's diverse economy, housing market turnaround, strong revenue growth and spending restraint, among other factors.

"This is great news for Arizona, and further validation of everything we've done to get our economy back on firm footing," added Governor Ducey. "We're going to keep working hard to grow the economy, create jobs, protect taxpayers and secure a healthy fiscal future for Arizona."
