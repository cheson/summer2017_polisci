Press Release

Governor Doug Ducey announced today a $33 million savings to Arizona taxpayers from the refinancing of state loans, with Arizona's recent credit upgrades adding millions of dollars to the savings.
"This is why fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets matter," said Governor Ducey. "This is more money we can invest in the things that matter -- in our kids, in our schools, in Arizona priorities -- rather than spending on debt financing. As a direct result of our credit upgrades, Arizonans will see millions of their dollars saved that would have otherwise been spent financing debt."
In May Moody's Investors Service, upgraded Arizona's credit rating to Aa2, with a "stable" outlook.
In their announcement, Moody's said the rating increase "reflects the state's positive economic trends, significantly improved liquidity levels (and) budget actions expected to eliminate a structural imbalance." Additionally, Standard and Poor's recently assigned Arizona its strongest rating since 2008.
The savings -- on capital and school construction financing -- will be realized over the next 13 years, with the new interest rates kicking in this month and millions of dollars a year in interest savings.
