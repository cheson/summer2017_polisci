Public Statements
Applauding The Introduction Of Bill To Combat Opioid Abuse
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: April 13, 2017
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Modeled after an executive order issued by Governor Doug Ducey, Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) today introduced legislation to combat opioid abuse across the nation. Similar to Governor Ducey's order, the legislation seeks to limit the first fill of prescription opioid drugs to seven days.
"I applaud Senators McCain and Gillibrand for stepping up to address what's become a national crisis," said Governor Ducey. "The amount of highly addictive opioids prescribed every year is staggering. In addition to helping those currently suffering from addiction, we need proactive reform that stops addiction before it starts. This bold legislation is an important step to making that happen, and I encourage Congress to act on it."
In October 2016, Governor Ducey issued an executive order limiting opioid prescriptions from state-run programs to seven days. Another executive order issued in January 2017 helps inmates suffering with addiction to recover and receive transition assistance before leaving prison.
The governor also has taken steps to encourage all physicians in Arizona to complete Continuing Education in drug addiction and signed legislation to allow pharmacists to prescribe Naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, to family members of those affected.
