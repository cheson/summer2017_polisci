Pastor Gonzalez, distinguished guests, friends and fellow citizens:
A new administration rightly begins with appreciation for the work of others. Governor Brewer, for your good service to our state, we thank you and we wish you well. And I welcome Governors Hull and Symington -- we're glad you're here, thank you for coming.
Among our seven former governors, the two most senior could not be here, but I want both to know that we're thinking of them. There's the great Arizonan who took this oath in 1975, and this year will reach the age of 99, Governor Raul Hector Castro. Let's also remember the gracious lady who is still very dear to our state, Governor Rose Mofford.
And it is my high honor to share today's event with members of Arizona's National Guard. It is because of their sacrifice and others who serve in uniform that we are able to exercise the freedoms we celebrate today. Thank you.
As my predecessors here can testify, it's not the promises we bring to office that count the most. The trust measure is taken in the work we finish, the good we do and the commitments we keep.
Our work at this capitol begins with challenges entirely in our power to overcome. Some are financial in nature. They are difficult, but hardly unfamiliar in the workings of government.
Several years ago, our state confronted fiscal problems on a scale few had seen before. But leaders -- many of them here today, starting with my predecessor -- made the decision to change course and avoid the worst.
For that, we owe them our gratitude. And now it is our turn to act. Once again, there is no escaping duty, reality or arithmetic. We can confront the budget shortfall this coming fiscal year -- and we will.
