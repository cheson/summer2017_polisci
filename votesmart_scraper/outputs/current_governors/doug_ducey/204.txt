Governor Doug Ducey has declared September "Arizona Hunger Action Month" to raise awareness for Arizona's most vulnerable populations and the community members who donate to help citizens who need it most.
"I commend all Arizonans who give their time, money and resources to help the most vulnerable populations in our state," said Governor Ducey. "Arizona's food banks were able to provide more than 124 million pounds of food to those in-need across Arizona last year because of volunteers who are dedicated to making this a place where everyone can succeed and thrive. I thank them for their generosity and commitment to making Arizona a place of opportunity for all."
