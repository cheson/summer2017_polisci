Arizona has some great public schools, among the best in America, but Arizona's children do not yet have equal access. Governor Ducey believes we can do better. Arizona's children deserve a world-class education that will put them on the path to success. Governor Ducey is committed to ensuring parents have a choice of top-notch schools when deciding where their child should be educated. Governor Ducey also wants to get more money into the classroom -- where learning happens.
