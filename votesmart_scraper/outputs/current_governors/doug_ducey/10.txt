Press Release

Governor Doug Ducey today signed legislation to protect individuals who need to break into a car to save the life of a child or pet. The governor made passing the "Good Samaritan" law a priority this session, and called on legislators in his State of the State address in January to send him legislation preventing hot car deaths.
"A few minutes is all it takes for a child or pet left in a hot car to die of heat stroke," said Governor Ducey. "That's a scenario we never want to see happen. With this bill, we are protecting Good Samaritans who take action to save a child or pet and sending a signal that breaking a car window should be the last consideration when someone's life is on the line. I thank Senator Kavanagh for leading on this important legislation."
Under House Bill 2494, an individual who enters an unattended motor vehicle to remove a child or domestic animal would be protected from civil liability if a good faith belief exists that the child or pet is in imminent danger of injury or death. The legislation also requires the person to notify law enforcement or emergency medical personnel before entering the vehicle and to stay with the child or pet until authorities arrive.
