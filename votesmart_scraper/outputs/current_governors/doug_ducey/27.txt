Governor Ducey Signs Bill Reducing Duplicative Licensing Requirements For Veterans
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: March 21, 2017
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed a bill to make it easier for veterans to transition to civilian life by reducing duplicative licensure requirements. HB 2271 requires regulating agencies to consider a veteran's relevant military experience, education, and training for the purpose of satisfying similar requirements when issuing licenses, certifications, or other registrations.
"Our returning service members should be met with gratitude and support, not government red-tape," said Governor Ducey. "Their training and education often more than meets what would be required for a civilian license or certification. I'm proud to sign this bill eliminating this unnecessary roadblock and making it easier for veterans to get jobs when they return home."
Today's legislation builds on Governor Ducey's efforts to eliminate onerous licensing requirements and enhance economic opportunity for veterans. Efforts over the past two years include:
Invested in programs that connect veterans to eager employers
Offered certifications to universities that offer unique services
Made it easier to gain academic credit for military service
Provided tax relief to military families who survive their loved ones
Streamlined government to improve customer service for veterans
HB 2271 was sponsored by Representative Maria Syms (R-Paradise Valley).
