Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey recently signed an Executive Order renewing the Arizona Human Trafficking Council.
"When it comes to combatting the horrendous crime of human trafficking, Arizona must hold the line," said Governor Ducey. "The Arizona Human Trafficking Council has made great strides in a short time, and our state continues to be on the cutting-edge of addressing this crucial issue. With the renewal of the Council, we will continue to see stronger federal, state and local collaboration, enhanced education and public awareness, improved services and care for victims, and a continued commitment to fighting human trafficking in Arizona."
The Arizona Human Trafficking Council, under the Governor's Office of Youth, Faith, and Family, was established in 2014 to develop a comprehensive and coordinated victims' service plan; evaluate and report to the governor statewide data on human trafficking; promote greater collaboration with law enforcement, state agencies and the community-at-large; and raise public awareness about victims services, restitution and prevention.
