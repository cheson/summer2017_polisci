Location: Phoenix, AZ

"It is with great sadness that I announce the passing of Arizona's cherished former Governor, Raúl Héctor Castro.

Arizonans will never forget Governor Castro. He was an honorable public servant, a history-maker, a beloved family man and a strong friend and fighter for Arizona. Whether as a county attorney, a superior court judge, a United States ambassador or - as we will best remember him - our 14th governor, his life and legacy of service is forever ingrained in our history. The thoughts and prayers of all Arizonans are with Governor Castro's family and loved ones during this difficult time.

While our state will grieve this immense loss, it's also important to celebrate the esteemed life and legacy of a great man who lived a full life of exemplary service to Arizona and its people.

In honor of Governor Castro, I have ordered that all state flags be lowered to half-staff."

Details will be forthcoming from the Governor's Office on plans to honor the life and legacy of Governor Castro.
