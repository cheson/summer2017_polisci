Governor Ducey Signs Bipartisan Legislation Protecting Arizonans' Property Rights
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: April 12, 2017
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed bipartisan legislation strengthening civil liberty and private property protections for Arizonans and increasing oversight, accountability and transparency of funds and property seized by law enforcement.
"Reforms have been needed in this area for some time," said Governor Ducey. "As public servants, we are entrusted with not only protecting public safety, but also the rights guaranteed to every citizen of this great state and nation. Today's important legislation strikes an appropriate balance between enabling law enforcement to do their jobs while upholding civil liberties. I commend Representative Eddie Farnsworth for his work on this legislation, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for supporting it. This bill will allow law enforcement to take appropriate action against drug cartels and other criminal enterprises, while ensuring citizens do not have their property seized without proper due process."
House Bill 2477, which passed with nearly unanimous support in both the House and the Senate, increases the burden of proof needed in cases of civil asset forfeiture. The legislation also establishes new oversight mechanisms on the use of funds seized by law enforcement to prevent fraud and misuse.
