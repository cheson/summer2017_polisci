Governor Doug Ducey's Statement On The Celebration Of Hanukkah
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Dec. 6, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

"Tonight, across Arizona, the United States, Israel and the world, millions come together to light the first candle in the Festival of Lights.
"Hanukkah celebrates liberation -- a people who fought honorably, overcoming so many obstacles, to defend their faith and freedom.
"As menorahs are lit over the next eight nights, they will shine across Arizona, this nation and the world. They remind us that in times of darkness and desperation, hope and peace are brighter, and God is lighting our way.
"From my family to yours, have a safe, prosperous and peaceful Hanukkah. Chag Sameach."
