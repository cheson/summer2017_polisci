Press Release

Location: Phoenix, AZ

A stronger focus on data and analytics when it comes to job creation, marketing and regulatory reform is at the heart of legislation introduced today in the Arizona House of Representatives to boost economic development.
Legislation sponsored by Representative Karen Fann will consolidate government offices by establishing the Governor's Economic Opportunity Office (GEOO) -- a one-stop economic development shop that will focus on getting government out of the way of job creators, provide a direct link between the business community and the workers and capital they need to be successful, cut down on government overlap to make taxpayer dollars go farther, and create a more unified and effective approach to job attraction and marketing of Arizona.
GEOO will serve as an analytics and strategy team under the Arizona Commerce Authority that will continually analyze how Arizona stacks up against other states, identify ways to drive down regulatory and tax burdens, and provide real-time data so policy makers and government can move at the speed of business to bring new business to Arizona. This will help ensure Arizona stays a step ahead of the competition in job attraction and creation, while helping hardworking and innovative Arizonans get to market easier and faster.
Additionally, this new approach is focused on:
Boosting job creators both large and small, expanding innovation in the sharing economy, and giving tools to rural communities.
Ensuring government is open and accountable, and that taxpayer resources are properly spent.
Streamlining government so it isn't standing in the way of new jobs.
