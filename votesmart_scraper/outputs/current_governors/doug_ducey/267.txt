Governor Doug Ducey Signs Legislation Reducing Barriers to Efficient, Cost-Effective Health Care
By: Doug Ducey

Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed H.B. 2645, legislation allowing individuals to obtain any laboratory testing directly from a licensed lab without a physician's orders.

"As a steadfast champion of reducing burdensome barriers and red tape, I was proud to sign a bill that does just that," said Governor Ducey. "Whether in business or in health care, Arizonans deserve excellent, efficient and cost-effective service. This bill keeps regulations lean while protecting our doctors and health care providers and expanding opportunities for Arizonans to get the testing they need in a timely manner.

I want to thank Rep. Carter for sponsoring this legislation, and I especially want to recognize Theranos and its CEO Elizabeth Holmes for the foresight and innovative spirit to drive this measure and see it through to the finish line. It's a great day for Arizona and for the future of health care in our state."
