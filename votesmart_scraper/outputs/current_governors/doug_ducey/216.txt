Governor Doug Ducey has declared the month of August Drowning Impact Awareness Month in an effort to highlight the importance of staying safe around water.
"Arizona has the most pools per capita in the United States due to our great weather and constant sunshine," said Governor Ducey. "Whether you're having fun in the pool, or visiting one of Arizona's many lakes, it's important to stay safe and especially watch little ones around water. Families can take simple steps to protect their children around water and I encourage you to make water safety a priority in your home."
