THE ISSUE: OBAMACARE IS A MONUMENTAL FAILURE AND HAS MADE A ROYAL MESS OF HEALTH CARE.
State Control. There's no reason we need to be stuck with the policy options the feds want to impose on us. States such as Arkansas and Rhode Island have sought and received waivers to do things differently. In Indiana, then-Gov. Mitch Daniels enacted innovations like Health Savings Accounts into Healthy Indiana, the state's Medicaid program, in a way that has not only promoted personal responsibility but also kept costs down -- while having a 96% satisfaction rating among participants. It will be a top priority of the Ducey administration to learn from the best practices of other states and to get out from under the federal government's thumb. I will lead the effort to negotiate a Medicaid waiver for Arizona and to protect our state from Obamacare, one of the worst laws ever signed by any American president.
Controlling the cost of Medicaid expansion. The expansion of Medicaid as part of Obamacare receives significant federal moneyÂ…for the first three years. After that the rules will change, and Arizona taxpayers may need to pay considerably more. As governor I will prepare for all scenarios, and I will not allow a massive new entitlement to grow into a huge financial burden for future generations of Arizonans. We will keep a lid on health care costs, period.
Helping those who truly need it. We want to care for our most vulnerable and needy citizens, and we want our health care options in Arizona to be the best in the nation. Medicaid is a program originally designed to take care of the destitute and disabled, but it's now being expanded as a middle class entitlement. We need to focus our efforts on people who genuinely need the help and can't do without it.
