Governor Doug Ducey today released his proposed executive budget for fiscal year 2017: a balanced, values-based and fiscally-responsible spending plan that makes critical investments, including an additional $106 million in public K-12 education; brings Arizona to a positive structural balance for the first time since 2007; and protects taxpayers by rejecting calls for a tax increase.
The governor's budget prioritizes vital commitments such as K-12 education, child safety and public safety while promoting fiscal responsibility, protecting our most vulnerable and finding cost-savings for Arizona taxpayers.
"Just like last year, this budget is structurally-balanced, it's values-based and it solves problems," said Governor Ducey. "We have a moral and legal obligation to pass a balanced budget and, just as importantly, we have a responsibility to protect our most vital commitments and vulnerable citizens. This budget brings us to structural balance by the end of fiscal 2017 while making critical investments in K-12 education, child safety and public safety -- all without raising taxes."
Highlights of Governor Ducey's Balanced Budget Plan:
Eliminates the structural deficit and brings Arizona to a $173 million positive structural balance by the end of FY 2017.
Includes $106 million in additional money for K-12 education. That's on top of the$224 million supplemental added with the $3.5 billion funding package approved last year in special session.
Makes significant new investments in our universities, with an additional $4 million in FY 2016 and $14 million in ongoing spending in FY 2017.
