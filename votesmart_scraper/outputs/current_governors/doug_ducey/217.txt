Governor Doud Ducey Announces AHCCCS Care Program
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Aug. 3, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today unveiled his plan to modernize Arizona's Medicaid program - AHCCCS - while increasing personal responsibility, encouraging wellness, expanding health technology, protecting taxpayers and promoting quality health care at an affordable price.

The program, "AHCCCS CARE," ensures Choice, Accountability, Responsibility and Engagement. Eligible members would make contributions to an account -- similar to a Health Savings Account -- that could be used for services not currently covered by Medicaid, including dental, vision, weight loss and more.

"Arizona can and must do better than Washington when it comes to delivering quality, cost-effective health care," said Governor Ducey. "This program does that while allowing Arizonans to take charge of their own health, providing enhanced services not currently offered under the Medicaid program to meet those requirements, rewarding personal responsibility and protecting the taxpayers by cracking down on fraud, waste and abuse in the system. This is a truly innovative, one-of-a-kind Arizona approach to health care, and it sends a loud signal about our steadfast commitment to caring for the most vulnerable in our state."
