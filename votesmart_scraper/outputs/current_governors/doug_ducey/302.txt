Super Bowl XLIX is almost here and it's an exciting time for Arizona.
As a sports fan, I'm pretty excited. I know you are too.
Not only does this week provide a huge economic boost for our state, but it's a prime opportunity to showcase Arizona to the rest of the country. It's a chance for everyone in the world to know what we know -- that Arizona is the place to be.
Let's make this a great week filled of a lot of fun.
It's game time, Arizona.
