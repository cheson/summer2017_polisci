Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: June 30, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

On the second anniversary of the Yarnell Hill Fire, Arizona State Parks today purchased 320 acres of State Trust land near the site where 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots sacrificed their lives while battling one of the most devastating fires in Arizona's history. This site is now the Granite Mountain Hotshots Memorial State Park.
"This site will serve as a lasting memorial to the brave hotshots who gave their lives to protect their community," said Governor Ducey. "While we can never truly repay our debt to these heroes, we can -- and should -- honor them every day. Arizona is proud to offer the public a space where we can pay tribute to them, their families and all of our firefighters and first responders for generations to come."
Arizona State Parks Executive Director Sue Black said, "Arizona State Parks is proud and humbled to add Granite Mountain Hotshots Memorial State Park to our family." Black, who concurrently serves as Chairman of the Yarnell Hill Memorial Site Board, continued, "We look forward to working together to open this Park to the public."
The purchase was funded by a $500,000 legislative appropriation resulting from HB 2624, the 2014 bill championed by Senator Steve Pierce and Representative Karen Fann. The bill also established the Yarnell Hill Memorial Site Board, which consists of the following members: Arizona State Parks Executive Director Sue Black (Chairman); Senator Steve Pierce; Representative Karen Fann; State Forester Jeff Whitney; John Flynn; Dan Fraijo; Prescott Mayor Marlin Kuykendall; Amanda Marsh; Brendan McDonough; Lenora Nelson; Fire Chief Ben Palm; Retired Fire Chief Darrell Willis; Yavapai County Supervisor Rowle Simmons; Chuck Tidey; and Aaron Green.
