Governor-Elect Ducey's Statement On The Anniversary Of The Attack On Pearl Harbor
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Dec. 7, 2014
Location: Phoenix, AZ

"The attack on Pearl Harbor was one of darkest days in American history. Today, we pay tribute to the more than 2,300 heroes, including the 1,177 crewman on board the USS Arizona, who tragically lost their lives bravely serving our nation 73 years ago.
"The United States is the land of the free and the home of the brave, and in the days, months, weeks and years that followed the attack, our country's resolve never wavered as we fought for our freedoms at home, in the South Pacific and throughout Europe.
"Today, we not only remember those who died at Pearl Harbor, but the patriots who currently serve in the United States Military and put their lives at risk every day to defend our way of life. They will all be in my thoughts and prayers."
