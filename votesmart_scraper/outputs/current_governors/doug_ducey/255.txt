Governor Ducey issued the following statement this evening regarding a change in adoption practices he is making at the Arizona Department of Child Safety:
"I have made it abundantly clear since day one that my administration is unambiguously and unapologetically pro-adoption. With 17,000 children under the state's care, we need more adoption in Arizona, not less. That's why I feel strongly -- as I have said many times before -- that all loving families should be able to serve as foster parents and adopt. I also have said my administration will follow the law. Practices have been brought to my attention that do not match those priorities, therefore, I'm instructing the Arizona Department of Child Safety to immediately ensure that all legally married couples in Arizona are able to jointly serve as foster parents and adopt. All children deserve a loving home, and under my watch, I'm committed to making sure government encourages that."
