Statement from Governor Ducey: Lowering Flags in Honor of Slain Navajo Nation Officer
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: March 20, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

"I'm deeply saddened to learn that Navajo Nation Police Officer Alex Yazzie was shot and killed in the line of duty Thursday night. Like all of our brave men and women who wear the badge, Officer Yazzie risked his life daily to protect our communities and our citizens. His death is a stark and sobering reminder that, for law enforcement, no call is ever routine.
I ask that all Arizonans join me in praying for his family, the Navajo Nation community, and all of our peace officers who perform a dangerous but important job to keep us safe. Please also keep in your thoughts and prayers Officers Herbert Frazier and James Hale, who were injured in the exchange. We wish them a full and speedy recovery.

In honor of Officer Yazzie, I have directed that flags at all state buildings be lowered tomorrow, Saturday, March 21, 2015, from sunrise until sunset. I will order that flags again be lowered on the day of his interment, for which services are pending."
