Governor Doug Ducey Signs Career And Technical Education Funding Package
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Feb. 17, 2016
Location: Phoenix, AZ

"In January, I stood in front of a joint legislature to deliver my priorities for this session -- and key among them was a strong focus on career and technical education.
"Now, following a bipartisan -- unanimous -- vote in both chambers, we are one step closer to providing vital support for thousands of Arizona students while keeping a structurally-balanced budget.

"This victory is a high testament to what I've said since the beginning -- we can be responsible with our budget while adding significant, real dollars to K-12 education.
"Over the past month, I've traveled the state corner to corner. I've met with education leaders, teachers, principals, parents and students. They share this commitment to ensuring that all Arizona students are prepared for life after high school graduation -- whether college or career.
"To them, and to all Arizonans, I'm proud to say that the plan I signed today delivers. I thank our legislators -- especially Speaker David Gowan and President Andy Biggs -- for working swiftly and in good faith to put our kids first."
