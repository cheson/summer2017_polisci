Governor Doug Ducey today announced the realignment of the Arizona Governor's Office of Education, previously the Governor's Office of Education Innovation, to focus on Governor Ducey's education initiatives.
The office's website, launched today, will create an additional forum to share information on the work of the office and to solicit public input on a variety of education policy initiatives.
