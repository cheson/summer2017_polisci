Statement From Governor Doug Ducey Wishing Arizonans A Happy Thanksgiving
"As citizens of this great state and exceptional nation, we all have something for which we are thankful this holiday season. For me, it's the love of my family and friends, the promise of my freedom, the strength of my faith, the gift of my health, the honor of serving Arizona and, of course, the excitement of a full day of good food and football.
"For those of us fortunate to spend this occasion with loved ones, please keep in mind those whose service to our country may be keeping them far from theirs. It is the selfless sacrifice of our women and men in uniform that guarantees us the freedom and security we enjoy this Thanksgiving, and every day of the year. Our thoughts, prayers and gratitude are with our nation's military members in all corners of the world, as well as their families. May God protect and bless them with a safe and peaceful holiday season.
Happy Thanksgiving, Arizona!"
