The people have spoken.
If nothing else, this year proved what millions of Americans have been saying all along: Washington, D.C. is broken. And now -- with a businessman in the White House and a governor in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building -- we finally have an opportunity to drain the swamp.
So today, as the governor of Arizona, I'm proud to applaud our state legislators for passing an "Article V resolution" to limit the scope and jurisdiction of the federal government and finally impose fiscal restraints on the tax-and-spenders in Washington.
Article Five of the United States Constitution states that, when two-thirds of state legislatures resolve to do so, they may call together a "convention of states" to discuss (and even officially propose) changes to the way things are done in Washington. Think of it as the CEO stepping in to bring order to an office run amok. Passing this resolution has added Arizona to the growing list of states that have applied for such a convention, making it clear that, when the federal government won't willingly listen to the people, the people will make them listen.
I'm currently in my third year as governor, and I'm all too aware of the unfortunate reality that, for far too long, our state's hands have been tied by federal bureaucracy. Drugs and human smuggling along the border. Unfair regulations. Out-of-control government spending. They just haven't listened. I am more than eager to join with other states, hand-in-hand, to throw out the red tape and clean out the cobwebs, especially in areas that are best left to state and local governments.
