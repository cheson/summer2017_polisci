Governor Ducey's Statement On Wrong-Way Driving
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: June 7, 2017
Location: Phoenix, AZ

"As we pray for the two individuals killed last night on State Route 51, and for their families, the state must also take action to more seriously address the issue of wrong-way driving.
Following last night's accident, I have instructed the Department of Transportation, the Department of Public Safety, and my Office of Highway Safety to convene immediately and increase efforts to mitigate and prevent this public safety issue.
I have specifically ordered that the planned launch of thermal camera detection technology be expedited. I want those cameras implemented as quickly as possible, and expanded to as many areas as possible where they may make a difference and save a life. We also need to take some immediate actions to increase enforcement and public awareness. All of this needs to be done in collaboration with local law enforcement agencies.
I want all Arizonans to know the state takes this issue extremely seriously. Our goal is to reduce fatalities and save lives, and we will take every appropriate measure in order to do so."
