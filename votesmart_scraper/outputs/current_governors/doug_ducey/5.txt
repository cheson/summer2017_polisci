Under legislation signed today by Governor Doug Ducey, Arizona's most vulnerable citizens will have access to an additional 12 months of economic assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. Included in House Bill 2372 are reforms to incentivize recipients to seek a job or complete a work program and make sure their kids have at least a 90 percent school attendance record.
House Bill 2372 provides further assistance to at-risk or vulnerable populations by expanding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to individuals convicted of a felony offense and waiving initial licensing fees for those at 200 percent or below the federal poverty level.
"With these bipartisan reforms, we are re-thinking our welfare system from one that just provides government assistance to one that offers a hand up and bridge out of poverty," said Governor Ducey. "This legislation will have a real-life impact for many in need. It rewards those making an honest effort to get off government assistance and incentivizes seeking a job and making sure kids are getting to school. I'm proud that we were able to achieve these important reforms, and thank legislative leaders and Representative Weninger for their efforts."
Both extending TANF benefits and waiving licensing fees for those in poverty were two highlights of Governor Ducey's State of the State address in January.
