Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: April 9, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

In honor of Prisoners of War Remembrance Day -- held annually on April 9 -- Governor Doug Ducey issued a proclamation today calling upon all Arizonans to pay respect and gratitude to all of the men and women of our nation's armed forces who have suffered captivity in foreign countries during active service.
"Today, we pause to recognize the brave members of our armed forces who, throughout history, have been taken captive by an enemy nation while fighting to protect us at home.
We are eternally indebted to these men and women. Day after day, American heroes put on the uniform and answer the call to service -- selflessly relinquishing their personal freedom to preserve ours. To those who have not returned home, they are in our thoughts, prayers and hearts. We forever honor them, and we continue to pray for their safe return.
I ask that all Arizonans join me in paying respect to our nation's Prisoners of War, their families and all who serve and sacrifice in the name of our national and personal security. God Bless them all."
