Governor Doug Ducey today signed House Bill 2153, which exempts surviving spouses or dependents of a U.S. military service member killed in the line of duty from paying a Vehicle License Tax and registration fee.
"We must continually honor the brave women and men who've served and sacrificed in defense of our nation's freedom -- not only with our words, but with action," said Governor Ducey. "We owe our patriots in uniform, and their families, a debt that can never be repaid, so this bill is only a small token of our appreciation. Supporting our military members, veterans and their families will remain a top priority."
