In keeping with his mission to reduce red tape and regulations in state government, Governor Doug Ducey today signed into law H.B. 2297 - legislation that prohibits state agencies from adopting rules that would increase existing regulation on property rights or business.

"This measure reflects my commitment to ensuring government operates at the speed of business, while also ensuring agencies can no longer overstep their authority by making laws," said Governor Ducey. "I'm proud to support legislation that keeps regulations lean and reduces redundancies and burdens wherever possible."
