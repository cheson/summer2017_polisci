Governor Doug Ducey Convenes Special Session On Education Funding
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Oct. 28, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey has issued a call to the Arizona State Legislature for a Special Session beginning today, October 28, 2015, for lawmakers to act on a plan that injects $3.5 billion in additional dollars into Arizona schools over the next 10 years, permanently establishes certainty for K-12 funding and resolves the ongoing lawsuit over education funding.
 
"In January's State of the State address, I called on both sides to settle this lawsuit. Now, we are ready to do just that," said Governor Ducey. "By working together with legislative and education leaders, we've built a winning plan that gives educators the resources they've been asking for and sends a strong message about the value of education in Arizona. Finally, we can stop paying lawyers, and start paying teachers.
"By better utilizing dollars in the state's Permanent Land Endowment Trust Fund, this plan will get billions of dollars flowing to our kids and teachers all while protecting our general fund budget and without raising taxes on Arizonans.
 
"There is strong support and momentum behind this effort. We've worked together to get to this point; now it's time to get this done for Arizona kids, families and teachers."
