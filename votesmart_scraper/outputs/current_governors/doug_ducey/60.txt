As our economy advances, our government and our laws need to modernize too -- and that means ensuring government regulations don't prohibit or delay hardworking Arizonans from making a living. Governor Ducey has already taken significant action to help small businesses and start-ups thrive, and will continue to embrace innovation and support 21st century companies that employ Arizonans, advance the way we do business and improve the way we live.
