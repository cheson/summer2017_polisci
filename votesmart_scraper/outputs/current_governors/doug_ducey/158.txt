"Justice Antonin Scalia was a true patriot and a fierce defender of the United States Constitution. His unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting the founding principles of our country was an inspiration to those of us devoted to the expansion of freedom. I was honored to visit with him just last year on his trip to Arizona, and today, my heart and prayers go to his family. While we mourn his death, his wisdom lives on. Because of Justice Scalia, Americans live in a more free and just nation. May he rest in peace."
