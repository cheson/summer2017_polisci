Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Nov. 29, 2016
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey and Lucid Motors today announced the company has selected Casa Grande for its electric car manufacturing operation. The facility will bring over 2,000 projected new jobs and more than $700 million in capital investment to the region by 2022.
"Lucid Motors' expansion into Casa Grande is the latest evidence that Arizona leads the nation in attracting innovative technology companies to our state," Governor Ducey said. "This project will create thousands of new direct jobs, support many more indirect jobs, and attract new suppliers to the Casa Grande region. I thank Lucid Motors for its commitment to Arizona, as well as Sonora's Governor Claudia Pavlovich, Senator McCain, Senator Flake, the Arizona Commerce Authority, Pinal County, and the City of Casa Grande for the hard work and collaboration that helped make this happen."
Following an extensive search across 13 states and 60 sites, Lucid Motors selected Arizona based on numerous positive factors including business climate, infrastructure, talent, geographic location, and the automotive supply chain in the Arizona-Sonora Megaregion.
