Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: April 4, 2017
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed legislation that allows individuals who have served their time to be employed as peer-coaches in targeted substance abuse treatment and reentry programs. House Bill 2196, sponsored by Representative Heather Carter and passed with unanimous bipartisan support in both chambers of the Legislature, removes roadblocks that prevent treatment facilities from employing Arizonans who have overcome their owns pasts with substance abuse.
"All Arizonans deserve the opportunity to find a job and make a better life for themselves," said Governor Ducey. "For individuals who have served their time, this can be especially challenging. That's why we've focused on building a support system for those leaving prison and reducing barriers to employment. This bill is an important step toward those goals and I'm proud to sign it into law."
Governor Ducey's efforts to expand opportunity for ex-offenders include establishing employment centers in prisons, building a re-entry center in Maricopa County, and creating substance abuse programs for those exiting prison.
In addition, his fiscal year 2018 Executive Budget provides funds for additional substance abuse counselors and a re-entry planner at the Department of Arizona Corrections and creates a post-release fire crew.
