"This latest incident only reinforces the need to take our national security seriously on all fronts. News like this is very troubling, especially in light of new threats on the United States from ISIS in a video released in just the last 24 hours.
"Our state is grateful to the law enforcement officials and agents on the ground who made these apprehensions, but more vigilance is needed at all levels. I've been consistent in saying we want to partner with the federal government, as we have been through our border strike force efforts.
"This Monday, members of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee are coming to Arizona, and I will personally be making the case for enhanced security along our border to build on the efforts already underway. It's clear, our nation needs to up its game and improve border resources if we are going to protect our homeland."
