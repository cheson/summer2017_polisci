Uber Expands Footprint in Arizona
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: June 11, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today attended the opening of Uber's Center of Excellence in downtown Phoenix and reiterated his support of the ride-sharing company and lightening government regulation to make Arizona more business friendly.
Uber's Phoenix office will employ several hundred people over the next five years.
"My administration is a 21st-century administration, and we're going to embrace 21st century ingenuity," said Governor Ducey. "We're going to do everything we can to make sure our business environment is keeping up with the times. That's why I'm thrilled about this facility we're here celebrating today."
"This is good news all around," added Governor Ducey. "This Center of Excellence will provide first-rate support to Uber customers and partners and one of the nation's most dynamic companies will have a bigger footprint in Arizona."
Governor Ducey signed House Bill 2135 in April 2015, allowing ride-sharing services (like Uber) to operate legally in Arizona.
