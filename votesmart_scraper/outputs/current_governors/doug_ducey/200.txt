Governor Doug Ducey to Light Arizona Capitol Dome Purple in Observance of "Domestic Violence Awareness Month"
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Sept. 22, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey will light the Capitol dome purple as a symbol of Arizona's dedication to ending domestic violence at an event outside the Capitol on October 1, 2015 from 6:00--7:00 P.M. All Arizonans are encouraged to attend.
"Domestic violence is a pervasive problem that affects 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men in Arizona, and stands in direct opposition to our No. 1 priority of protecting Arizona families and communities," said Governor Ducey. "This is an issue that affects all ages, races, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds and education levels. As Arizonans, we all have a responsibility to know the signs, to help the victimized and vulnerable and to speak out against it whenever we can. I encourage Arizonans to stand with me as we send the unwavering message that domestic violence can stop."
Arizonans can join in this effort by lighting their homes purple. The Home Depot is selling purple light bulbs at all Arizona store locations, with a portion of the proceeds going to support domestic violence prevention.
