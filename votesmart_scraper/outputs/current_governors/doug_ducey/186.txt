Governor Doug Ducey Declares November Veteran Employment Month
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Nov. 4, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Arizona is home to more than half a million military veterans. And we have a responsibility to serve all of them with the same commitment with which they've served our nation.
In addition to our gratitude and support, one of the most important things we can offer a veteran when he or she takes off the uniform, is a job. An opportunity to benefit in the civilian workforce.
And, hiring a veteran is a "win -- win" situation.  They bring valuable skills, knowledge, experience, discipline and leadership to the employers who hire them.
The Arizona Department of Veterans' Services and the Arizona Coalition for Military Families are leading the way in bringing key stakeholders together from the public and private sectors to connect service members, veterans and their families with real, quality jobs.
In recognition of this, I have proclaimed November 2015 as "Veteran Employment Month."
It's a way of focusing on those employers that have demonstrated they are truly "Arizona Veteran Supportive Employers."
And I'm proud that many of our very own agencies, including the Department of Corrections and the Department of Economic Security -- are among those employers.
Thank you. By hiring our veterans and their families, you're contributing to a strong workforce, helping to build Arizona's economy, and making our state the best place in the country for our military heroes in uniform to live, work, and do business.
Thank you.
