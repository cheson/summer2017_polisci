Governor Doug Ducey Signs Legislation To End Live Dog Racing In Arizona
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: May 13, 2016
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed two bills ending live dog racing in Arizona -- House Bill 2127, which prohibits greyhound racing effective January 1, 2017, and House Bill 2387, which repeals the financing that supports it.
Both bills were unanimously approved by the Legislature and supported by all stakeholders involved.
"Greyhound racing has run its course in Arizona," said Governor Ducey. "It's heartening that these beautiful greyhounds will soon be off the track and in loving homes. For any families looking to adopt a new canine companion this summer, I encourage you to consider one of these gentle and intelligent dogs. I thank Rep. JD Mesnard and Rep. Eddie Farnsworth for sponsoring this legislation, and all the lawmakers and stakeholders who worked in good faith to get it passed and sent to my desk with unanimous support."
Although the legislation allows for racing until the end of the year, Tucson Greyhound Park has received approval from the Arizona Racing Commission to end live dog racing even sooner -- by the end of June. This means these greyhounds will be ready for adoption this summer.
