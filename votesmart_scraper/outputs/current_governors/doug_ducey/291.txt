Governor Doug Ducey's Statement On Kayla Mueller
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Feb. 6, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

"As a parent, it's unfathomable to imagine the pain and heartache Kayla Mueller's parents have lived with and the uncertainty they must feel today. Kayla has devoted her life to serving others. At just 26, she has literally been around the world, with the simple but righteous goal of making it a better place. As long as there are humanitarians like Kayla in this world, evil will not prevail. My thoughts and prayers, like all Arizonans and Americans, continue to be with Kayla and her family."
