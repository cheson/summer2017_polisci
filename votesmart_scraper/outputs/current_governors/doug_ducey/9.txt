Press Release

Date: May 12, 2017
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed Arizona's fiscal year 2018 budget, making new investments in Arizona's K-12 public schools, universities, transportation infrastructure and programs that help the state's most vulnerable citizens. The budget, which reflects many of the priorities outlined in the governor's State of the State Address and executive budget proposal released in January, adds $163 million for K-12 schools above inflation and provides a permanent raise for teachers. The package also provides new dollars for transportation infrastructure and rural roads, and funds recidivism and drug treatment programs.
"I'm proud to say these investments will make an immediate and lasting difference for students and teachers in Arizona, in our rural communities, and for those looking for a second chance," said Governor Ducey. "With this budget, we are targeting dedicated resources toward teacher raises, early literacy education, and programs that work. And we are doing it all without raising taxes on hardworking Arizonans. This goes to show we can be fiscally responsible and fund the things that matter most to our state. I will continue to work hard to hear the priorities of our citizens and make them Arizona's priorities."
Arizona's education investments will include:
$68 million for a permanent 2% teacher pay raise over two years
$30 million in on-going funding for transportation infrastructure and rural roads
$37.6 million for results-based funding at public schools, half of which is earmarked for teacher raises
$20 million over two years for early literacy programs, including full-day kindergarten
$80 million for the construction and maintenance of school facilities
$7.3 million for IT upgrades to more efficiently make payments to schools at the Department of Education
$3 million in matching funds for rural school access to internet connectivity/broadband generating approximately $100 million in total funds
$2.6 million additional funds for small and isolated rural schools
$1 million for high school graduates to complete JTED programs
$250,000 to expand principal leadership training
$250,000 to expand teacher loan forgiveness
$100,000 for dropout prevention programs
