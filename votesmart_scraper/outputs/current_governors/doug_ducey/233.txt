"Today marks a solemn anniversary for the state of Arizona, as we remember the 19 brave men who gave their lives at Yarnell Hill two years ago.
"These elite Granite Mountain Hotshots represented the very best of our state and our nation. We'll never forget their service, nor take for granted their sacrifice. Our thoughts and prayers are with them every day, and continue to be with their families, the entire Yarnell community and all of the firefighters and first responders who risk their lives every day. To perform an inherently dangerous job in selfless defense of others takes a rare form of courage. These men did it daily, willingly and without hesitation. They were heroes, and they will forever be remembered as such.
"In commemoration of this anniversary, and out of respect for our fallen 19, I have ordered that flags at all state office buildings be lowered from sunrise until sunset today,Tuesday, June 30, 2015."
