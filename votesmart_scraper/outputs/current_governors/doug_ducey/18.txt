Statement
By: Doug Ducey

Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed legislation to increase the severity of the punishment for attacks on law enforcement officers that are motivated by hatred against law enforcement. Senate Bill 1366 establishes malice against law enforcement as an aggravating factor when sentencing criminals who assault police officers.
"Our police officers put their lives on the line every day to defend our communities and keep our streets safe," said Governor Ducey. "Their job is dangerous enough already, and we have zero tolerance for anyone who would target officers simply for doing their jobs. This legislation sends the clear message that Arizona stands firmly by its men and women in uniform, and I am proud to sign it."
