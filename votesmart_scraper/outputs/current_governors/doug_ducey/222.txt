By: Doug Ducey
Date: July 21, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

In coordination with the President's proclamation, Governor Doug Ducey has ordered that flags at all Arizona state office buildings be lowered to half-staff beginning today, July 21, 2015, until sunset July 25, 2015, in honor of the five United States service members killed last week by a gunman in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
"These were men who dedicated their lives to serving and saving others. That they were taken in this senseless shooting continues to anger and sadden all Americans. Our hearts ache for their families and loved ones, and our thoughts, prayers and gratitude are with all of the brave men and women of our nation's armed forces.
"As we grieve the loss of our four Marines and one Navy officer, we also offer our eternal gratitude for their time on this earth, and their service and sacrifice to this country. We will never forget, nor take for granted, what they risked to defend our freedom and keep us safe. God Bless them all."
