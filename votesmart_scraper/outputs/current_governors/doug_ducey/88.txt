Press Release

Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey has proclaimed Saturday, September 24, 2016, as Arizona Hunting and Fishing Day to celebrate and recognize hunters and anglers for their immense contributions to fish and wildlife conservation and the Arizona economy.
Last year, Arizona's 786,000 hunters and anglers spent more than $1.2 billion, supporting 18,220 Arizona jobs, generating $131,755,796 in state and local taxes and $53,799,168 to support the conservation efforts of the Arizona Game and Fish Department.
"Hunters and anglers have a rich and storied history in Arizona," Governor Doug Ducey said. "From the pine tipped mountains of Northern Arizona to the Saguaro filled valleys of the Sonoran Desert, our state has so many beautiful corners to enjoy the outdoors, lands and wildlife. The economic impact of hunters and anglers allows the state of Arizona to continue to preserve and protect our precious animals -- ranging from Arizona's wild horses to its desert tortoises. I thank Arizona's hunters and anglers for their continued support of our land and wildlife."
