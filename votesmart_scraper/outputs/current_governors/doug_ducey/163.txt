Governor Doug Ducey's Monthly Address: Justice For Rape Victims
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Feb. 2, 2016
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Ducey's monthly address focuses on efforts to require the investigation of thousands of untested rape kits in Arizona.
Governor Ducey highlighted the issue in his 2016 state of the state address and included dollars in his executive budget to start the process of testing the kits, and formed a bipartisan task force last week charged with drafting legisation to ensure every kit is analzyed.
Listen to the governor's radio address, here and read a transcript of the address below.
Hello,
Backlogged rape kits have become a problem rampant in city, county and state governments across the United States. In Arizona's largest county there are 2,300 rape kits sitting in storage waiting to be tested. When it comes to the welfare of women in our state, there will be zero tolerance for men who victimize. Government's greatest responsibility is to protect its people -- in this instance, we must do better.
It is unacceptable that predators roam free, and women await justice while rape kits gather dust. On my watch, the state of Arizona will do whatever it takes to lock these criminals away. And we're taking action.
I've established a special team to develop statewide, standard processes for testing and tracking protocols of the kits to ensure every single one is tested in a timely manner. I'm putting money behind this too. My budget includes dollars to help clear the backlogs and put these predators behind bars, where they belong.
I want these victims of sexual assault to know the state of Arizona supports you 100 percent. We are committed to solving this injustice once and for all.
