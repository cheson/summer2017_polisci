"Three years ago today, Arizona lost 19 brave Granite Mountain Hotshots to the most devastating wildfire in Arizona history. Our hearts are with their families, fellow firefighters and the community of Yarnell on this solemn anniversary.
"The Yarnell 19 made the ultimate sacrifice to protect a community and keep residents out of harm's way. We are forever grateful to these heroes for their service to Arizona. I join my fellow Arizonans in sending prayers for them and their loved ones, along with all of the fire professionals and families fighting wildfires across Arizona and the West. We are grateful to have so many skilled and selfless professionals working around the clock to keep us safe this and every wildfire season.
In commemoration of this anniversary, and in honor of our fallen 19, I have ordered that flags at all state office buildings be lowered from sunrise to sunset today, Thursday, June 30, 2016."
