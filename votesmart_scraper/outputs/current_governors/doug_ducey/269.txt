Location: Phoenix, AZ

"This weekend, Arizonans will come together in celebration of two of the most sacred and joyous holidays of the Jewish and Christian customs.
"I hope all Arizonans have the opportunity to join their families and loved ones to rejoice in these important occasions. As you do, please keep in your thoughts and prayers those who may be separated from theirs as they serve our country and keep us safe. May God Bless our service members, their families and the entire State of Arizona."
"I wish all Arizonans a happy and healthy Passover and Easter weekend."
