Statement From Governor Doug Ducey: Memorial Day
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: May 23, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

"On Memorial Day, we honor the men and women who have laid down their lives in defense of American freedom and democracy.
"For as long as we've had independence, we've had heroes who risk everything to protect it. There is no cause more noble, no calling more selfless.
"Our nation isn't exceptional by accident, and it isn't free by birthright. As President Reagan would remind us, freedom "must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation, for it only comes once to a people. Those who have known freedom and then lost it have never known it again.'
"We're eternally grateful to the men and women who fight every day so that we may always know freedom, and we're especially indebted to those who've made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf. May God watch over them, may He protect those who continue to serve and may He continue to bless the military families who make daily sacrifices of their own.
"In honor of Memorial Day and the service members who've died for our country, I have ordered that all state flags be lowered to half-staff from sunrise until noon on Monday, May 25, 2015. I invite all Arizonans to join in this tribute."
