Statement From Governor Doug Ducey Regarding Comments By Governor Jerry Brown
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Dec. 5, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

"All of Arizona mourns for the victims in California. To politicize a tragedy of this magnitude and use it as an opportunity to attack our state is out of bounds. Not only will we be ignoring Gov. Brown's advice, but I call on him to retract his incredibly thoughtless and ill-advised comments."
