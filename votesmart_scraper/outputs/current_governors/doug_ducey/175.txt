Location: Phoenix, AZ

"In observance of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, Governor Doug Ducey has ordered that flags at all state buildings be lowered to half-staff on Monday, December 7, from sunrise to sunset.

"Seventy-four years ago, our nation awoke to news that would forever change the course of American history. The midmorning surprise assault on our naval base at Pearl Harbor would last just two hours, but destroy 20 American naval vessels, take the lives of about 2,400 U.S. service members and injure 1,000 more.

"December 7 is an especially poignant anniversary for the state of Arizona, as nearly half of those killed in the attack were crewmen aboard the USS Arizona. I'm proud and honored to commemorate this solemn but important occasion from the place where World War II began for our nation, and to pay my respects for the 1,177 crew members who lost their lives on the historic battleship named for our state.

"On Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, let us pause to remember all of the American service members who made the ultimate sacrifice protecting our homeland, the patriotic heroes of our Greatest Generation who answered the call to serve their country in World War II, and the brave women and men who continue to fight for American lives and liberties across the world today. They deserve our highest respect and remain forever in our thoughts and prayers."

Tomorrow, Governor Ducey on behalf of the state of Arizona, will lay a wreath at the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor in memory of those lost in the attacks.
