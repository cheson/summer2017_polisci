Statement

Governor Doug Ducey today signed House Bill 2502, which enters Arizona into the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, improving the medical licensing process and allowing for increased access to medical care.
"I've said repeatedly that we want Arizona to be the healthiest state in that nation. The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact increases Arizona's ability to attract top quality doctors to the state by dramatically decreasing licensing time, and lets the world's most talented physicians know that Arizona is open for business. Patients also benefit as the bill ensures that bureaucratic regulations, like processing paperwork, do not keep qualified physicians out of the operating room where they could be saving lives. I appreciate Rep. Heather Carter's leadership on this significant legislation."
