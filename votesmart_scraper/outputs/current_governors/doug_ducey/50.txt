Governor Ducey Announces RedTape.AZ.Gov
Press Release

Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today announced a new program aimed at freeing Arizona's businesses from the burden of harmful and outdated regulations standing in the way of economic growth and job creation.
The website--RedTape.AZ.Gov--is a new online service that empowers Arizonans to make recommendations about how to update our state's regulatory system. The innovative program allows individuals across the state to recommend ways to improve or eliminate outdated (often-hidden) regulations directly to the Governor's Office at no cost to them or to their business.
"Decades of overreach by government and special interest groups have left burdensome regulations scattered throughout our economy," said Governor Ducey. "Finding them can sometimes feel like an expensive scavenger hunt that our small businesses simply can't afford. This innovative program will decrease the time and energy it takes to clear out old regulations and will speed up the process of improving government for the 21st century."
RedTape.AZ.Gov is a strategic step in the governor's ongoing work to make Arizona the best state in the nation to open a new business or expand an existing one. Many regulations have already been eliminated, but there's still a lot more that can be done.
Governor Ducey's goal is to eliminate a total of 500 of these regulations by the end of 2017.
There's no regulation too small or rule too out-of-date to suggest that could expand opportunities for people across the state. You send it and we'll see it--because big things can happen when government gets out of the way of an economy on the rise.
