Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: March 30, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today released the following statement on his signing of HB 2001, a policy he called for in his January 12 State of the State address that permanently indexes Arizona's income tax to inflation.
"I'm proud to sign this common-sense but significant legislation to protect our taxpayers by eliminating a hidden tax increase on Arizonans. This is one more crucial measure to keep our tax rates reasonable and predictable while further promoting our open-for-business agenda. It's good government, it's good for Arizona, and it fulfills a key campaign promise on which I was elected. I want to thank the Legislature - especially the sponsor of the bill, Rep. Olson - and all the business leaders, organizations and individuals who helped champion this needed reform."
