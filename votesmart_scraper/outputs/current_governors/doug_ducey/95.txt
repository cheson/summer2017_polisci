"Today is a great day for Arizona schools, students and teachers.
"Thanks to the voters' approval of Proposition 123 in May, Arizona school districts today will receive hundreds of millions of dollars -- just the beginning of what they can expect this year, and only a portion of the $3.5 billion that will directly benefit our public K-12 classrooms over the next 10 years. These new resources will make a meaningful difference in the lives of teachers and kids across our state.
"Teachers like Maddy will get a raise, and her students won't have to share textbooks. Paul can quit one of his three jobs and focus more on helping his students. Mitch will be able to afford his daughter's swimming lessons and child care while he and his wife teach full-time at Flagstaff High School.
"A broad, bipartisan coalition of elected officials, education and community leaders made this happen. And today, thousands of teachers will begin receiving the boost they need to do the important job of educating our kids."
