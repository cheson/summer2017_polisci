A great economy requires great public schools. Arizona is already doing a lot of things well, with three of the top 10 public high schools in the country and nationally renowned teachers and principals. During his first year in office, the Governor worked with the legislature to pass a historic $3.5 billion dollar funding plan for Arizona public schools. He remains committed to ensuring kids and teachers get the resources they have been asking for while realizing that spending is not the measure of success. He will continue to work with lawmakers and education leaders on reforms that improve educational results and help kids reach their full potential.
