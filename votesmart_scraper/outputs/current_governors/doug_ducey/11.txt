Press Release

Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed legislation expanding a program that allows non-violent felony criminals to undergo treatment programs as an alternative to prosecution. Under the Felony Pretrial Intervention Program, offenders admit to their guilt, agree to make full restitution to any victims, and enroll in programs to treat substance abuse and other behavioral or health issues.
"This is another reform to ensure our corrections system is truly about corrections," said Governor Ducey. "With this legislation, and our previous actions to reduce recidivism, we are providing a real second chance to Arizona citizens who want to get back on their feet and start a new life. I thank Senator Smith for his leadership on this issue."
Currently, Maricopa County is the only county in the state to operate a Felony Pretrial Intervention Program. Senate Bill 1278 provides $2.75 million in the recently passed budget to expand this program to all Arizona counties.
