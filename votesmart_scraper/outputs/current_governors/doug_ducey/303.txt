Location: Phoenix, AZ

In anticipation of the release of his Executive Budget this afternoon, Governor Doug Ducey stood in unity this morning with House Speaker David Gowan and Senate President Andy Biggs.
Governor Ducey will release his budget this afternoon to members of the Legislature and looks forward to continuing working with legislative leadership to solve the state's budget gap in a responsible way that protects taxpayers and protects classrooms.
"It's great to stand united with Speaker Gowan and President Biggs today," said Governor Ducey. "My budget offers spending discipline that balances our budget, while protecting vital commitments. I will govern under a Classrooms First Initiative, and this budget reflects that priority. It also protects taxpayers by rejecting calls to raise taxes. I look forward to working with the Speaker and President to get it passed."
"Arizona is on the right track to a thriving economy and I am pleased to work alongside Governor Ducey and President Biggs to begin the process of getting to a structurally balanced budget," said Speaker David Gowan. "I look forward to working with my members in the House to get Arizona's budget balanced."
"The people of Arizona have entrusted us with solving this budget crisis and doing it in a responsible way," said President Biggs. "I am glad to stand with Governor Ducey today as we work together to bring our budget into balance and make wise decisions that will grow our economy and put our state on a stable path forward."
