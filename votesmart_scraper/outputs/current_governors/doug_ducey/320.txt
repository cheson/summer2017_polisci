"Tonight, I send warm wishes to the Jewish community and all Arizonans celebrating Hanukkah.
The Hanukkah story reminds us that even in the darkest of times, light can be found. The story is a symbol of hope, perseverance and faith for millions around the world.
As we celebrate the holiday season, let us not forgot the brave men and women serving the United States of America away from their families. Their commitment to our freedom is heroic and I wish them a blessed and safe holiday."
