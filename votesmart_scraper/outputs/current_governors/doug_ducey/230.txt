Following incidents this weekend at the Hualapai Unit in Kingman, Governor Doug Ducey toured the prison Sunday morning, where he received the latest briefings from public safety officials on the ground, surveyed damage and met with local county and city officials to thank them for their swift response.

I want to thank all the local and state law enforcement authorities, especially members of the Arizona Department of Corrections Tactical Support Units, for the professional and urgent manner in which they are addressing this situation. Mayor Richardson and Sheriff McCabe have the full support of the state, and I thank them for their cooperation. I will remain in close communication with Director Ryan and Director Milstead as we monitor this facility and ensure prisoners are properly and safety transferred."
