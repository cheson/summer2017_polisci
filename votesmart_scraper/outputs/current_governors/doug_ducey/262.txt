Governor Doug Ducey Signs Measure to Secure Future of Ridesharing in Arizona
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: April 9, 2015
Location: Washington, DC

Governor Doug Ducey today signed into law H.B. 2135 - bipartisan legislation that legalizes ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft in Arizona.

"This is one more simple but significant measure to promote innovation in Arizona," said Governor Ducey. "Ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft are already booming businesses - rather than standing in the way of growth, we should be encouraging it.

"I'm proud to sign common sense legislation that further reduces limitations to success while supporting enterprise and job growth in our state. I want to thank the legislators - especially Rep. Karen Fann - as well as all the stakeholders who collaborated and compromised to pass this pro-business legislation."
