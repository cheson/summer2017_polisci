Governor Doug Ducey Vetoes House Bill 2568
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: May 10, 2016
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today released the following statement on his veto of House Bill 2568 (community facilities districts; formation; governance).
"I'm a strong advocate for building our economy, and I know that growth and development are key to that success. I've been a champion for our business community and will continue to be. I also understand there are issues to be addressed with our community facilities districts.
However, I'm concerned that this bill does not provide needed protections for the taxpayer. These districts, like all of government, need to be accountable, and when the balance of power disproportionately favors any one side, homeowners and businesses are the ones who suffer.
In any future efforts on this issue, I encourage more emphasis on accountability and reforms that ensure protection for both businesses and taxpayers."
