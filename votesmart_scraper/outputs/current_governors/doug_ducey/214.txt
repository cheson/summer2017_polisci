Governor Doug Ducey today highlighted Arizona State Forestry (AZSF)'s active participation in assisting with wildfire suppression efforts across the west.

"Over the last week AZSF and local cooperators have supplied 50 fire management personnel, the Bear Jaw firefighting crew and 25 wildland fire engines to assist with the California wildfire crisis," said State Forester Jeff Whitney. "We are pleased to send both our staff and our local cooperating Fire Departments. Not only is Arizona's wildland fire community supporting California, AZSF has also dispatched State and local personnel to Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. Additional orders continue to be filled on an ongoing basis."

"I commend AZSF for its ongoing and active efforts to help our neighbors in-need," said Governor Ducey. "Arizona knows what it's like to suffer a devastating fire season, and we understand the importance of out-of-state aid and collaboration. We're grateful during these times to have dedicated, brave firefighters and first responders working day and night to protect people and property. Our hearts and prayers are with all of them, as well as the residents of these states who've been impacted by the fires. We will continue to do everything in our power to assist these states in their efforts to combat these wildfires."
