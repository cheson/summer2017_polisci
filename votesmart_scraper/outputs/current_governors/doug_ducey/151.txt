Governor Doug Ducey Signs Crucial Legislation for Arizona Foster Children
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: March 24, 2016
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed HB 2442 -- "Jacob's Law" -- to ensure easier, better access to behavioral health care for Arizona foster kids and families. Read his statement below:
"There are nearly 19,000 kids in Arizona's foster care system -- many who have suffered unthinkable abuse, trauma and neglect at the hands of the people who are supposed to love and protect them above all else. I can assure you: where these children have been failed and forgotten, Arizona will be there to stand up for them.
"And every day, wonderful people across our state open their hearts and their homes to these vulnerable children -- often facing great burdens and barriers to care for them. People like Anika Robinson, Susan Woodruff and Angela Teachout -- who are not only exceptional foster moms in their own right, but have also taken on the cause of helping thousands of kids and families just like theirs throughout Arizona.
"It is because of their tireless efforts, the leadership of Rep. Eddie Farnsworth and the unanimous, spirited support of the legislature that Jacob's Law exists today. Foster children and families face enough stresses and challenges as it is -- getting urgent and adequate behavioral health treatment should not be one of them. If there were ever a time to do away with red tape and bureaucracy, it's now. This legislation ensures that kids like Jacob will no longer be ignored."
