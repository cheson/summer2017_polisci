Location: Phoenix, AZ

"I'm grateful to the Arizona lawmakers who worked swiftly and diligently to complete the people's work for this session. I've always said government should operate at the speed of business, and legislative leadership, particularly President Biggs and Speaker Gowan, were partners in making that happen.

Of course, it's not just about working quickly -- it's about working in good faith to serve the people of Arizona in the best way we know how. In a few short months, we've set priorities and upheld them, made promises and kept them, and we've taken significant steps to get our fiscal house in order and improve education in the state of Arizona. I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and look forward to working with legislators in the interim and in future sessions to continue leading Arizona forward."
