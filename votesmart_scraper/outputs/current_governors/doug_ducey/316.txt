Governor Ducey inherits a serious budget deficit because our state is spending more than we can afford. After his election, Governor Ducey formed a budget study committee, comprised of experts from the private and public sectors, to provide advice and recommendations on balancing the state's budget. Doing so is going to require all sectors of government to tighten their belts. Just like Arizona families have had to balance their budgets, so will government. What Governor Ducey won't do is raise taxes on Arizona families and businesses, which would stifle economic growth and make our state less competitive.
