Governor Doug Ducey Appoints Substance Abuse Task Force
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey
Date: Feb. 23, 2016
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today announced members of the Arizona Substance Abuse Task Force -- a coalition of leading substance abuse experts, providers and community members focused on addressing and reversing the growing epidemic of drug abuse and addiction in Arizona communities by finding the best treatments and reducing barriers to care. The establishment of this coalition was a key component of the governor's 2016 State of the State address.
"Whether it's unemployment, homelessness, crime, child neglect or the prison population, many of society's most urgent problems can be traced back to a common theme: drug abuse and addiction," said Governor Ducey. "If we're going to successfully address these issues, we must do everything we can to tackle the culprit -- and that means a stronger focus on prevention, early intervention and treatment for those affected. Substance abuse and addiction isn't someone else's problem -- it's Arizona's problem, and it's a growing national crisis. We must work together to raise awareness, to educate our communities, and to reverse this silent but severe epidemic."
The Substance Abuse Task Force will provide recommendations on a variety of substance abuse-related issues, including access to treatment, evidence-based practices, neonatal abstinence syndrome and medically assisted treatment best practices. The Task Force will meet for the first time on March 23, 2016.
