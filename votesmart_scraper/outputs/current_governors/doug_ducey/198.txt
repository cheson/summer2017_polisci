Location: Phoenix, AZ

In conjunction with the 10th annual National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, Governor Doug Ducey and the Office of Youth, Faith and Family are encouraging all Arizonans to safely and responsibly dispose of unwanted, unused and expired prescription medicines at one of the several collection sites throughout the state, including the Arizona State Capitol.
This nationwide event is aimed at preventing prescription medication abuse by giving individuals the opportunity to turn in unwanted or unneeded prescription drugs for proper disposal consistent with Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) policies.
"Prescription Drug Take-Back Day addresses a crucial and growing problem in Arizona and across the nation," said Governor Doug Ducey. "By educating and encouraging individuals to properly discard their unwanted medication -- rather than let it sit in their medicine cabinets, where it's easily accessible and susceptible to misuse -- we can do our part to curb prescription drug abuse in our state. I encourage all Arizonans to visit one of the 117 locations across Arizona tomorrow and be a part of the solution."
