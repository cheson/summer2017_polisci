Hello, this is Governor Doug Ducey.
Wildfire season is upon us and it's up to all of us to help prevent the spread of wildfires.
The fact of the matter is, the vast majority of fires aren't caused by lightning strikes.They're caused by people.
We must be vigilant about preventing fires and ready to combat them when they happen.
As always, keeping our residents, citizens, and firefighters safe is our number one priority.
And one of the ways we can help our hardworking, heroic firefighters is give them fewer to fight.
That's where we come in. /Arizona is one of the best states in the country when it comes to recreation and we want you to enjoy all Arizona has to offer.
As you head out this summer for long weekends -- or visitors come here to enjoy our beautiful weather, I caution everyone to follow the law.
Be safe. Be smart. Have fun, but practice common sense.
Don't leave campfires unattended, and extinguish them completely.
Follow the fire restrictions, and report any violations.
Have a great rest of your summer and be safe!
