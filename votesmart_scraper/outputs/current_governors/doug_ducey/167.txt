A tax forgiveness program built into last year's budget brought in $15 million more than expected for the state of Arizona.
The program was projected to bring in $32 million, but resulted in a $47 million total.
The program ran from September 1 through October 31 and waived all penalties and interest for those who owed the state money if they paid during that time period.
"These are more dollars we are able to invest in priorities that will improve the lives of Arizona citizens," said Governor Ducey. "Whether it's K-12 education, universities, child safety or public safety, we are putting new resources into vital state commitments while also ensuring we live within our means."
