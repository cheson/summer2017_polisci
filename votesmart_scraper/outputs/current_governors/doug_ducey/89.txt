Press Release

Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today announced the 2016 Arizona Tax Recovery Program, which provides Arizona taxpayers the ability to pay any back taxes owed to the state without penalty, interest or criminal prosecution. The program will run from September 1, 2016 through October 31, 2016.
In addition to providing relief to individual taxpayers, taxpayers statewide also benefit from the millions of dollars in uncollected taxes that are recovered and invested in critical programs. In 2015, the program recovered $55 million.
"The tax recovery program offers a great way for individuals or businesses who fell behind on their taxes to make good on their obligations," said Governor Ducey. "By collecting what is owed, we're providing assistance to those seeking to comply with the law, ensuring fairness and keeping Arizona's budget balanced."
State lawmakers authorized the tax recovery program in a law adopted this past spring. This year, taxpayers may pay the tax liability in full by the end of October or pay it off in installments over a 24-month period by Oct. 31, 2018.
"The availability of payment plans provides individuals and businesses that were set back by the Great Recession with some budgetary flexibility to pay their tax obligations," said State Revenue Director David Briant.
