"Welcoming Pope Francis to the United States is a rare opportunity, and it's one I won't forget. Angela and I are honored to have been invited by the President to represent Arizona. As both an American and a Catholic, I was deeply humbled to be a small part of the Pope's historic visit, and I look forward to attending his much-anticipated congressional address on Thursday."
