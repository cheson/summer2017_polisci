Governor Doug Ducey released the following statement today regarding Uber's decision to move its self-driving cars to Arizona due to California's burdensome regulations:
"Arizona welcomes Uber self-driving cars with open arms and wide open roads. While California puts the brakes on innovation and change with more bureaucracy and more regulation, Arizona is paving the way for new technology and new businesses. In 2015, I signed an executive order supporting the testing and operation of self-driving cars in Arizona with an emphasis on innovation, economic growth, and most importantly, public safety. This is about economic development, but it's also about changing the way we live and work. Arizona is proud to be open for business. California may not want you, but we do."
