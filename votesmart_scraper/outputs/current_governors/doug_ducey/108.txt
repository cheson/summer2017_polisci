Governor Doug Ducey Signs Legislation Revamping Economic Development
Press Release
By: Doug Ducey

Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today signed one of the top priority items of his January State of the State address, revamping economic development efforts in Arizona.
House Bill 2666 establishes the Office of Economic Opportunity -- a one-stop economic development shop that will focus on getting government out of the way of job creators, provide a direct link between the business community and the workers and capital they need to be successful, cut down on government overlap to make taxpayer dollars go farther, and create a more unified and effective approach to job attraction and marketing of Arizona.
The office will use real-time data to analyze how Arizona fares against other states, identify ways to drive down regulatory and tax burdens, and develop a statewide workforce plan that aligns with Arizona's economic development priorities.
"Arizona is increasingly a destination for businesses large and small," said Governor Ducey. "As businesses compare each state, searching for high quality of life, light regulations, low taxes, good financing and qualified workers, the Office of Economic Opportunity will be there to help make the pitch and communicate the advantages that Arizona has to offer. I commend Rep. Fann for her leadership in this significant legislation and her efforts to increase Arizona's economic competitiveness."
