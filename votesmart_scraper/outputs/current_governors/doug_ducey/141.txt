Governor Doug Ducey: "I Will Not Sign Legislation That Threatens Arizona's Water Future'
Statement
By: Doug Ducey
Date: May 9, 2016
Location: Phoenix, AZ

Governor Doug Ducey today released the following statement on his veto of Senate Bill 1268 and Senate Bill 1400.
"Arizona enjoys a proud and longstanding reputation as a global leader in water management. Historically, we've planned ahead for the needs of our citizens and the future of our state but these bills undermine those efforts. While I appreciate the sponsor's efforts to protect Arizona from federal overreach, I'm concerned S.B. 1268 and S.B. 1400 would encourage a patchwork of water ordinances throughout our cities and leave our water supply securities in peril.
Ensuring the certainty and sustainability of Arizona water is a top priority. I will not sign legislation that threatens Arizona's water future.
I look forward to working with legislators to build on the success our state has experienced with the Groundwater Management Act of 1980, and the hard work of leaders from Carl Hayden, to Mo Udall and Jon Kyl, by implementing additional conservation opportunities and exploring new, sustainable water sources for our state."
