By: Doug Ducey
Date: March 31, 2015
Location: Phoenix, AZ

In keeping with his commitment to lessen regulations on Arizona businesses, Governor Doug Ducey today signed S.B. 1030, the Arizona Beer Bill, a measure to protect and grow the craft brewing industry and create jobs in Arizona.
"When it comes to business, Arizona should not be punishing success - we should be fostering and assisting in it," said Governor Doug Ducey. "This is a common-sense reform to an arbitrary and outdated law. Arizona has a booming craft beer industry and it's growing every day. I want to ensure that it continues to thrive, unimpeded by overly burdensome regulations. It's good for industry, enterprise and the economy - and it's good for Arizona."
Arizona's craft beer industry is a multi-million dollar industry supporting more than 20,000 jobs and $600 million in wages, and has contributed more than $1.2 billion to the state economy.
