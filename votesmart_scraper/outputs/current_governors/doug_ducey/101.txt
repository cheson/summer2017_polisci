It's been nearly six months since Arizona Governor Doug Ducey launched his controversial initiative that publicly shamed suspected "deadbeat parents," and the numbers are in on how it's going so far.
The Governor's Office confirmed on Wednesday detectives found their 11th suspected deadbeat mom or dad since the program started in January.
The latest delinquent parent to be found appears to be David Rojas, who reportedly owes more than $66,000 in back child support for his two children.
During his State of the State address in January, Gov. Ducey started the initiative where the Arizona Department of Economic Security tweeted out names and faces of suspected deadbeat parents with the hashtag, "#deadbeat."
Since the social media shaming campaign began, DES has posted 56 deadbeat parents online. Those include eight women and 48 men.
"If you're old enough to father a child, then you're old enough to accept financial responsibility for that child. If you don't want your embarrassing unlawful and irresponsible behavior going viral: Man up and pay up," Ducey said in January.
Ducey said he thinks public shaming is a way to help get deadbeat dads and moms to pay what they owe.
