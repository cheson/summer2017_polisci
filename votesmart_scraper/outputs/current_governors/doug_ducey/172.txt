Governor Doug Ducey today directed the Arizona Department of Economic Security to release $280,000 in additional funding for the 32 domestic violence shelters throughout the state.

"Government's No. 1 concern at all times is for the safety of our citizens -- particularly our vulnerable and victimized," said Governor Ducey. "As many of us prepare to celebrate Christmas tomorrow in the comfort and security of a loving home, we're reminded of those who, through no fault of their own, won't have that option.

"Rather than let this money sit unused in an account, we should put it to good use -- by providing additional services to victims of domestic violence who often struggle to meet basic needs as they rebuild their lives. There's no better time than the season of giving and goodwill to make this happen."

"The Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence is grateful that excess funds available for services to support victims of domestic violence through the Domestic Violence Shelter Fund are being released to the programs now," said Allie Bones, CEO of the Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence. "This will be a welcome gift for the holidays for programs that are struggling to ensure that all victims' needs are met in their communities."

The Domestic Violence Shelter Fund provides funding to 32 shelters in 13 counties in Arizona. Funds consists of monies collected from court fees, tax check-offs, and notary fees. The fund is capped at $2.2 million in spending annually but over the past several years has consistently generated more.
