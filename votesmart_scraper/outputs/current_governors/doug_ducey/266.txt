Reiterating his commitment to ensuring all Arizona children have access to an excellent education in the school of their family's choice, Governor Doug Ducey today signed S.B. 1332 - legislation that expands Arizona's Empowerment Scholarship Account (ESA) to children living on Native American reservations.

"I've been adamant in my commitment to ensuring that all Arizona students have access to the best education possible, regardless of where they live. This bipartisan legislation is a simple but significant step in the right direction," said Governor Ducey. "I want to thank our legislators, and particularly the bill's sponsor, Sen. Begay, for their commitment to empowering parents, expanding educational opportunities and improving outcomes for all."
