Press Release

The latest monthly report released this morning by the Arizona Department of Administration shows a continuing positive trend in Arizona employment, with above-average job gains for the month of December and unemployment among Arizonans falling below 6 percent -- the lowest rate for December since 2007.
"This report says a lot about the direction of our state -- and it's the latest validation that Arizona is, in fact, on the rise," said Governor Ducey. "With December job gains well above the post-recession average, and unemployment now at 5.8 percent -- nearly a percentage point down from this time last year -- one thing is clear: more Arizonans are getting back to work.
"While this is good news, we're not bringing out the punch bowl. We're going to remain steadfastly committed to creating a business-friendly environment built on low taxes, light regulation and quality workers. Our pursuit of pro-growth policies is what has driven our economic success over the past year, and it will continue to make the difference for Arizonans in the months and years ahead."
