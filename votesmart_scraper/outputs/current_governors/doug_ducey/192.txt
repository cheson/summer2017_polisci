Location: Phoenix, AZ

Hello, this is Governor Doug Ducey.
October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month.
This is a serious issue that affects 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men in Arizona.
Every Arizonan has the right to feel safe in his or her own home.
To those in abusive situations -- you are not alone. Please reach out to a loved one and ask for help, or call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.
You have my word: the state of Arizona will prosecute those who commit domestic violence with the full force of the law.
By working together, we can protect our fellow citizens and get them the support they need. Thank you.
