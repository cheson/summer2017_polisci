Taxes are job killers. Times are tough, and the last thing we should do is raise taxes on a population that is already struggling and a small business community that has been forced to cut back. Bill is 100 percent opposed to a state income tax, and as governor he will veto any attempt to enact one.
Tennessee already has the highest combined state and average local sales tax rate in the nation and Bill will not allow it to get any higher. As governor, Bill will make sure the state lives within its means. As the only candidate with executive experience in business and government, he's the best prepared to force the state to prioritize, make difficult cuts when he has to, and manage our state budget conservatively without more taxes.
