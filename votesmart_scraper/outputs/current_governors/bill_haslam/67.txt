Press Release

Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today issued the following statement on the guidance to schools released by the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education:
"The White House itself has said what they issued last week is not an enforcement action and does not make any additional requirements under the law. Congress has the authority to write the law, not the executive branch, and we disagree with the heavy-handed approach the Obama administration is taking. Decisions on sensitive issues such as these should continue to be made at the local level based on the unique needs of students, families, schools and districts while working closely with the local school board counsel, understanding that this is an emerging area of law that will ultimately be settled by the courts."
