Tennessee is now paying a price for the failure of the federal government to effectively secure our nation's borders and enforce our immigration laws.
As governor, Bill will enforce the state laws on the books and do everything within his authority to be sure that Tennessee does not attract illegal activity. At a time when more than 10 percent of our citizens can't find work, we can't tolerate employers knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. We should never provide any form of state government ID without proof of citizenship. And we should support the local law enforcement officials who are working to see that illegal immigrants are identified and deported.
