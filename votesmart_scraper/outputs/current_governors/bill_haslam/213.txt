Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam has requested assistance from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to help individuals and businesses in Metro Nashville and Davidson County and its contiguous counties recover from the severe storms and flash flooding that occurred on August 8-9, 2013.
The additional Tennessee counties that would be eligible for SBA loans are Cheatham, Robertson, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson and Wilson as damage to homes and businesses occurred in multiple locations.
A joint Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) and SBA damage survey shows more than 190 homes and 46 businesses in Davidson County sustained minor or major damages and/or loss of inventory.
"The impact on affected individuals and business is significant, and a disaster declaration from the SBA will help speed their recovery from this flood," Haslam said.
The SBA provides low interest disaster loans to homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and private, non-profit organizations to repair or replace real estate, personal property, machinery and equipment, inventory and business assets that have been damaged or destroyed in a declared disaster.
On Thursday, August 8, a severe weather front with heavy rain -- in excess of 10-inches in some locations -- moved across portions of Davidson County and Sumner and Wilson counties. First responders performed nearly 200 water rescues and high water covered numerous roadways and low-lying areas.
