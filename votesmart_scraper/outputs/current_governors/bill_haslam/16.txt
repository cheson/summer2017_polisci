Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today issued the following statement regarding the settlement reached between the Department of Justice and Volkswagen:
"Volkswagen is incredibly important to Chattanooga and the state's economy. I have spoken with Volkswagen officials several times over the last couple of days, and they have assured me that this settlement won't restrict in any way their capital expansion plans in Chattanooga. In fact, they have committed to bringing even more jobs to Chattanooga. So the future is bright for our workforce, and VW can continue doing what it does best, which is building great cars in Tennessee." - See more at: http://www.tn.gov/governor/news/47922#sthash.eeHh39UC.dpuf
