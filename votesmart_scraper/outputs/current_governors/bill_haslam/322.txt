Today we remember the innocent victims of the terrible attacks on Sept. 11 nine years ago. Crissy and my thoughts and prayers are with the families of the men and women who died that day and with those men and women who so bravely sacrificed their lives for our country. We also think of those overseas defending our country and working for peace around the world. May God continue to guide and bless America.
