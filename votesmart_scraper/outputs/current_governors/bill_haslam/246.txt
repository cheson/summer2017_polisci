Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today released a statement about the comprehensive report on the state's teacher evaluation system issued by independent non-profit State Collaborative on Reforming Education (SCORE).

In December 2011, Haslam asked SCORE to collect input and feedback on Tennessee's teacher evaluation system, a key piece of the First to the Top legislation that positioned Tennessee to be one of the first two states awarded Race to the Top funding.
"I appreciate SCORE's work in traveling the state and listening to feedback from educators on teacher evaluations," Haslam said. "We will review these recommendations along with the state Department of Education's internal review of the process, which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.

"If we want to improve education in Tennessee, that starts with an effective teacher leading each Tennessee classroom," Haslam said. "This report is part of a comprehensive review of the teacher evaluation process. We want to support and reward effective teachers and are committed to making the evaluation system as strong as it can be."
