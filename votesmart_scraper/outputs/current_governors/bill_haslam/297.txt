Governor Haslam's Statement On Storm Impact In Tennessee
Statement
By: Bill Haslam
Date: March 1, 2011
Location: Unknown

Governor Bill Haslam today expressed sympathy for the families of the four individuals that lost their lives during Monday's storms and flooding. Weather-related fatalities occurred in Franklin, Polk, Robertson, and Rutherford counties, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA).
Haslam will view damaged areas in Franklin County tomorrow afternoon. Details to come.
"The power of severe weather can't be underestimated," Haslam said. "Once the debris is cleared away, those families will still face the unimaginable loss of a loved one, and our hearts go out to them."
On Monday, local government personnel performed numerous rescues at great personal risk to themselves, while warnings from the National Weather Service made it possible for those in harm's way to seek shelter from the advancing storm.
"I want to acknowledge our first responders and the National Weather Service for their role in saving lives yesterday," Haslam said.
The TEMA and the local governments across the state are currently engaged in damage assessments of storm-damaged communities. These assessments are used to gauge whether the state will reach the qualifying thresholds for federal assistance.
Once damage assessments are compiled, Governor Haslam will be able to determine whether the situation warrants a request for federal disaster aid programs.
