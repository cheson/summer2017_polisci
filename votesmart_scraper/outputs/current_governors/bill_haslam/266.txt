By: Bill Haslam
Date: Feb. 23, 2012
Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced Phillip Robinson as judge of the Third Circuit Court for the 20th Judicial District, replacing Barbara Haynes who retired last year.
Robinson received his J.D. from the University of Tennessee College of Law and has spent the entirety of his 36-year legal career practicing in Nashville.
"Phillip has practiced law in Davidson County his entire career, and he will bring that extensive experience to the bench," Haslam said. "I appreciate his willingness to serve."
The Third Circuit Court will likely be designated a new family law court for Davidson County.
Robinson's practice originally included domestic relations cases, personal injury and criminal and probate matters, but for the last 25 years it has exclusively been domestic relations with Robinson opening his own practice with associates in 2001.
"I am honored to receive the appointment from Gov. Haslam, and I appreciate the opportunity to serve the people of Davidson County in the Third Circuit Court," Robinson said.
Robinson is a fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and is board certified as a family law trial advocate by the National Board of Trial Advocacy.
He is a hearing panel member of the Board of Professional Responsibility of the Supreme Court of Tennessee and a fellow of the Nashville Bar Association.
He has been recognized by Best Lawyers in America from 2005 to present and Mid-South Super Lawyers from 2007 to present.
Robinson, 61, lives in Nashville with his wife Christy Cason Robinson.
