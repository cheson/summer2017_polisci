Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today appointed James R. Newsom III of Memphis as Chancellor in the 30th Judicial District, which serves Shelby County.
Newsom replaces Oscar C. "Bo" Carr III, who died earlier this year.
Newsom, 61, has been a member of the Memphis law firm Harris Shelton Hanover Walsh, PLLC since 2005. He practiced with that firm's predecessor, Hanover, Walsh, Jalenak & Blair, PLLC from 1979-2004. He became a member in 1985.
Newsom was appointed special master of the Chancery Court for the 30th Judicial District in November 2010 and served in that position through January of this year.
"Tennesseans in the 30th Judicial District will be served well by this appointment," Haslam said. "Jim Newsom has a strong commitment to justice and an excellent record of work in Shelby County. We appreciate his willingness to serve in this capacity."
"I want to thank Governor Haslam for his appointment," Newsom said. "I am humbled that I was his choice for this important position. I look forward to taking on its challenges. I hope to justify the Governor's confidence by serving the people of Shelby County well as their new Chancellor."
Newsom, who grew up in Memphis, received his law degree from Vanderbilt Law School in Nashville in 1979 after receiving his bachelor's degree from Rhodes College in Memphis in 1976. Newsom and his wife, Debra, have three grown children, Jonathan, Christopher and Katherine, and two grandchildren. Jim and Debra have been married 33 years.
Newsom has been actively involved in the Riveroaks Reformed Presbyterian Church, where he is an elder and trustee. He is a member of the Downtown Memphis Kiwanis Club and an Eagle Scout through the Boy Scouts of America.
