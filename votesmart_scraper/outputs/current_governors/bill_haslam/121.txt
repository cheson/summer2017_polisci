Haslam Announces Grant for TCAT Memphis
Press Release
By: Bill Haslam
Date: June 29, 2015
Location: Memphis, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced a $500,000 grant to start Information Technology and Advanced Manufacturing programs at an off-campus site in the TCAT Memphis service area and meet workforce needs in the region, as the state continues its Drive to 55.
The funds will assist TCAT Memphis in providing quality training to prepare Tennesseans to meet local workforce needs for careers that are high tech, high skills, high wage and high demand. The new equipment will provide students with hands-on technical training, similar to what is being used in the industry.
Haslam included in his FY 2015-2016 budget amendment and the General Assembly approved $5 million to fund new equipment at TCATs to meet job training demands across Tennessee. This month Haslam is announcing targeted investments in high demand programs at TCATs.
"Our TCATs have a great track record of success, and as a state we want to allocate resources strategically, where those funds can be most effective," Haslam said. "The state's ability to attract and retain business is tied directly to the quality of our workforce, and across our 27 technical colleges, students are gaining the necessary skills to succeed and go on to higher paying jobs and better lives."
Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology have an 80 percent graduation rate and an 85 percent job placement rate across the system.
By 2025, 55 percent of the jobs available in Tennessee will require a post-secondary credential, and currently only 33 percent of Tennesseans qualify. The governor launched his Drive to 55 two years ago to increase the number of Tennesseans with a post-secondary degree or certificate.
