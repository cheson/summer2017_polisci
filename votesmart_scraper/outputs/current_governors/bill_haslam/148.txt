Haslam Introduces Legislation Tied To Budget Proposal
Press Release
By: Bill Haslam
Date: Feb. 10, 2015
Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today filed legislation that is reflected in his
FY 2015-16 budget proposal. The bills are a result of the governor's continued focus on more Tennesseans earning a post-secondary credential, supporting teachers across the state and building a more customer-focused, efficient and effective state government.

"These legislative proposals build on the Drive to 55, our effort to raise the percentage of Tennesseans with a degree or certificate beyond high school from 32 to 55 by the year 2025. We know that just reaching high school graduates won't be enough to reach our goal, so we're specifically looking to get adults with some college credit to go back and earn their degree," Haslam said.

"Along with including $100 million in the budget for teacher salaries, the proposals are also aimed at supporting educators in meaningful ways, and we are always looking for ways to recruit, reward and retain the best and brightest to serve in state government."
