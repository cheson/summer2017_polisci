Haslam Takes Budget Hearings on the Road
Press Release
By: Bill Haslam
Date: Oct. 26, 2011
Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced that portions of the Fiscal Year 2012-2013 budget hearings will take place outside of Nashville so that citizens in East and West Tennessee have an opportunity to attend. Hearings will be held in Knoxville and Memphis, which will mark the first time in state history that budget proceedings will occur away from the State Capitol.
Scheduled to begin on November 2, the budget hearings will be streamed live on www.tn.gov as in years past to give Tennesseans that are unable to attend accessibility to the budget discussions of each state agency.
"This is an opportunity for Tennesseans to learn more about the state budget and our agencies," Haslam said. "It is important to engage our citizens in the process of setting priorities and planning for the future. We will continue to approach the budget in a fiscally disciplined way to do more with less while focusing on quality customer service for Tennessee taxpayers."
