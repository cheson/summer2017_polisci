Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today thanked members of the 109th General Assembly for their work this session and partnership in passing a balanced budget and legislation to continue the state's focus on education.
"For Tennesseans who don't follow news out of the State Capitol every day, I think you can take away two main things from this session: education and fiscal strength. We're making the largest investment in K-12 without a tax increase in Tennessee's history and reorganizing our higher ed structure in Tennessee in the best way to increase student success and the number of Tennesseans with a degree or certificate," Haslam said.
"As I spend time with other governors I'm reminded how fortunate we are as a state to be passing a balanced budget this early in the year, to be taking on no new debt, to have no transportation debt, to be in a position to fund priorities and add to our savings account to prepare for uncertain times down the road," he added.
