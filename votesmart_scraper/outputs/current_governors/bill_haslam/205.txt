Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Department of Environment and Conservation Commissioner Bob Martineau today announced a third offering of the Clean Tennessee Energy Grants, totaling $1.9 million, to fund energy efficiency projects for municipal governments, county governments, utility districts and other similar entities across Tennessee.
"Increasing Tennessee's energy efficiency will help us be even better stewards of both taxpayer dollars and our environment," Haslam said. "The projects we've been in a position to fund have benefited Tennesseans on both fronts, and I'm proud to work with local governments and districts to achieve these results."
Funding for the projects comes from an April 2011 Clean Air Act settlement with the Tennessee Valley Authority.
The Clean Tennessee Energy Grant Program provides financial assistance to these public entities to purchase, install and construct energy projects. Eligible categories of the Clean Tennessee Energy Grant Program include:
Cleaner Alternative Energy -- biomass, geothermal, solar, wind
Energy Conservation -- lighting, HVAC improvements, improved fuel efficiency, insulation, idling minimization
Air Quality Improvement -- reduction in greenhouse gases, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, hazardous air pollutants
"We are pleased to announce this third round of Clean Tennessee Energy Grants and look forward to receiving an equally impressive array of projects as we did this past year," Martineau said. "These grants provide an outstanding opportunity to promote environmental stewardship and energy efficiency across the state, while decreasing emissions and reducing expenses at the local level."
