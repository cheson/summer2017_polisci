Haslam Issues Statement on Federal Court's Health Care Ruling
Statement
By: Bill Haslam

Location: Nashville, TN

Governor Bill Haslam issued the following statement today after U.S. District Court Judge Roger Vinson ruled the entirety of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act unconstitutional:

"Today's ruling was a crucial step in our fight against President Obama's unaffordable healthcare mandate. I declared this law an 'intolerable expansion of federal power' when the bill was passed by Congress last March, and Judge Vinson's ruling is yet another confirmation that the federal government significantly overstepped its authority.
"Our goal should be advocating for an approach that embraces healthy choices and personal responsibility and accountability for a healthy lifestyle. As governor, I am committed to controlling costs and improving Tennessee's health status. Forcing mandates on states and individuals is entirely the wrong approach.

"We need to encourage our national leaders to use appropriate insights into the health care system to bring about real reform."
