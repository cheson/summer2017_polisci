Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today appointed Roger Amos Page of Madison County to the Tennessee Supreme Court, replacing Justice Gary R. Wade, who retired in September.
Page, 60, has been a judge on the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals since his appointment by Haslam in December 2011, writing more than 330 appellate opinions. He previously served as a circuit court judge for the 26th Judicial District, which includes Chester, Henderson and Madison counties. In that position, he presided over more than 300 civil and criminal jury trials.
"We are fortunate to have someone with such a depth of experience for this important position," Haslam said. "Judge Page has a distinguished career both as a judge and an attorney, and Tennesseans will benefit from having him on the Supreme Court."
