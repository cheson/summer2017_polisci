Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced the next phase of his administration's multi-year, comprehensive action plan to help make Tennessee safer.
According to the latest data from Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, the overall crime rate has decreased 14.8 percent since 2010.
"Our overall crime rate is going down, but there is still much to do," Haslam said. "Keeping Tennesseans safe is one of state government's primary responsibilities. Safer communities are a significant part of making Tennessee the best place to live, work and raise a family, and this next phase of our public safety action plan will build on the progress we've made and take on the challenges we still face."
