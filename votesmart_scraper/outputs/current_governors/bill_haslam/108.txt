Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) Commissioner John Schroer sat down with local and state officials in Greeneville today to discuss the region's transportation and infrastructure needs.
In a meeting this afternoon at the Greene County Partnership, Haslam and Schroer discussed the functionality and capacity of Tennessee's state roads and highways, safety issues around roads and bridges, and the impact infrastructure has on economic development efforts in urban and rural communities.
Tennessee's transportation system includes 95,000 miles of roads, 1,100 miles of interstates, 19,000 bridges, 28 transit systems in 95 counties, 79 general aviation airports, 949 miles of waterways and more than 3,000 miles of railroads.
"The quality of Tennessee's transportation and infrastructure system always ranks at or near the top when compared to the rest of the country," Haslam said. "We have no transportation debt, and we do a great job maintaining our roads, but we know we have challenges on the horizon. We know that we can't depend on the federal government to be the funding partner that it once was. We also know that as our infrastructure ages, maintenance becomes more important and more expensive. And we know that maintaining our roads is only part of the equation. Right now we have a multi-billion dollar backlog of highway projects across this state that address key access, safety and economic development issues, and that's only going to grow."
