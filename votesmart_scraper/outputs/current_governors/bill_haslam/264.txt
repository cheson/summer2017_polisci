Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today joined the State Collaborative on Reforming Education (SCORE) in calling for state leaders to continue to focus on education reform as changes to Tennessee's education system are implemented statewide in response to SCORE's release of its third annual "State of Education" report.
The report outlines four priorities for the coming year that SCORE identifies as crucial to Tennessee being the fastest improving state in the nation, including sustaining policy leadership in the effort and strengthening the principal and administrator pipeline.

"Tennessee continues to have the eyes of the nation on us because of the progress we're making in education reform," Haslam said. "Change isn't typically easy, but it is important to carry through on the reforms Gov. Bredesen and the General Assembly began and then continue to build upon that momentum moving forward.

"I appreciate the role that SCORE is playing in improving education in Tennessee as a thoughtful, independent force that brings people together from across the state to focus on achieving real results."

SCORE is a non-profit and non-partisan advocacy and research organization that was founded by former U.S. Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) in 2009.
