Tennessee is the "2013 State of the Year," according to Business Facilities magazine, a national economic development publication.
Tennessee's top five economic development projects created a total of 6,900 jobs, $3.2 billion in capital investment and included seven expansions and three new recruitments. The magazine picked the state after evaluating the top five projects for the number of jobs created and amount of capital invested from October 1, 2012 through October 31, 2013.
"A lot of hard work goes into keeping Tennessee competitive, and I want to thank Business Facilities for recognizing the efforts of so many people across the state," Gov. Bill Haslam said. "We understand that jobs are created when someone is willing to risk capital, and we will continue working to make Tennessee a great place to invest."
"Over the past year, Tennessee has experienced unprecedented momentum," ECD Commissioner Bill Hagerty said. "The global companies that invested capital in our state and the number of jobs created demonstrate to the world that Tennessee not only provides a top-notch business environment, but also the ongoing support needed for success. I am extremely pleased by this award and look forward to another successful year."
"Tennessee continues to impress us with its aggressive execution of a diversified growth strategy," Business Facilities Editor in Chief Jack Rogers said. "The state has put in place a solid foundation for robust job creation for years to come."
