Press Release

Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced that for the second consecutive year nearly 60,000 high school seniors have applied for the Tennessee Promise, Tennessee's groundbreaking scholarship and mentorship program that provides high school graduates last-dollar scholarships to attend two years of community or technical college free of tuition and fees.
"We're excited to see even bigger application numbers this year. This is changing the culture of expectations in Tennessee, and one of the significant things about these numbers is it means that in the last two years more than 117,000 Tennessee students have had a purposeful conversation about going to college," Haslam said.
Seniors that applied for the Tennessee Promise will now be required to participate in two mandatory meetings, submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and complete eight hours of community service.
"We know that access to college is important, but even more important is success. The process of applying and attending college can seem daunting, especially for first generation college students, and having a caring adult to help guide you can make a big difference," Haslam said.
