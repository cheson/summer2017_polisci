Location: Lewisburg, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Tennessee Department of Transportation Commissioner John Schroer announced today the award of a $701,138 transportation alternative grant to provide a pedestrian and bicycle facility connecting Lewisburg Square with Rock Creek Park.
The Downtown Connector Project, which will be constructed in four phases, includes parking, sidewalks, and a multiuse path, eventually connecting to the existing Rock Creek Park greenway path. The grant funds Phase I of the project.
"This project will improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists as well as provide residents and visitors with critical connections to different areas of the city," Haslam said. "Tennessee's downtowns are the heart of our communities, and projects like this enhance the lives of Tennesseans and make our communities more livable."
The transportation alternative grant is made possible through a federally funded program formerly known as transportation enhancement, and is administered by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT).
"Through these grants, TDOT has funded more than $318 million in non-traditional transportation projects," Schroer said. "This program has assisted communities all over the state in their efforts to revitalize downtowns, highlight historic areas, provide alternative means of transportation, and increase opportunities for economic development."
A variety of activities, such as the restoration of historic facilities, bike and pedestrian trails, landscaping and other non-traditional transportation projects, are eligible for grant funds under the federal program.
