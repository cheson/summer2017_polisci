Haslam Announces FOCUS Act Transition Task Force
Statement
By: Bill Haslam
Date: Dec. 7, 2015
Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced the members of the transition task force to offer guidance on the proposed Focus On College and University Success (FOCUS) Act during the legislative process and potential implementation if approved by the General Assembly.
Comprised of higher education leaders and professionals, the transition task force will have two components: a steering committee to provide high level implementation guidance to the governor and a working group that will offer technical assistance and report back to the steering committee.
"The Drive to 55 is changing the landscape for Tennessee students and public higher education in our state," Haslam said. "The conversation has brought us to this point: making sure our colleges and universities are aligned in support of student success, and I want to thank these leaders and professionals from Tennessee higher education for helping work through the details of this proposal."
