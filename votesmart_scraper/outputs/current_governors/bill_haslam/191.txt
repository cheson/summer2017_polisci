Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam joined Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (TDMHSAS) Commissioner E. Douglas Varney and others today to announce "Prescription for Success," the state's plan to prevent and treat prescription drug abuse in Tennessee.
Prescription drug abuse is a pervasive, multi-dimensional issue impacting Tennessee individuals, families, and communities. Of the 4,850,000 adults in Tennessee, it is estimated that nearly 5 percent (about 221,000) have used pain relievers, also known as prescription opioids, in the past year for non-medical purposes. Of those, it is estimated that 69,100 are addicted to prescription opioids and require treatment for prescription opioid abuse.
"Tennessee has a serious problem with prescription drug abuse, and this widespread and complex issue demands coordinated solutions," Haslam said. ""Prescription for Success' is a comprehensive, multi-year strategic plan that will involve different agencies across state government to reduce the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs so Tennesseans can live happy, healthy and fulfilling lives."
A number of strategies have been developed to meet the following seven goals of the "Prescription for Success" plan to fight this epidemic:
Decrease the number of Tennesseans that abuse controlled substances.
Decrease the number of Tennesseans who overdose on controlled substances.
Decrease the amount of controlled substances dispensed in Tennessee.
