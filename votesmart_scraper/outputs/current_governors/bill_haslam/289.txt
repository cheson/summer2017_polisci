Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Economic and Community Development Commissioner (ECD) Bill Hagerty today announced the Jobs4TN plan, which lays out the administration's economic development strategy resulting from a top-to-bottom review of the department. The governor's Jobs4TN plan focuses on:
* Prioritizing the strategic recruitment of target industries;
* Assisting existing Tennessee businesses in expansions and remaining competitive;
* Supporting regional and rural economic development strategies;
* As well as investing in innovation and reducing business regulation.
"My top priority is for Tennessee to be the No. 1 location in the Southeast for high-quality jobs," Haslam said. "Our Jobs4TN plan is a blueprint for doing just that. By leveraging our existing assets in each region, we will be able to attract new businesses to the state while helping our existing businesses expand and remain competitive. We will also be making significant investments in innovation to position Tennessee as a national leader well into the future."
The governor's Jobs4TN plan was developed over a 45-day period and involved interviews with more than 300 stakeholders, community leaders, and national experts as well as through seven roundtables across the state. The plan includes four key strategies:
Prioritizing target clusters and existing industries: Tennessee will focus its recruitment efforts on six target clusters in which the state has a clear competitive advantage: automotive; chemicals and plastics; transportation, logistics and distribution services; business services; healthcare; advanced manufacturing and energy technologies.
