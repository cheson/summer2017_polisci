Governor Haslam's Goal: To be the fastest improving state in the country.
Today's economy requires workers to have more education and training than ever. Governor Haslam is working to improve the state's education system in order to help develop a skilled and knowledgeable workforce prepared to succeed in a 21st century economy. The administration is focused on ensuring the state's K-12 education system is led by great principals and highly effective teachers. Governor Haslam believes in empowering parents by expanding school choice and has launched the "Drive to 55" initiative to shrink the gap between what our higher education system produces and actual workforce demand. Ultimately, Governor Haslam believes one of the most important things we can do to improve the overall quality of life for Tennesseans is to work together as a state to improve student outcomes and increase education. - See more at: https://www.tn.gov/transparenttn/section/education-workforce-development#sthash.ALx1ltxo.dpuf
