Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Economic and Community Development Commissioner Randy Boyd along with Magneti Marelli officials announced today that the company will expand its Automotive Lighting Division in Pulaski, Tennessee and create 450 new jobs. The expansion will add 80,000 square feet to Magneti Marelli's manufacturing facility located at 181 Bennett Drive and will supply head lamps to FCA, Mercedes, GM, Volkswagen and Honda vehicles.
"We want to thank Magneti Marelli for today's announcement of 450 new jobs and for further investing in Giles County," Haslam said. "With more than 900 auto suppliers and manufacturers in Tennessee, our state's reputation, strength and momentum in the auto industry continue to grow, helping us toward our goal of becoming the No.1 state in the Southeast for high quality jobs."
"Congratulations to Magneti Marelli on this latest expansion in Tennessee. I'm thankful for the new jobs being created and the confidence it shows in our workforce," Boyd said. "We are working hard to align our business recruitment efforts with education to ensure companies like Magneti Marelli have a skilled pipeline of well-trained employees."
Employing more than 950 people in Tennessee, two Magneti Marelli business areas are located in Giles County -- the Shock Absorbers Division, which designs and manufactures suspension modules and components, and the Automotive Lighting Division, which currently produces headlamps for FCA and Mercedes.
Magneti Marelli announced the addition of its Pulaski lighting manufacturing in June 2012, with production officially beginning a year later. The Automotive Lighting Manufacturing facility is the company's first in the U.S. and third in North America.
