Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced the next step in the Drive to 55: ensuring that colleges and universities are organized, supported and empowered in efforts to increase the number of Tennesseans with a postsecondary credential to 55 percent by 2025.
To enhance student success across higher education the plan includes key strategies to provide more focused support for community and technical colleges, increase autonomy and local control for Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) universities and strengthen the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC).
"Since the launch of the Drive to 55 we have made tremendous progress, becoming No. 1 in the nation for federal student aid completion and increasing the size of our freshman class by 10 percent in one year," Haslam said. "Tennessee is at the forefront of innovation in public higher education, and the conversation has brought us to this point -- making sure Tennessee colleges and universities are organized, supported and empowered to meet the demands of Drive to 55."
"Tennessee's future in economic development will depend on us having a workforce that is ready for high skill, high wage jobs, and as part of that effort we have to make sure our colleges and universities are strategically aligned in supporting student success," Haslam said. "The FOCUS Act will put us on that path."
