Tennessee Students Still The Fastest Improving in U.S. Since 2011
Statement
By: Bill Haslam
Date: Oct. 28, 2015
Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced Tennessee students are still the fastest improving in the nation since 2011 according to the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), commonly known as the Nation's Report Card.
Tennessee also rose to the top half of states in fourth grade math, ranking 25th -- the first time Tennessee has ever ranked in the top half of states in any subject or grade.
"Tennessee is distinguishing itself as the state to watch in education, and today's announcement is a testament to all of the hard work put in day to day by our educators and students," Haslam said. "There is no doubt that we're asking more of teachers and students than ever before, and they are delivering. Four years ago we committed to becoming the fastest improving state in the nation in academic growth. Students showed incredible progress in 2013, and this year a new set of fourth and eighth graders proved the gains our students have made are real."
