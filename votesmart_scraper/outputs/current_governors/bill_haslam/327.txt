Bill knows safe neighborhoods and communities are the key to a healthy, vibrant society. As Mayor, Bill works with local law enforcement officials to keep the streets of Knoxville safe, and through this experience he understands the need for unique local solutions. As governor, he will work with sheriffs and other local law enforcement officials to combat crime and improve public safety.
If we want to reduce crime in Tennessee, we have to make it a priority. As governor, Bill will make our safety a priority and will focus on both short-term and long-term solutions for crime prevention and reduction. First, he will push for tougher state sentencing laws that will keep violent offenders locked up and off our streets. Then Bill will use his management experience to improve the efficiency of our corrections system. We must keep Tennesseans safe while minimizing the costs to taxpayers. Prisoners don't need the luxuries of a nice hotel.
In the long-term, Bill will improve our education system, enhance the state's workforce development efforts, and create more and better job opportunities for Tennesseans. An education and a good job are the keys to making sure our young people go on to lead healthy, productive lives.
As governor, Bill will also address issues of public safety by working to restore professionalism to the Tennessee Highway Patrol and by improving the efficiency of the Tennessee Department of Motor Vehicles.
