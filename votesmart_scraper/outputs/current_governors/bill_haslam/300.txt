Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam today announced he signed Senate Bill 25 / House Bill 51 regarding school consolidation in Memphis and Shelby County. He offered the following comment:
"The bill addresses two of my biggest concerns. It allows an orderly planning process for transition, while leaving the local vote in place for March 8.
"My primary concern, however, has always been that we focus our discussions on what is best for the 150,000 students in Memphis and Shelby County. I think the situation, if we will handle it in a thoughtful manner, can be an opportunity for all of us to have a discussion about how we keep moving forward with public education in Memphis and Shelby County."
