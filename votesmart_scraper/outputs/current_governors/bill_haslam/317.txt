I applaud GM for choosing to expand their production in Spring Hill and create nearly 500 new jobs. To have those jobs come online will be a major boost for the Spring Hill community, and if elected, I look forward to working with GM and second- and third-tier suppliers to use the Spring Hill plant as a regional asset to leverage for job growth. If our goal is to make Tennessee the No. 1 location in the Southeast for high quality jobs, announcements such as today's are very encouraging and great step toward that end goal.
