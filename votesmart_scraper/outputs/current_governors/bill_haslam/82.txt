Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced 81 percent of the 2015-16 class of Tennessee Promise students returned for the spring semester after beginning classes last fall.
This high retention rate for Tennessee Promise students is a significant indicator they are on pathways to success in higher education.
"When we launched Tennessee Promise, our goal was not only to get more students to enroll in a technical or community college but also to see the students succeed and graduate," Haslam said. "Students must receive post-secondary credentials if we're going to achieve the goal of Drive to 55, and we will continue to work with our campus leaders to ensure these students have the highest possible chances of attaining their certificate or degree."
In fall 2015 there was a 24.7 percent enrollment increase at community colleges and a 20 percent enrollment increase at colleges of applied technology (TCATs).
Data provided by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission indicates that Tennessee Promise students enrolled at a TCAT had a retention rate of almost 95 percent while community college students were retained at a rate of 78.5 percent. The community college data also includes Austin Peay State University, the single public university with associate degree students.
