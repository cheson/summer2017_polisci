Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Economic and Community Development Commissioner Randy Boyd along with Eurotranciatura USA officials today announced the manufacturer is investing $12.6 million to expand its operations in Paris over the next five years.
Eurotranciatura, a subsidiary of the world's largest steel lamination company for electrical rotating machines, will create more than 170 new jobs as part of the expansion.
Eurotranciatura's investment includes upgrades and new equipment for its existing manufacturing plant in Henry County. Eurotranciatura will also build a roughly 30,000 square foot distribution warehouse near its current plant to accommodate growth and reduce transportation costs.
"Advanced manufacturing runs deep in Tennessee. Time and time again, when manufacturers choose to locate in our state, Tennesseans are up to the task," Haslam said. "Tennessee's highly-skilled workforce and dedication to innovation continue to attract leading manufacturers like Eurotranciatura. We thank them for choosing to expand in Paris and their commitment to create more than 170 new jobs for Henry County. This expansion pushes us closer to our goal of being the No. 1 location in the Southeast for high quality jobs."
"Team Tennessee believes in the power of manufacturing, a sector that employs more than 332,000 Tennesseans and one that is continually evolving," Boyd said "Eurotranciatura is a global leader in that evolution and is constantly bringing new technologies to the table. We're excited Eurotranciatura is doing so right here in Paris and expanding operations in a major way. We welcome this new investment and Eurotranciatura's commitment to bring meaningful, highly-skilled jobs that will have a lasting impact on Henry County residents."
