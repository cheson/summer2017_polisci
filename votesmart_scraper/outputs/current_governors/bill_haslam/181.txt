Press Release
By: Bill Haslam
Date: July 23, 2014
Location: Brownsville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) Commissioner John Schroer today announced a $715,844 transportation alternative grant to the city of Brownsville to fund Phase II of the Downtown Enhancements Project.
The project is located along Main Street from South Bradford Avenue to North Park Avenue and will include the removal and replacement of 1,800 linear feet of sidewalk, the relocation of utilities and new landscaping. The improvements will greatly improve pedestrian safety and mobility, and create a gateway into Brownsville.
"This project will enhance the character of downtown Brownsville and create a more pedestrian friendly environment," Haslam said. "Tennessee's downtowns are the heart of our communities, and improvements like these improve our cities and towns and the quality of life for residents."
"Through these grants, TDOT has funded more than $306 million in non-traditional transportation projects," Schroer said. "This program has assisted communities all over the state in their efforts to revitalize downtowns, highlight historic areas, provide alternative means of transportation, and increase opportunities for economic development."
The transportation alternative grant is made possible through a federally funded program formerly known as transportation enhancement and is administered by TDOT. A variety of activities, such as the restoration of historic facilities, bike and pedestrian trails, landscaping and other non-traditional transportation projects, are eligible for grant funds under the federal program.
Sen. Dolores Gresham (R-Somerville) and Rep. Craig Fitzhugh (D-Ripley) represent Haywood County in the Tennessee General Assembly.
