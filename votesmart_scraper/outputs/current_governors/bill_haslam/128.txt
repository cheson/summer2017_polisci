Location: Lewisburg, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Tennessee Department of Transportation Commissioner John Schroer announced today the award of a $597,678 transportation alternative grant that includes the replacement of 4,500 feet of existing sidewalks, accessibility improvements and crosswalks along streets surrounding the Public Square in Shelbyville.
Phase III of the Shelbyville Sidewalk Improvement Project will improve pedestrian access in downtown Shelbyville by providing safe and continuous routes between local destinations. The project is part of an overall plan to revitalize the downtown district.
"This project will help Shelbyville's efforts to improve its downtown and strengthen the heart of the community," Haslam said. "When complete, the project will make downtown areas more accessible to residents, businesses and visitors and will continue to have positive impacts on the local economy."
The transportation alternative grant is made possible through a federally funded program formerly known as transportation enhancement, and is administered by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT).
"Through these grants, TDOT has funded more than $318 million in non-traditional transportation projects," Schroer said. "This program has assisted communities all over the state in their efforts to revitalize downtowns, highlight historic areas, provide alternative means of transportation, and increase opportunities for economic development."
A variety of activities, such as the restoration of historic facilities, bike and pedestrian trails, landscaping and other non-traditional transportation projects, are eligible for grant funds under the federal program.
