Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced "Tennessee Reconnect + Complete," a Drive to 55 initiative focused on encouraging Tennessee adults with some college credit to return to college and complete their degree.
According to the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), approximately 940,000 Tennessee adults have enrolled in a postsecondary institution in the state and achieved some college credit but left before obtaining a degree or credential. Of those, nearly 110,000 Tennesseans have earned more than half the credit hours toward a degree during the past nine years, with 25,000 likely to have enough credits to graduate in only one additional semester.
"Between working full time, taking care of kids and paying the bills, going back to college can often seem like an unrealistic option for many Tennessee adults," Haslam said. "We've challenged our universities, community and technical colleges to work even harder at finding new ways to assist busy adults, particularly those who left before graduating, to come back to school and achieve their dreams of getting a college degree or certificate.
"Data shows us that when adult students re-enter higher education they do very well, so it's crucial that we find a way to help more of them succeed. It's not only important to them but also to our employers and to our state."
