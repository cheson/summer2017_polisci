Haslam Highlights Transportation Projects Across State
Statement
By: Bill Haslam
Date: Nov. 9, 2015
Location: Alcoa, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam traveled across the state today highlighting transportation projects in Alcoa, Kingsport, Chattanooga, Memphis and Lebanon that illustrate the challenges facing Tennessee's infrastructure system.
Joined by Department of Transportation (TDOT) Commissioner John Schroer, Haslam also released two transportation projects lists: a list of 181 backlogged projects that will not be completed or at least under contract until 2034; and a list of 765 new project needs that cannot be considered until 2022 at the earliest, if ever.
"Today is about starting a thoughtful discussion on what Tennesseans want from their transportation system today and for their children and grandchildren. Transportation affects every Tennessean. From the business moving product to the parents trying to make it home before their kids go to bed, everyone has a stake in this discussion," Haslam said. "The last time Tennessee passed a roads plan was 1986, so if history is any indication, it could be another 30 years before the state has another plan.
"Tennessee has a debt-free system that is the third highest ranked in the country and spends the third least per capita," he added. "But looking ahead five years, there are very real challenges that will affect the conditions of our roads and bridges, our ability to recruit the jobs we want in Tennessee, and our quality of life."
