Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam announced today the 11 colleges and universities selected to receive the Veteran Reconnect Grant, a competitive grant focused on improving the success of student veterans enrolled in Tennessee colleges and universities.
"From 2008 to 2013, we saw a 200 percent increase in the number of veterans enrolling in our Tennessee colleges and universities," Haslam said. "Our Veterans Education Task Force has been working to address the unique needs that our service men and women have when they come home and go back to school, and these competitive grants will help 2-year and 4-year schools develop initiatives specifically designed for veterans to be successful in earning a degree or certificate." - See more at: http://www.tn.gov/governor/news/16795#sthash.R7aBBg1T.dpuf
