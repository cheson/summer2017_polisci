Bill has a great appreciation for Tennessee's agricultural industry and its importance to our state's economy, culture, and tradition. Bill has met with farmers and agribusiness leaders all across the state, and as governor he will make sure their concerns are heard and addressed.
Earlier this year Bill announced that as governor he will create the first-ever Director of Small Towns & Rural Development within the state Department of Economic and Community Development. This leadership position will focus solely on small towns, agriculture, and rural development issues and will provide farmers and rural small business owners with a direct line to the governor's office and the commissioner of Economic and Community Development.
Establishing a Director of Small Towns & Rural Development will help ensure rural communities have their own unique strategies for economic development. An important part of economic development in rural areas is conservation, which plays a key role in supporting the tourism industry and protecting certain areas for hunting and fishing.
As governor, Bill will work with his Director of Small Towns & Rural Development to ensure state agencies are being helpful and not a hindrance to agriculture and rural economic development and that every small town has a resource at the state level to aid in developing individualized strategies for economic growth.
