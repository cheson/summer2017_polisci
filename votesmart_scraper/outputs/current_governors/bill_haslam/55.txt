Governor Greg Abbott today released a statement following the Supreme Court's executive amnesty ruling.
"The action taken by the President was an unauthorized abuse of presidential power that trampled the Constitution, and the Supreme Court rightly denied the President the ability to grant amnesty contrary to immigration laws," said Governor Abbott. "As the President himself said, he is not a king who can unilaterally change and write immigration laws. Today's ruling is also a victory for all law-abiding Americans--including the millions of immigrants who came to America following the rule of law."
