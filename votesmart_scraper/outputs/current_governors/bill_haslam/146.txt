Press Release

Date: Feb. 26, 2015
Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the apprehension, arrest and conviction of the person or persons who committed, attempted to commit or conspired to commit the murders of Sean and Donnie Goetcheus in Chattanooga in 1997.

"I encourage anyone with information regarding this case to contact authorities immediately so that justice can be brought to those responsible for this crime," Haslam said.

In January 1997, brothers Sean and Donnie Goetcheus were shot and killed execution-style in their Chattanooga home. Sean was 25, Donnie 19.

Since almost 18 years has lapsed, their deaths are considered cold case homicides. However, over the last two years a renewed investigative effort and creation of the district attorney's office cold case unit have uncovered and developed new leads and facts. Significant progress has been achieved toward identifying the person or persons responsible for these murders.

Anyone with information about the Goetcheus case is asked to contact the district attorney's office cold case unit at 423-209-7470 or at coldcases@hcdatn.org. Neal Pinkston is the District Attorney General for the 11th Judicial District. His office number is 423-209-7448.
