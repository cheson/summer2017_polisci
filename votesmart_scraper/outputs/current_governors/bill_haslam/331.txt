A man of deep faith, Bill Haslam understands that protecting our conservative values comes first. He respects the Bible's admonition against losing our moral compass: "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
Bill is a life-long conservative who is pro-life, in favor of traditional marriage, and a strong supporter of an individual's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. As governor, Bill will work tirelessly to uphold these values. Bill strongly supports Senate Joint Resolution 127, which will help us create stronger protections for the rights of the unborn in our state's constitution.
Bill and his wife Crissy, of Memphis, were college sweethearts -- they met on the first day of college classes and were married a year after they graduated. Twenty-nine years later they've raised three children and are more in love than ever. Bill and Crissy have two daughters, Annie and Leigh, and a son, Will, who resides in Knoxville with his wife, Hannah. For 27 years, Bill and Crissy have been members of Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church and for 21 of those years Bill has served as an Elder. As governor, Bill will work to protect our values and ensure that Tennessee remains one of the best states in the country to raise a family.
