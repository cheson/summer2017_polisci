Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today appointed Valerie L. Smith as circuit court judge for the 30th Judicial District, which serves Shelby County.

Smith was a clerk for Shelby County Circuit Court Judge James F. Russell from 1999-2000.
"We're fortunate to have someone with Valerie Smith's experience to bring to the bench in the 30th District," Haslam said. "Her service in the Shelby County District Attorney General's office and her years of work in private practice have prepared her to serve the people of the 30th Judicial District well."
"I am deeply humbled and thank Governor Haslam for this appointment," Smith said. "I am honored and grateful for this opportunity to serve the citizens of Shelby County as a circuit court judge."
Smith received her law degree from the University of Memphis in 2000 after receiving a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Memphis in 1997.
She has been involved in numerous community activities, including membership in the Junior League of Memphis since 2002 and the Mid-Town Memphis Rotary Club since 2011. Smith served as a board member for Mid-South Spay Neuter Services from 2012-2015 and for the Rotary Club from 2012-2014.
