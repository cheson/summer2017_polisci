Press Release
By: Bill Haslam
Date: June 19, 2015
Location: Rockwood, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Tennessee Department of Transportation Commissioner John Schroer announced today the award of a $437,122 transportation alternative grant to the city of Rockwood for the Greenway and Trailhead Project.
The project includes a 10-foot-wide multiuse greenway beginning at Dr. Tom Fuller Park and parallel Pumphouse Road to East Nelson Street, and will terminate at the intersection of East Nelson Street and US 27. A 600-square-foot trailhead/comfort station will also be constructed at Dr. Tom Fuller Park. The trailhead will include bathroom facilities, bike racks, and a small parking lot. Signage will be added in the area to direct visitors to the trailhead.
"When we make our cities and towns more pedestrian friendly and improve recreation areas we strengthen communities," Haslam said. "We want Tennessee to continue to be the very best place to live, work and raise a family, and projects like these are key to making that a reality."
The transportation alternative grant is made possible through a federally funded program formerly known as transportation enhancement, and is administered by the Tennessee Department of Transportation.
"Through these grants, TDOT has funded more than $318 million in non-traditional transportation projects," Schroer said. "This program has assisted communities all over the state in their efforts to revitalize downtowns, highlight historic areas, provide alternative means of transportation, and increase opportunities for economic development."
A variety of activities, such as the restoration of historic facilities, bike and pedestrian trails, landscaping and other non-traditional transportation projects, are eligible for grant funds under the federal program.
