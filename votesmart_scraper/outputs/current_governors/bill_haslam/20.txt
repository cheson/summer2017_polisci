Governor Haslam's Goal: To promote healthy behavior and provide high quality services to our most vulnerable populations.
Governor Haslam believes individuals must take ownership of their health, and we are working to promote healthy decisions and responsible behavior. The state also plays a role in dealing with public health challenges as well as serving some of our most vulnerable populations, including children in state custody, low income individuals and families receiving Medicaid benefits or obtaining services through our health clinics, and the intellectually disabled. Governor Haslam is working hard to make sure we are providing high quality and cost effective services to these populations. - See more at: https://www.tn.gov/transparenttn/section/health-welfare#sthash.hjNJtWnm.dpuf
