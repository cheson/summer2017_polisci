Statement

Location: Nashville, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today convened the Drive to 55 Summit for a discussion on progress made and challenges the state faces in reaching the goal of 55 percent of Tennesseans having a postsecondary degree or certificate.
"The Drive to 55 has changed how Tennesseans think about their future, but while progress has been made to improve access, there is still work to do to help ensure students receive their degree or credential," Haslam said.
"To reach 55 percent by 2025, we have to be engaged at all levels of higher education and across all sectors: public and private, making it a statewide priority for everyone," Haslam added. "This is not just about access, but it's about success. We need to make sure we're doing everything we can to help students be successful and prepared to enter the workforce."
