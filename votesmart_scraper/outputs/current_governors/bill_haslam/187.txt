Haslam Announces Transportation Grant for Dunlap
Press Release
By: Bill Haslam
Date: July 8, 2014
Location: Dunlap, TN

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Department of Transportation Commissioner John Schroer announced today a $591,141 transportation alternative grant to the city of Dunlap to connect residential areas near Coops Creek with the downtown business district and educational centers.

Phase II of the Coops Creek Greenway Project is located at the beginning of Highway 127 and continues along the edge of the creek. It will include parking, bicycle racks, and a gathering area for public events.

"In addition to providing residents and visitors with critical connections to areas of the city, this project will also improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists," Haslam said. "Tennessee's downtowns are the heart of our communities, and projects like this enhance the lives of Tennesseans and make our communities more livable."

The transportation alternative grant is made possible through a federally funded program formerly known as transportation enhancement, and is administered by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT).

"Through these grants, TDOT has funded more than $306 million in non-traditional transportation projects," Schroer said. "This program has assisted communities all over the state in their efforts to revitalize downtowns, highlight historic areas, provide alternative means of transportation, and increase opportunities for economic development."

A variety of activities, such as the restoration of historic facilities, bike and pedestrian trails, landscaping and other non-traditional transportation projects, are eligible for grant funds under the federal program.

State Sen. Janice Bowling (R-Tullahoma) and state Rep. Ron Travis (R-Dayton) represent Sequatchie County in the Tennessee General Assembly.
