Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam joined Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey and House Speaker Beth Harwell today to announce that key stakeholders of K-12 education from across the state will come together in Nashville on Thursday, September 18 for Tennessee's Education Summit: Progress of the Past, Present and Future.

"There is nothing more important to the future of our state than getting education right," Haslam said. "We are making historic progress in Tennessee, and as part of that progress there has been a lot of change and discussion. This is a chance to review where we've been, take a look at where we are today, and make sure we're planning for where we want to go."
"The progress our state has made in education over the past few years has been nothing short of remarkable. As the cause of reform continues, it is important to take stock and reflect on our past successes with an eye towards mapping our future progress," Ramsey said. "It is now more important than ever to ensure we provide our students with a strong, world-class education rooted in Tennessee values. I look forward to this opportunity to listen, learn and discuss how Tennessee can build on its historic gains in education."

"We need to ensure that Tennessee students are getting the very best education possible, so that they can compete on the global stage," Harwell said. "One of the most important things we can do as policymakers is facilitate discussions with those stakeholders who are working with our children every day, and determine what progress we have made, and where we can do better. We have made significant progress, but there is more that can be done."
