Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on Thursday evening regarding the death of Nelson Mandela:

"Nelson Mandela's "long walk to freedom' changed our world for the better. The cause of his life became the world's cause, and in 1987, the State of Connecticut joined him by banning state investments in companies that did business in South Africa in support of his mission of ending racial segregation policies.

"His reverent passion for justice will continue to inspire generations of citizens to improve social, political, racial, and humanitarian conditions around the world. While the news of his passing is cause for sorrow, we should be forever grateful for his incomparable contribution to the cause for equality."
