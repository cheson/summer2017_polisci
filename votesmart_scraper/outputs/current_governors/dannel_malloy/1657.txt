Democratic nominee for Governor Dan Malloy today released the following statement:

"I welcome Tom to the discussion about education, but I think there are some real deficiencies in his plan. There's nothing on early childhood education, very little on parental involvement, and not a word about higher education. To put forward an education "plan' and not address the needs of young children, as well as high school graduates and adults seeking access to higher education, demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding that education is a lifelong process. And to not propose creative ways to get parents more involved in their children's education suggests a lack of understanding that more and better parental involvement produces better results.

"I'm proud of the education plan I put forward three months ago, and I'm proud that under my leadership in Stamford, we were the first city in Connecticut to offer pre-K to every child and we narrowed the achievement gap, all while making sure our schools were safe and clean.

"I look forward to discussing with Tom our different plans on education, and the experience each of us has in delivering results for students and their parents."
