Gov. Malloy Statement on U.S. Supreme Court Ruling Concerning Home Health Care Workers
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: June 30, 2014
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement concerning today's U.S. Supreme Court decision on home health care workers in Harris v. Quinn:

"Today's ruling takes the rights of American workers backwards. A stable, qualified home care workforce makes life-changing improvements in the lives of seniors and people with disabilities, who want nothing more than to live independently at home. While we review today's ruling to determine exactly how it will impact workers in Connecticut, I can guarantee that we will continue to stand with them and keep improving the jobs and fair wages that they have worked for."
