Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman issued the following statements commemorating Memorial Day, observed May 27, 2013:

"Connecticut is deeply grateful to our military and their families for their sacrifices," said Governor Malloy. "Their work to protect and defend this country, and the bravery and integrity with which they have performed their duty speaks volumes about our service members and the values this nation holds dear. This weekend is an opportunity for our communities to come together and reflect on the generations of men and women who have fought and died to make our nation a better, stronger place."

"The continuing conflicts overseas and the recent horrible events in Boston show that the fight for our freedom and our safety really never ends," said Lieutenant Governor Wyman. "As we commemorate this Memorial Day, I hope that all of us remember the debt we owe to our Veterans, and pray for the thousands of our men and women in uniform that remain in harm's way. They are the reason that this country is--and must remain--a place of freedom like no other."

The Governor issued a Memorial Day proclamation and, in accordance with U.S. Flag Code, has ordered U.S. and state flags to fly at half-staff from sunrise until noon on Memorial Day.
