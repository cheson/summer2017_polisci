Governor Dannel P. Malloy today applauded final passage of Senate Bill 1138, An Act Concerning Connecticut's Clean Energy Goals.

"The move toward more renewable energy is a critical part of our overall effort to provide cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy to residents and businesses," said Governor Malloy. "By moving from dirtier, out-of-state bio-mass to cleaner hydropower, we will both improve air quality throughout New England and lower cost for consumers. Those lower costs will mean family budgets can stretch a little farther, and businesses can grow jobs where we need them - right here in Connecticut. I want to thank Senators Williams and Duff, Speaker Sharkey, Representative Reed and the legislature for their support of this bill and Connecticut consumers."

One of the key components of the Governor's comprehensive energy strategy unveiled in October calls for the modernization of the state's Renewable Portfolio Standards, which currently call for 20 percent renewable power by 2020. The change will allow Connecticut to increase the mix of renewable energy options beyond Class I renewables like wind, solar and fuel cells.
