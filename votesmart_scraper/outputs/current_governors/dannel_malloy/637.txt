Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he has ordered increased state police presence along Metro North and Amtrak rail lines as well as at Bradley International Airport.

"The health and safety of our citizens is my number one priority. With the current events overseas and out of an abundance of caution, I am ordering an increased state police presence along our rail lines and at Bradley Airport," said Governor Malloy. "But let me be clear, there is no credible threat against the State of Connecticut at this time and these measures are precautionary in nature."

As always, the Governor is also asking residents to be aware of their surroundings and if they see anything out of the ordinary, call the state Homeland Security Tips Line at 1-866-HLS-TIPS. For any immediate threat, call 9-1-1.
