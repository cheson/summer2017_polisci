Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement on the final passage of legislation establishing collective bargaining for home healthcare and daycare workers:

"I want to congratulate the Senate for passing an important bill in concurrence with the House that will help to provide a better wage to people who work tirelessly for some of our state's most vulnerable residents.

"When given the opportunity, the individuals who work with both children and seniors have overwhelmingly voted in favor of unionization. While I believe the executive orders I signed last year provided a pathway to organization, this law takes away any uncertainly that effort may face going forward.

"I know this issue has caused anxiety for some but let's lay to rest any concerns that residents may have. I believe our state government has an obligation to protect our most vulnerable, young and old alike. It's my hope that elected representation will lead to better wages, and therefore more stability in each of the fields -- a development that will help both client and care workers."
