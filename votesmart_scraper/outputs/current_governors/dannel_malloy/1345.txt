Governor Dannel P. Malloy on Friday signed into law a bill that will allow certain Connecticut Energy Assistance Program (CEAP) recipients to receive a matching payment from utility companies for a supplemental energy assistance benefit they will receive under the program.

"This assistance for low-income households comes at a time when it is greatly needed, especially for the elderly and other vulnerable households who should not have to choose between heating their homes and other vital necessities," Governor Malloy said.

CEAP is designed to help offset the winter heating costs of Connecticut's lower income households and is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This year, Connecticut received $79.5 million in federal funding under the program. Utility companies offer a matching program that helps low-income households that are delinquent on their bills reduce their debts.

Under the legislation, which was unanimously approved yesterday by both chambers of the General Assembly, a $200 supplemental LIHEAP payment will be matched by the utility companies for a total supplemental benefit to these households of $400.

The legislation is House Bill 5445 -- An Act Concerning Supplemental Payments Under the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program.
