Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the announcement made today that Saint Mary's Hospital plans to join the Tenet Healthcare Corporation:

"Saint Mary's Hospital provides a great benefit to the Greater Waterbury region and it is a top priority to make sure that residents in this area continue to have access to the health care services they need. The delivery of health care across our nation has been an extraordinarily complex and multifaceted issue, which only added to the need for everyone involved to be thorough and mindful of the long-term effects of a major transaction such as this. I am glad to have signed legislation last month that helped today's announcement come to fruition and I look forward to working with Tenet and Saint Mary's to ensure a smooth process that continues to serve the Waterbury community."
