Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statement regarding President Barack Obama's announcement today on new actions the administration is taking to advance equal pay for all workers:
Governor Malloy said, "If we want to close economic gaps, and if we want to do what's right, then we need to close the gender wage gap. It's 2016 - and it's unacceptable for women, doing the same work, to earn 79 percent of what their male counterparts earn. This is very simple - equal pay for equal work. I'm proud of the steps we have taken, including putting a halt to the practice of pay secrecy last year. But we can all do more. I applaud the Obama administration for this announcement today, for working to move the ball down the field, and urge Congress to deliver progress on behalf of all women across the nation."
Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said, "Closing the gender wage gap is imperative to the security of families in Connecticut and across the nation. Allowing economic disadvantage to continue unchecked and lowering future earning potential for women and minorities - these practices are widespread and completely contrary to building strong families and strong communities. I applaud President Obama's attention to this issue and join him in urging Congress to take action on paycheck fairness. It's a fundamental economic security issue for women, men, and families."
