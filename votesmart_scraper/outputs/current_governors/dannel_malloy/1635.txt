"Cathy and I send our thoughts and prayers to our friend, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, her family, staff and others who were involved in this horrific incident. Those of us who serve in public life know there are risks, but precious few of us ever realize them firsthand. Rep. Giffords was doing her job- talking to Arizona residents about their concerns and ideas- when this happened. It is unfathomable to me that there are people who believe this is how best to be heard."
