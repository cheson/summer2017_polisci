Press Release
By: Dan Malloy
Date: July 18, 2016
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that - in accordance with a proclamation from President Barack Obama directing flags to be lowered to honor the victims of the attack on police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana - U.S. and state flags in Connecticut should remain flying at half-staff through sunset on Friday, July 22, 2016.
Accordingly, since no flag should fly higher than the U.S. flag, all state, local, municipal, corporate, and other flags should also be lowered during this same duration of time.
Flags are also currently at half-staff through sunset on Tuesday, July 19 to honor the victims of the recent attack in Nice, France. With this new order, flags should remain lowered through sunset on Friday.
