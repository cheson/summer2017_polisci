MALLOY ANNOUNCES PLAN TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY CHILD IN CONNECTICUT
HARTFORD -- Calling it a "moral obligation we can and should meet," Democratic candidate for Governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's Mayor, today announced the first major policy proposal in the 2006 race for Governor: a plan to provide health care for every child in Connecticut.
The initiative, called "Every Child Matters" (ECM), takes what Malloy called "a monumental first step in alleviating Connecticut's growing health care crisis by extending health care coverage to all of Connecticut's children."
"It is in a word 'shameful' that there are approximately 71,000 Connecticut children who don't have access to health care coverage -- in this, the wealthiest State in the wealthiest nation in the world," said Malloy. "It's something that we have a moral obligation to fix."
Malloy added: "Over the years, our health care problems have escalated into a crisis, with little to nothing being done to alleviate them," said Malloy. "Insuring the 71,000 children in our State who currently lack health care coverage is just a starting point, albeit a critical one. The ultimate goal must be to provide coverage to the 300,000 adults who also lack access to affordable health care as well."
