Press Release

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that CTtransit buses throughout the state will soon be equipped with GPS devices that will provide real-time bus location information to riders. With a total of 42 million passenger trips taken per year, riders will be able to better plan travel with up-to-the-minute arrival and departure information, as well as a better experience, with the new devices.
"This is all part of transforming our systems. It's good for residents, it's good for businesses, and it's good for CTtransit. With real-time bus location information, it's another step in our effort to take Connecticut into the future," Governor Malloy said. "We want the CTtransit experience to be easy and user-friendly, and the addition of this technology will make travel more convenient and reliable. This is a smart, strategic step in continuing the modernization of our infrastructure to move us towards a new era in economic growth that will support Connecticut families and businesses and create a best-in-class transportation system."
This project will provide 'intelligent technology' for passengers on 500 CTtransit buses throughout the state. Similar GPS tracking information has already been successfully deployed on CTfastrak buses in central Connecticut. The new system is made possible by a $7 million allocation that was approved last month by the State Bond Commission.
The Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) is encouraging riders to download apps to their smart phones, such as "Transit App," that will utilize the GPS tracking information provided on the bus system.
The installation of the new technology is the next step in a multi-phase statewide project that will include introducing new electronic fareboxes over the next six months. It will be compatible with the latest in new high-tech fare-paying options so that Connecticut can begin the design of a smart-card payment system as well as smartphone ticketing.
CTtransit is the CTDOT-owned bus service. In 2014, CTtransit provided 42 million passenger trips around the state.
