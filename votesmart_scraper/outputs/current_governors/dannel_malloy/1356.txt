Statement
By: Dan Malloy

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Malloy released the following statement to recognize Equal Pay Day:

"While the news on pay equity is slowly improving, all across the country women are still earning less money than men for doing the same work. It is systemic discrimination, and it must stop. We are a nation of opportunity and justice--men and women labored side-by-side in founding this country, and women continue to be a critical part of our success and economic strength. There is no question that men and women must earn the same wages for doing the same job. Our economy and families everywhere depend on it."
