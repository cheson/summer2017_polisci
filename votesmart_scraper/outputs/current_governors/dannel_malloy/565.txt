Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to the release of the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for October 2014. The report shows that the unemployment rate stands at 6.4% -- the lowest point since November 2008 -- and that Connecticut saw a net increase of 4,900 private sector jobs during the month. In total, the state has experienced an increase of 70,600 private sector jobs since January 2011.

"These numbers are another sign of progress. With more than 70,000 private sector jobs created since January of 2011, we are experiencing one of the best periods of growth in decades. More work remains to be done, and we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure Connecticut remains on a path towards an economic revival. By working with the business community on expanding their operations or relocating to our state, we are putting Connecticut on the path to long-term prosperity."
