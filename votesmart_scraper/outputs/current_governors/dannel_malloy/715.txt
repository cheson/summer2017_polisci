Governor Dannel P. Malloy today cautioned residents about possible severe weather through this evening and potential flooding through tomorrow morning.

"We continue to be in a very active, severe weather pattern," said Governor Malloy. "I am asking all residents, especially those living in low-lying, flood-prone areas, to stay alert to changing weather conditions."

The current forecast is calling for possible rainfall rates of 1 -- 3 inches per hour with some storms which could cause minor to locally moderate urban flooding this afternoon and evening. The severe weather threat is expected to diminish after 10:00PM tonight, however, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue overnight with additional heavy showers and some thunderstorms Wednesday morning as a cold front pushes through the state from west to east.

The Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) will continue to monitor conditions across the state and coordinate any assistance that may be necessary.
