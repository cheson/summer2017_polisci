Governor Dannel P. Malloy today praised final passage of bill making Bradley International Airport an economic driver in the state.

"Bradley Airport is centrally located, easily accessible and it could be a major economic driver in our state -- if we approach its operations and management strategically," said Governor Malloy. "This bill will free Bradley from the bureaucracy that has hamstrung the airport in the past and help to make it more attractive to new routes, new airlines and new ways to increase our state's economic viability. It's important to note this bill's bipartisan, bicameral backing, and I look forward to working with those who are as committed as I am to make Bradley International Airport an integral part of our state's economic strategy."
