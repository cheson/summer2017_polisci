Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) Commissioner Melody A. Currey today announced that DMV is extending the emissions due date and waiving late fees for applicable vehicles involved in the recent General Motors (GM) recall.

"We understand that affected residents are already under enough stress dealing with the GM recall and don't want to add to their burden. Their first priority should be remedying their vehicles' safety issues," said Governor Malloy. "We are extending emissions' deadlines and waiving late fees to ease the pressure on Connecticut owners while they get through this extraordinary situation."

GM has recalled about 2.5 million of its compact cars, including 2.2 million in the United States, due to safety hazards related to a defective ignition switch. Last week the automaker said it was aware of a 13th death related to the faulty ignition switches.

"This is a serious problem and we want to help people as much as we can," said DMV Commissioner Currey. "We see this effort as assisting these consumers as they work to get repairs done."
