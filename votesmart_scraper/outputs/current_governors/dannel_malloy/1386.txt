Governor Dannel P. Malloy's General Counsel Andrew J. McDonald this afternoon released the following statement regarding today's State Supreme Court's decision on Bridgeport schools.

"Today's Supreme Court decision is disappointing and has the potential to seriously disrupt the educational opportunities of Bridgeport's schoolchildren this year. We are reviewing the implications of this decision and intend to discuss further legal and legislative options with state and local officials in the very near future. Our goal has always been to create a stable, productive and educationally sound environment for a chronically struggling school district. Our focus will not change."
