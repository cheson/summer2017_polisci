Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the U. S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently approved a new Employment and Day Supports Waiver that will help the state Department of Developmental Services (DDS) improve access to services for people with developmental disabilities.

Over the next two fiscal years, the Employment and Day Supports Waiver will, in effect, help the state cover the cost of services for DDS clients, which will generate $5.2 million for Connecticut. It will create 160 jobs by providing new services for high school graduates.

"This is a situation in which everybody wins. We are expanding a program that provides critical services to our most vulnerable citizens, and doing so in a cost-efficient manner," said Governor Malloy. "I applaud the Department of Developmental Services for pursuing new ways to do more for our residents."

The new funding will assist individuals over the age of 18 who require career development, employment, respite or behavior supports and children under the age of 21 with complex medial issues who live with their families.
The Department of Social Services (DSS) is responsible for oversight of the waiver while DDS manages the day-to-day operation through state case managers and service partners.

Currently, DDS has over 8,600 individuals receiving services under several federal funding streams and is in the process of pursuing federal dollars for autism services.
