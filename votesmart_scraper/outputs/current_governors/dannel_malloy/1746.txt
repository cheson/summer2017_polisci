HARTFORD, Conn. -- Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell is taking political heat for skipping the National Governor's Association meeting this weekend in Washington, D.C.
It's the second time in a row she has bowed out.
Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy, who is vying against New Haven Mayor John DeStefano for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, said Rell should reconsider her decision, go to Washington and fight for what she calls her top priority, economic development.
Rell is vice chairman of the NGA's Economic Development and Commerce Committee.
"Here's a chance for her to address her No. 1 priority on behalf of the people of Connecticut with key leaders from around the nation and President Bush, and she turns it down," Malloy said in a written statement.
