Malloy Shares Ideas And Plans With Northwest Area Residents
Democratic Candidate for Governor says he "understands the needs of small towns."
May 7 - Following on the heels of a recent visit to Freund's farm in East Canaan, Democratic candidate for Governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's four-term mayor, was in western Connecticut again yesterday to share his ideas about how to grow the region's economy and protect the environment.
His first stop was at the riverfront home of Lakeville resident Wendy Bailey Hamilton, where Malloy spoke to a well-informed group of 35 delegates and Democratic Town Committee (DTC) members from the towns of Salisbury, Canaan, North Canaan, Norfolk, Sharon, Cornwall, Goshen, and Kent.
Later Malloy met with Democratic convention delegates and town representatives from New Fairfield and surrounding towns at Portofino's Pizza.
Frank Ghi, North Canaan DTC member, said that the governor won his support and that he would be returning with the reasons why to his DTC. Dennis DePaul, Kent DTC member affirmed the group's sentiments regarding the issues discussed.
Each group was interested in hearing his views on health care, property taxes, education, job creation as well as his plans to beat Jodi Rell in November.
Malloy has said that as governor the first priority of his administration would be economic development. Ranked dead last in job growth and retention Malloy spoke about his Every Job Matters policy initiative. The plan proposes changing the way Connecticut approaches business growth and has a clear, attainable goal to create 100,000 jobs by 2010. The added revenue associated with 100,000 new jobs - approximately $190 million - will offset the operating expenses associated with implementing the plan.
