Joint statement from Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman:

"To be clear, this is not the road down which either of us wanted to go. It's the reason we both worked hard and in good faith to come to an agreement with SEBAC that would have avoided the layoffs of rank-and-file state employees and managers. But at this point, with no clear path to reach a ratified agreement with SEBAC, it's our job to find a way to fill the $1.6 billion hole in the budget and ensure our budget is balanced honestly. Tomorrow we'll send our full plan to the legislature, including these layoff numbers and additional service and programmatic cuts totaling $1.6 billion. And then we'll work as hard as we can to mitigate the impact these layoffs and cuts will have on the people of Connecticut."
