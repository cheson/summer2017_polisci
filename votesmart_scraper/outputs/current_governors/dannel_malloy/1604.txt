On the heels of his second major restructuring proposal, Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced his proposal to reduce the number of budgeted agencies by 30 percent -- from 81 to 57 agencies.

"I'm asking the people of Connecticut to do more with less, and we in state government need to, as well. I've reduced my own staff in the Governor's Office by 15 percent, and I'm proposing to reduce the number of budgeted state agencies by 30 percent," said Gov. Malloy. "When putting together my budget, I had to ask -- what sense does it make to split the Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security and the Department of Public Safety? Or why are the Offices of Workforce Competitiveness and the Commission on Culture and Tourism stand-alone agencies, apart from the Department of Economic and Community Development? And why are all of the government accountability functions -- the Elections Enforcement Commission, the Freedom of Information Commission, the Judicial Review Council, the Contracting Standards Board, and the Office of State Ethics separate entities when so many of their issue areas and jurisdiction overlap? It just didn't make sense.

"This is a large shake-up, and I know there will be a number of questions. In the coming weeks and months, I'm going to be talking to people all across the state about my plan for a more streamlined and efficient Connecticut state government. But make no mistake -- I am serious about these proposals, and I am ready to work with the committees of cognizance in the legislature to make this happen."
