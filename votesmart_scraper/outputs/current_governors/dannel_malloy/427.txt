Governor Dannel P. Malloy, Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman, and Department of Housing Commissioner Evonne Klein today released the following statements on Connecticut having the lowest population of homelessness in a point-in-time count ever.
According to a report released this week by the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, as a result of state initiatives like Zero: 2016, the total homeless population in Connecticut is down to historic lows, the sheltered population is down 4 percent, unsheltered homelessness is down 32 percent, and chronic homelessness is down 21 percent since last year. Further, Connecticut has made substantial progress towards ending homelessness among the veteran population.
"We're nationwide leaders in ending homelessness because we're making smarter decisions today for a brighter Connecticut tomorrow - and this report is a complete validation of our efforts," Governor Malloy said. "Zero: 2016 is transformative, not because of the high goal we set, but because of the extraordinary efforts we're making to reach it. As we grow jobs, do more on affordable housing than has been done in decades, and take strategic approaches on ending homelessness, we're taking steps like never before to help residents get back on their feet. Our methods are working. This report demonstrates that our commitment to ending homelessness, particularly among veterans, is seeing success. We're going to continue to make even more progress to make Connecticut an even better place to live, work, and raise a family - for everyone."
"Ensuring that housing, employment services, healthcare, and other programs are operating cohesively is key to meeting our commitment to end homelessness among veterans by the end of this year and chronic homelessness by the end of next year," Lt. Governor Wyman said. "I applaud the state Department of Housing and the many organizations and advocates who are coordinating care and services - this work has made a tremendous impact in the lives of some of Connecticut's most vulnerable citizens."
"The numbers are going in the right direction - a decrease in homelessness. Governor Malloy's commitment to end chronic homelessness by the end of 2016 is something Connecticut is on the path to realize," Commissioner Klein said. "It is because of the hard work each and every day by our providers on the ground that we are seeing this reduction in homelessness in Connecticut. The Department of Housing is proud to support their efforts."
