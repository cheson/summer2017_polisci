Malloy: Rell Abandoning Her Post-Rowland Ethics Promises

Says, "The more things change the more they stay the same"
The following is a statement from Democratic candidate for Governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's Mayor:

I am deeply concerned by the latest developments in the Governor's office.

The recent departure of the respected, independent ethics counsel in the Governor's office would be troubling enough, but the fact that Governor Rell has replaced her with a political appointee who will report to her chief of staff -- who herself was recently suspended for violating campaign finance laws -- is very troubling.

It's especially troubling considering that there are still unanswered questions about what the Governor knew, and when she knew it, regarding the fundraiser in East Hartford that has become the focus of so much attention. On Friday, it was reported that Governor Rell herself was actually present at the dinner where her chief of staff Lisa Moody handed out fundraiser invitations to administration officials -- but even after that revelation, the Governor's spokesman still refused to tell a reporter what she knew about it and when.

We deserve answers -- but it's hard for me to imagine that someone who reports to Lisa Moody will want to even ask Lisa Moody, or the Governor, these questions.

It really is now the proverbial fox guarding the chicken coop.

We now know -- after all the promises Governor Rell made when John Rowland resigned -- that the more things change the more they stay the same.

The people of Connecticut deserve a Governor and Administration that will ensure real reform and high ethical standards.
