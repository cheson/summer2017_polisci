Governor Dannel P. Malloy today reflected on his first 100 days in office and the 17 Town Hall Meetings he held across the state. Governor Malloy began those meetings on February 21 in Bridgeport and finished on April 12 in Middletown. Taking into account the concerns raised, Governor Malloy today announced that he would reinstate the property tax credit to $300. In addition, his revised tax package lessens the burden on the vast majority of the middle class.

"At various points along the way, people wrote that maybe I wasn't listening -- that maybe I was just on a venting tour -- and that in the end I wouldn't change anything in my budget proposal," said Governor Malloy. "With all due respect, the people who said that weren't listening to what I was saying. All along, I've been saying the same thing: this budget is based on a set of principles from which I will not back down. But I also said that within the framework of those principles I've been trying to find the right balance, and that I was open to listening to people's ideas."
