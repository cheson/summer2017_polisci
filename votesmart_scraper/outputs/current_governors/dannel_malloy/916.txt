Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement following the release of a letter today from the Office of Policy and Management (OPM) to Comptroller Kevin Lembo detailing Connecticut's latest revenue and expenditure figures, including a projected state budget surplus that has risen to more than $500 million:

"Today's letter highlights the continued progress we have made in turning a record-setting $3.6 billion deficit to a surplus of more than $500 million, while at the same time making smart investments to improve our education system and grow jobs.

"Overall, the rate of budget growth under this administration is lower than those of my predecessors. For too long, our state had been putting off the tough decisions needed to get our fiscal house back on track and keep it there. While the work isn't done yet and we must continue working to improve the state of our state, thanks to the efforts of many people in our state, we're seeing progress."
