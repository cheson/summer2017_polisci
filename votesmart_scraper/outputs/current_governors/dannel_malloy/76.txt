Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the announcement made today by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation that President Barack Obama will be the recipient of the 2017 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award:
"President Obama throughout his life has continually demonstrated the courage to improve the lives of all Americans. From expanding access to affordable healthcare for millions of people, to reforming our criminal justice system, to restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba, to efforts to combat global warming -- our nation and the world are forever changed for the better because of his work. The best policy decisions are not driven by dogma, but are rooted in a genuine desire to do what is just, moral, and in the best interests of the people of our nation. President Obama has embodied such a thoughtful approach throughout his tenure and I congratulate him on this award -- it is an honor that is well deserved."
The John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award is presented annually to public servants who have made courageous decisions of conscience without regard for the personal or professional consequences. Governor Malloy received the award in 2016 for his advocacy on behalf of refugees from war-torn countries.
