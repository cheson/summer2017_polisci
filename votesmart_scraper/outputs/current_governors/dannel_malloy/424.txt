Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced today that he plans to sign legislation he introduced earlier this year establishing a Long Island Sound Blue Plan, which was unanimously approved by the State Senate last night in concurrence with the House of Representatives, which passed the bill in April.
Under the legislation, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the University of Connecticut will convene relevant state agencies, academic institutions, and stakeholders to compile an inventory of the natural resources and the human resources of the Long Island Sound. That information will be used to develop a plan to guide future uses of the Sound's waters and submerged lands.
"Through smart legislation passed today, we're making the future brighter tomorrow. The Long Island Sound is a critical component to Connecticut's economy and quality of life - millions of people rely on its resources. By taking action now, we are planning for our long-term future, protecting our environmental resources while making economic smart decisions," Governor Malloy said. "I would like to thank Environment Committee co-chairmen Senator Ted Kennedy Jr. and Representative James Albis for their joint advocacy on this proposal, which I look forward to signing into law in the coming days."
