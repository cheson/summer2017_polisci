Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman today applauded the decision by UnitedHealthcare to voluntarily extend some of the provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, regardless of how the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of the Act later this month.

"This decision is not only good news for those covered by UnitedHealthcare, but shows that a major insurance carrier sees the benefit of these reforms both to patients and to the industry," said Governor Malloy. "Clearly, this is a major endorsement of key provisions of the ACA and I hope that other insurers quickly come to the same conclusion."

Among the provisions UnitedHealthcare will maintain are coverage for dependents up to age 26 under their parents' plan; eliminating lifetime dollar limits on policies and offering no co-pay preventive services including annual check-ups, screening for high-blood pressure and diabetes, and immunizations.

"These provisions not only keep people healthier and give greater access to coverage, but help lower the overall cost of providing care for everyone in the health care system," Lieutenant Governor Wyman said.
