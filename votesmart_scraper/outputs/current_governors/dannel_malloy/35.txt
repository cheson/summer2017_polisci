Statement
By: Dan Malloy

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding last night's shooting in Bridgeport:
"When the use of force by law enforcement officers results in the loss of life, justice is best served when the incident is reviewed by objective and independent entities. That is why in 2015, I signed a bill into law aimed at increasing accountability and transparency by expanding the reporting and investigation requirements in such instances. It is appropriate that Office of the State's Attorney and the Connecticut State Police have assumed their respective responsibilities in the review of the shooting that occurred last night in Bridgeport. The State of Connecticut is committed to ensuring an open and independent investigation to determine the facts of this case.
"With that said, a young man lost his life last night and I am deeply saddened by this reality. I am sensitive to the concerns of all those impacted by this incident and ask for patience from members of the community as the independent reviews are being conducted."
The legislation Governor Malloy signed in 2015 is Public Act 15-4, An Act Concerning Excessive Use of Force.
