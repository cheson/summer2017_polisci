Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the announcement made today that the U.S. Department of Defense has approved Sikorsky to produce 200 CH-53K King Stallion helicopters for the U.S. Marine Corps:
"The headline is that these state-of-the-art helicopters will be made in Connecticut. This is an exciting milestone for Sikorsky and for our state. Competition in today's worldwide economic climate is fierce, and Connecticut has shown we remain a valued leader where businesses can access one of the most well educated, productive workforces and maintain a competitive edge well into the future. This isn't only about Sikorsky -- it's also about the supply chain companies and the thousands of employees in every corner of our state who will benefit. That's why we worked so hard to ensure the CH-53K King Stallion would be built right here in Connecticut."
