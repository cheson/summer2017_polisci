Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman issued the following statements regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's decision today not to review all five pending marriage equality cases:

Governor Malloy said, "The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court today represents great news not only for the five states at hand, but for everyone in our country who believes that when equality triumphs for one, it triumphs for all. While Connecticut has had marriage equality since 2008, there is still a long way to go to ensure that everyone in our nation is treated equally in this regard. A marriage should not be a right that you gain and lose on a road trip across the country. Equality leads to stronger families and stronger communities, and I join advocates across our nation in celebrating today's decision. There is one thing we know for sure -- six years of marriage equality has made Connecticut a stronger state."

Lt. Governor Wyman said, "I applaud today's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court rejecting appeals from several states that would have denied same-sex couples the freedom to marry. Because of the action announced today, Americans in 30 states will soon enjoy this fundamental right regardless of their sexual orientation. This is an important moment in the long struggle to ensure that all Americans enjoy equal justice under the law. I commend the Supreme Court."
