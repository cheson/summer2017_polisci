Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to a federal judge's decision today upholding Connecticut's gun laws:

"The court made the right decision today. The common-sense measures we enacted last session will make our state safer, and I am grateful for the court's seal of approval.

"Let's not forget that this has happened before. In prior instances when Connecticut has passed related firearms laws, there have been similar challenges and they have all been unsuccessful."
