Statement

Location: Hartford,CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding a sit-in by the members of the House Democratic caucus - including Connecticut's Congressional delegation - who are demanding that votes be taken in Congress on gun violence prevention measures:
"Enough is enough. We recognized that enough was enough in Connecticut, and our Congressional delegation realizes it in Washington. I fully support their sit-in to force a vote on commonsense gun laws. We are seeing tragedy after tragedy, and while we in Connecticut have acted with the smartest gun law in the nation, Republicans in Congress continue to stand in the way of meaningful changes to save lives. That's why these actions in the House, with our delegation taking a leading role alongside Congressman Lewis, are so vital and necessary."
