Gov. Malloy on Final Passage of "First Five" Initiative
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: June 8, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today hailed the final passage of legislation he proposed creating the "First Five" program -- a new jobs initiative that will provide a unique set of incentives to the first five businesses that each bring a minimum of 200 new full-time jobs to Connecticut within the next 24 months.

"Connecticut is open for business, and this program is a clear sign to those companies already located within the state, or those who might be thinking of moving here, that we're ready, willing and able to work with them to grow and expand their businesses and create new jobs," said Governor Malloy. "And no one should be deterred by the name -- ultimately, I'd like to increase this to the First Fifty or more, but we need to take the first step, now. In our new Department of Community and Economic Development Commissioner, Catherine Smith, we have a smart, savvy and proven business leader who knows what needs to be done to put people back to work. I look forward to working with her and those companies who would like to make Connecticut their home."
