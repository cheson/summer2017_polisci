federal judge's ruling in Florida that federal health reform is unconstitutional isn't likely to change day to day operations for insurers, hospitals and many states.
"It's still the law of the land," William Hoagland, vice president of public policy at CIGNA Corp. told the Associated Press. "We'll continue to proceed with its requirements, and (the ruling) will not slow that down. We have no other choice until this thing is resolved one way or the other."
Here's the full AP story.
Governor Dannel P. Malloy responded to the court decision, saying he believes this is a "clear case of judicial overreach" by U.S. District Court Judge Roger Vinson in Florida.
"We need to figure out ways to make healthcare more affordable and accessible to people, but the way to do that is not by scrapping the entire law and starting all over again," Malloy said. "As I've said before, the rising cost of healthcare is a major detriment to job creation here in Connecticut, and I commit to resolving open SustiNet issues with all parties at the table on behalf of Connecticut residents and businesses."
SustiNet is state-sponsored, quasi-governmental health insurance approved by the legislature in 2009 and intended to be up and running by 2012. It is intended to cover state employees, but will also be available to municipalities, employers and individuals.
