Leaders of Connecticut's small towns were left to read the fiscal tea leaves Wednesday as state leaders offered two starkly contrasting views of Connecticut's finances.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and his fellow Democrats leading the House and Senate declared fiscal stability and pledged to continue trying to bolster municipal budgets, but GOP legislative leaders cited projected deficits, a bond rating downgrade and cash flow problems as evidence of another impending fiscal crisis.
"What a difference a year makes," Malloy said Wednesday to open a 16-minute address at the Connecticut Council of Small Towns' annual meeting at the Cromwell Plaza Hotel and Conference Center.
"A year ago we were literally standing at a cliff, looking over that cliff and making a decision whether we would do what other states were doing," Malloy said, adding that nearly all states except Connecticut attacked state budget deficits but ordering deep cuts to municipal aid and to social service programs, passing burdens onto property taxpayers and the poor. "We went a different way. Our economy is beginning to grow, and we are taking on other, systemic issues."
The governor reminded municipal leaders that he inherited a budget with a built-in deficit that topped $3.6 billion in the 2011-12 fiscal year, a gap equal to nearly one-fifth of all spending. "We promised not to balance our budget on your backs and we didn't," he said, adding it probably was a "daunting fear" in many communities that town aid would be slashed.
