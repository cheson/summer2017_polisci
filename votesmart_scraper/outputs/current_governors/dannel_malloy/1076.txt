Gov. Malloy Statement on U.S. Senate Passage of Immigration Bill
By: Dan Malloy
Date: June 27, 2013
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to the U.S. Senate vote today on the immigration bill:

"Today, the United States Senate acted upon President Obama's call for this Congress to finally fix our broken immigration system and passed a bipartisan, commonsense immigration reform bill. If enacted, this legislation will strengthen our borders, create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, stimulate our economy, and create jobs.

"I commend Senators Blumenthal and Murphy and all their colleagues in the Senate who worked so hard to craft a compromise bill that is tough and yet reaffirms our heritage as a nation of immigrants. I also commend my fellow governors who worked in support of this effort, particularly to include in the bill a dramatic increase in STEM education funds to states to help us as we work to grow a domestic labor force of high-skilled workers."
