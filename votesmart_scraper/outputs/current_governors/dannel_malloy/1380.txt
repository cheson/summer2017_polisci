Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement regarding the release of the Connecticut Department of Labor's (CTDOL) monthly "Labor Situation" report for the month of January 2012. The report announced that Connecticut's unemployment rate decreased for the sixth consecutive month to 8.0 percent, compared with the national rate of 8.3 percent, and is at its lowest level since April 2009.

In addition, CTDOL released updated job numbers for 2011, showing that 16,300 private sector jobs were added in Connecticut since January 2011. Connecticut's job market began the year with a good start, growing 7,700 private sector jobs during the month of January 2012.

"Today's report is encouraging -- another sign that we are beginning to see a recovery when it comes to job creation," said Governor Malloy. "We continue to outpace the national average, which is a testament to the hard decisions we made last year to stabilize our state's finances and focus on job creation.

"But let's be clear, we still have much work to do," continued Governor Malloy. "Our successes last year have provided a road map and we must remain vigilant to make sure we arrive at our ultimate destination -- an economic revival that benefits all of our residents."
