Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor has awarded the state with a $6 million grant to develop the Eastern Connecticut Manufacturing Pipeline Initiative - a program that will initially create a pipeline for customized training programs in manufacturing in the eastern portion of the state, and provide similar assistance to the aerospace industry throughout Connecticut.
The initiative, a partnership of manufacturing employers, community colleges, technical high schools, and workforce development partners, was developed in response to the expansion of Electric Boat and its stated need to hire 520 new and replacement workers annually over the next several years as it grows its staff to develop nuclear submarines. It will also assist additional manufacturers and aerospace companies with training development, which will include skills assessments and supportive services to help participants complete the training.
"By creating partnerships between our American Job Centers, community colleges, employers, and other interested parties, we can create a pipeline for manufacturing jobs through customized training programs that will translate into well-paying jobs for the residents of our state," Governor Malloy said. "This is an innovative, collaborative program focusing on the needs of regional employers who can place jobseekers into long-term careers."
"This grant was awarded based on Connecticut's innovative strategies for developing customized training that effectively responds to the immediate workforce needs of our manufacturing employers and will provide well-paying job for those that are unemployed or underemployed," Connecticut Labor Commissioner Sharon M. Palmer said. "We are grateful to U.S. Labor Commissioner Perez for recognizing the value of this initiative and providing the state with opportunities to build short-term training programs that will lead to long-term careers."
The program will be operated by the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board (EWIB), with the Connecticut Department of Labor's (CTDOL) Office for Veterans' Workforce Development helping recruit and refer veterans to the programs. CTDOL's Office of Apprenticeship Training will also assist by identifying and recruiting qualified instructors for the occupational training programs and assisting with developing shipyard apprenticeship training programs.
EWIB plans to work with CTDOL and the state's four other regional Workforce Boards, as appropriate, to expand the program to other areas of the state addressing similar industry needs.
Electric Boat, which is looking for workers with manufacturing and welding skills, will provide additional on-the-job training courses to those that it plans to hire. In addition, the Eastern Advanced Manufacturing Alliance also has committed to hiring workers that go through this customized training program.
