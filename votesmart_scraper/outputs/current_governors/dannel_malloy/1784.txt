Governor Rell's Decision To Veto
Topic: Better Government
Three weeks ago, I released a statement publicly urging Governor Rell to sign a new state contracting reform bill into law. Already passed by our State Senate, the bill would place common-sense restrictions on the Governor's ability to privatize state services.
Unfortunately for the people of Connecticut, Governor Rell decided today to veto this reasonable and necessary bill.
It is troubling that our Governor has opted to halt the reform process. As I said three weeks ago, privatization in Connecticut is broken and greatly needs stronger oversight. This bill would have been a firm and comprehensive move in that direction.
