Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the Office of the Claims Commissioner's decision to award Kenneth Ireland compensation following 21 years of wrongful incarceration:

"Kenneth Ireland is a man of extraordinary character who endured the unimaginable pain of two decades of wrongful incarceration, and yet is not only without bitterness, but is incredibly thoughtful, insightful and committed to public safety and service. Nothing could ever replace the two decades of life as a free man that were wrongfully taken away from him, separated from his family and friends.

"Modern DNA technologies are ensuring that the violent criminals who have actually committed the crimes are convicted and remain behind bars. I applaud the work of the Innocence Project for their efforts in ensuring that our criminal justice system remains fair and just."
