Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement:

"I continue to work closely with the federal government on this important issue. Today, I participated in a conference call with the White House and the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. It appears that substantial progress has been made to diminish the need for housing children for extended periods in large scale institutional settings. For example, the facility at Nogales now houses 22 children, down from more than 1,000. Much of this work has been accomplished by pursuing the appropriate step of placing children as quickly as possible with relatives, a position that we have advocated for the past week.

"The federal government has placed more than 320 children with relatives in Connecticut. I previously directed state agencies to facilitate such placements and to work with federal officials in an appropriate fashion should any additional needs arise or should they make additional requests. That would include exploring the Gateway property, which is owned and controlled by the Board of Regents system and is not a surplus state property. However, I do not believe that the long-term detention of minors is the appropriate policy."
