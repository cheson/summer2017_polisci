Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman today issued the following statements in support of Women's Equality Day, which was established in 1971 by a Joint Resolution of Congress.

"Connecticut has a rich history of strong women leaders who serve as critical drivers in the overall success of our state," said Governor Malloy. "It's a simple equation -- when women succeed, families succeed. And when families succeed, we create a state where the middleclass thrives. Despite the many advancements we've made, Women's Equality Day reminds us that we still have a long way to go. It is completely unacceptable for women to earn less than men for doing the same job. Cultural and gender diversity in the workforce makes us a stronger state and a more inclusive place to live, work and raise a family. As Governor, I remain committed to addressing the challenges to women gaining full economic equality in our state."

"Women's Equality Day reminds us just how far we've come, and how much there is left to do before women reach parity across all aspects of our lives," said Lieutenant Governor Wyman. "It all begins with the right for women to have their voices heard at the ballot box. Over the past couple of years, Connecticut has taken strong steps that benefit women and their families--raising the minimum wage, passing paid sick leave, and working to reduce the gender wage gap all help women gain economic stability and care for themselves and their families. These changes also make Connecticut a fairer, more just place overall."

August 26 marks the day in 1920 when passage of the 19th Amendment ensured American women had the right to vote.
