Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on the criminal justice budget implementer:
"Connecticut has made great strides in recent years to address the inequities in our criminal justice system, leading to a dramatic reduction in crime while saving taxpayer money. I am grateful to my partners in the General Assembly who have made these efforts a reality, especially Democratic leadership and the chairs of the Judiciary Committee.
"This weekend, I spoke with Democratic caucus leadership, and together we have agreed to pursue a compromise. That agreement would focus on passing the bail reform components of the original bill.
"On a typical day there are approximately 350 prisoners in our state's jails who are charged only with a non-violent misdemeanor, but who are too poor to post even a small bond. The vast majority of these defendants will spend a month or two waiting for their cases to be resolved in court and will then be released directly from court. It just doesn't make sense.
"This compromise, focusing on the bail component, is critical to this year's budget, which is currently sitting on my desk for signature. If we are able to reform our bail system in Connecticut, we will allow the closure of another Connecticut prison - a closure that both Democrats and Republicans have agreed should happen. Failing to find these savings would mean that additional painful budget cuts will be necessary in order to bring our budget into alignment.
"This is a compromise that we can and should get done in the days and weeks ahead. I urge members of the General Assembly on both sides of the aisle to support this compromise."
