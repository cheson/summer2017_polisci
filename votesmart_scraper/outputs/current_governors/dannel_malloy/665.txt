Press Release

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released an Interim Report on Veterans Homelessness that demonstrates that significant headway is being made towards the Governor's goal of ending chronic homelessness among Connecticut veterans by the end of 2015. Governor Malloy attributed the progress to the implementation of a comprehensive strategic plan earlier this year and an unprecedented level of cooperation and coordination among the key stakeholders around the state who are working on this issue. The report was produced by the CT Heroes Project, which chairs the Working Group on Veterans Homelessness as part of the Partnership for Strong Communities' Reaching Home Campaign to end homelessness.

"In February, we announced that we would be working with state leaders, veterans and veterans' groups to do our part to end veterans' homelessness in the United States by 2015. This progress report not only demonstrates the commitment of our partnership to reaching that deadline but makes it clear that we are fully capable and well on our way to achieving that goal," said Governor Malloy. "We owe it to those who have sacrificed so much to preserve our freedom to ensure that they have access to the employment opportunities, health care, housing and support they need and deserve. I am grateful to Greg Behrman and the CT Heroes Project for their leadership, vision and commitment to completing this mission and look forward to working with all of our partners in the coming months to make this vision a reality."

After receiving this update from the CT Heroes Project, Governor Malloy has called for a Veterans Summit to be held this fall to review the interim report with stakeholders and chart a course for the next best steps necessary to eliminate homelessness among veterans by the end of 2015. Among the areas of review outlined in the report are:

-Improving outreach efforts;
-Reforming transitional housing efforts;
-Increasing residential options and financing various housing upgrades to the
Department of Veterans' Affairs Rocky Hill campus;
-Improving discharge planning for justice-involved veterans;
-Expanding rental assistance vouchers;
-Enhancing employment support services;
-Streamlining the Federal Veterans Administration housing process;
-Streamlining the Supportive Services for Veteran Families program;
-Better utilization of federal resources; and
-Enhancing data collection.

In connection with the Governor's commitment to eliminate chronic homelessness among veterans, the state budget provides $500,000 in funding to perform a capital needs assessment of the Rocky Hill campus, including a feasibility study for additional veterans housing at Rocky Hill including new construction and adaptive re-use projects.

"Ensuring our military men and women have the housing, education, job training, and healthcare supports they need is a priority," said Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman. "This report is an important resource in our efforts to end homelessness among veterans by 2015, and provides a strong blueprint for moving forward. I want to thank everyone for their work, and look forward to all that we will accomplish together in this effort."

Last week, Governor Malloy created an advisory group tasked with planning and determining the most effective use of the Department of Veterans Affairs Rocky Hill campus in order to support Connecticut's at-risk veterans' population. The Governor appointed Lt. Governor Wyman to head the group which is expected to hold its first meeting in September.

"Governor Malloy and his entire Administration have been true partners in this effort to end Veterans homelessness," said Greg Behrman, Founder & Director of The CT Heroes Project. "Given the progress we have made to date, I am confident we will get to our goal."

In 2009, President Obama and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Eric Shinseki announced a national goal of ending homelessness among veterans by 2015. President Obama asked partners and supporters nationwide to embrace this pledge in order to build on the progress the VA has made by increasing programs and funding to help veterans who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. According to the most recent Point in Time count, there are an estimated 4,500 homeless people in Connecticut, of which approximately 11 percent are homeless veterans in temporary housing or living on the streets. In 2012, an estimated 1,000 veterans in Connecticut spent at least one night homeless.
