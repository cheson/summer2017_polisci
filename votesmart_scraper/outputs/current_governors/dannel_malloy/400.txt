Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statements in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges concerning marriage equality:
Governor Malloy said, "Today's decision marks a historic moment in U.S. history and reaffirms everything that this great nation stands for - equality, liberty, and justice for all. It's a day that Americans across our state and country can celebrate. While the State of Connecticut has recognized marriage for same-sex couples since 2008, today's ruling means that our residents cannot lose their marriage rights while traveling from state to state. In short, couples will get the equality under the law that they rightfully deserve. My wife Cathy and I proudly join all of our friends, both gay and straight, to celebrate today's ruling and its recognition that the Constitution of the United States serves to protect the rights of all its residents equally."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "This decision marks a victory for equality and inclusivity. At a time when our nation is again facing devastation wrought by violence and bias, this ruling reconnects us to our humanity - our common desire to establish safe communities, build strong families, and be treated fairly and justly under the law. I'm grateful to the pioneers, the leaders, the lawyers, and the couples that stood up to intolerance and bias. These men and women who fought a decades-long war to get us to today. Today's victory furthers us as a nation, one that is committed to all of our citizens."
