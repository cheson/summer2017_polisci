Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following commemorating Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

"At a moment when our nation is reflecting upon its collective voice and examining the discourse and actions we use to express our freedoms, the commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday is especially appropriate.

"Dr. King's teachings remind us that progress, however slow or unwilling, is made every day. It is incumbent upon each and every one of us to identify injustice when we see it, work to improve it, and continue on the road ahead.

"Today -- the 25th anniversary of our nation's recognition of this day -- let Dr. King's commanding wisdom and the legacy of his timeless message be a reminder to us all that the love, compassion, and justice he conducted himself with should be the methods we all strive to emulate."
