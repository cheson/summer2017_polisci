Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement concerning the devastating typhoon in the Philippines:

"The reports out of the Philippines are devastating. My prayers are with those who live in the region, as well as the Filipino-American residents of Connecticut as they cope with the impacts of this typhoon and its aftermath. With millions living in the region now in need of aid, people inspired to donate funds can contact an organization they trust, such as the Philippine Red Cross, the American Red Cross, AmeriCares, or UNICEF, so those organizations can continue to provide the food, medicine and relief that is so desperately needed."
