Gov. Malloy Statement on MTA Board's Decision to Credit Metro-North Haven Line Customers
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement following the MTA Board's vote this afternoon to approve a credit for Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line customers with monthly or weekly tickets during the ongoing power outage.

"While I look forward to reviewing and providing input on their plan, today's news is certainly a step in the right direction. As I expressed earlier today in a letter to the board, Con Ed should underwrite the refunds, even as they are administered by MNR and MTA. Con Ed should also be responsible for any and all additional costs related to the interim service plan and the ultimate restoration of service.

"Connecticut commuters should never have been put in this situation in the first place, but the unprecedented action taken by the board today is the first step in making things right."
