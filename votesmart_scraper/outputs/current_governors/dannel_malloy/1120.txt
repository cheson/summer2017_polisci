Governor Dannel P. Malloy congratulated the State of Rhode Island for the anticipated approval of legislation later today legalizing same-sex marriage and noted that with its inclusion, every state in New England now recognizes marriage equality.

"Today marks a significant milestone in the struggle for equal rights among our gay and lesbian family members, friends, co-workers and neighbors now that every state in our region of the country has legalized same-sex marriage and is setting a national example of justice for all," Governor Malloy said. "Throughout U.S. history, New England has consistently had a revolutionary spirit and recognized that the greatest American values are respect and equality under the law. It should come as no surprise that this spirit is still alive today."

Governor Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island has scheduled a bill signing ceremony for the legislation for 5:45 p.m. today in Providence. Rhode Island will become the tenth state in the country to legalize same-sex marriage, six of which are in New England.
