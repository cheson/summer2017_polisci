Statement

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement about the Jobs Special Session legislative package.

"As I have been saying for weeks, I'm committed to trying my best to make this jobs session a bipartisan one. To that end, in order to respect the wishes of the caucus leaders, we are going to hold off on releasing specific details today in terms of what's potentially going to be in the final package. They can't make a final agreement with my Administration until they've gotten sign-off from their caucuses, and that hasn't happened yet. Conversations regarding the package are ongoing, productive, and, I believe, will ultimately be fruitful, as we work to reinvent Connecticut and help create jobs in our state."
