Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following joint statement in recognition of Veterans Day, observed annually on November 11:

"We join all Connecticut residents in being deeply grateful for all the sacrifices that our nation's veterans and their families have made to protect our democracy and our freedom. We are proud that Connecticut is home to nearly 280,000 veterans, and that thousands of military men and women will return here as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan come to a close.

"It's important that we thank our service members for their sacrifices, their bravery, and their patriotism, but it is equally important that we give back to them just as they have given to us. Veterans Day is a good day to reaffirm our commitment to ensuring economic opportunity, affordable housing, education and job training, and good healthcare for our military men and women, veterans, and their families."
