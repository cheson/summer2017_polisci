Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that seven grants totaling $1.25 million are being awarded to regional planning councils and their municipalities under the state's Regional Performance Incentive Program with the goal of improving regional efficiency and helping municipalities cut costs.

The program, administered by the Office of Policy and Management, provides grants to regional councils of governments, economic development districts or groups of two or more municipalities that coordinate functions and services on a regional basis.

"Regional cooperation makes government more efficient, lowers costs and ultimately saves taxpayer dollars," Governor Malloy said. "The communities involved have come together to coordinate and plan efforts that will benefit their communities without driving up property taxes. These are examples of collaborations that provide local services to meet the needs of residents in a smarter, more efficient and less expensive way."
