Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the public health emergency declared in the City of New Haven overnight due to a string of heroin overdoses:
"This is a very dangerous situation and one that we are taking seriously. Everyone must recognize that no region of the country, state, city or town is immune - this affects all of us and so many families across our state and nation. That's why we have been doing everything in our power to stop this epidemic and prevent tragedy, including the recent passage of a series of legislative actions addressing this situation.
"I've been in touch with Mayor Harp and have pledged whatever support the state can provide. That includes ensuring the continued availability of Narcan for first responders and others in the city who are in need of administering this life-saving medication. We must continue to fight this - together."
