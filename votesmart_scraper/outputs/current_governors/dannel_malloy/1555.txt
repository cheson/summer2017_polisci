Connecticut is prepared for a short-term federal government shutdown if one occurs, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said Wednesday.
In a written statement, Malloy said he asked key state officials to assess how a shutdown would hurt state services. Based on responses, he said, he determined the state could withstand a 2- to 3-week shutdown with no disruptions.
Malloy said he has formed a task force to create a contingency plan in case a shutdown lasts longer.
"Connecticut residents won't notice a disruption in services or operations for a temporary shutdown, but anything longer than three weeks, and there is a real concern about our ability to continue to deliver vital state services," Malloy said in the statement. "My office is in contact with the offices of our representatives in Washington -- all of whom are working to ensure our federal government does not shut down -- and we will prepare a contingency plan."
