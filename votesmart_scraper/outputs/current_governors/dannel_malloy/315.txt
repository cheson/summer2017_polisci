Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Department of Correction (DOC) Commissioner Scott Semple today joined state officials and advocates at a ceremony to open the newly established Veterans' Unit of the Cybulski Reintegration Center in Enfield. Created as part of the Governor's Second Chance Society initiative, the specialized unit specifically targets inmates who have served in the United States military, providing tailored services specific to their needs while addressing barriers to successful reentry. The new housing unit, which holds 110 veteran inmates, aims to reduce recidivism, lower crime, and save taxpayer dollars. The initiative is part of a broader shift to recognize that when it comes to criminal justice and successfully reducing recidivism, one size does not fit all.
"We need to change our approach in the criminal justice system - and by tailoring services within our prison walls, we can lower crime outside of them. We are indeed taking a smarter, more pragmatic approach. Too many of our veterans end up mixed into the criminal justice system following their return to civilian life. While incredibly heartbreaking, it is critical that we provide the support services to address the unique needs of our veterans," Governor Malloy said. "Our Second Chance Society initiatives are game changers so that we can prevent recidivism and eliminate a long-term cycle of crime and poverty. Tailoring our approach - instead of using a one-size-fits-all formula - gets to the core of systemic issues. This initiative is a major one."
