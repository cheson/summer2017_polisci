A New Race
As we're all aware by now, the Democratic gubernatorial primary field has narrowed by a third, with the exit of Susan Bysiewicz.
Susan and I had a good conversation yesterday, and after speaking with her I know that her dedication to the people of Connecticut remains as strong as ever, and that she will continue to serve our state well.
In the now two-way primary, I believe there is an exceptional opportunity for a substantive, open, and exciting dialogue over the great issues of our day. Connecticut faces serious challenges that demand serious attention. Connecticut's middle class has steadily lost ground. Property taxes are a burden too great for many to bear. Connecticut is last in the country in job growth. It's time for a change.
As I run for governor, I travel the state and see the wealth of talent we possess. We have the potential to be on the cutting edge - to lead. What has been missing is a governor who's not just a maintainer of the status quo, but a leader with the courage and vision to do more. I look forward to the primary ahead, I look forward to meeting the voters on the campaign trail, and I look forward to making Connecticut the comeback state!
