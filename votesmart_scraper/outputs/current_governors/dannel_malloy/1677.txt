Dan Malloy Speaks To The Citizens Of Woodstock
As I travel around the State campaigning for Governor, the first thing most people want to know is, why am I running? I am running for Governor because I believe in the possibility of government, when run openly and well, to make a positive and lasting difference for people and the communities they love. It's that belief that gets me out of bed in the morning. That's at the core of why my wife Cathy and I have dedicated more than two decades to public service.
I have been honored to serve the people of Stamford for over 11 years. We have turned the city into a nationally recognized model on many fronts, from education, the environment and crime fighting to economic growth and fiscal integrity. We turned Stamford around by working together toward a common vision of a community where people and employers want to live, work, play and raise a family. As Governor, I can do the same for all of Connecticut.
When I am Governor I will be clear about our commitment to Eastern Connecticut. For too long, "the Quiet Corner" has felt left out in the state government process. The most important thing I can do as Governor is to be a real partner with the communities in your part of the State Â— to help you plan your future, and to help reconnect your residents with their government. My plans for universal healthcare, as well as for property tax and education reform, will have direct and immediate impact your towns (you can read more about those plans at my website, www.danmalloy.com).
I will also tell you that I am proud to have the support of elected officials from the Northeast corner of our State. People like State Representative Shawn Johnston (Killingly/Putnam/Thompson), State Representative Michael Cardin (Ashford/Tolland/Willington), and Town Chair Mary Oliver (Hampton). Their kind support has given me invaluable insight and understanding of your beautiful communities.
These are exciting times for my campaign. After winning the Party's endorsement in May, we now look forward to what will no doubt be a close primary on August 8th. I hope that I can count on the support of Woodstock residents as we run an energized race in that primary, and all the way to the general election.
