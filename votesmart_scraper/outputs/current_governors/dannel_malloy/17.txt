Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding a bipartisan vote in the Connecticut House of Representatives this afternoon to adopt legislation he introduced that will reform the state's pretrial justice system to help break the cycle of crime and poverty:
"Today's vote by the House is an important next step in creating a fairer and more equitable criminal justice system. It also serves as further proof that Connecticut is leading the nation in criminal justice reforms. Across the country, courts are ruling the current system of bail is unconstitutional. This legislation brings us into compliance with those rulings. The fact is that there are hundreds of individuals currently locked up in Connecticut jails, not because they are threat to society, but simply because they are poor. And being poor should never be a crime.
"We are grateful for the bipartisan support in the House, for Representative Tong's leadership, and for the many advocates who have been working alongside our administration in support of this legislation, including the members of the Connecticut Sentencing Commission. I urge the Connecticut Senate to act swiftly and pass this important piece of legislation."
The legislation is House Bill 7044, An Act Concerning Pretrial Justice Reform. It next moves to the State Senate for consideration.
