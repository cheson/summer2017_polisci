Governor Dannel P. Malloy today signed a proclamation declaring Friday, December 21, 2012 a "Day of Mourning" in the State of Connecticut and requesting that residents statewide participate in a moment of silence at 9:30 a.m. The Governor is also requesting houses of worship and government buildings that have the capability, to ring bells 26 times during that moment in honor of each life that was taken at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

"Let us all come together collectively to mourn the loss of far too many promising lives at Sandy Hook Elementary School," Governor Malloy said. "Though we will never know the full measure of sorrow experienced by these families, we can let them know that we stand with them during this difficult time."

Governor Malloy has also written a letter to every governor in the United States, asking each state to consider joining the State of Connecticut on Friday during this time of reflection and mourning.

"Mourning this tragedy has extended beyond Newtown, beyond the borders of Connecticut, and has spread across the nation and the world," Governor Malloy said. "On behalf of the State of Connecticut, we appreciate the letters and calls of support that have been delivered to our state and to the family members during their hour of need."
