Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he has signed a proclamation calling the Connecticut General Assembly to convene in a special session at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, December 8, 2015, in order to enact legislation that will improve Connecticut's business climate, amend the state constitution to ensure that transportation dollars are only spent for those purposes, and ensures that state spending aligns with revenues as well as making long-term structural changes.
"After over a month of bipartisan dialogue with a healthy exchange of ideas, I believe there is more that unites Democratic and Republican leaders than divides us. We all want what's best for the State of Connecticut. While there might be some outstanding disagreements, we must set a deadline for action, and date and time for a special session. And while there may be some policy differences, I'm urging both sides to work collectively to resolve them by Tuesday," Governor Malloy said. "We must act collectively to tackle our short-term budget issues, make structural long-term changes to our policy, pass tax reform to help make Connecticut's business climate one of the strongest in the region, and ensure that money set aside for our long-term transportation vision is spent for that purpose."
