Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that 13 municipalities across Connecticut are being awarded $5 million in grants to develop or improve town commercial districts in an effort to attract small businesses, grow jobs, and improve pedestrian access and livability in town centers. The grants are part of the state's Main Street Investment Fund, which is administered through the state Department of Housing.

"These grants are a great way for the state to support our cities and towns in their efforts to develop and improve their commercial centers," said Governor Malloy. "This program responds to the unique needs of individual communities all around the state by creating partnerships with local governments and merchants to improve aesthetics and pedestrian access, attract new businesses, new customers, and new residents -- ultimately breathing new life into our smaller commercial centers."

The Main Street Investment Fund provides financial incentives to eligible municipalities as well as owners of commercial private properties for expenditures that directly support and enhance a qualified project. Awards are no more than $500,000 and can be used for expenses such as building improvements, signage, lighting, and streetscape improvements.
