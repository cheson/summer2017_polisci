Connecticut will receive nearly $3.9 million from the federal government to develop innovative job-training programs focused on regional and industry-specific collaborations, the state said Friday.
The announcement came one day after the state said it added 6,400 jobs in May and the unemployment rate fell to 6 percent, the lowest in seven years.
The money from the U.S. Department of Labor is part of more than $138 million being awarded to 27 states and the Cherokee tribal nation through the Sector Partnership National Emergency Grant program, the federal government said. The grant will be used to connect unemployed workers to a range of services, including job search assistance, apprenticeships and career planning.
It will also allow the state's five workforce investment boards, including the Northwest Regional board, to work with local businesses, community colleges, chambers of commerce, trade associations and other local organizations to determine which specific skills and training are needed to create a "sustainable long-term pipeline of workers for these sectors," the state said.
"As we anticipate the needs of emerging industries that offer viable employment opportunities, the funds will provide employment services to unemployed workers and connect them to new jobs," Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said in a statement. "Ultimately, we're working every day to ensure that residents have the skills necessary to attain a job for the business needs of today."
