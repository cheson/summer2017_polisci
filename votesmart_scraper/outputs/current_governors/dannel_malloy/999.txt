Governor Dannel P. Malloy on Wednesday morning released the following statement regarding the state's first-time use of Election Day registration in yesterday's municipal elections:

"The positive response from both town officials and voters to yesterday's first-time use of same-day registration is exactly why this change is so important -- it helps ensure that all citizens have a voice in their government. While the exact numbers are still being reported by town registrars, it appears that the new law was utilized by hundreds of voters in towns across Connecticut. Improving voter turnout and participation means ensuring people have fair access to the ballots, and I'm glad that Connecticut is moving in this encouraging direction."
