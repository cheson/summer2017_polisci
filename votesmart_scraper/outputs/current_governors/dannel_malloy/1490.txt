Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy was named chair of the National Governors Association (NGA) Natural Resources Committee by NGA Chair Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman and NGA Vice Chair Delaware Governor Jack Markell.

"While the cost of energy continues to rise -- straining family budgets and putting our fragile economic recovery in jeopardy -- we must do more to explore different avenues and move toward a clean, green energy future," said Governor Malloy. "As a nation, we must continue to advance the clean energy technologies that are the future of job growth and economic expansion. I am honored to chair the Natural Resources Committee and work towards balancing the needs of our economy with the stewardship of our land and resources."

The Natural Resources Committee has jurisdiction over energy, agriculture, the environment and natural resources issues. Members of the committee ensure that the governors' views are represented in the shaping of federal policy.
