Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement this evening in response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address:
"Tonight, President Obama unveiled a clear agenda to help middle-class families and rebuild our nation's aging infrastructure.
"Right now, we are seeing the best period of private sector job growth in decades. In Connecticut, with over 75,000 private sector jobs created over the last four years, we have witnessed the fastest growth since the 1990s. We must continue to build on that momentum so that all of our citizens benefit from the economic recovery as we lay a foundation for a strong middle class for generations to come.
"President Obama tonight proposed ideas that will amplify and enhance what we're doing in Connecticut. We implemented paid sick leave and increased the minimum wage, while our economy has responded with strong private sector job growth. We've been successful with our "Go Back to Get Ahead' program, helping our workforce earn college degrees to fill good-paying jobs for the future. But, with our partners in the federal government, there is even more to do. I commend the President on his agenda and urge Congress to work with him, find common ground, and act in the best interest of all Americans.
"We must put petty partisanship aside in Washington and act now. The middle class can't afford to wait any longer."
