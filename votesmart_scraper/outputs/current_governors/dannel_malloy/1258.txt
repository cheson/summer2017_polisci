Gov. Malloy on State Board of Education Approval of First Commissioner's Network School Turnaround Plans
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Aug. 9, 2012
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on the State Board of Education's unanimous vote today to approve the first Commissioner's Network school turnaround plans submitted by Bridgeport's Curiale School, Hartford's Core Knowledge Academy at Milner School, New Haven's High School in the Community, and Norwich's Stanton School.

"This is about beginning to fix what's broken in our public schools by directing more resources to our students and making other meaningful changes that will help us close the nation's largest achievement gap. For too long, we failed to bring about meaningful reform in our struggling public schools, especially those in the lowest performing districts. Thanks to the comprehensive, bipartisan education reform bill that the legislature passed and I signed earlier this year, those days are over.

"In just this first year, we have both a union-led and a charter school-led turnaround plan. The diversity in these approaches proves that we can take different roads to reform, but ultimately reach the same destination.

"I want to thank everyone from Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven and Norwich who worked so hard on putting these plans together, and the State Board of Education for their unanimous approval.

"This is work that will benefit our children -- work for which they will one day be proud."
