Location: Hartford, CT

Today at 5:00 p.m., Governor Dannel P. Malloy will hold a news briefing at the State Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in Hartford to provide updates on the state's preparations for tonight's forecasted winter storm and severe cold outbreak. The Governor is also partially activating the EOC beginning at 4:00 p.m.

Following a call today with the state's unified command, the Governor has asked the Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security to communicate with municipal leaders on the importance of finding shelters for at-risk members of their communities. The state is also coordinating transportation services to locate those in need of shelter and bring them to designated facilities.

"Partially activating the State Emergency Operations Center will allow us to quickly respond to any problems that may arise and coordinate any resources that may be needed across the state as we head into the height of the storm tonight," Governor Malloy said. "In addition to the winter storm, we are also warning residents to be prepared for a severe cold weather outbreak. Yesterday, I directed the Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security to work with our social services agency to activate the state severe cold weather protocol which enables us to help our most vulnerable populations access sheltering. If you are in need of a shelter, please call 2-1-1."
