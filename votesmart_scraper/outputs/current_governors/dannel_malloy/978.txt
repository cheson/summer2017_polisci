Governor Dannel P. Malloy this afternoon issued the following statement in response to the release by the Office of the State's Attorney for the Judicial District of Danbury of its report on the investigation of the December 14, 2012, shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School:

"My thoughts today are with the people who lost a loved one at Sandy Hook Elementary School, as they have been nearly every day since the tragedy. The release of this report will no doubt be difficult on them. But if there is one thing that I believe we must do, it's that we must honor the lives that were lost by taking steps to protect ourselves from another horror like this. I hope that the information in this summary and in the supporting documents that will be released by the State Police takes us closer to that goal."
