MALLOY CALLS UPON RELL TO TAKE ACTION ON ETHICAL LAPSES
Stamford -- Dan Malloy, Democratic candidate for Governor and Stamford's Mayor, today released the following statement on the Chief State's Attorney's Office announcement that it was closing its investigation of Governor Rell's chief of staff and various cabinet members:
"The closing of the criminal investigation into Governor Rell's administration does not answer, still, some troubling questions about ethics. Those questions center on Rachel Rubin, Governor Rell's Special Counsel for Ethics Compliance, and her role in Governor Rell's administration. Specifically, we now know that Governor Rell's chief of staff, Lisa Moody, was told by Rubin that it was inappropriate for her to do what she did prior to her doing it, and Moody went ahead and did it anyway. When Governor Rell issued a press release touting the creation of the special ethics counsel, she said, 'Rubin's work will make it absolutely clear that everyone serving in the Office of the Governor and all of the Executive Branch agencies will adhere to the highest ethical standards when conducting the state's business. This appointment will guarantee a constant and serious focus on the spirit as well as the letter of all ethics laws and regulations.' It's imperative the Governor establish a culture of compliance within her own administration. The question for Governor Rell is exactly what role Rubin has in the Executive Branch if the Governor's own chief of staff was ignoring her counsel, and what has Governor Rell done to fix a clear breakdown in her administration's ethical infrastructure besides sending her chief of staff on a two week hiatus over the holidays."
