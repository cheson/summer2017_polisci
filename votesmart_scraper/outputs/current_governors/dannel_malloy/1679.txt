NEW LONDON, Conn. -- Overshadowed for weeks by a fierce U.S. Senate primary that's drawing national attention, Democratic gubernatorial candidates Dan Malloy and John DeStefano tried to rally primary voters and differentiate themselves Tuesday night.
Both appeared in a debate sponsored by The Day of New London and the League of Women Voters at the Garde Arts Center in New London and broadcast live on WTNH-TV, three weeks before the primary.
While the two candidates agreed on a number of issues, such as a need to change Connecticut's education funding system, they tried to sell themselves as the right Democrat to defeat Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell in November.
DeStefano, the mayor of New Haven, said in his opening remarks that he was running for governor to "get things done for working people."
"For the last two years, Connecticut has been hobbled by a governor with no vision and no ability to get things done," DeStefano said. "And I'm motivated by a set of values that say that people who work hard ought to be able to do better for themselves and their kids, and the government has a responsibility to see that that happens."
