Governor Dannel P. Malloy during the coming days is scheduled to hold meetings with several international companies to discuss the economic development benefits of doing business in Connecticut.
"Connecticut has the best educated, most talented workforce in the world - and that makes our state one of the best places for aerospace companies to expand and thrive," Governor Malloy said. "In our 21st Century, global economy, we must reach out to the leading corporations and let them know that Connecticut is ready and willing to do business with them. It is our responsibility to let the world's top aerospace companies know that Connecticut is a prime place to grow and expand."
On Saturday, June 13, the Governor will arrive in Dublin, Ireland, where he will meet with executives from Irish airline Aer Lingus to discuss the possibilities of adding a direct, transatlantic flight from Bradley Airport in Windsor Locks to Dublin.
On Sunday, June 14, and Monday, June 15, the Governor will visit Paris, France, during the biennial Paris Air Show, where he is scheduled to hold meetings with executives from aerospace companies headquartered both in Connecticut and throughout the world, including United Technologies Corporation, Kaman, MB Aerospace, Pietro Rosa, Embraer, Cobham, Boeing, and GKN Aerospace, who will be at the air show to showcase their offerings.
On Tuesday, June 16, at the invitation of the Vera Institute of Justice, the Governor will visit Berlin, Germany for an opportunity to meet with some of the country's top criminal justice officials and tour a prison in the city. The Governor's visit will give him an opportunity to discuss his "Second Chance Society" initiatives and criminal justice reforms with the German officials and discuss best practices for high-risk offenders.
He is scheduled to return to Connecticut on Tuesday night.
Governor Malloy is one of nearly a dozen Governors from throughout the United States who will be attending the Paris Air Show on economic development missions. His travel to Ireland and France is being funded through the Department of Economic and Community Development, and his travel to Germany and back to the United States is being paid for by the Vera Institute of Justice.
