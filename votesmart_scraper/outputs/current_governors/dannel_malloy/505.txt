Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Tenet Healthcare Corporation today released the following joint statement:

"After more than two years of working toward an arrangement under which a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare Corporation, in partnership with the Yale New Haven Health System, would acquire four hospital systems in Connecticut, we regret to announce that we have decided to end our discussions. We believe it is best for the hospitals, their employees and the communities they serve to move forward exploring other options."

Governor Malloy said, "The environment for both providers and state government is complex and rapidly changing. Unfortunately, the issues that separated us simply could not be overcome. We will continue to work with the hospitals, the affected communities, and our colleagues in the legislature to come up with smart, creative solutions that will preserve local access to care for all patients."

Trevor Fetter, president and chief executive officer of Tenet Healthcare Corporation, said, "While Tenet is disappointed with the outcome, we wish the hospitals, local community leaders and Governor Malloy the very best in their effort to build a sustainable future for these and other hospitals in the State of Connecticut."
