Governor Dannel P. Malloy today joined the Connecticut State Police Command Staff at the graduation ceremony for 83 new State Troopers, all members of the 123rd Training Troop.

"Today's graduation ceremony represents our commitment to law enforcement. It means more than 80 additional troopers will be keeping our communities and residents safe and I am honored to congratulate each and every one of these graduates for earning the title of State Trooper," said Governor Malloy.

"The duty of public safety is a 24/7 responsibility, meaning our first responders are often away from home and their loved ones," continued the Governor. "The families of the graduates have made and will continue to make tremendous sacrifices, and I want to also thank them for their support."

Commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, Reuben F. Bradford, and Colonel Danny R. Stebbins, Commander of the State Police, presided over the graduation exercises. Commissioner Bradford, who announced his retirement last month, administered the oath of office to the new Troopers. Governor Malloy gave the keynote address and thanked Commissioner Bradford for his service to the state. Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman also gave remarks and offered congratulations to the new Troopers.

The 123rd Training Troop has been in training since June 2013. This graduating class spent over 1,400 hours in the classroom and many more hours training in physical conditioning, water rescue, driving and other specialized areas of police work. The new Troopers will next report to their State Police assignments, where they will complete their training with field training Troopers.
