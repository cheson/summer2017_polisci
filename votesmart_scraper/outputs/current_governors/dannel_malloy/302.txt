Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements regarding the order announced today by Defense Secretary Ash Carter to open all military occupations and positions to women, without exception:
Governor Malloy said, "Women deserve not just equal pay, but equal rights. We cannot - and should not - place artificial, archaic, gender-based boundaries around a woman's desire to protect our freedoms and defend our nation. Patriotism and love of country is simply not determined by gender. Opening all combat jobs to women is a major step forward that is long overdue - not only for women who serve in our military, but for women everywhere. I want to applaud Secretary of Defense Carter and President Obama on this important step."
