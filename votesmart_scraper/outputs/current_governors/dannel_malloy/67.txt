Gov. Malloy Statement on Federal Court Order Blocking Travel Ban
Statement

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to a federal court ruling blocking implementation of President Trump's executive order regarding refugees and immigration:
"During his campaign, President Trump repeatedly pledged to ban Muslims from entering the country, and since taking office, his administration has spent countless hours trying to do just that. When the first executive order failed, the administration did not turn its focus on strengthening the system they believe needs fixing. Instead, they doubled down on their efforts to contrive yet another executive order that is clearly intended to target a single religious group. The American people know better and are better than this. Our system of government instills a measure of checks and balances to protect individuals from harassment and discrimination -- and the court's action today does just that. I commend all states and individuals who are standing up to such blatant acts of discrimination."
