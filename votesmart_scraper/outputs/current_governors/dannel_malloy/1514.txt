Statement

"While Juneteeth is a day marking the liberation of slaves in Galvelston, Texas in 1865 -- two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Lincoln -- it also serves as a day to reflect upon the continued struggle for equal rights and opportunities for us all. Indeed we must also take the time to reflect upon the contributions African Americans have made to Connecticut and our country, and celebrate their rich heritage. I join in celebration and remembrance with those who are committed to reflecting upon our history and ensuring continued work towards equality and justice for everyone."
