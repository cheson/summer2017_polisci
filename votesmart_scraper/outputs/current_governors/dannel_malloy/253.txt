Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that - in accordance with a proclamation from President Barack Obama directing flags to be lowered to half-staff in honor of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia - U.S. and state flags in Connecticut will fly at half-staff beginning immediately until sunset on the day of interment.
"Justice Scalia served the Court - and the nation - honorably. While we may have disagreed politically, what is unquestionable was Justice Scalia's dedication to America. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family," Governor Malloy said.
