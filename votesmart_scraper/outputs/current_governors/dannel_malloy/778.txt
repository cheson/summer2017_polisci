Governor Dannel P. Malloy today applauded the State Senate's approval of a bill he introduced that prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes and other devices to minors and strengthens Connecticut's anti-smoking laws.

"Connecticut should move swiftly to adopt laws that keep tobacco products out of the hands of our young people," Governor Malloy said. "I applaud the Senators who voted for this bill, and especially want to thank Senate President Williams, Senate Majority Leader Looney, and Children's Committee co-chair Senator Bartolomeo for their leadership on this critical issue that will reduce tobacco use and tobacco-related illnesses and help keep our youngsters healthy."

The Governor's Senate Bill No. 24, An Act Concerning the Governor's Recommendations Regarding Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems and Youth Smoking Prevention, seeks to enhance the state's efforts to prevent tobacco use among minors by banning the sale of e-cigarettes and other vapor products to minors, reducing the number of tobacco retailers who commit repeat offenses by implementing a tobacco prevention education program for first-time offenders, cracking down on the sale of loose cigarettes, and investing in tobacco prevention and cessation efforts.

The legislation, approved this afternoon in the Senate by a vote of 35-0, next moves to the House for consideration.
