Governor Dannel P. Malloy said today that the budget agreement reached with House Speaker Brendan Sharkey and Senate President Martin Looney will help transform Connecticut's infrastructure, which is in disrepair due to massive underinvestment.
The budget deal will add billions of dollars for a historic investment in our infrastructure aimed at making Connecticut's system best-in-class. Connecticut loses billions of dollars annually in economic output as a result of our aging infrastructure, and every dollar spent on our infrastructure yields net cost benefits. Without investment agreed upon in the budget - a half a percent off the sales tax, which is remaining flat at 6.35% - our transportation system will continue to deteriorate.
ROADS AND BRIDGES
In Connecticut, there are 3,734 route miles - or 9,834 lane miles - of state roadways.
Roughly 35% were built before 1950, with 44% built between 1950 and 1980, and just 21% build since 1980.
47% of state roadways are in less than good or excellent condition.
If current funding remains constant, 30 years from now 71% of our roads would be in less than "good" or "excellent" condition.
Of the 4,006 bridges and structures maintained by the state, 334 are in "poor" condition. Nearly a third of state maintained bridges were built prior to 1950, and just 21% were built since 1980. A majority of existing bridges were built with a 50-year structural design life, while those built today have a 75-year structural design life.
