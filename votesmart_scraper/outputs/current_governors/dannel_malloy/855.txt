Governor Dannel P. Malloy said today that 22 additional cities and towns have received road salt this week under a Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) program that was recently set-up to replenish municipal salt supplies diminished over a harsh 2013-14 winter season. As of this morning, more than half of Connecticut's municipalities have now benefitted from ConnDOT's salt distribution program.

"With another storm predicted late this weekend, we want to make sure that our cities and towns are prepared," said Governor Malloy. "This vital program, pulled together by the DOT on very short notice, has resulted in the delivery of more than 17,000 tons of salt to nearly 100 towns and other entities across the state."

Due to previously planned salt deliveries and contracts, ConnDOT has had no difficulty maintaining adequate salt supplies and continues to be in a good position for the remainder of the winter season. Last weekend, the state received 45,000 tons of salt that was delivered to the Port of New Haven by International Salt.

In addition to local public works garages, salt has also been delivered to several state colleges and universities, rail lines and the Mashantucket and Mohegan tribal nations. The following list includes the 22 municipalities that received road salt this week:
Ansonia
Bolton
Brooklyn
Durham
E Hampton
E Windsor
