Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to the release of the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for November 2014. The monthly report shows:

Connecticut saw a net increase of 4,700 private sector jobs in November 2014
Since January 2011, the total number of private sector jobs in the state has increased by 76,000
The state's private sector has recovered 92% of the jobs that were lost during the Great Recession
Employee hours and earnings have increased over the last twelve months, with a 1.8% increase in the average weekly hours worked and an increase of nearly $60 in average weekly earnings
The labor force participation rate, currently at 1,898,752, has increased over the year by 2.8%.

"This report is another positive sign that we are making progress in our effort to create good paying jobs with good benefits for residents," said Governor Malloy. "Labor force participation is up. We are seeing growth in nearly every sector of the economy. And the private sector in particular has almost completely recovered the jobs lost during the recession. While these are positive signs, it is critical that we work to make the changes that lead to even greater positive growth. I won't be satisfied until everyone who wants a job has one. And during the upcoming session of the state legislature, I am hopeful that we can do more to work together and reinvent Connecticut in order to create jobs for the 21st Century economy."
