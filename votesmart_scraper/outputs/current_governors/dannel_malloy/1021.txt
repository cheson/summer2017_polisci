Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in advance of an expected vote in the U.S. Senate and House to reopen the federal government and temporarily increase the government's statutory borrowing authority:

"While I am pleased that an agreement to end the shutdown has been reached, the fact remains that this is no way to run a government. We simply cannot go from one manufactured crisis to the next, and that's all this deal does -- put off the hard choices until a later date, so we can go through this nonsense again next year.

"The decision in Washington by House Republicans to abdicate their responsibilities as elected officials in order to pursue a fringe ideological agenda has very real implications for states and for the families that live in them. The sad truth is that those most in need are the ones most directly impacted, as we saw in Connecticut when vital Head Start facilities in Bridgeport and across the state unnecessarily faced closure. Republicans in Washington need to get the message -- they are elected to govern, not to score political points on the backs of those they're supposed to serve. I wish I could say that I am optimistic that a lesson has been learned, but the truth is I'm not.

"I do want to thank every member of our Congressional delegation for their work in seeing us through this crisis. We are fortunate to have good and decent public servants working on our behalf in Washington."
