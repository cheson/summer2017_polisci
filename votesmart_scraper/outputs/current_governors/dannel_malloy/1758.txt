FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Harvard Grad Gerard McGeary Brings Global Vision to the Mix
Democratic Gubernatorial candidate Dan Malloy, Stamford's Mayor, announced today that R. Gerard McGeary, Jr., a former Associate with The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) specializing in global business strategies, has agreed to ply his talents for the duration of the 2006 Connecticut gubernatorial campaign.
An honors student at Harvard who graduated in 2004 with a B.A. in Government, McGeary recently left The Boston Consulting, a top-tier management consulting firm that develops strategic and operational solutions for Fortune 500 companies. BCG focuses on both internal, logistical matters as well as external, market-wide issues as part of its overall strategy of improving its clients' competitive position.
"Gerard is an exceptional young man and I am proud to have him join my team," said Malloy. "It is gratifying to have a person of his caliber believe in my vision for Connecticut and work with me to make that vision a reality."
