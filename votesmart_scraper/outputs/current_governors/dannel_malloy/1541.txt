Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement after the Connecticut House of Representatives passed the FY12/FY13 Biennium Budget.

"With the passage of this budget by the Democrats in the House of Representatives, coming on the heels of yesterday's passage by the Senate, Connecticut has taken another important step toward much-needed fiscal stability. In particular, I want to thank Speaker Chris Donovan, Majority Leader Brendan Sharkey, Appropriations and Finance Co-Chairs Toni Walker and Patricia Widlitz, and the other 79 Democrats who had the courage to make this vote. As I said yesterday, I know it's a tough vote -- it's also the right vote. This budget is balanced, honest, and contains none of the gimmicks that helped get us into this mess. It will provide the stability we need to foster much-needed job creation -- which is everyone's top goal.

"Now it's up to my Administration to reach an agreement with our fellow state employees and to present it to the legislature for ratification. I remain hopeful that we'll get there. If we don't, I remain committed to presenting an alternative budget to the General Assembly in the next couple of weeks.

"Make no mistake: come July 1, Connecticut will have an honest, balanced budget in place. No smoke, no mirrors. A solid foundation for the future."
