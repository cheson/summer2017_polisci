Governor Dannel P. Malloy will partially activate the state's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at midnight tonight to monitor storm conditions across the state and prepare for the heavy snow forecasted to begin overnight and continue into the late afternoon Wednesday.

"After speaking with emergency management officials and assessing the current forecast, I am calling for the partial activation of the EOC tonight to better coordinate a rapid response to any problems that may arise during the height of the storm," said Governor Malloy. "Beginning early tomorrow morning, this storm is forecasted to produce very heavy snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain causing low visibility and deteriorating driving conditions. I am urging everyone to exercise caution if they must travel tomorrow."

Total snowfall is currently forecast to range from 4" -- 6" along the coast, 5" -- 9" across most of the state and up to 12" in the Northwest Hills. The Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) is also coordinating with the state's utilities regarding their preparedness for this storm in the event power restoration is needed.

The EOC will be staffed with representatives from DEMHS, Department of Transportation, Department of Public Health, Division of the State Police, Connecticut National Guard, and Fire/Rescue Coordination.
