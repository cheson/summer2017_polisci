Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that his request for a major disaster declaration with snow assistance for federal aid in connection with the January blizzard for New Haven County has been approved by President Barack Obama. President Obama has now approved Governor Malloy's entire disaster declaration request for the January blizzard.
"I would like to thank President Obama for approving this disaster declaration for New Haven County. This declaration, coupled with the earlier approval of New London, Tolland, and Windham Counties will provide much needed financial assistance to the state and to the municipalities hardest hit by the January blizzard," Governor Malloy said. "I also would like to thank Connecticut's Congressional delegation for their advocacy and support in securing this declaration."
On April 8, 2015, President Obama approved a major disaster declaration for New London, Windham, and Tolland Counties. This declaration will provide federal aid to Connecticut state agencies, eligible non-profit organizations, as well as municipalities in New Haven, New London, Windham, and Tolland Counties, and also the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nations, to help pay for eligible costs incurred as a result of the January blizzard at a 75 percent reimbursement rate.
All counties and the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nations in Connecticut are also eligible to apply for assistance under the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which provides assistance for actions taken to prevent or reduce long-term risk to life and property from natural hazards.
