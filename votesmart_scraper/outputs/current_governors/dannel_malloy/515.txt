MATTHEWS: Wow. Dan Malloy, of course, is governor of Connecticut and
Jason Samenow is with me here in Washington. He`s "The Washington Post`s" weather editor.
Governor, I am completely on the side of politicians who play it safe. You
know, better safe than sorry, we`re told when we`re 3 years old, and I
think after blasting the hell out people like Lindsay over the years and
Michael Bilandic (ph) out in Chicago, and of course, Mayor Barry down here,
and the new mayor down here because she got 1 inch wrong, basically, in her first action as mayor-- it was-- it was two inches of now, rather than one. She didn`t have the plows out, so she got blasted for that. And now people are out blasting people like Cuomo and de Blasio.
I don`t want to blame them. And by the way, Christie ought to just keep
quiet. Attacking the media`s the dumbest thing I ever heard of. We didn`t
create the weather reports. They come from the weather bureau. Anyway,
your thoughts?
(LAUGHTER)
MATTHEWS: Is it better to be safe than sorry?
GOV. DANNEL MALLOY (D), CONNECTICUT: Well, I agree with you. It is. You know, I`ve been through a bunch of these, Irene and Superstorm Sandy and unbelievable weather storms. We had on 40 inches February 13th in parts of our state. You should always err on the side of caution and safety.
That`s why I closed our highway system down at 9:00 o`clock last night.
But it also allowed us to clean up a lot quicker than we otherwise would
have been able to do. You learn as you go along in these things, and you
always should err on the side of safety.
And listen, let me say this to the meteorologists. Thank you. You know,
you`re giving us the best information you have available. We need to act
on it as leaders. It`s not just public safety, although that has to be the
largest portion. It`s about how quickly you can recover after the fact, as
well.
You know, I`m sitting here listening to you talk about Worcester. You
know, I played a lot of rugby against Holy Cross when I was at Boston
College. I have a nephew and a niece who live on Nantucket. He`s an
orthopedic surgeon out there. And of course, I was a prosecutor in New
York City.
These are vital places. They have-- the people deserve to be protected.
That`s our job. That`s what we get elected to do.
MATTHEWS: Let me go to our expert here right now from "The Washington
Post." Jason, how good is weather-- I mean, I never-- my mom used to stay up all night waiting for the weather. I said, What are we, farmers? We`re going to-- I still have to go to school. Dad`s got to go to work. Why do we check the weather? But people do it out of-- how good is-- what is it,
50 percent right, 70 percent right? I mean, how do you--
JASON SAMENOW, ``WASHINGTON POST``: Well, I think it`s a lot better than that. I mean, weather forecasting has made tremendous progress over the last few decades. For example, about three decades ago, a three-day
forcast three decades ago is as accurate-- a one-day forecast is a lot more
accurate than a three-day forecast was several decades ago.
MATTHEWS: Really?
SAMENOW: Yes.
MATTHEWS: I think you meant to say that backwards. A three-day forecast
is better than what a one-day--
SAMENOW: Yes, exactly.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: I get it. So but were there two models out there last night for
the politicians to look at, the governors and the mayors, like Governor
Malloy? Were they looking at two possibilities or a range of possibilities
or what? What led Governor Cuomo to shut everything down at 11:00 o`clock last night?
SAMENOW: Right. So there was a lot of differences in the various weather
models that we look at. Some forecasts were showing up to three feet of
snow in New York City. Some were showing closer to a foot. And I think
what politicians did--
MATTHEWS: It`s 8.
SAMENOW: Yes, I know.
MATTHEWS: Eight inches.
SAMENOW: I know. The models were wrong. They-- our science is improving, but sometimes, especially when storms-- we`re right on the edge of a storm, the modelds can be just a little bit off. And it was a difference of just about 60 miles. Eastern Long Island got almost 30 inches of snow, whereas New York City just got 8. So that`s a very fine line.
And so it`s a really tough call for forecasters in that situation. So what
forecasters were doing, they were looking at this information and telling
the officials, that, Look, this could be really bad. We could get up to
three feet of snow in New York City, crippling the most populous city in
the entire U.S.
MATTHEWS: So what`s going to be the message to figure politicians, when
Lindsay made a fool of himself, and so did Bilandic out in children and
Marion Barry for the hundredth time? Is the message going to be now, Be
careful, don`t be on the too cautious side, Governor? Or is it going to be
the message of--
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: --better be smarter than you are? Nobody`s smart enough to
predict the weather. You just admitted it. You can`t predict the weather.
You can`t. You can`t.
MALLOY: You can`t, but I`ll point something out to you real quickly. They
actually had the type of snow right this time. They told us what it would
be and that it would be a lighter snow and there`d be a lot more wind
pushing it around, and that sort of thing.
Listen, err on the side of public safety. You`re going to get blamed for a
lot of things as a mayor. I was a mayor for 14 years. They`re going to
forget that you kept them safe, and they got mad about that. They`re going
to remember if you don`t pave the road, if you don`t plow the street, if
you don`t pick up the garbage. Those are the things that people remember
on election day.
MATTHEWS: Why do politicians wear those-- what do you call them, foul-
weather gear costumes, when they`re inside? I`m just-- I was watching
Cuomo the other day, Governor, and every-- you`ve got your shirt, your tie
missing, that`s fine. But every-- they look like they`re off the Grand
Banks, the George (ph) Banks. They`rek, like, out there catching fish.
All they`re doing is walking outside for a few minutes for a presser and
they dress accordingly. It just-- is this to identify with the people,
identify with the working guy out there who`s shoveling snow? What is it
about, the costuming?
MALLOY: It`s-- well, first, the people who are home watching, you know,
that`s how they`re dressed. I suppose that`s part of it. I`ll also tell
you, it`s fun. I mean, you know, we got to wear ties all the time and to
have an excuse not to wear a tie is not such a bad deal.
MATTHEWS: Yeah, I thought Governor Cuomo should have had a harpoon with him last night. Anyway, thank you, Governor Dan Malloy. Congratulations. We rooted for your reelection. We`re glad the people chose you again, sir.
Thank you.
MALLOY: Thank you.
