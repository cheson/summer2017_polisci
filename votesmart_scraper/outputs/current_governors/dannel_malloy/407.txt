Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statements in response to the release of the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for May 2015.
The monthly report shows:
Connecticut's private sector employers added 6,600 jobs during the month of May 2015.
Connecticut has reached a new milestone that it hasn't seen in four decades. With 1,921,768 workers, our state has the largest labor force since 1976. May 2015 marks Connecticut's 20th consecutive month of labor force growth.
The unemployment rate has dropped to 6.0% - the lowest point since August 2008 and a drop of two tenths of a percent since last month.
When compared with May 2014, private sector employers in the state have increased employment by 24,600 jobs over the year.
"This jobs report is yet another validation of our progress - because of our efforts, Connecticut's economy is growing, job numbers are steadily improving, and employment is reaching heights that it hasn't in decades. We are no doubt making progress as we work today to deliver a brighter tomorrow for the residents of our state," Governor Malloy said. "Our efforts are focused on delivering long-term growth and prosperity, and we are committed to continuing our efforts to move Connecticut forward, because we believe everyone in our state who wants a job should have one."
"This is very encouraging news for Connecticut's labor force and our businesses," Lt. Governor Wyman said. "These numbers represent declining unemployment, more workers in the job market, and more jobs created throughout the state. But most importantly, today's announcement speaks to the strong partnerships we are building in the business community and the commitment we've made to residents through expanded job training and employment programs."
