Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement regarding the release of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 100-Day Action Plan:

"During a meeting in my office in February, I asked the MTA to pull together this plan so that riders can get a clear sense of what they're doing to restore confidence in the railroad. While it's taken longer than I would have liked, I think they are taking a number of steps that will enhance the daily operations and make the railroad safer. But even with these changes, the MTA has much work to do to improve their performance.

"Even though the MTA held direct commuter forums in the state as I asked them to do, there is much more to do to implement a comprehensive and enhanced communications protocol with their customers and local officials. My administration will continue to work with them and to provide resources when appropriate so that riders can get the service they deserve.

"It's my hope that this report will hold the railroad accountable to the commuters they serve."
