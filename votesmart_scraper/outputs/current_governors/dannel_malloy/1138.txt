Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on the Next Generation Connecticut and Bioscience Innovation Act initiatives passing out of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee earlier today:

"I would like to commend co-chairs Senator John Fonfara and Representative Patricia Widlitz and members of both parties on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee who are helping to move our state forward with their support of the "Next Generation Connecticut' and "Bioscience Connecticut' legislation. I also thank the many business leaders, chambers of commerce, and labor leaders for their work and support of these initiatives.

"Historically, Connecticut has enjoyed the distinction of being the birthplace of ideas and invention, leading the world in patents and groundbreaking advancements in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. By making the investments called for in these two pieces of legislation, we will take steps to regain our standing as a leader in innovation and make our state an attractive place to invest, work and do business."

Next Generation Connecticut, which was endorsed by more than 100 corporations, trade and labor groups, local businesses, and other entities concerned with strengthening the state's economic development and job creation efforts, is Governor Malloy's proposal to greatly expand educational opportunities, research, and innovation in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines at UConn over the next decade. Earlier this year, Governor Malloy also proposed the Bioscience Innovation Act which, over ten years, will establish a $200 million fund to strengthen Connecticut's bioscience sector.
