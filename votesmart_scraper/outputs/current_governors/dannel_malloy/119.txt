Gov. Malloy Statement on November Jobs Report
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for November 2016.
Preliminary numbers show that Connecticut added 2,100 jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell four-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent -- the lowest level the state has seen since October 2007.
"Provided that these estimates hold, the state's unemployment rate hasn't been this low in nearly a decade. This is positive news and we remain determined to continue to move in a direction that will encourage businesses to grow their employment base here in our state and attract out-of-state companies to move within our borders. One of the ways we are going to accomplish this is by creating more structural stability within our state finances in order to create more predictability for businesses," Governor Malloy said. "I am committed to ending decades of bad financial practices in order to get the state's fiscal house in order -- this has been long overdue and we've made enormous progress on that front over the last several years, but there is more to be done. I look forward to working with our partners in the business community during the coming legislative session on giving Connecticut the predictability we need to make smart investments and continue creating good paying jobs with good benefits for the residents of our state."
