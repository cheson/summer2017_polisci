Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement urging a three-week cooling-off period for Red Cross workers and management.

"These workers have been without a contract for three years and this has been a long and difficult negotiation.

"It's understandable that emotions are high on both sides and tempers occasionally flare.

"But in the interest of the public health of our state, workers, and management, I am urging both sides to agree to a three-week cooling-off period in order to facilitate a fair agreement. I believe this approach is particularly important right now given the challenges our entire state is facing as we continue to recover from this devastating storm."
