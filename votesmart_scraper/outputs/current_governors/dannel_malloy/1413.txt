Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced a proposal to continue the process he began last year to downsize state government. The Governor said the state agency consolidations announced today will allow state government "to continue to get smaller, leaner, and more effective."

"Last year we began the work of changing how the state does business--making government smaller, less costly, and easier to navigate," said Governor Malloy. "Like companies and families across the state and the country, state government must do more with less. This session we are continuing the effort to ensure government is working as efficiently as possible."

In his first year in office, Governor Malloy reduced state agencies by 30 percent through mergers and consolidations -- going from 81 separate line-item state agencies to 59. Today's announcement reduces that number to 52.

The Governor will submit legislation in February detailing these proposed consolidations.
