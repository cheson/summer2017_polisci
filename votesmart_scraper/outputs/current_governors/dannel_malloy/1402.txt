Gov. Malloy Proposes Eliminating 25 State Boards and Commissions to Reduce Overlap, Shrink Government
Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced a proposal to eliminate 25 of the state's 258 boards and commissions to which he can make appointments to reduce overlap and shrink the size of government.

"Over the years when these boards and commissions were first created by statute, most of them served a worthwhile purpose for their time, however many either no longer fit today's needs, or their functions can be or already are served by another state body that already exists," Governor Malloy said. "It's incumbent upon us from time-to-time to review and reconsider whether these state boards and commissions are still serving their original purpose, are duplicative, or have completed their tasks."

Governor Malloy continued, "For example, the Quinebaug & Shetucket Rivers National Heritage Corridor Advisory Committee completed its required mission over a decade ago but it's still in our statute books. The tasks of the Bi-State Farmington River Watershed Advisory Committee are being performed by the Farmington River Coordinating Committee. And shorthand reporters are already required to pass a national exam, so there is no longer a need to have a separate overlapping State Board of Examiners of Shorthand Reporters."

Governor Malloy stressed that the proposal is a first step in reviewing existing state boards and commissions. His administration will continue to look into ways to streamline government, including eliminating and merging additional boards and commissions in the future.

The list of boards and commissions Governor Malloy proposes to eliminate includes:
* Adult Literacy Leadership Board
* Advisory Committee for the Center of Real Estate and Urban Studies (UConn)
* Advisory Committee for William Benton Museum of Art
* Bi-State Farmington River Watershed Advisory Committee
* Board of Directors of the Lower Fairfield County Conference/Exhibit Authority
* Child Daycare Council
* Commission on Innovation and Productivity
* Computer-Assisted Mass Appraisal Systems Advisory Board
* CT International Trade Council
* CT Israel Exchange Commission
* CT Progress Council
* CT Public Transportation Commission
* CT Risk Assessment Board
* Geospatial Systems Information Council
* HealthFirst Connecticut Authority
* Housing Advisory Committee
* Innovations Review Panel
* Medical Inefficiency Committee
* Nurturing Families Network Advisory Commission
* Quinebaug & Shetucket Rivers National Heritage Corridor Advisory Committee
* Small Business Air Pollution Compliance Advisory Panel
* Southwest Corridor Action
* State Board of Examiners of Shorthand Reporters
* Statewide Community Antenna Television Advisory Council
* Student Financial Aid Information Council

In addition to the 25 eliminations, Governor Malloy is also proposing two mergers, including the Commission on Uniform Legislation into the Connecticut Law Revision Commission, and the Special Contaminated Property Remediation and Insurance Fund Advisory Board into the Brownfield Remediation Liability Workgroup.

The proposal will be included in the legislative package Governor Malloy will introduce for the upcoming 2012 regular session of the General Assembly.
