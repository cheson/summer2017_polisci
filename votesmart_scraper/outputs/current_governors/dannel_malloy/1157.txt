Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the exclusion of the assault weapons ban in the gun control legislation that is pending before the U.S. Senate:

"While I'm disappointed by this news, and I continue to believe that an assault weapons ban on the federal level is the best course of action to improve public safety, this does nothing to deter our efforts to pass comprehensive gun violence prevention in Connecticut. I will continue to advocate strongly for the common sense guns safety reforms I've proposed, including a stricter assault weapon ban. I plan to continue working with our State Legislature to make those proposals a reality, and to help make Connecticut communities safer."
