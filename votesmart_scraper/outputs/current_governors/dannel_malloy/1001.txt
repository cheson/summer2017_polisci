Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement in response to the state Public Utilities Regulatory Authority's (PURA) preliminary decision to approve the expansion of natural gas service across Connecticut:

"The action today by utility regulators is great news for Connecticut consumers. Part of our plan to provide cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy is to expand natural gas service to people who are interested in lowering their energy costs.
