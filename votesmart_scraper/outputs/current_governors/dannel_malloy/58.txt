Gov. Malloy and Lt. Gov. Wyman Statements on Equal Pay Day

Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statements to recognize Equal Pay Day:
Governor Malloy said, "In this day and age it is unacceptable for women -- doing the same work and making the same valuable contribution -- to earn less than a man for no reason other than being female. The gender wage gap negatively impacts our economy, puts a burden on households, and most of all, is morally wrong. In Connecticut, we are working every day toward ensuring that workers receive the fair wage that they are owed and have earned. Our economy depends on it, and women deserve it."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "Equal pay for equal work is fundamental to a just society. The gender wage gap is a persistent injustice that harms today's working women -- and damages the generations of women coming up behind us. Wage equality benefits the economic security of our workforce and their families. It also speaks to our core values as Americans -- and that we recognize the impact of women's work on our global competitiveness. No matter their gender, the world we leave to our children and grandchildren should pay them equally for equal work."
