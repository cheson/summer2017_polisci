Statement

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court decision on President Obama's immigration plan:
"In Connecticut, we appreciate the immense value that immigrants bring to our communities. We have acted to ensure that undocumented students in our state are able to access in-state tuition at our institutions of higher education, not only because it is the right thing to do, but because we recognize that it makes us stronger.
"The Supreme Court's failure to issue an opinion addressing President Obama's executive actions on immigration is deeply disappointing and stalls the efforts for the millions of undocumented immigrants that are already here. The deadlocked decision further demonstrates how the Republican Senate's refusal to fulfill its constitutional duty to consider the President's nominee is preventing the court from functioning fully - and preventing access to justice. I urge Senate Republicans to do their job and give Judge Merrick Garland's nomination all due consideration."
