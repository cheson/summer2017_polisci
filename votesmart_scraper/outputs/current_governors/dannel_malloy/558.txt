Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) has resurfaced 305 two-lane miles of roadways this construction season -- about 63 miles more than during the 2013 construction season. The additional mileage was the result of an extra $11.9 million state investment in ConnDOT's road program made last spring and marks the third consecutive year of increases in road resurfacing since Governor Malloy took office.

"Since taking office, we have been serious about our commitment to maintaining and upgrading our roads and bridges by making smart, strategic investments to bring our transportation infrastructure into the 21st Century," said Governor Malloy. "This includes increasing funding and mileage for Connecticut's road resurfacing program which has been especially important considering the harsh winter seasons we have experienced recently. We will continue making these investments in all aspects of our transportation system because doing so drives growth, economic development and job creation while improving overall quality of life for our residents."

In total, ConnDOT spent $68.9 million on road resurfacing this year - compared with $57 million for 242 two-lane miles last year -- resulting in the creation or retention of nearly 2,000 construction-related jobs. ConnDOT typically does between 225-250 miles annually and is responsible for the maintenance of more than 4,100 miles of roads and highways throughout Connecticut.

"We work hard to keep Connecticut roads and highways in a state of good repair and I'm pleased that we could add the additional miles this year well in time for the winter snow and ice season," said ConnDOT Commissioner James P. Redeker. "Jobs and economic growth depend on a safe and reliable transportation network -- and that requires consistent, sustained investment."

The majority of Connecticut's capital resurfacing and related projects are completed under the Vendor-in-Place (VIP) resurfacing program. VIP refers to a contract in which the vendor supplies all materials, labor and equipment to perform a work function or project. The most common VIP paving contract is one in which the vendor supplies the asphalt, paving equipment, trucking and labor and the state pays for the services by the ton in place.
