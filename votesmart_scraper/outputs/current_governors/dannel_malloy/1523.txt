Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: June 6, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on Senate passage of Senate Bill 1243, An Act Concerning Connecticut's Energy Future.

"This bill represents a strategic new approach to our state's energy policy that will reduce future energy costs and decrease our dependence on fossil fuels. The fact that this bill enjoyed bipartisan unanimous support speaks to the will of our legislators to address the detrimental impact high energy costs have had on families, business and industry, and our overall economy. With the creation of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), the state's approach to energy will work in tandem with our efforts to protect the environment, to strengthen the economy, improve our renewable energy portfolio and expand the clean energy sector and related jobs in Connecticut. Specifically, I'd like to thank the legislature's Energy Chairs and Vice-Chairs, Senators Fonfara and Duff and Representatives Nardello and Reed, Ranking Members, Representative Hoydick and Senator Witkos, and the LCO drafting attorneys who stayed through two nights to make this bill a reality. I thank the Senate for passing this bill, and I urge the House to do the same and put Connecticut on track to a smarter energy future."
