Malloy Comments On Campaign Finance Proposal

Stamford Mayor and Gubernatorial Candidate Dan Malloy spoke in favor of the campaign finance reform proposal announced today by Senate President Don Williams and House Speaker Jim Amann, urging Governor Rell to sign the legislation once it is passed.
"I'm pleased that an agreement has been reached, and I think all the people involved in forging that agreement deserve a tremendous amount of credit," said Malloy. "The proposed legislation represents landmark reform for Connecticut, and has been embraced by several groups well-known for their advocacy and expertise on this issue. While I continue to believe that all the reforms proposed today, including public financing of elections, could go into effect immediately, the proposal made today nonetheless represents a crucial step. I urge the Governor to accept the proposal and sign the legislation once passed."
Malloy, whose gubernatorial campaign had raised $1.7 million as of October 30th, has previously stated that he would return all contributions if a system of public financing were adopted for the 2006 election cycle. "I support public financing 100%. In fact, I have advocated immediate public financing of campaigns for constitutional offices, including the 2006 Governor's race. But the proposal announced today represents a significant step forward, and there is absolutely no reason for the Governor to reject it."
