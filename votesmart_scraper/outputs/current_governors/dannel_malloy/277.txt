Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement this evening in response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address:
"Tonight, President Obama delivered a powerful message - we are at our strongest when we work together. When we put common sense and the best interests of people first, we thrive.
"I am proud to stand with the President tonight because our state has an amazing story to tell over the past several years. The things happening in Connecticut - our efforts to prevent gun violence, to raise the minimum wage, to be the first state to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 and pass paid sick days, to sweeping criminal justice reforms - are being recognized. We are acting when other states are not, and we are on the cutting edge of emerging policy trends. We have embraced much of President Obama's agenda - and we have been successful as a result.
"The President showed tonight that we have accomplished much as a nation over the past seven years, and that the future looks even brighter as a result.
"It was an honor to be with the First Lady and President this evening. It was extraordinarily humbling, and I cannot thank them enough for the honor."
