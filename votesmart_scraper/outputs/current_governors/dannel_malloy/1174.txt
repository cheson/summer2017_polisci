Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) Commissioner Daniel C. Esty today issued the following statements applauding President Obama's nomination of Gina McCarthy to serve as the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

"During her tenure as Connecticut's Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, Gina McCarthy was a fierce advocate of the state's natural resources--her legacy of environmental protection continues to this day in the programs spearheaded by DEEP," said Governor Malloy. "Connecticut's loss has undoubtedly been the country's gain--Gina's tireless work to improve air quality and slow climate change has made an important impact in Washington and across the globe. I applaud President Obama on her nomination."

"We are confident that as the EPA Administrator, Gina will once again roll up her sleeves to tackle the tough national and global environmental challenges that we are facing," said Commissioner Esty. "Gina was widely credited with reinvigorating the environmental agenda in Connecticut, modernizing DEP, and engaging young people in environmental protection through the innovative No Child Left Inside program. Her extensive knowledge and strong skills will serve her well in her new position--and she will bring to the job a special sensitivity concerning issues facing Connecticut and New England."
