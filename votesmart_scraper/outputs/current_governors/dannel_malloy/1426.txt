Gov. Malloy's Education Workshop to Focus on Bold Ideas and Solutions for School Reform
Press Release
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Jan. 4, 2012
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced the agenda for Thursday's Education Workshop, which will combine experts, school administrators, teachers and other stakeholders to share ideas on how the state can confront the need to return Connecticut to a position of preeminence in education.

The workshop will help shape education reform proposals Governor Malloy will introduce during the upcoming 2012 regular session of the General Assembly, which begins in February.

"We should not and will not accept half-measures and repackaged versions of the status quo," Governor Malloy said. "Working with Commissioner Pryor, we will craft legislation that is potent enough to make Connecticut a national leader in narrowing the achievement gap, and comprehensive enough to set the stage for a restoration of Connecticut as a model for creating academic excellence for all."

The event, held at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, will feature a keynote address from U.S. Department of Education Under Secretary Martha J. Kanter.
