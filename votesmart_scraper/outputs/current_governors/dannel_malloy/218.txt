Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statements regarding joint guidance that was released today from the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice to help provide educators with the information they need to ensure that all students, including transgender students, can attend school in an environment free from discrimination based on sex.
Governor Malloy said, "Discrimination, harassment, and bullying have no place in our classrooms and at our schools. Every child, no matter their gender identity, should be treated equally and fairly in a safe, supportive environment. I want to applaud the Obama administration - this guidance will help give educators the tools they need when setting a school policy that provides a safe learning environment for all. While some espouse and support division, we believe in inclusiveness, and we believe that diversity makes us stronger."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "All students should have the opportunity to high-quality, safe schools that respect and inspire them as learners and as young people. I commend President Obama and the Departments of Education and Justice for issuing specific guidelines to protect the civil rights - and human rights - of transgender students. The strength of our communities, our workforce, and our nation lies in our young people, modeling integrity and equality is the right thing to do."
