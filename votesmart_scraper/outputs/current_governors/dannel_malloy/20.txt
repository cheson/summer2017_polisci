Gov. Malloy Statement on State Senate Approval of Yet Another Insurance Mandate
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to action taken by the State Senate early this morning, whereby Senate Bill 586 was amended with language that effectively adds yet another mandate onto insurance carriers, which will raise the cost of health insurance for consumers:
"Yet again, the State Senate turned a deaf ear on the insurance industry and completely disregarded informed input on this topic. By amending Senate Bill 586 -- which is a laudable bill and one that I support -- with a brand new mandate, the end result will mean higher premiums for customers both on and off the exchange. In short, they took a good bill and essentially sank it. It's a shame for Connecticut consumers, and it's an inexcusable action by policymakers who continue to disregard the perspective of major employers in the state. This lack of awareness and blatant disdain for the insurance industry's expertise and concern for their customers is infuriating and needs to stop. For my part, let me be absolutely clear -- it will be very difficult for me to sign my name onto a bill that will raise insurance premiums without first enacting my proposal calling for a comprehensive insurance mandate review. I seriously question whether the legislature understands the impact that their actions have on the rising costs of healthcare."
