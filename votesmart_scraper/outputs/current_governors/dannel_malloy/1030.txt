Gov. Malloy Statement on United Technologies Announcement
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Oct. 2, 2013
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to the announcement by United Technologies this afternoon that they will be forced to furlough thousands of workers, including nearly 2,000 Sikorsky workers beginning on Monday, if the shutdown is not resolved.

"This is what happens when House Republicans decide that political gamesmanship is more important than people's jobs. It's unconscionable that so many working families would be unfairly put in this situation. The people of Connecticut, and of the entire United States, deserve better. Once again, I call on House Republicans to stop this irresponsible behavior and pass a clean continuing resolution that funds the government, keeps people at work, and doesn't threaten to undo the important progress that's been made toward economic recovery."
