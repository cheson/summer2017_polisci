Statement

Location: Hartford,CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements in response to the United States Supreme Court's rejecting a challenge to Connecticut's assault weapons ban:
Governor Malloy said, "During tragic times, we acted. When we saw wrong, we did what was right. After enduring a moment as a state that shook our collective conscience and jolted the soul, we banded together and stood up for common sense. We passed one of the toughest, one of the smartest gun laws in the nation. As today shows, common sense has prevailed.
"We appreciate the Supreme Court's action today. It should be a demonstration to states across the nation that commonsense gun laws not only work, they are Constitutional. We must stand up against mass shootings. We cannot sit idly by and watch tragedy after tragedy, horror after horror. We have the ability to act - the question is whether or not elected officials have the will.
"We are safer today because of our gun laws, and I thank the Supreme Court for recognizing that states can be smarter about how we sell guns and what kinds of guns we sell, and that those commonsense steps do not infringe on Constitutional rights. Now, it is incumbent upon Congress to do what's right and follow Connecticut's lead in embracing basic steps regarding guns - like universal background checks - that the vast majority of Americans support."
Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said, "Connecticut is proud to have passed some of the strongest gun laws in the nation, laws that have wide support among our residents, and that have withstood legal challenge. Connecticut stood up for our residents, and it's time for Congress to stand up for the American people. I applaud the Supreme Court for their action today."
