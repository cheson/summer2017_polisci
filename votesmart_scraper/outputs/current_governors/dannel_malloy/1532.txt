Gov. Malloy: Paid Sick Leave Bill Represents Good Public Policy
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement applauding Senate passage of paid sick leave for service workers.

"I applaud the 18 senators who voted for this bill. This piece of legislation is a reasonable compromise that represents good public policy. It exempts industries where appropriate, it ensures that the benefit won't be abused, and most importantly, it protects public health. It shouldn't be the case that people who are frontline service workers -- people who serve us food, who care for our children, and who work in hospitals, for example -- are forced to go to work sick to keep their jobs. It's my hope that the House of Representatives will take up this piece of legislation, pass it, and I can sign it into law."
