Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: June 7, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement upon final passage of Senate Bill 1243, An Act Concerning Connecticut's Energy Future:

"The House of Representatives, and in particular Representatives Nardello and Hoydick, should be commended for the quick action they took passing the energy bill unanimously approved by the Senate on Monday. They know, as I do too, that the rising cost of energy has negatively impacted Connecticut families and businesses, and we need to strategically approach our energy policy if we are to bring relief to either. This legislation has multiple benefits for policymakers and for ratepayers--positioning us to bring down the high cost of energy, as well as bolstering job growth and innovation in our renewable energy sector. This is an important step toward protecting consumers from volatile oil market price swings while creating the clean energy jobs that will ensure we compete in the new energy economy."
