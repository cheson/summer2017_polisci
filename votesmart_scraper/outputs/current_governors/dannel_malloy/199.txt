Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements in response to the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision today regarding capital punishment:
Governor Malloy said, "Several years ago, Connecticut joined more than a dozen other states and the majority of the industrialized world in replacing capital punishment with the punishment of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Today's decision reaffirms what the court has already said: those currently serving on death row will serve the rest of their life in prison with no possibility of ever obtaining freedom.
"In the last half century, Connecticut has only executed two inmates, both of whom volunteered for that punishment. Capital punishment is an emotional issue, and my opposition to it arose after many years as a prosecutor, then as an attorney, and finally as a public servant. Opinions on this issue vary, and it's critical that we respect that diversity of perspectives. These are deeply personal and moral issues that we as a society are facing and the court has once again ruled on today.
"Our focus today should not be on those currently sitting on death row, but with their victims and those surviving family members. My thoughts and prayers are with them on this difficult day."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "This is an important affirmation, one that furthers Connecticut's work to ensure our criminal justice system is effective and that it protects the public it serves. I echo Governor Malloy's comments - our hearts are with the victims and survivors today."
