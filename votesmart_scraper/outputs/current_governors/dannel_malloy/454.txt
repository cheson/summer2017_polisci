Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to the release of the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for March 2015.

The monthly report shows that Connecticut gained 4,000 nonfarm jobs during the month. Connecticut has now added 27,100 jobs over the year.

"This is no doubt good news, and no doubt a reflection of the smart choices we've made to make the future brighter for thousands of residents," Governor Malloy said. "Jobs numbers are improving, our economy is growing, and our strategy is working as we make more progress. Last year, we added more jobs than at any time since 1998, and we are on pace to continue that progress. We are constantly working to put Connecticut on a path for success for both the next fiscal quarter and the next quarter century, and this jobs report shows that Connecticut is poised to continue making progress in both the short and long-terms."
