Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the resignation of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius:

"I thank Kathleen Sebelius for her service as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Few in Washington have had a harder job these past five years than Secretary Sebelius, but she has been tireless working on behalf of all Americans, whether to improve access to quality affordable health insurance, expand mental health services, or promote public health. Throughout her tenure, she has been a good friend to the State of Connecticut, and I wish her and her family all the best in future endeavors."
