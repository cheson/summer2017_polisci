Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Health Care Act:

"This is a tremendous day for all Americans. The Supreme Court has taken a historic stand with the Affordable Care Act -- this decision demonstrates that the nation will do the right thing in ensuring accessible, affordable health care for all Americans. With SCOTUS validating the law, Republicans in Congress should cease their efforts to repeal the reforms and instead join President Obama in focusing on job creation. In Connecticut, we've been leading the way on this issue -- we never stopped working, and today's decision is an affirmation of everything we've worked so hard to prepare. Now let's make sure we continue to implement this historic, positive change."
