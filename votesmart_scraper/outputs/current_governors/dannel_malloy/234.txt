Gov. Malloy Bans Non-Essential State-Funded Travel to Mississippi Due to State Law Endorsing Discrimination
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he is banning non-essential state-funded travel to Mississippi, following that state's enactment of a discriminatory law that allows businesses and nonprofit groups to refuse service to people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.
The state-funded travel ban falls under Executive Order No. 45, signed last year after Indiana enacted similar legislation.
"Government should be in the practice of eliminating discrimination - not embracing it. This law in Mississippi is an active attempt to discriminate against the LGBTQ community. We, as a state, cannot stand for that," Governor Malloy said. "I am proud of Connecticut's continued advancement of equality for all residents. Our state prides itself on our diversity. We celebrate it. And we are a stronger, better state as a result. This law, however, is simply rooted in backwards thinking and backwards values. That's why we're taking action."
