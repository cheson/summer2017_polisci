With the Sentencing Commission meeting today, Governor Dannel P. Malloy urged the General Assembly to adopt Second Chance 2.0 legislation he introduced that builds upon reforms approved last year, which are designed to continue reducing the state's decreasing crime rate, as well as ensure nonviolent offenders are successfully reintegrated into society.

"Connecticut must continue to lead - and we must continue to strive to be a society invested in permanent reform instead of permanent punishment. Across the nation, both Republicans and Democrats are changing their approach. We must do away with the failed policies of the past and move towards the future," Governor Malloy said. "Our next step is Second Chance 2.0, and reforming our approach to juveniles while making our bail system fairer. These reforms will continue our efforts to whittle away and end the cycle of poverty, crime, and prison that plague so many of our communities. We should all aim to be on the right side of history on this issue."
