Governor Dannel P. Malloy issued the following statement regarding today's release of the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for March 2012, which indicates that the state's unemployment rate decreased for the eighth consecutive month to 7.7 percent -- the lowest unemployment rate in three years and half of a percentage point below the national average.

"While I'm certainly pleased that our unemployment rate continues to decline, we still have a long way to go in this growing recovery. The fact remains that if you don't have a job, the unemployment rate is basically 100%.

"State government is working to help improve this situation. From the Small Business Express Program to the innovative incentives designed to spur new hiring, the policies we've enacted are beginning to pay dividends. But we have a lot more work to do."

January 2011: 9.3%
