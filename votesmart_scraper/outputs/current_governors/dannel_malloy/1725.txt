Dan Malloy For Governor Launches First Delegate-Only Website

Category: Campaign News
Customized site offers advice to help convention delegates manage process
Signaling another break through in gubernatorial cyberspace campaigning in Connecticut, Democratic candidate for Governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's four-term mayor, launched the first ever website page dedicated exclusively for delegates to the Democratic State Convention on May 20. Dubbed the Convention Survival Guide, it is devoted entirely to the needs of Democratic Convention delegates and helps them navigate the challenging and sometimes confusing State Convention process.
"Political conventions are exciting, but they can also be confusing and stressful," said Malloy. "If there is a way to lessen the stress, improve communications and have a little fun along the way, then that's what we're going to do."
The site offers several useful features -- general logistical help, venue and staff contact information, links to other related websites, tips and advice for surviving the event, and a printable Convention scorecard to help track the day's voting. The site even boasts a Convention countdown clock to remind delegates of the fast-approaching event.
"My candidacy is about reaching out, thinking outside the box and offering solutions," Malloy added. "We want to connect with people in a very real way and meet them where they live. For delegates it's all about the Convention. If we can provide these committed Democrats with good information and a more memorable experience, then we've accomplished our goal."
