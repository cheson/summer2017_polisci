Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced the release of the second of two $30 million installments of Town Aid Road funding for cities and towns across Connecticut - a total of $60 million statewide. The funding continues an increased amount for municipal purposes, which prior to the Malloy administration had received lower amounts ranging from $12.5 million to $30 million.
In addition, an allocation of $68.9 million has also been approved to cover the costs associated with resurfacing state roadways this year. The state's road paving program will begin in earnest on April 1, the traditional start of the construction season in Connecticut. This year, it is anticipated that at least 250 two-lane miles of roads throughout the state will be repaved.
"In Connecticut, we are in the middle of a critical conversation on what we need to do to build a best-in-class transportation system that provides residents and businesses with real solutions for problems that the state can no longer put off," Governor Malloy said. "Providing our towns and cities with increased funding for local transportation projects is an important part of these efforts."
Under the Town Aid Road program, municipalities can use the funding for a variety of purposes, including construction of maintenance of highways and bridges, snow removal, the trimming and removal of trees, the installation of traffic signs and signals, and for providing and operating essential public transportation services and related facilities.
"Investments in our transportation network are key to Connecticut's future competitiveness," Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said. "This funding is part of a larger strategy to strengthen our transit system, to expand mass transit options, and to make commerce more efficient. It speaks to our overall commitment to Connecticut's economic growth and our workforce."
"Our towns appreciate this funding and can use it to supplement their own local budgets," Department of Transportation Commissioner James P. Redeker said. "It is important that this funding is in place now, so that towns can plan for the road work they need to begin this spring."
The Governor is continuing his efforts this legislative session to adopt a constitutional amendment that creates a transportation fund lockbox to ensure that money dedicated for transportation is only used for that purpose.
Funding for both the Town Aid Road grants and statewide road paving were approved at last Friday's meeting of the State Bond Commission.
