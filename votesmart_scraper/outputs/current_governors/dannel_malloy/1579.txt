Location: Hartford, CT

After a conference call with Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) staff and key commissioners, Governor Dannel P. Malloy ordered the state's Emergency Operations Center within the State Armory to be opened at 11 p.m. this evening. Governor Malloy also held a 4 p.m. call with Connecticut towns to discuss the impending storm and flood precautions related to it. While currently there is light rain falling in western Connecticut, heavier rain is forecast to arrive in the state later this evening and tomorrow morning, and the entire state is under a flood watch.

"We've already seen some flooding in areas across the state, and the rain we're expecting to get over the next 24 hours or so is a concern," said Governor Malloy. "We're asking that any remaining snow pack you may have on your property or surrounding areas be moved away from storm drains and check to make sure your roofs are clear, as well. We're monitoring the situation and if any coordinated response is needed, our state is ready and prepared to act."

The EOC will be staffed with representatives from the Departments of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, Public Safety, Environmental Protection, Transportation, Correction, Public Health, the Military Department, the State Fire Coordinator, the American Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
