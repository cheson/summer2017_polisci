"The Connecticut State Veterans Memorial serves as an enduring tribute to the high regard that we hold for the more than 1.3 million Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen from Connecticut who have served our state and our nation since the Revolutionary War," Governor Malloy said. "Our state has a deep military history, and over 200,000 veterans continue to call Connecticut home today. The opening of this memorial in our capitol city will provide all of us with a special place to honor those who have served, those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, and those who continue their courageous work around the world today."
