Press Release
By: Dan Malloy
Date: July 1, 2016
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy urged residents to be safe during the July 4th weekend. With the recent attacks that occurred in Turkey earlier this week, the state, the Connecticut Intelligence Center, and its partners at the local, state and federal levels are continuing to monitor domestic and international information. Should residents witness any suspicious behavior, they should report it.
"The new normal is continuous vigilance. At the state level, we're doing just that. But the public is a critical partner to law enforcement, so as the saying goes, if you see something, say something," Governor Malloy said. "There are currently no credible threats to Connecticut, but we can never be complacent. That's why this July 4th weekend, we are urging all residents to be aware of their surroundings, report questionable behavior, and notify law enforcement authorities immediately if they witness any suspicious activity."
Connecticut's Homeland Security Tip Line can be contacted via telephone at 1-866-HLS-TPS (1-866-457-8477), via email at ctic@ct.gov, and via the web at www.ct.gov/demhs/sar. If immediate attention is necessary, people should call 9-1-1 and inform the operator about what they saw and what struck them as concerning.
