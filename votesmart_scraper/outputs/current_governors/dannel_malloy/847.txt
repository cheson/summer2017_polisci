Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement on the situation in Ukraine:

"In this moment of crisis, Connecticut stands with the people of Ukraine. Many in the Ukrainian diaspora have made Connecticut their home over the last century, and from them we have come to appreciate the long struggle of Ukraine to free itself from foreign subjugation. The Ukrainian people have spoken loudly and clearly: Ukraine must remain an independent nation, a transparent democracy and a part of Europe."
