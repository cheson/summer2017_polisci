Press Release
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Sept. 18, 2014
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to the release of the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for August 2014:

"For the seventh consecutive month, we are seeing the private sector do what we need it to do -- add jobs. The unemployment rate is at a 5 year low, and we've added nearly 60,000 private sector jobs since 2011. All of these are positive signs of progress but we still have more work to do. I've said it before, but I'll say it again -- until every resident who wants a job has one, our work is not done."
