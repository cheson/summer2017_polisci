Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the votes in each of the four legislative caucuses to select their respective leaders for the upcoming term in office:
"I want to congratulate the legislators in each of the four caucuses in the House and the Senate who were selected by their respective bodies to serve in leadership roles during the coming term in office. Throughout my experience here, we've come together across party lines time and again on many important issues, and I am confident that this bipartisan, productive collaboration will continue. We must remember that public service is about giving back to our communities and ensuring the results of our cooperative work makes our state and our neighborhoods a better place. I look forward to meeting with legislative leaders from both parties in the weeks ahead as we begin discussions on how we can move forward together in order to deliver the best results for all the people of our state."
