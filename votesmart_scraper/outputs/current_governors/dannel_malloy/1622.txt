After a full day of meetings, including one with his agency commissioners, Governor Dannel P. Malloy will attend President Obama's State of the Union speech this evening as a guest of Congressman John Larson.

Prior to flying back to Connecticut tomorrow morning, Governor Malloy will meet with a candidate for the Department of Transportation commissioner position, as well as Congressman Joe Courtney, to speak about the challenges, issues and concerns about Route 11 and other transportation matters in the southeastern part of the state.

"I'd like to thank John Larson for extending to me an invitation to join him at the State of the Union speech this evening," said Governor Malloy. "I am eager to hear President Obama's agenda for creating new jobs and getting our nation's finances back in order; two of the very same goals I am working on here in Connecticut. Bright and early tomorrow morning, I'll be meeting with a candidate for the Department of Transportation commissioner position and having breakfast with Congressman Courtney to talk about Route 11 and other transportation issues in his district. While I'd like to stay longer and meet with other members of our delegation, there's more snow in the forecast for later in the day on Wednesday and it's important that I get back to the state."

Leaving in the early evening on Tuesday, Governor Malloy will be back in the state by late morning on Wednesday.
