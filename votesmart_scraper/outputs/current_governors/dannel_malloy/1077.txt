Gov. Malloy Applauds U.S. Supreme Court Decision on Marriage Equality
Statement

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on marriage equality:

"The Supreme Court today reaffirmed the core principles of our country -- that all people are created equal and have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

"Although the State of Connecticut has recognized marriage equality for same-sex couples since 2008, a discriminatory federal law known as DOMA prevented these legally married couples from being recognized by the U.S. government, thus being denied a host of rights that are afforded to all other married couples.

"Having two different sets of laws for people based solely on their gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity is wrong, and that's exactly what the Supreme Court recognized today. Simply put, today's ruling comes down to equality, and when equality wins, we all win.

"With this ruling, I implore every state to give full faith and credit to valid same-sex marriages. Every Connecticut resident deserves to have their marriage recognized as they travel among the states for work, vacation and family visits. A marriage should not be a right that you gain and lose on a road trip across the country.

"My wife Cathy and I proudly join with all of our friends, both gay and straight, to celebrate today's ruling and its recognition of justice for all."
