Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the mass shooting earlier today in San Bernardino, California:
"This is yet another heartbreaking situation, and yet another day during which families are holding their breath hoping - and praying - that their loved ones are coming home. And it's our most vulnerable communities who are suffering today. Unnecessary gun violence is plaguing America, and we must step up and act to protect our neighbors, our families, and communities across the nation.
"We are mourning for the San Bernardino community, for the families who lost loved ones, and those with loved ones who've been victimized. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families on this day and the first responders and others who will be impacted by these events. I have spoken with Governor Brown to express our condolences.
"In light of today's events, we will have enhanced State Police patrols at DDS facilities out of an abundance of caution. Our hearts are with this community tonight."
