Governor Dannel P. Malloy commended the passage of legislation in the Connecticut State Senate today that increases the minimum wage in the state by 75 cents per hour over a two-year period to a total of nine dollars per hour.

"This change will make it just a little easier for working people in our state without adversely impacting the business community," Governor Malloy said. "Studies have shown that increasing the minimum wage is one of the best ways to get children out of poverty. In addition, some of our neighboring states have recently begun transitioning to nine dollars per hour and I believe it is time for our state to move in that direction as well. I am hopeful that this legislation will advance through the House during the coming days and I look forward to signing it into law when it reaches my desk."

The legislation is Senate Bill 387 -- An Act Increasing the Minimum Fair Wage. It now advances to the House of Representatives for consideration before it can move to the Governor's desk for his signature.
