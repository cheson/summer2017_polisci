Governor Dannel P. Malloy applauded a decision today by the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) to lift the nationwide freeze on enrollment into the Jobs Corps program. In March, Governor Malloy wrote to USDOL Acting Secretary Seth Harris urging the freeze to be lifted so young adults in Connecticut could continue enrolling in the program.

"Today's announcement is good news for our state's young adults who are looking to gain employment experience and improve their lives," Governor Malloy said. "Since its inception, the State of Connecticut has strongly supported Jobs Corps and it has become a vital part of our workforce training infrastructure. It's training programs like these that help our state's efforts to invest in our workforce and grow our economy."

The Jobs Corps program provides a variety of job training services to young, low-income adults so they can gain the skills needed to fully integrate into the workforce. In Connecticut, the program has centers in Hartford and New Haven and impacts the lives of over 600 young adults annually.

Through programs like Jobs Corps, the Connecticut Department of Labor has been able to offer quality educational and employment opportunities, as well as develop and support many other programs that are housed at the Connecticut Jobs Corps Centers.
