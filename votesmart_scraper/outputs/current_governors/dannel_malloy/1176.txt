Gov. Malloy: $29 Million Investment to Bolster Housing Efforts
Press Release
By: Dan Malloy
Date: March 4, 2013
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced a state investment of more than $29 million in nine housing developments in Brookfield, Canaan, Hartford, New Haven, Vernon, and West Hartford. The funding, through the Competitive Housing Assistance for Multifamily Properties (CHAMP) initiative at the Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD), is a part of the Governor's commitment to strengthening Connecticut's economy by expanding housing opportunities that will attract and retain a talented workforce.

"To be competitive, Connecticut must attract and retain talented workers," said Governor Malloy. "Affordable housing for the state's young professionals and working families, and congregate housing for the elderly and those who need support is critical to creating livable communities and a thriving economy. Over ten years we will make a $500 million investment in neighborhoods across Connecticut--investments that will rehabilitate long-neglected state units and provide new options for young families. "

Through CHAMP, owners and developers of affordable single and multifamily rental developments can apply for loans and grants to expand or rehabilitate housing. Funds awarded under this program may be combined with financial assistance from the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority (CHFA), including four percent low-income housing tax credits and taxable or tax exempt bond financing. The funding is intended to be gap financing and may not exceed $5 million per development.

This financing will help build or renovate approximately 476 residential units, of which at least 319 will be affordable to income-qualifying households. The total project development costs are more than $103 million with $29 million coming from the state and $74 million coming from other sources, including developer equity, private financing, and federal funding.
"Housing investments fuel economic activity in many ways," said DECD commissioner Catherine Smith. "Every dollar invested in housing has an impact, whether in the form of increased wages, sales of construction materials and supplies, new tax revenue or other benefits. Effectively leveraging private and federal dollars--in this case more than 3 to 1--magnifies the impact even further."

The Governor's housing plan, announced last February, calls for a $500 million investment over 10 years. The program will create and preserve a wide range of affordable housing--including $300 million to revitalize the state's housing portfolio.
