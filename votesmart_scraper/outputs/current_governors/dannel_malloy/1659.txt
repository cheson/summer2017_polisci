When I showed up to our first video shoot for the general election my team asked me to tell you about my time as Mayor of Stamford, and what I want to accomplish as Governor. Then they handed me a stopwatch and told me to do it in just sixty seconds. There's a lot that I wanted to say, so I had to talk fast. Here it is:
I'm proud of what we accomplished in Stamford. We reduced crime by 63%. We brought thousands of new jobs to the city. We created the first citywide pre-Kindergarten program. We built new affordable housing and revitalized our city center. In short, we worked hard to make Stamford the kind of place where people want to live, work and raise a family.
I'm running for Governor because I want to take that experience to Hartford. We ran a smart government in Stamford that reduced the size government while increasing services to residents. I'll do the same as Governor--we'll cut the Governor's staff by 15 percent and the number of state agencies by a third.
My opponent released the first negative ad of the general election season today. Right out of the gate, Tom Foley went negative. Our first ad will be talking about the issues facing Connecticut's families: how we can address the economic decline, create jobs and security for our workforce, lower the cost of living, and make the state a destination for businesses and opportunity.
The truth is, Tom Foley doesn't have a record to run on and he doesn't have a plan to talk to you about. I do, and I'm proud to tell to you about it in our first ad.
