Public Statements
Gov. Malloy on the Anniversary of September 11
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Sept. 9, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in remembrance of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001:

"Ten years ago, the world, the country and our state changed forever. As the Mayor of Stamford at that time, I recall going to the train station to wait for the trains coming home from New York City, watching some of the people get off covered in soot and dust, and sending first responders to New York City to help with the response. In some ways, that day feels like it happened a long time ago; in other ways, it seems like it happened yesterday. Regardless of how many years go by, time does little to erase our memories of that day and for those who lost loved ones, the memories they have of that person or people will live on forever; their grief is our grief. Ten years later, we remember the countless, selfless acts of bravery and courage undertaken that day by so many men and women -- and most especially, but not limited to, uniformed personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice. And we of course think daily of the men and women serving in the Armed Forces who have sacrificed their own lives on behalf of our own. Our world is different, our country was impacted, and our state was forever altered, but ten years later, I remain convinced of our resiliency and determination to move forward from this terrible tragedy."

In recognition of Honor our Heroes and Remembrance Day, Governor Malloy has directed flags to fly at half-staff on Sunday, September 11, and asks residents to observe a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m., the time American Airlines flight 11 struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center.

Flags will return to full staff at sunset on Sunday.
