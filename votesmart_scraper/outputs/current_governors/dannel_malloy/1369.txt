Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following response on passage of his storm legislation in the Energy Committee:

"Last year, we endured two major storms in a little more than six weeks that left many of our residents without power for a significant period of time. Today, we are one step closer to tougher standards for utility companies and improve communication and training for state and local officials. This bill will also ensure that we make necessary investments at the local level in new technology like microgrids, so that we can be better prepared to weather whatever Mother Nature throws our way.

"Emergency preparedness is a process that must continue to evolve. This bill makes sure that we've taken the best of the recommendations of both the Witt Associates and Two Storm Panel Reports and put them into practice."

The Governor's bill included both legislative proposals in addition to changes to administrative procedures to improve operations in four individual policy areas: performance; management and communications; preparedness and training; and infrastructure strengthening.
