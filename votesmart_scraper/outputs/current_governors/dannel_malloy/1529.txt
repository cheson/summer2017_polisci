Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy issued the following statement commemorating Memorial Day, observed May 30, 2011.

"While over the years, Memorial Day has come to mean the unofficial start of summer, it's important to reflect upon the true meaning of the day -- honoring the brave men and women who have given their lives in service to our country. Over the past decade in Connecticut, we have lost 56 soldiers in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They join the thousands of heroes who, over the course of history, have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our Constitution and the values we hold dear. It's incumbent upon all of us to honor their legacy and thank them for their service."

In accordance with the U.S. Flag Code, the Governor has directed flags to fly at half staff from sunrise until noon on Memorial Day.
