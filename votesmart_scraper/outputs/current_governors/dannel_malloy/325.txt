Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements in response to today's ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals upholding Connecticut's gun safety laws.
Governor Malloy said, "Connecticut has the smartest, toughest, most common sense gun safety laws in the nation - approved with broad, bipartisan support - and the court's ruling validates it. It's all designed to keep our communities safe, while respecting the Second Amendment. We've clearly done that. The court today made the right decision, and time after time, court challenges aimed at whittling down our smart gun laws are proving unsuccessful.
"Connecticut has struck the right constitutional balance between access to firearms and public safety. Today's decision acknowledges our state government's obligation to take every sensible step toward reducing gun violence. One thing remains clear: Connecticut would be better off if every state and the federal government enacted similar, sensible gun safety rules.
"I commend the work of Attorney General George Jepsen and his office for once again successfully defending bipartisan gun safety legislation."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "I applaud the court on this decision - and the many men and women who worked to ensure that this anti-violence measure became law. Governor Malloy, Connecticut's legislature, and so many advocates stood up for common sense and for safer communities. From grassroots action in our neighborhoods to defending the law in court, this ruling underscores just how important leadership is."
