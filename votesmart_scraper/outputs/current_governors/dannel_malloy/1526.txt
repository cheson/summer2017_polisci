Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released a statement praising final passage of a bill granting paid sick leave to service workers.

"Throughout my campaign and now during my time as Governor, I've been clear about my commitment to the concept of paid sick leave, and I'm pleased that a reasonable compromise has passed both the Senate and the House. As I've said before, this is good public policy and specifically, good public health. Why would you want to eat food from a sick restaurant cook? Or have your children taken care of by a sick day care worker? The simple answer is -- you wouldn't. And now, you won't have to. Without paid sick leave, frontline service workers -- people who serve us food, who care for our children, and who work in hospitals, for example -- are forced to go to work sick to keep their jobs. That's not a choice I'm comfortable having people make under my tenure, and I'm proud to sign this bill when it comes to my desk."
