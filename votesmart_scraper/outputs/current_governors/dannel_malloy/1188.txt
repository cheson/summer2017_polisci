Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address:

"In his State of the Union address tonight, President Obama built upon the themes of his Inaugural Address and proposed a plan to accelerate job creation, promote long-term economic growth and grow the middle class.

"This plan is rooted in our values: that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should make it in America.

"His speech was also a powerful call to action against gun violence. The green and white ribbons that have come to signify the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School have now, for some, become a call to action. We have a responsibility to our children to take common sense steps now to prevent gun violence.

"At the start of the President's second term and the start of a new Congress, a fresh opportunity exists for our federal lawmakers to meet head-on our nation's challenges and set aside rigid ideology and political brinkmanship. I commend the President for his economic plan and for championing issues that matter to the citizens of Connecticut."
