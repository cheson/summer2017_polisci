Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Senior Officials for Governor Dannel P. Malloy were briefed by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) this morning about the results of the 60-day Operation Deep Dive review of Metro-North Railroad. The goal of Operation Deep Dive was to perform a comprehensive safety evaluation of Metro-North based on commuter railroad best practices and identify opportunities for improvement. Governor Malloy released the following statement on FRA's report.

"This report reinforces the serious concerns that I have raised with Metro-North leadership regarding their business practices in light of the major issues that impacted Metro-North and the New Haven Line over the past year.

"Based on the commitments I have received from the Metropolitan Transportation Agency and Metro-North, I expect that the key recommendations of this report will be the top priorities addressed in the 100-Day Plan for the railroad. I want that report in short order, so that riders will have deadlines and benchmarks that will hold the railroad accountable.

"I expect, and indeed senior management has assured me, that Metro-North will focus on restoration of the highest quality, safe service in the industry and restore the New Haven to a "best-in-class" railroad. That's what the customers and taxpayers from Connecticut deserve."
