Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements in response to President Trump's budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2018:
Governor Malloy said, "While we continue to analyze its impact on the state, it is abundantly clear that President Trump's budget is abysmal for working Americans. In an effort to provide his wealthy friends tax breaks and fund his own unpopular projects, the President is devastating critical environmental programs, undercutting important educational initiatives, and decimating human services programs to the detriment of the sick, elderly, and poor."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "The President's budget further destabilizes the healthcare marketplace and cuts funding where it's most needed -- children's health, behavioral health, and Medicaid. These reductions reverse progress on programs that are working -- programs that improve lives and productivity. The cuts also directly damage the ability of the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income residents to get care. The budget shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how important public health is, as well as the healthcare economy."
