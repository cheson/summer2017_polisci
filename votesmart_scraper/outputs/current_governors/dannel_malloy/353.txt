Governor Dannel P. Malloy, United States Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, Amtrak, and the members of Connecticut's Congressional delegation met this morning in Washington, D.C. to discuss the future of the New Haven-Hartford-Springfield rail line, known as the Hartford Line. They released the following joint statement:
"The Hartford Line is a top priority for the U.S. Department of Transportation, Governor Malloy, the Connecticut Congressional delegation, and Amtrak. Today's meeting was both positive and productive. It was clear that all of the stakeholders in this process - Secretary Foxx, Federal Railroad Administration Acting Administrator Feinberg, Governor Malloy, Amtrak President and CEO Boardman, Amtrak Chairman Coscia, and the Connecticut Congressional delegation - agree that this project must get done. By the end of the month, we expect to make progress on a path acceptable to all parties that can help move this project forward."
