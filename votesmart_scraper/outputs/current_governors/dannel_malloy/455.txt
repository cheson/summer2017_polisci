Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced today that, through diligence by the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services (DRS), the state has identified and saved taxpayers over $14 million in fraudulent claims within 2014 filings so far this season.

"Even though April 15 has passed, our agencies are working diligently and efficiently to save taxpayer dollars and protect residents. We're doing everything we can to identify fraud, root it out, and prevent it in the future. Particularly in an age when our identities, personal information, and filings may be susceptible to theft, we are being vigilant like never before -- and the results show," Governor Malloy said.

DRS Commissioner Kevin Sullivan said, "Nationally and in Connecticut, there's been a big increase this tax season in attempted tax fraud targeting income tax refunds. Every year, the criminals get smarter and more brazen. That's why Connecticut takes a dynamic approach in fighting tax fraud. The Department of Revenue Services uses multiple layers of variable screening and incidence-driven assignment of staff. In addition, we are doing much more to provide taxpayers information on how to avoid and remedy identity theft and tax fraud. So far this tax season, we have already stopped more than $14 million in fraud -- a nearly 150% increase over last year."

In 2013, nearly $5.5 million in fraud was prevented and protected.
