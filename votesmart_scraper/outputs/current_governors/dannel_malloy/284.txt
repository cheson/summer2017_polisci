Press Release
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Dec. 28, 2015
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that as the result of a new law he signed last year, Connecticut's minimum wage is scheduled to increase from the current rate of $9.15 an hour to $9.60 per hour on January 1, 2016. The change is the second in a series of three scheduled increases under the adopted legislation, which will ultimately see the state's minimum wage increase to $10.10 on January 1, 2017.
"Nobody who works full-time should live in poverty. We believe hardworking men and women, many of whom are supporting families, deserve fair wages," Governor Malloy said. "I am proud that Connecticut has been a leader in promoting a higher hourly wage. It is a modest increase that will give working families a boost while also having stimulative economic effects."
