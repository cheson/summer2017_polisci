Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the recent MTA service disruption. Earlier this afternoon, Metro North announced that service would return to normal for the Monday morning commute.

"I'm happy for the thousands of Connecticut commuters that service will be back to normal on Monday. I hope this outage serves as a wake up call to both Con Ed and the MTA when it comes to maintenance. We need to look at why this happened and take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. And we will continue to push Con Ed to reimburse residents. Connecticut did not cause this problem, and we should not be on the hook for the cost."
