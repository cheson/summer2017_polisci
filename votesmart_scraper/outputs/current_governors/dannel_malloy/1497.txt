Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: July 29, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released this statement following the President's announcement on improvements in fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas limits:

"Several years ago, Connecticut made a commitment to cleaner cars, and shortly afterwards, we passed landmark legislation to reduce our global warming emissions. Now, with President Obama's leadership, the nation has taken an unprecedented step towards improving our vehicles and our environment. I applaud the President, the Environmental Protection Agency and the other stakeholders for setting a course that will encourage American innovation and technology and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Connecticut's clean energy companies are well-positioned to play a significant role in our new energy economy, improved vehicle efficiency will keep more dollars at home in Connecticut, and we'll all breathe easier with less air pollution."
