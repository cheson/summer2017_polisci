Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statement in response to an overnight shooting incident in New Haven during which six people were injured, one fatally.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the woman who died as a result of her injuries, the victims who are fighting for their lives, and all who are impacted by this senseless violence. This is a tragic reminder that despite progress in recent years, Connecticut cities still suffer too often from the plague of gun violence. On the state, municipal, and community levels, Connecticut must continue to work together to make all our communities safer."

On Saturday afternoon, Governor Malloy will attend a press conference at New Haven Police Headquarters, 1 Union Ave., New Haven, CT.
