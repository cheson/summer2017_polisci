Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman today issued the following statements in support of Women's Equality Day, established in 1971 by a Joint Resolution of Congress.

"Equality for women, including pay equity, fair employment policies, and access to healthcare, is critical to the strength and competitiveness of Connecticut and this country," Governor Malloy said. "That women earn less than 76 cents to every dollar earned by men doing the same job damages families in communities throughout Connecticut and far beyond. It isn't just about fairness -- wage discrimination also detracts from the economic stability of the entire state. Last January, I created a task force to examine Connecticut's wage gap and make recommendations that will help us eliminate gender wage discrimination. Headed by Department of Labor Commissioner Sharon Palmer and Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Catherine Smith, the first report is expected in October, and will assist us in addressing the challenges and barriers to women gaining full economic equality in the workplace."

"A lifetime of earning less pay not only means a smaller paycheck, but also means a retirement with less security for a woman and her family," Lt. Governor Wyman said. "That is a fundamental economic disadvantage that is clearly unfair and needs to be dealt with so women can better support their families today and retire on equal footing with men."

August 26 marks the day in 1920 when passage of the 19th Amendment ensured American women had the right to vote.
