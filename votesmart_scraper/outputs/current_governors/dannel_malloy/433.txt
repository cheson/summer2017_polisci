Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that new energy efficiency measures now planned for Connecticut Valley Hospital (CVH) in Middletown and several Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices throughout the state will reduce energy costs at those locations by more than $3.3 million per year. The measures are being implemented under the state's "Lead by Example" initiative, which was designed to reduce energy use in state and local government buildings.
"A brighter tomorrow for Connecticut means delivering energy efficiency - and taxpayer savings - today. The steps we are taking now demonstrates that we're making smart decisions to be efficient in the long-run," Governor Malloy said. "These are wise investments that will help drive down the cost of government, and reduce carbon emissions and air pollution created by burning fossil fuels to create heat and electricity. It's simply commonsense policy."
The State Bond Commission acted Monday to authorize $38 million in funding for the two projects, which will be repaid through the energy savings guaranteed by the contractors. Upon completion of the projects, the energy performance of the two facilities will be diligently monitored to make certain the promised energy savings are achieved.
This "performance contracting" approach was developed by Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the Connecticut Green Bank. Over the past few years, dozens of smaller projects have been undertaken in state buildings that are already saving more than $1 million a year, with another $2 million a year coming on-line soon. The projects at CVH and DMV are among the largest to be undertaken through this initiative.
