Governor Malloy issued the following statement today in support of Women's History Month, which runs today through the end of March.

"Women's History Month is an opportunity to celebrate the struggles and successes of the many women who have worked to make the world more equal and more just for us all. While there is still more work to be done, we take this time to pause and reflect on the work our mothers and grandmothers have done on our behalf: a fight for more comparable wages, better working conditions, increased access to health care, and a safer environment in which to raise our families. Strong women have always been a staple in my life -- the work my mother, Agnes, my sister, Gail, and my wife, Cathy, have done and continue to do will help future generations of young women in this state. This month we celebrate Women's History Month and the strength of all of the women in our past, present and future."
