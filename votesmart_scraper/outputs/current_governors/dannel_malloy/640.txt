Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced the state is awarding $10,649,077 in grants and loans for eight projects and programs that will create 131 units of affordable housing throughout the state.

"Increasing the supply of all types of affordable housing is one of the best ways we can build stronger communities, reduce homelessness, promote transit-oriented development and improve the quality of life for our residents," said the Governor. "These are smart investments that are making a real difference in peoples' lives."

The projects and programs are being funded through the state's Affordable Housing Program, which provides grants, loans, loan guarantees, and deferred loans for the development and preservation of affordable housing. Funds from the program, administered by the Department of Housing (DOH), can be used for a wide array of activities including new construction, rehabilitation, demolition and the redevelopment of vacant properties. These eight recipients were chosen competitively through the DOH's Special Priority Projects and Program NOFA.
