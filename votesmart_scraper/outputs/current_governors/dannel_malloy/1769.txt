MALLOY'S GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN MEETS TORRINGTON YOUNG DEMOCRATS
Democratic Candidate Listens and Shares Vision for Connecticut
TORRINGTON January 9-- Democratic candidate for Governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's four-term Mayor, Monday morning shared his vision for Connecticut and how a Malloy Administration would benefit the youth of Connecticut, with the members of the Torrington Young Democrats.
"I have a vision of a world class Connecticut for the 21st Century, where all of our communities prosper with jobs, economic growth and a lifestyle factor that attracts and retains companies, workers, families and our young people," said Malloy. "This means setting priorities that reflect the needs of all our people, young and old, challenging ourselves to plan for the long term, setting goals and holding ourselves accountable for achieving those goals."
Malloy met with students ranging in age from 15 to 18, at the Career Center of Torrington High School. Daniel Pullium, the Torrington Democratic Town Chairman and Jennifer Dillon, Torrington High School alum and President of Connecticut College Democrats also attended the meeting. During the hour-long conversation, Malloy fielded questions about property tax relief, keeping teenagers safe, the burdensome cost of higher education, transportation, and the 22% increase in the electric rate.
Some of Malloy's comments include:
· "Regarding property taxes, Connecticut's towns are burdened by excessive property taxes which are currently the only means to raise the revenue needed to fund education. For a long time now I have advocated a tax sharing system where a portion of state taxes are shared with local communities, resulting in lower property taxes and easing the burden on property owners."
· "As for college funding, Connecticut's higher education system is one of the costliest in the nation and we should have a goal to reduce the cost in order to keep our own young people here for college, increasing the likelihood they will continue to call Connecticut home after graduation. To make our colleges and universities more competitive, I support deregulation of Connecticut's higher education system to allow the institutions more flexibility in offering programs that meet the needs and interests of their students."
· "Anyone who spends any time in a car is frustrated by the traffic on our highways. On my way to Torrington today, we drove through long stretches of gridlock on I-95 and Route 8. I think this is one of the major reasons why Connecticut is ranked last among the 50 states in job retention and as governor I would invest in improving the transportation infrastructure which is a key element in growing the economy."
Malloy commended the group for their commitment to the future of Connecticut. "It is always exciting to meet with young people who share a common passion for politics and public service." He ended by saying how impressed he was by such a "knowledgeable and informed" group and looks forward to carrying on the dialogue with their counterparts across the state.
Malloy has dedicated more than two decades to public service and was recently re-elected to an unprecedented fourth term as the Mayor of Stamford. Under his leadership, the City has experienced an economic turnaround:
· building a strong and vibrant business base and increasing employment by over 9%,
· achieving 63% reduction in crime,
· launching the first universal pre-school program in Connecticut
· maintaining a AAA bond rating
· opening one of the State's most highly-respected senior centers and
· securing and protecting over 250 acres of open space, more than any other municipality in the State.
· During his term, the City's housing stock has grown by 10% representing one of the fastest growth rates in the State, and Stamford is the only municipality in the State to establish an affordable housing program as a means to address the very high cost of housing in Southwestern Fairfield County.
Dan Malloy has spent the past two years traveling across Connecticut meeting with Democratic Town Committees, elected and community leaders and young people to engage them in an open dialogue about Connecticut's future
