Governor Dannel P. Malloy directed U.S. and Connecticut flags to remain at half-staff on Saturday, December 7, in recognition of Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day and the lives lost in the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Flags are also currently flying at half-staff through Monday evening in honor of Nelson Mandela.

"This is an opportunity to consider the courageous actions of those who made the ultimate sacrifice at Pearl Harbor and the numerous battles to follow during the Second World War," Governor Malloy said. "Some seven decades after the attack, our service men and women stationed abroad continue to make sacrifices in defense of our great nation. We are forever grateful for their service and pray for their safe and speedy return."

"The countless acts of courage and sacrifice that took place on that day and in the years of war that followed must never be forgotten," Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said. "Today is a day not only to pay tribute to our military heroes of the past, but for each of us to recommit ourselves to honoring the principles of freedom and democracy for which they gave so much."
