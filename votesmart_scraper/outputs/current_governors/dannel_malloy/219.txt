Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he is directing U.S. and state flags in Connecticut to be flown at half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Sunday, May 15, 2016, in recognition of Peace Officers Memorial Day.
The national observance pays tribute to local, state, and federal law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. It is recognized annually during National Police Week.
"Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to ensure the safety of the citizens of this country and our state, and we are so grateful for their sacrifices. United in their desire to protect and serve, these men and women give so much to protect our communities, and we are a safer state thanks to their service," Governor Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said in a joint statement. "On Peace Officers Memorial Day, we honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty, as well as their families. Their service will never be forgotten."
