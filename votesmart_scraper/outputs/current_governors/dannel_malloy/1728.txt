NORWICH -- Joseph League of Baltic would like to see more emphasis on bringing a greater variety of job opportunities to the region.
"There's a big gap in pay scales around here," said League, 26, a slot machine technician at Mohegan Sun. "I think if there was more emphasis put on getting different kinds of companies here, everything else would follow. More diversity would mean better paying jobs."
The economy -- specifically the southeastern Connecticut economy -- took center stage in the gubernatorial campaign Thursday. Democratic challenger and Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy accused Republican Gov. Jodi Rell of long ignoring the economic importance of the area. At press conferences throughout the region, Malloy said he supports a 10-year, $100 million investment to help municipalities foster economic development opportunities -- with $10 million made available immediately.
"I'm not a Johnny-come-lately to this region, nor are my concerns for it," he said at Norwich City Hall press conference, outlining a series of economic proposals.
Malloy's announcement comes a day after Rell released a statement of her support for a series of recommendations developed by her Commission on Diversifying the Southeastern Connecticut Economy. This included support for a $10 million low-interest loan fund to help municipalities fund infrastructure projects that could provide significant economic return.
