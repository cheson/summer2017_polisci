Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements regarding the passing of former State Senator Eileen Daily of Westbrook:
Governor Malloy said, "For decades, she was a tenacious fighter for her constituents and a committee chair who wielded enormous respect among colleagues - and she did it with a smile on her face. Eileen was one of the toughest elected officials in the state, yet her jovial disposition always made those around her feel at ease. She represented the best of public service and politics. She was tough, loyal, hardworking, knew the issues, and her word was always her bond. This is a loss for all of us - Eileen will indeed be missed. Our hearts go out to her family and loved ones."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "Today is truly a sad day. Within the walls of the State Capitol, Eileen was more than just a public servant - she was a genuine leader. To me, Eileen was more than colleague - she was a friend. We served together for years. And while we worked closely together on so many different issues, we knew each other well. She was a wonderful person with whom I was close, and I received the news this morning with an extraordinarily heavy heart. My prayers are with her entire family at this difficult time."
