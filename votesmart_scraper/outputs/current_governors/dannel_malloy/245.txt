Governor Dannel P. Malloy today applauded an announcement made by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell that over $2.5 million in federal funding has been awarded to seven health centers in Connecticut to improve and expand the delivery of substance abuse services in health centers, with a specific focus on treatment of opioid use disorders in underserved populations.
"This funding will no doubt provide help to those who need it. We must tackle prescription opioid and heroin use - this is a growing problem nationwide that Connecticut is working hard to combat," Governor Malloy said. "I applaud HHS and Secretary Burwell for investing in our community health centers so they can expand and build upon the critical services they provide our residents."
"These funds will help us save lives," Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said. "Connecticut is working to stem the damage done by opioids - expanding access to life-saving medication and working closely with partners on the front lines of providing addiction treatment and healthcare. We are grateful to our federal partners and to Secretary Burwell for this investment in our residents and our state."
Funding was awarded to the following health centers in the state:
Bridgeport: Optimus Health Care, Inc., $325,000
East Hartford: First Choice Health Centers, Inc., $406,250
Hartford: Community Health Services, Inc., $325,000
Middletown: Community Health Center, Inc., $379,167
New Haven: Cornell Scott-Hill Health Corp., $406,250
New Haven: Fair Haven Community Health Clinic, Inc., $352,083
Waterbury: Staywell Health Care, Inc., $325,000
"We know that treatment works and recovery is possible. These additional funds will allow our community health centers to expand their substance abuse services so we can get more people into treatment and on the path to recovery," Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services said. "We are thankful for the support from the federal Department of Health and Human Services as we fight the battle against addiction."
As part of today's announcement by HHS, a total of $94 million in Affordable Care Act funding was awarded to 271 health centers in 45 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Administered by the HHS Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), these awards to health centers across the country will increase the number of patients screened for substance use disorders and connected to treatment, increase the number of patients with access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use and other substance use disorder treatment, and provide training and educational resources to help health professionals make informed prescribing decisions.
Earlier this week, DMHAS announced a statewide 800 number connecting residents seeking treatment and services for an opioid addiction to local walk-in assessment centers throughout the state. Residents are now able to call 1-800-563-4086 24-hours-a-day to be connected to a walk-in assessment center in their area.
