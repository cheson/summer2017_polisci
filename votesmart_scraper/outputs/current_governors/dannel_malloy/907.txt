Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address:

"Tonight, President Obama once again challenged Congress to work constructively with him to enact common-sense laws that strengthen our nation and foster economic opportunity and prosperity for all Americans.

"Too often during the past year -- and despite the efforts of the President and many in Congress, particularly Connecticut's congressional delegation -- Washington has been mired in political gridlock. But as the President highlighted tonight, regardless of inaction in Washington, progress is being made.

"In Connecticut, we enacted common-sense gun laws to make our communities safer; we raised the minimum wage to increase family incomes; we implemented health care reform to provide affordable, high-quality coverage to our citizens so they're healthier and more economically secure; we've invested in our roads, bridges and rail systems to enhance economic growth and our quality of life; and we're doing more to educate our children and train our workforce than at any time in the past two decades. No question there is more work to be done, but these accomplishments are progress by any measure.

"I commend the President's agenda and I urge Congress to work with him, to find common ground, and to act in the best interest of all Americans. And I look forward to working with the President over the course of this year to build upon the progress we've made as a state and a nation and to continue doing the work we were elected by the people to do."
