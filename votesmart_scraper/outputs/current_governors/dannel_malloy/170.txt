Location: Hartford, CT

The Office of Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released photos of the Governor's visit to Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida on Friday. Following the mass shooting there last month, the Governor recognized the victims and their families.
"What happened at Pulse was a truly devastating moment for the nation. To visit there personally, you think about the individuals who held their breath in fear inside that building, knowing a madman was nearby. You think about horror they must of felt - a horror no person should have to experience. You think about the parents and family-members who woke up to the tragic news that their loved ones would not come home - and the pain that will make their hearts swell forever. It fills you with emotion," Governor Malloy said. "The wounds in Orlando and across the nation are still raw. These are challenging times - gun violence is simply taking too many lives. We must never forget. We must take real action on gun violence prevention nationwide, and we must do all we can to stop tragedy from occurring. My prayers continue to be with the victims and their families."
The Governor also participated in a private memorial with other Democratic leaders Friday evening. At the event, on behalf of the people of Connecticut, he gave to Orlando leaders the pride flag that flew outside of the Governor's Residence in the wake of the shooting.
