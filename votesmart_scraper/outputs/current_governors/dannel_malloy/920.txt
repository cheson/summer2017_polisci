Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements commemorating Martin Luther King, Jr. Day:
"I am proud to be the governor of a state that was one of the first to enact an official statewide observance of Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday -- 12 years before the date was recognized as a national holiday," said Governor Malloy. "Dr. King's timeless message continues to touch the lives of so many contemporary Americans more than 40 years after his death, serving as an inspiration to all of us to undertake what Dr. King called a "new revolution of values based on love, compassion and justice'. As we reflect on the life of this great man, I am committed to doing my part to honor and carry on Dr. King's legacy and ask others to join me in working towards Dr. King's vision of a society that guarantees equality, justice, and freedom for all."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "Dr. King's conviction that each of us should do whatever we can to empower people and strengthen our communities is particularly relevant today as we try to create a new roadmap of opportunity for everyone. As Dr. King said, "Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle - the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.' I think the greatest thing we can do to honor Dr. King is to try every day to be passionate and dedicated to achieving the equality that he spoke about -- and dreamed about."
