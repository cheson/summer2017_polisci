Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on the 43rd celebration of Earth Day, April 22:

"The 43rd annual Earth Day celebration is a great reminder that environmental preservation is key to creating healthy, livable, and viable communities. We've made good progress balancing sustainability with development, and we must continue to look for ways to protect our natural resources as we grow our economy. Our efforts to reduce energy use and find cleaner, cheaper, more reliable ways to power Connecticut's homes and businesses, our investments in brownfield remediation that will return formerly toxic land to viability, the work to upgrade infrastructure to ensure less pollution flows into Long Island Sound--these initiatives will make Connecticut a healthier and cleaner state now and for future generations. I applaud the work being done by stakeholders and advocates across the globe to reduce our impact on the planet."
