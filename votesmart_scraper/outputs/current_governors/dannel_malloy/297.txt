Governor Dannel P. Malloy, the members of Connecticut's Congressional Delegation, and Connecticut Housing Commissioner Evonne M. Klein today announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has approved nearly $1.2 million in grants to help low-income residents in Connecticut find employment and obtain valuable job training skills. The State Department of Housing and ten local housing authorities across Connecticut will benefit from the federal award.
"We have made extraordinary investments in job training and dramatically increased the availability of affordable housing - both deliver more vibrant communities. Making worker training available is indeed good business throughout Connecticut," Governor Malloy said. "Job training opportunities help ensure that our workforce continues to have the tools to obtain employment - and to be successful in their jobs."
