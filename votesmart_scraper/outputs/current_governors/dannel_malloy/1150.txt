Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement in support of the new Tier 3 Vehicle Standards proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

"EPA's proposed Tier 3 vehicle standards and cleaner gasoline will give our state immediate air quality benefits, which will only grow over time as new cars enter the marketplace.

"In Connecticut, we are taking action to show that we can have a strong economy and a healthy environment, and the new standards for motor vehicles and fuels announced today by EPA are consistent with our approach.

"I applaud EPA's help taking on the most significant source of air pollution -- cars, trucks and other so-called mobile sources -- and look forward to prompt finalization of the rule so we all breathe cleaner air."

Earlier today, the EPA today released new proposed standards for cars and gasoline that will significantly reduce harmful pollution, prevent thousands of premature deaths and illnesses, while also enabling efficiency improvements in the cars and trucks we drive. The proposal will slash emissions of a range of harmful pollutants that can cause premature death and respiratory illnesses, including reducing smog-forming volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides by 80 percent, establish a 70 percent tighter particulate matter standard, and reduce fuel vapor emissions to near zero.
