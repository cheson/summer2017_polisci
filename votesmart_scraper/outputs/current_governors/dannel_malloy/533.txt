Governor Dannel P. Malloy today outlined additional details regarding the proposals he intends to submit to the General Assembly regarding a transportation "lock box":

The Governor is proposing both a constitutional amendment as well as a statutory change to protect the Special Transportation Fund, ensuring dollars from that fund are spent only for transportation purposes.

The proposed statutory change would take effect this year and, unlike current law, would clarify and protect taxpayer dollars going both into and out of the Special Transportation Fund.

Neither the statutory change or the constitutional amendment will include any "escape clause," such as an override option for the General Assembly or Governor.

"I will submit language to the General Assembly for consideration that changes state law, so we can immediately make clear there will be no future diversions from the Special Transportation Fund or its revenue sources as we move through the process to pass a constitutional lock box," Governor Malloy said. "We must make sure every penny we raise for transportation goes toward our vision to transform Connecticut -- now and in the future. That means we must ensure a working lock box is passed this year, in this legislative session. These are commonsense first steps in a dialogue that is long overdue."

In addition to a proposed constitutional amendment that is required to pass the General Assembly before being put to the voters in 2016 for consideration, the Governor's proposal will include a statutory change for the interim.

The specific language for both proposals shall be released in the coming days.
