Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement following the House of Representatives' passage of House Bill 6360 -- An Act Concerning the Implementation of Connecticut's Comprehensive Energy Strategy. The legislation is expected to expand energy choices, lower utility bills for Connecticut residents and businesses, improve environmental conditions and generate at least 10,000 clean energy jobs.

"This bill will take us many steps closer to our goal of providing cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy to Connecticut residents," said Governor Malloy. "For far too long, Connecticut has approached its energy, environmental and economic challenges separately. As a result, residents and businesses are paying some of the highest energy costs in the country. This legislation builds on our efforts and provides a solid, inclusive plan to create good jobs, strengthen our state's competitiveness and achieve a more sustainable economic and environmental future."
