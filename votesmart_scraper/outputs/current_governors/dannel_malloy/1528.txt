Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement today, applauding Senate passage of his Bioscience Connecticut initiative, which will create thousands of new jobs, sustain economic growth going forward, and spur innovation into the future.

"I'm pleased that the Senate has passed the Bioscience Connecticut proposal and I urge the House of Representatives to do the same. This proposal is about three things: creating thousands of jobs now and for years to come, making Connecticut a leader in an emerging growth industry, and improving healthcare.

"This proposal is a win-win investment -- it will provide 4,000 jobs annually over the next six years, it will create long-term economic growth with 16,400 jobs by 2037, and it will help stabilize the Health Center's own finances. This is an aggressive, forward-thinking proposal that understands that, while Connecticut has a storied history as a leader in manufacturing and the insurance industry, we cannot rest on our laurels and allow the next wave of economic growth -- in the field of bioscience -- pass us by. The state's flagship public university and its Health Center must be looked at as more than just a school or just a hospital -- we need to view them as economic drivers and ways in which we can leverage our education system into long-term, sustained economic growth."
