Democratic nominee for Governor Dan Malloy today commented on recent news that the Groton sub base may once again be under threat of closing. Said Malloy:
"When the sub base was nearly closed in 2005, Connecticut stood up and made the case that the base is not only vital in supporting the U.S. submarine force and its sailors, it also employees thousands of Connecticut residents and contributes billions to our economy. The base was essential then, as it is now, and it needs to be actively guarded against threats of closure.
"During that 2005 fight, which I was proud to play an active role in, there were two lessons we learned. One is that we need to get out in front of the issue and take strong, proactive steps to defend the base. The other is that our effort can't be politicized or it risks losing credibility; we need to present a united, bipartisan front.
"That's why I was disappointed in the decision by a number of Republican candidates, including my opponent Tom Foley, to hold what appears to be a partisan press conference today on this issue. It's good they're standing up for the base, but I think we delegitimize the cause by turning it into what some have called "a political football.'
"Instead, we should convene a meeting to discuss how Connecticut can best work together to thwart any attempt to close the base. The meeting could be led by our Congressional delegation, the Governor, and others who were active in the 2005 fight. I'd be happy to attend, and I assume Tom would as well."
