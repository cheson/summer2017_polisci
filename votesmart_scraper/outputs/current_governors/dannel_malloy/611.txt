Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he asked the leadership of the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) to rehang the Hartford Whalers banners at the newly renovated XL Center, and the agency wholeheartedly agreed.

"The XL Center holds great value for the State of Connecticut and for our capital city, and we are proud of its legacy -- which includes nearly two decades of being the home of Whalers hockey," Governor Malloy said. "This arena serves as an important economic driver for the Hartford region, and while the newly unveiled renovations represent its next phase, we should continue to honor and celebrate its history."

CRDA has indicated that the banners will be up in time for the opening game of the Hartford Wolf Pack on Saturday, October 18.
