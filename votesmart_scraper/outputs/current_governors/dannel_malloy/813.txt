Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that $5.76 million to fund road improvements and resurfacing in Connecticut state parks was approved at Friday's meeting of the state Bond Commission.

"Connecticut's state parks and forests are a destination to millions of residents and tourists each year, and roadways in many locations are showing the signs of all of this use," said Governor Malloy. "In a year when we are celebrating the centennial of our state park system, it is especially important to make the investments needed to ensure that people can travel safely and conveniently into and around our parks. These projects will also create much needed construction work for Connecticut workers."

Most projects will begin as soon as the weather permits and continue throughout the spring and early summer. Major projects include:
East Lyme -- Resurfacing the approach road to the beach at Rocky Neck State Park
Litchfield -- Milling and resurfacing the road leading to the mansion at Topsmead State Forest
New Fairfield -- Resurfacing the access road to Squantz Pond State Park, as well as incorporating a new drainage system during the resurfacing
New Fairfield -- Improving the parking area at the state boat launch at Squantz Pond State Park on Candlewood Lake
Derby -- Resurfacing the parking lot for the Kellogg Environmental Education Center

"These bond funds are the latest example of an extraordinary commitment Governor Malloy and the General Assembly have demonstrated toward maintaining and improving the infrastructure in our state parks and forests," said DEEP Commissioner Rob Klee. "These and other previous funds that have been allocated allow us to make improvements that will ensure our parks remain first-class attractions for many years to come."
