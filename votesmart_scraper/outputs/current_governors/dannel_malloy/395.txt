Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Connecticut Department of Housing (DOH) Commissioner Evonne M. Klein today announced that 17 applications have been selected for funding under the department's Affordable Homeownership round. The $30 million in funding will create homeownership opportunities for eligible individuals and families across the state.
"Affordable housing strengthens communities, creating neighborhoods where families and individuals can find stability, gain employment, and build a brighter long-term future," Governor Malloy said. "Investing in quality housing and opportunities such as these can improve thousands of lives and help further Connecticut's progress."
The successful applicants in this affordable homeownership round include new construction or rehabilitation projects and programs that finance the construction, purchase, or rehabilitation of homeownership units, critical improvements necessary for accessibility for owner-occupants, and owner-occupied small multi-family properties and programs that help bring homeownership within reach of moderate income individuals and families. Assisted properties must be owner-occupied, comprising one to four units that create or preserve affordable housing.
"As a department, we are tasked with ensuring that the residents of Connecticut have access to safe, quality, and affordable housing," Commissioner Klein said. "The affordable homeownership funding round presents the unique opportunity to create affordable homeownership, not only in our cities, but also in our smaller municipalities. Initiatives and programs like this one give hard working individuals and families a chance to own their own home."
DOH allocated $20 million to seven statutorily designated cities, including Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport, Stamford, Norwalk, New London, and New Britain. The remaining $10 million was available to all other towns and cities across the state.
