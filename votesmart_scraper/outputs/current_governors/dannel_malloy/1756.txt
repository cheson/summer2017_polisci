For Immediate Release
MALLOY CALLS IT 'SHAMEFUL' THAT CT IS RANKED 49th IN PERCENTAGE OF TOBACCO SETTLEMENT MONEY SPENT ON TOBACCO CESSATION PROGRAMS
Says Rell "needs to show leadership on this issue by doing the right thing"
Saying, "It's unconscionable that the wealthiest state in the nation, armed with hundreds of millions of dollars from the tobacco settlement, ranks nearly dead last in funding for tobacco prevention programs," Democratic candidate for Governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's Mayor, today criticized Governor Rell for her "lack of leadership and commitment to adequately funding common sense programs that keep our children from a habit that causes a lifetime of addiction, disease and death." He challenged the Governor to increase funding for a comprehensive tobacco control and prevention program in her upcoming budget.
According to a recently released study by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, Connecticut ranks second-to-last in the nation in state funding to prevent tobacco usage. The Centers for Disease Control recommends a $21.24 million state budget for comprehensive tobacco control, but Connecticut spends only $40,000. Jerold Mande, associate director for policy at the Yale Cancer Center, says Connecticut will receive $383.6 million in tobacco revenues from the state's tobacco tax and the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement this year alone.
