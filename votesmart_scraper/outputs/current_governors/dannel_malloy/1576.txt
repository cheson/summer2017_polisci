Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy is back in Washington, D.C., seeking a portion of the $2.4 billion in federal high-speed rail funding that Florida"s governor has rejected.
Malloy met with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to discuss the state's request for $100 million.
The money would fund the planned commuter rail line from New Haven to Springfield, Mass.
Following the meeting, his fourth with LaHood, Malloy said he believed he was making progress securing the funds.
"That's why I'm in Washington," said Malloy. "We have a very robust application for allocation of the Florida dollars and I'm being quite aggressive in arguing our case."
Connecticut has already committed $286 million to the project, which is expected to cost about $800 million. The federal government already approved $161 million and Malloy and the congressional delegation have been looking for federal funding to help cover the remainder of the cost.
Malloy was also scheduled to meet Vice President Joe Biden and attend a St. Patrick's Day reception at the White House with President Barack Obama.
