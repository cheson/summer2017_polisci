Governor Dannel P. Malloy thanked the Connecticut State Senate for giving final approval today to legislation he introduced earlier this year that will create the Connecticut Coordinated Assistance and Recovery Endowment, also known as CT CARE -- a foundation that will accept charitable donations in the immediate aftermath of an emergency and disseminate them as quickly as possible in accordance with the donors' intent.

"CT CARE will honor the donors' intent and get their donations in the hands of victims as soon as safely possible," Governor Malloy said. "While we all hope for the best, CT CARE will plan in advance and stand ready to help when it's needed most. I want to thank the General Assembly for giving final approval to this legislation and I look forward to signing it into law."

CT CARE creates an innovative partnership between the state and the nonprofit sector. In the event of an emergency, the State Treasurer will immediately receive donations as a custodian for the new foundation. CT CARE will be an independent, nonprofit entity that will place financial control in the hands of its governing board. It will be ready to lessen the chaos that can arise in the charitable community following an emergency by developing response plans, best practices and other objective scenarios for the distribution of charitable funds.

The legislation, House Bill 6374 -- An Act Concerning Coordinated Long-Term Disaster Relief and Recovery, was approved by the House of Representatives last week and now will be transmitted to the Governor for his signature.
