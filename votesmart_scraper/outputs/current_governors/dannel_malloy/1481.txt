Governor Dannel P. Malloy this afternoon requested that President Barack Obama declare a pre-landfall emergency in Connecticut. This declaration allows the state to request funding and other assistance in advance of the storm hitting the state.

"Hurricane Irene is a serious threat to our state, and this declaration will allow us to request federal funding and other assistance in Connecticut in advance of the storm," said Gov. Malloy. "As the hours go by, we are more and more certain that Hurricane Irene will have either a direct or substantial impact on our state, and I'm not willing to wait until afterward to ask the federal government for help. The best case scenario is that we don't end up needing this -- the worst case scenario is we do, and it's too late to begin to ask."
