Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) will award $7 million to 12 brownfield redevelopment and assessment projects across the state, including $5.4 million to four remediation and redevelopment projects and $1.5 million to eight projects for assessment and investigation. Together, the projects will help clean up and assess a total of 462 acres of commercial, industrial and municipal properties.
"Remediating and redeveloping these sites helps jumpstart local economies by rehabilitating areas, putting them back into use for development, and creating jobs for residents," Governor Malloy said. "Over the last few years we've made historic investments in remediating contaminated properties for redevelopment, and these additional projects further demonstrate our commitment to our cities and towns."
Funding will be awarded through the Connecticut Remedial Action and Redevelopment Municipal Grant Program, which provides grants to municipalities and economic development agencies to support remediation, abatement, and demolition activities prior to redevelopment and to conduct environmental site assessments. Goals of the program include augmenting the state's investment by leveraging the maximum amount of private funds, reactivating long-stalled sites, and encouraging job creation.
The four remediation and redevelopment projects, which represent 11 acres of potential redevelopment statewide, include
Meriden - $1,725,000 to remediate and rehabilitate the former Record Journal building at 11 Crown Street. The proposed private development includes 81 residential units and commercial/retail space
Middletown - $500,000 to remediate a former retail facility at 339 Main Street into a vibrant, mixed-use facility that will serve as a destination for consumers.
Stratford - $1,205,000 to remediate and abate a 3.6-acre former public school site at 1000 East Broadway. The town plans to seek redevelopment opportunities that feature mixed-use, transit-oriented development.
Vernon - $2,000,000 to remediate and redevelop the Amerbelle Mill and Daniels Mill in the heart of the downtown Rockville historic district. These properties have the potential for significant commercial development.
The eight assessment projects, which represent 451 acres of future development, include:
* Ansonia - $146,000 grant for investigation of two city-owned parcels at 497-501 East Main Street and 153 Main Street.
* Hartford - $85,000 grant for investigation of 3.4 acres at 1212 Main Street, a component of the Downtown North redevelopment.
* New Britain - $200,000 grant for investigation of four downtown parcels with strong transit-oriented development potential in connection to the CTfastrak system.
* Newtown - $150,000 grant for investigation of the 30-acre former Batchelder site at 44 and 46a Swamp Road.
* Norwich - $200,000 grant for investigation of 26 Shipping Street
* Preston - $165,000 grant for investigation of the former Norwich Hospital site on Route 12
* Torrington - $100,000 grant for investigation of a former dry cleaning facility at 18 Mason Street.
* Waterbury - $200,000 grant for investigation of 11 acres at 130 Freight Street and on West Main Street.
"Advancing Connecticut's brownfield agenda has been a top priority for Governor Malloy since taking office because this kind of support represents an investment in the state's long-term economic health and the revitalization of our communities," DECD Commissioner Catherine Smith said. "In fact, since 2012, DECD has invested $138 million in brownfield redevelopment, which is one of the smartest ways to create jobs and invest in our urban centers."
"Today's announcement is the latest example of the extraordinary level of commitment by Governor Malloy and Commissioner Smith to the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields throughout Connecticut," Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Rob Klee said. "Brownfield redevelopment is an investment that helps to protect human health and the environment and grow our economy. These grants will help turn sites that have been a blight on many communities into assets that communities can once again be proud. The continuing success of Connecticut's brownfields redevelopment program would not be possible without the strong partnership between state and local government, local communities, and private developers."
"Under Governor Malloy's leadership, Connecticut has developed one of the most active brownfield remediation programs in the country, and with this new round of projects we are taking the next steps towards returning more sites to productive reuse," DECD Deputy Commissioner Tim Sullivan said. "Our office looks forward to working these 12 cities and towns to bring their visions for redevelopment and revitalization to reality."
