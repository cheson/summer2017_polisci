Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Catherine Smith today announced the results of a new analysis on the First Five jobs initiative (now referred to as the First Five Plus), one of the state's flagship economic development programs. To date, nearly 3,800 new jobs have been created at the 13 participating companies.
The 13 First Five Plus companies are investing a total of nearly $1.3 billion in new infrastructure and human capital, which is over five times the state's assistance in loans and grants.
"The First Five Plus initiative has been a huge success, bringing new jobs to our residents and new income to our state," Governor Malloy said. "When I took office, we didn't have existing toolkits to help large corporations expand, nor did we help small businesses thrive. This report demonstrates that the work we've done is and will continue to pay long-term dividends to Connecticut. We are proud to partner not only with these companies, but other organizations that are eager to participate. This report shows that we are moving in the right direction as we not only retain valuable jobs, but create new ones."
Key findings of the report include:
The 13 First Five Plus companies have created about 3,800 jobs, well on their way to the goal of 5,264 new jobs for Connecticut residents.
The companies are investing almost $1.3 billion within Connecticut, over five times the amount of assistance the state has provided through grants and loans. In short, the public assistance is yielding multiples in private investments.
