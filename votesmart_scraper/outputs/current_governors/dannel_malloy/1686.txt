Malloy Urges Reopening Of Rell Chief Of Staff Investigation

Category: Ethics
The following is a statement by Democratic-endorsed, gubernatorial candidate Dan Malloy:
"In light of recent revelations, I am calling today for Connecticut's Chief State's Attorney Christopher L. Morano to reopen the investigation of Gov. Rell's Chief of Staff, Lisa Moody, and charges that the Rell Administration engaged in illegal fundraising for the Governor's reelection campaign and interfered with an investigation by the Connecticut legislature into those allegations. The recent discovery that Gov. Rell's Chief of Staff appears to have misled the legislature, under oath, clearly warrants further investigation.
"Since last December, we have seen a disturbing, bizarre story unfold involving ethical lapses at the highest levels of the Rell Administration. The only thing that is clear is that Gov. Rell's Chief of Staff has at the very least muddied the waters with her testimony before the legislative committee investigating this matter. As a result, the people of Connecticut are no closer to the truth today than they were six months ago, when questions regarding this matter were first raised.
"I commend the work of the legislature in trying to ascertain the truth. At the same time, I am frustrated as the more questions get answered by the Rell administration, the more questions get raised. Haven't we had enough in this state? The people of Connecticut deserve a swift but thorough investigation. If the timing is inopportune for Chief State Attorney Morano to lead this investigation, then I encourage him to appoint a special prosecutor in order to give this serious matter the swift and serious attention it deserves.
