Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: April 26, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement after learning that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has granted Mariano Cardoso a temporary stay of removal. Last week, Governor Malloy wrote to immigration officials to request that they defer a deportation order for Cardoso, who is nearing completion of his engineering degree at Capital Community College in Hartford.

"This is the news for which Mariano Cardoso has been waiting, and I couldn't be more pleased with the Department of Homeland Security's decision," said Governor Malloy. "This young man is working toward his degree in the only country he's ever known. That he could not make a decision for himself when he was brought to this country at 22 months of age should not impede his ability to make a better life for himself here, now. I look forward to seeing what contributions to this state and this country Mariano makes in his future career and personal aspirations."
