Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to today's U.S. Supreme Court ruling concerning "straw" purchases of guns:

"Today the Supreme Court made it clear that reasonable state and federal gun violence prevention laws are without a doubt constitutional. Thanks to this decision, it is less likely that someone can find a way around the system and purchase a gun illegally. Reducing the number of straw purchases will make our states and our nation safer, period.

"While this decision is a good one, I want to again call on Congress to do what the vast, vast majority of Americans want them to do -- pass common sense gun violence prevention legislation."
