Governor Dannel P. Malloy will release his first state bonding agenda Friday, which is squarely focused on creating new jobs in Connecticut, and keeping the ones we have.

"I have been very clear that borrowing money for operating expenses is not something I think is a good idea," said Governor Malloy. "But using our bonding authority to make smart, strategic choices to help create jobs and invest in Connecticut's physical and technological infrastructure is a really good idea. It's exactly what we need to do to get our state back on track once again."

Among the 34 projects on the agenda, funds allocated will save or create nearly 6,600 jobs in the state.
