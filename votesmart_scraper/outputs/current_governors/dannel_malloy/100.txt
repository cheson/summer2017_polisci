Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements regarding the vote today in the Connecticut General Assembly on the "Juan F." agreement:
Governor Malloy said, "Today the General Assembly let politics stand in the way of progress for our most vulnerable children and families. This plan was supported by the plaintiffs, the federal court monitor, advocates, national experts, and the Attorney General's Office, and yet it was not enough for the legislators who cast votes against the measure. They have now voted to keep Connecticut under federal oversight, even though a federal court has acknowledged the state's significant improvements.
"We may not have another opportunity in the near future to exit federal oversight and it will do us well to remember this fact as we suffer the consequences of this embarrassing inaction. I commend the 44 legislators, and especially Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, who voted to approve this measure that would ultimately allow the state to resume its sovereign responsibility for the welfare of its children."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "The Department of Children and Families has made important changes to better serve our young people and their families. The vote today is disappointing. We missed the opportunity to backstop that progress and to regain full control of a key state agency."
