Democratic nominee for Governor Dan Malloy today responded to news that Mohegan Sun will lay off 475 employees. Said Malloy:

"My heart goes out to the employees and their families who will be affected by these layoffs. The news, unfortunately, does not come as a shock. It's one more reminder that Connecticut continues to lose ground in the one area that matters most to us and to our economy: jobs. That's one reason I was at Bradley Airport yesterday discussing a plan to spur economic growth via our state airports, and it's the reason that Nancy Wyman and I have laid out a smart, comprehensive strategy for growing jobs across Connecticut in the years ahead.

"In part we'll do that by understanding what works in various parts of the state. In eastern Connecticut, for example, I'd focus on using the tourism and hospitality industry that, when properly supported, serves as the lifeblood of thousands of small businesses in the region. I'd also work with local leaders to make sure we protect Electric Boat.

"As Mayor of Stamford, I spent 14 years working to create a vibrant economy -- and that's what I'll do across the state when I become Governor."
