Malloy Campaign Launches Major Website Upgrade
"talkCT Blog" Expands Dialogue for Connecticut's Future
Stamford - Dan Malloy, Democratic candidate for Governor of Connecticut, today announced
the official launch of his upgraded campaign website that includes a new blog called talkCT,
more breaking news, and updated issues-based messages from Malloy, at www.danmalloy.com.
"My campaign team and I are committed to making danmalloy.com a community destination
point for anyone who cares about making Connecticut a better place to live, work and raise a
family", Malloy said. "We are especially excited about our new talkCT blog, which promises to
be the most up to date and compelling issues-driven gubernatorial blog in the State of
Connecticut."
Malloy explained that with talkCT, he is encouraging people to participate in a cyber-dialogue
for Connecticut's future, where real issues and solutions can be openly discussed. "The Malloy
for Governor Campaign will take cues from the talkCT dialogue to further bolster and refine our
own vision and objectives for realizing an economically viable and livable Connecticut for the
21st Century, Malloy added. "Dialogue and understanding are critically important precursors to
action - we listen, we get it, and then and only then do we act. That's been the hallmark of my
public service track-record. That's the kind of governor Connecticut deserves, and that's the
kind of governor I will be."
