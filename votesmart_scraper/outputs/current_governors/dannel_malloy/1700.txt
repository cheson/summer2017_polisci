Dan Malloy Announces Plan For Universal Health Care In Connecticut

Malloy's plan ensures universal access to affordable health care, reduces health care costs, and focuses on improving public health and wellness
HARTFORD -- Dan Malloy, the endorsed Democratic candidate for governor of Connecticut, today announced his plan for universal health care for the state.
Malloy will discuss his plan and tour the Community Health Services, Inc. in Hartford, where he will be joined by State Representative Peggy Sayers, Co-Chair of the Public Health Committee, and rJo Winch, Majority Leader of the Hartford City Council.
Malloy's plan, which builds off his nationally-recognized work in providing universal health care to all children, will ensure that the nearly 400,000 people in the state who lack insurance will have access to affordable coverage. His plan will also reduce costs so that those individuals and families struggling with the skyrocketing costs of insurance will be able to afford health care.
"Today in Connecticut nearly 400,000 people are without health insurance," said Malloy. "Most of those who lack coverage are children and working families -- meaning either their employers don't offer health insurance, or because of the skyrocketing costs of insurance the policies are too expensive. And those people who do have coverage are paying among the highest insurance premiums in the nation. Meanwhile Connecticut also has a growing public health crisis. Our state has among the highest rates of some ailments and diseases -- including asthma and cancer -- in the entire nation, and is facing a severe nursing shortage."
