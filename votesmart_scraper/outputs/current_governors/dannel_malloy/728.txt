Gov. Malloy & Lt. Gov. Wyman Statements on U.S. Supreme Court Contraception Ruling

Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements concerning today's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that closely held corporations with religious owners can be exempt from the requirement to cover contraception:

"While we should all respect each other's right to hold different positions based on religious beliefs, women should not be denied access to reproductive healthcare benefits due to the personal beliefs of their employer. Today's decision from the Supreme Court is an affront to that very basic and fundamental idea," said Governor Malloy. "In our diverse society, it is unconscionable that the religious beliefs of a private, for-profit employer can dictate the kind of medical care that is available to an employee. We will review this decision and assess the impact it may have in Connecticut."

"Providing the option of contraceptive coverage is part of serving the healthcare needs of women, it is just that simple," said Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman. "Carving out exemptions to medicines or treatment is tantamount to restricting access--it puts women at risk and that is unacceptable. This Supreme Court decision reminds us that we have a lot left to do in our fight for equity for women."
