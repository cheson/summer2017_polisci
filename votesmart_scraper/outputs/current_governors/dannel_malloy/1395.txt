Gov. Dan Malloy wants more green spent in Connecticut, and he's pushing for repeal of the state's blue laws.

Package store owners in Connecticut are not keen on repealing the blue laws. They see no benefit, but Malloy who is fighting hard for repeal of the ban on Sunday liquor sales says Connecticut is losing a lot of money as shoppers there cross the borders on Sunday to buy wine, beer, and liquor.

"Let me assure you that the businesses in New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island don't want us to change our laws because they know they're getting millions of dollars of sales from Connecticut that goes across the border to their states to access lower prices and more convenience," Malloy told WCBS 880 Connecticut Bureau Chief Fran Schneidau on Tuesday.

Malloy estimates Connecticut is losing about $600 million just on Sunday sales as folks there travel across state lines to buy not only beer, but cheaper gas too.
