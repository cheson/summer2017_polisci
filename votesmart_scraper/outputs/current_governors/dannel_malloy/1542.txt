Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: May 3, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement after the Connecticut State Senate passed the FY12/FY13 Biennium Budget.

"The Senators who voted for this budget early this morning should be commended for making the tough decisions necessary to begin the process of getting Connecticut's fiscal house in order. That was a tough vote to make, but it was the right vote to make. It was a vote for an honest budget, one that's balanced with no gimmicks, and one that will stabilize the state's finances and lead to our ultimate goal: job creation. I'd like to thank Senate President Don Williams, Majority Leader Marty Looney, Appropriations Chairman Toni Harp and Finance Chairman Eileen Daily in particular. They took the budget I proposed, they made it better, and they passed it."
