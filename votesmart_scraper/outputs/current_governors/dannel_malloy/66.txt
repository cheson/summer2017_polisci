Gov. Malloy Statement on President Trump's FY18 Budget Proposal
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding President Trump's fiscal year 2018 budget proposal:
"If President Trump truly wanted to put "America first,' he would start by putting our people and our common values first in his budget. Instead, the administration gets it terribly wrong in this proposal. This proposal guts programs that protect the environment and provide people access to critical services like housing, education, energy assistance, and child nutrition. All of this comes on top of a proposed $880 billion dollar cut to Medicaid. These are services that we in Connecticut have continued to support, even as we've made hard but necessary reductions in spending. My administration will do all that we can to work with our federal delegation to ensure that this budget proposal does not come to pass."
