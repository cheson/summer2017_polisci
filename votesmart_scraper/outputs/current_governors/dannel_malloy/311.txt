Gov. Malloy Releases Economic Impact Numbers of Replacing the Hartford Viaduct
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Nov. 17, 2015
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that an economic analysis performed on the I-84 Viaduct in Hartford demonstrates that the benefits of replacing the aging, 2.5-mile stretch of highway are two to three times the cost of its anticipated replacement. Replacement - rather than inaction - will generate billions in economic activity while supporting thousands of jobs. Allowing the Viaduct to deteriorate will impose huge costs on travelers as well as to businesses.
"We know that for decades Connecticut underinvested, and we know that our failure to do so curbed our ability to attract businesses and grow our economy. Today, we're saying that the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of action - that making a down payment on a project that we must replace will generate billions in economic activity and grow thousands of jobs. To move our state forward, we must make our infrastructure best-in-class," Governor Malloy said. "This 50-year old structure is overdue for replacement - it costs millions each year in maintenance costs to keep it in a state of good repair. We have a clear opportunity to do the smart, proactive step and build for the long-term. Let's seize it."
