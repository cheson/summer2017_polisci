Gov. Malloy Statement on Access to Public Records
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: June 5, 2013
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy tonight made the following statement upon final passage of Senate Bill 1149, An Act Making Technical Changes to the Statutes Concerning Public Records:

"My goal with this legislation was to provide some measure of protection for the families affected by the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. But the fact is, all families have a right to grieve in private. Those who lose loved ones to violence have a right to protect themselves against further anguish.

"This is a difficult issue, requiring all of us to balance deeply held beliefs and important public policy values. I commend the legislators on coming to an agreement that respects the privacy of grieving families."
