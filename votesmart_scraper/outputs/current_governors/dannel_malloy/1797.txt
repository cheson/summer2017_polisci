Stamford, Connecticut - Tuesday, August 2, 2005 - Mayor Dannel P. Malloy announced that the City of Stamford today sold $17.5 million of refunding bonds, which will produce budgetary savings totaling $598,000 after expenses. The savings will be realized through reduced debt service payments, mostly over the next two years, as a direct result of the City's outstanding AAA bond rating (one of only 19 cities in the nation with such a rating). The refunding bonds have a total interest cost of 4.2%, including all costs related to the sale. The present value of the savings is $427,000.
"I am glad we have been able to take advantage of low interest rates through this and past refundings," said Mayor Dannel P. Malloy. "Making capital investments in Stamford has always been one of my priorities, and we have been able to keep the costs very low because of our excellent credit rating and the opportunities that it creates for us."
