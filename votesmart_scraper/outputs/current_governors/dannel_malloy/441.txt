Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the three apparent violations at Millstone identified by the NRC.
"I have been briefed by staff and DEEP Commissioner Klee. Dominion Power needs to fully cooperate with federal regulators in this probe. My team will work closely with the federal government and with the NRC to ensure this site remains compliant with all laws and regulations. Any deviation from that - anything that puts residents at risk - is simply unacceptable to me and unacceptable for the State of Connecticut."
