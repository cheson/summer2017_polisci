With the 2015 Atlantic Hurricane Season beginning June 1, Governor Dannel P. Malloy today is reminding Connecticut residents to be prepared for any severe weather that may impact the state. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with the principal threat period for Connecticut occurring between mid-August and mid-October.
"As we have experienced, it only takes one hurricane or tropical storm to make landfall to have a devastating impact on our state," Governor Malloy said. "Now is the time to prepare. I urge residents to take three simple preparedness steps: Get a kit, make a plan, and stay informed. These three steps will allow you to become more resilient to any storm or emergency you may face."
"Now is the time to become familiar with the potential risks your community and neighborhood may face, such as storm surge, flooding, road or bridge closures," Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection Commissioner Dora B. Schriro said. "If a storm is approaching your area, carefully monitor weather reports and follow all of the instructions provided by public safety officials."
