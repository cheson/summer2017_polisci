Press Release

Location: Hartford,CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced today that $4.3 million in funding is being awarded to nine regional councils of government and a regional economic district to assist towns and cities throughout the state in reducing costs and burdens by providing support for their efforts to regionalize services and coordinate essential functions of government.
The grants are being awarded under the state's Regional Performance Incentive Program (RPIP), which is administered by the Office of Policy and Management (OPM). Any councils of governments, two or more municipalities, or regional economic district are eligible for a grant under RPIP.
"In this new economic reality, it is crucial that we remain steadfast in our commitment to improve and streamline the way that government works at every level," Governor Malloy said. "These grants will encourage municipalities and regions to rethink the way they provide local services - resulting in more efficiencies and smaller costs for taxpayers."
"Regionalization of services is not only cost-effective and economical, it is smart policy," OPM Secretary Ben Barnes said. "As we continue to make difficult decisions about funding services at the state level, we must support municipalities and regions that are coming together to coordinate and provide important services to residents while saving taxpayer dollars."
