Gov. Malloy Hails Final Passage of Bioscience Connecticut
Statement
By: Dan Malloy

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy hails final passage of his Bioscience Connecticut proposal, which will provide 3,000 jobs annually between 2012-2018, and create more than 16,000 jobs through 2037.

"This is about creating new jobs, sustained economic development, and staking out the ground that will again make Connecticut a leader in an emerging industry. In my opinion, it's a win-win. More than that, it sends a clear message and plants a very firm flag in terms of Connecticut's commitment to being a leader in the bioscience industry. The state's flagship public university and its Health Center must be looked at as more than just a school or just a hospital -- we need to view them as economic drivers and ways in which we can leverage our education system into long-term, sustained economic growth. I look forward to signing this bill into law and embarking upon this new project to help put people back to work."
