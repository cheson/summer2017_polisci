Governor Dannel P. Malloy today encouraged residents -- with more impending snow on the way in the coming days -- to clear snow from rooftops, if possible, as a safety precaution to prevent potential collapses.

The Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection's Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DESPP/DEMHS) has been working with the State Building Inspector and the Commission on Fire Prevention and Control to disseminate the message to municipalities, asking them to assess snow buildup on their public buildings and agricultural facilities. If necessary, they should begin the process to remove the snow.

"With active winter storm pattern still anticipated to continue over the next several weeks, it is imperative that residents, businesses and governments clear snow from rooftops now to prevent heavy buildup," Governor Malloy said. "Especially with another snowstorm expected to impact the state this weekend, we should get this work completed the sooner the better."

DESPP Commissioner Dora Schriro said, "Important preventive steps such as these help to keep Connecticut's residents safe and secure in their homes and businesses."

Governor Malloy also encouraged residents with elderly or disabled neighbors to offer assistance with roof clearing if appropriate. In addition, residents who opt to pay for roof-clearing services may contact the Better Business Bureau to ensure the quality of the vendor.

DEMHS has posted documents onto its website outlining safety guidelines and procedures for roof load safety.
