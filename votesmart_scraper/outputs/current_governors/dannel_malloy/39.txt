Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements regarding today's vote in Congress to adopt legislation implementing Trumpcare:
Governor Malloy said, "Today's vote by Congress is appalling. This action is a grave disservice to the people of our nation and undermines the core mission of the Affordable Care Act. The fact remains -- Trumpcare threatens coverage for some of our most vulnerable populations, including seniors, persons with disabilities, and all Americans with pre-existing conditions. Our collective concern should be about stabilizing the marketplace and increasing access for all individuals to quality healthcare. The only thing that this proposal accomplishes is ensuring that when it comes to healthcare, Americans pay more for less."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "This is an inexcusable lack of leadership from Washington -- and that's why I'm convening a bipartisan working group in Connecticut to address these federal changes. Healthcare reform should be deliberated as a policy challenge, not a political one. Under the Republican plan, healthcare costs rise for consumers and for the state. We lose hundreds of millions in federal funding and rising costs could be catastrophic for more than half a million Connecticut residents who have pre-existing conditions. Trumpcare further destabilizes the healthcare marketplace -- and we still don't have a CBO score or a full understanding of how many Americans will lose health insurance under the plan. The bill is bad, the process to gain passage was bad, and the impacts on our residents and the economy are bad."
