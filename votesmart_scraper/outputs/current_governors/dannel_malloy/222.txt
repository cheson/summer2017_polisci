Gov. Malloy Urges Congress to Take Swift Action on Zika Funding
By: Dan Malloy
Date: May 10, 2016
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement, joining a call from Governors across the nation who are urging for federal funding for the Zika virus:
"This is too important to ignore - and too important to be held hostage by Washington gridlock. That's why I'm urging Congress to immediately approve President Obama's request for federal funds to protect American families from the threat posed by the Zika virus.
"We have been actively taking steps for months to prepare for Zika, including a coordinated, cross-functional response across agencies. We have been approved by the CDC for expedited testing at the Connecticut Department of Public Health Laboratory and continue to monitor the situation closely. We are doing everything we can at the state level - and it's because we are on the frontlines of response.
"I strongly urge Congress to immediately approve President Obama's request for federal funding to bolster our health emergency preparedness. Preparation is critical, and we in Connecticut are preparing to the extent we can. The members of our Congressional delegation have been ardent supporters of an agreement for additional federal funding, and Congress would do well to heed the calls of elected officials not just in Connecticut, but around the nation."
