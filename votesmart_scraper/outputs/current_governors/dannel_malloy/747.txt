Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP) will receive nearly $7.2 million in state funding to provide a technology upgrade to state public safety radio system. The State Bond Commission approved the funding at its last meeting on May 30.

"Whether it's a fire, a stranded motorist, a hurricane or other emergency, reliable radio communications are vital link to the state providing an appropriate and timely response," said Governor Malloy. "Funding these improvements to DESPP's public radio system will provide greater resiliency to our overall emergency communications network and more dependable communications for our first responder community."

These funds will finance the costs of phase 1 replacement and upgrade of the agency's radio communication systems. This phase includes replacement of troop and headquarters dispatch equipment, 212 mobile radios, 40 control station desktop radios and a dynamic system resilience back up master site.

Specifically, DESPP's improvements will include upgrades to radio equipment at State Police troops and provide for significant improvements to the state's 700/800 MHZ radio system's resilience by providing backup capabilities which will reduce the risk of failures and outages. The current 700/800 MHZ system supports over 8400 users representing state agencies, tribal nations, all local public safety answering points (PSAPS), and other partner response organizations such as the Metropolitan Transit Authority and Millstone Nuclear Power Plant.
