Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the announcement made by the White House today that the United States has admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees:
"We are a nation of immigrants - and we are a stronger nation because of it. As a state that openly welcomed Syrian refugees when others wouldn't, I want to congratulate the President and the White House for hitting his goal. When we open our hearts, and we strive to be more inclusive, we grow as a nation. Welcoming Syrian refugees escaping the tragedy and humanitarian crisis overseas is the right thing to do."
