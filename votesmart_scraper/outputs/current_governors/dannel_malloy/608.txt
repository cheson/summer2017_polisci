Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to preliminary negative test results from the Massachusetts State Public Health laboratory on the patient being treated for Ebola-like symptoms at Yale-New Haven Hospital.

"Certainly this is encouraging news," said Governor Malloy. "While the initial test results are negative, Dr. Mullen has made the determination that it is in the best interest for residents in New Haven and the surrounding area that the patient remain isolated as we await official test results from the CDC."

Earlier today, Governor Malloy outlined the state's efforts to safeguard against the spread of Ebola. The Governor has also directed every hospital in the state, in coordination with Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel, to perform a drill within the next week to assure that procedures are up to standard.

In addition, Governor Malloy today also announced that he is convening a Unified Command Team (UCT) to be chaired by Department of Public Health (DPH) Commissioner Jewel Mullen. The UCT will serve as point in the state's ongoing emergency management efforts.

Governor Malloy added, "We will continue to monitor the current situation and provide whatever resources we have at our disposal to ensure that everyone -- from the nurses in our emergency rooms to our first responders and our law enforcement personnel -- has the ability to do their critically important jobs safely and effectively."

Residents with concerns are encouraged to call United Way 211, which is providing information and links on its website at www.211ct.org, or call 2-1-1.
