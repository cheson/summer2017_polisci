Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement on the state's biennial budget:

"In February, I highlighted certain priorities that I thought were critical to moving Connecticut forward. I want to thank the Connecticut House of Representatives for passing a budget that reflects those priorities, and look forward to a similar outcome in the Senate.

"This budget contains no new taxes, and includes some modest but important tax relief for every family struggling to make ends meet.

"This budget makes substantial investments in public education, so that our children, no matter where they live, can go to schools that will prepare them for the future.

"This budget continues our unprecedented economic development agenda, so that we can continue to compete aggressively for jobs while protecting the jobs we already have.

"This budget honors our past obligations by finally funding our pension system, saving Connecticut's residents billions of dollars down the road.

"And last but certainly not least, this budget is fully balanced under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

"Of course, no budget is perfect and this budget required many tough cuts, many tough choices and hard compromises. We still have a long way to go. But this budget shows that we've got our priorities straight, and we are determined to keep Connecticut moving forward."
