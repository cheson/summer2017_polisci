A Proactive Approach: Environmental Protection and Economic Growth
Good environmental policy impacts a great deal more than the ecosystem. Clean air, safe water and healthy land - these aren't just descriptors of a great place to live, they're the critical elements for building business. Restoring a fundamental balance between the natural world and the places we work and live improves our overall quality of life, makes Connecticut a more desirable place to do business, and puts us on a path to a more sustainable future.
Understanding the impact that our environment has on our economy, as Governor I'll be guided by the simple principle that Connecticut's natural resources need to be protected and enhanced. Environmental enhancement is about restoring a natural and attractive balance between development and the natural landscape. It's about considering the sustainable or "green" way of accomplishing our goals instead of the old way of doing things. And it's about understanding that good environmental policy has a positive ripple effect across the state.
Thankfully, while we still have much work to do on these issues, Connecticut has momentum stemming from a solid foundation of success. In recent years, the state has established itself as leader in addressing global warming pollution, signing on to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and passing climate change legislation committing to a 20 percent reduction in 1990-level global warming pollution by 2020, and an 80 percent reduction by 2050. Connecticut's work on this front has helped drive progress in other states and on the national level.
It is critical that we continue pushing forward on energy conservation and innovation in renewable energy technologies if we are to meet the mandates set forth in the 2008 climate change bill. This legislation, as well as our work on emissions standards (which has shaped national policy) helps drive the state's economic engine. Recently Chevrolet announced that, due in part to Connecticut's leadership on environmental issues, Connecticut will be one of the first markets to see their electric car, demonstrating that efforts to jump-start business do not need to start with environmental rollbacks.
To be clear, the state needs to be thoughtful and strategic about how we protect and invest in our environment. For example, while Connecticut should absolutely explore wind energy, locating windmills in Long Island Sound is just a bad idea. The Sound is a narrow, navigable body of water home to a great deal of commerce and recreation - installing windmills would be a hazard and an impediment to the Sound's eight billion dollar economy. It would also endanger local wildlife populations, most notably a number of bird species that migrate across the Sound and nest in along our coastline as well as on the islands that dot the estuary.
We can't let good intentions and a hair trigger supersede sound policy and diligent decision-making. There is no one-size fits all solution to Connecticut's energy problems, but when it comes the environment, we can't allow ourselves to be our own worst enemy.
My administration will protect Connecticut's natural resources in the name of livability, public health, stewardship and economic growth. Connecticut is poised to lead the nation to a cleaner, greener new century. Only experienced leadership can get us there.
Real Smart Growth Experience
With a real commitment on the part of a Governor, state investments could be directed toward economic development projects that create jobs, preserve natural resources, restore and redevelop blighted properties and use green building materials and techniques. That's precisely what I did as Mayor of Stamford, where we made environmental improvement a fundamental goal of the way we did business.
In 1998, I established an energy engineer position in Stamford - one of the few cities across the country with an engineer solely responsible for improving energy efficiency. Because of this action, Stamford has been able to protect the environment and reduce costs at the same time.
Our Engineering Bureau worked to implement energy conservation measures throughout Stamford's public school system, saving taxpayers' dollars. Design of our new magnet school harnessed the power of the sun and wind for clean energy. It also instituted innovative energy efficiency controls and met LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) silver certification. As a result, Stamford qualified for an energy efficiency rebate of $165,379.
Under my leadership, Stamford also implemented a framework for accomplishing a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2018. During my tenure, we reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 180,000,000 pounds and instituted measures that were supported by more than $2 million in incentives and grants from Connecticut Light and Power.
We also partnered with the Connecticut Energy Efficiency Fund and CL&P to connect Stamford residents to cost-saving energy conservation measures, such as reduced-priced energy-efficient lighting and weatherization assistance and helped them take advantage of renewable energy opportunities available through the Clean Energy Fund.
As a result of environmental enhancement measures I instituted as Mayor, the City of Stamford was recognized as an environmental leader in our region by the Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnership. We received the "2008 Connecticut Climate Change Leadership Award" from Governor Rell.
# In 2009, my administration began efforts to: Create an Energy Improvement District to enable heavy energy users to generate clean power onsite and reduce their reliance on the power grid
# Install Fuel Cells to power the government center with clean, renewable energy
# Expand recycling efforts with the obtainable goal of reducing waste disposal costs by $700,000
# Improve our parks and greenways to enhance recreation and better protect wildlife habitat
The bottom line is this: as Mayor, I recognized that true environmental improvement is about much more than simply abiding by and enforcing state laws and regulations; there's more to preserving and restoring our environment than the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) can ever do. My broader vision of environmental enhancement improved Stamford's quality of life, promoted cleaner air and conservation, and saved taxpayers dollars at the same time.
As Governor, I will work to expand this vision of smart growth across the state, with a specific focus on the following areas:
Clean Water: Long Island Sound - Our Heritage and Our Future
Long Island Sound is one of Connecticut's most beautiful and iconic natural resources. It's also one of our most hardworking. A window to our rich maritime history, the Sound contributes $8 billion to our regional economy each year through marine trades, the seafood industry, recreation and tourism1.
Yet, every year two billion gallons of untreated sewage flows into Long Island Sound, threatening the long term viability of this precious resource.
Years of unchecked pollution have taken its toll on the estuary. The Sound's "dead zone", a hypoxic condition caused by polluted runoff, is stressing and killing marine life, and in 2008, contamination closed or "advisoried" Connecticut beaches on 135 days, up 25 percent from 2007. Between 2004-2009, shellfish beds around Bridgeport were closed 50 percent of all harvestable days due to contamination that created a public health hazard.
# As governor I will: Work with environmental experts to find innovative ways to reduce the pollution, toxins and chemicals flowing into Long Island Sound. I will make investing in clean water projects such as sewage treatment plant upgrades a priority. In doing so we will not only reduce pollution but grow jobs in construction, facilities operation, and engineering.
# Engage municipalities in the fight against water pollution by incentivizing green infrastructure like permeable pavers, vegetated swales, and greening of public areas to prevent runoff from reaching the storm system. Allowing rainwater to soak into and filter through soil can significantly reduce the amount of toxins reaching the Sound.
# Ensure that DEP has the resources and support it needs to seek out polluters and hold them accountable for fouling the waterways and harming marine life.
# Encourage homeowners and businesses around the state to adopt greener and cleaner habits including discouraging residential dumping and encouraging rain barrels, rain gardens, green roofs, and other mechanisms for slowing storm water or preventing it from reaching the system altogether.
# The state's mechanism for funding clean water projects, the Clean Water Fund, is a critically important program that both cuts water pollution, thereby protecting our marine trades, seafood and tourism industries, and grows jobs in construction, science and facilities management. As Governor, I will make clean water projects a priority for my administration and ensure that projects stay on track as well as assuring that the DEP has the resources to assure that the state is able to carry out its obligations under the Clean Water Act.
It's imperative that the next governor has experience working with legislative and municipal leaders on both the state and federal level to ensure these initiatives go from the drawing board to implementation. Legislation is currently being debated in Congress that would build upon existing efforts to clean up the Sound, including proposals to reduce pollution flowing into the watershed that ultimately ends up in the Sound. Leadership on making initiatives like that a reality will require collaboration and cooperation between Connecticut and its neighboring states.
Clean Air: Energy Efficiency and Transportation Needs
Cleaner air is about pollution reduction, pollution that comes primarily from three places: energy inefficient buildings, power generation, and a broken transportation system that leaves most Connecticut residents with little choice but to rely on already crowded highways for their daily commutes and other travel.
Clean air is also about a healthier population - especially when it comes to kids. One in ten children in Connecticut suffers from asthma, or more than 86,000 kids throughout the state.2 Unsurprisingly, the problem is worse in Connecticut's largest cities where children are also subjected to higher levels of diesel pollution. In fact, despite making up less than 18 percent of the total state population, children in these areas account for more than 40 percent of all child hospitalizations and emergency visits related to asthma.3 Our efforts in Stamford show that real progress can be made in reducing these harmful emissions, but more needs to be done - and it needs to happen statewide.
By reducing the amount of electricity we use, making our buildings more efficient and by developing better and cleaner public transportation options, Connecticut can reduce pollution and help everyone breathe a little easier.
Energy Efficiency
The environment and energy go hand in hand - becoming more energy efficient will help lower energy costs, make Connecticut businesses more competitive, grow the economy, and positively impact our environment. What follows are my thoughts on energy's role in promoting clean air. My broader plans for energy can be viewed here.
We all can and should take steps to become more energy efficient, and state government has a special responsibility to lead the way. I've committed to leading a statewide energy efficiency drive among Connecticut residents with a goal of reducing our energy usage by 15 percent over the next two years, making Connecticut one of the most energy efficient states in the nation.
# That process begins with making our buildings more energy efficient. In fact, energy inefficient buildings contribute 40 percent of polluting greenhouse gas emissions to our air4. As Governor, I will push for advanced energy codes for new buildings, including requirements that new construction be "electric-vehicle ready", and establish a state goal for "net-zero energy buildings," or buildings that produce at least as much energy as they consume.
# Connecticut is already home to an established solar and renewable energy industry directly and indirectly employing over ten thousand residents5 , but it's critical that our next governor have the long-term vision and commitment necessary to protect the Clean Energy and Energy Efficiency Funds that support and bolster these industries. As Governor, I will protect the Clean Energy and Energy Efficiency Funds, which are key to providing services that cut home energy use, reduce pollution, incent development and installation of renewable technologies, provide jobs for energy auditors, solar installers, and others in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors.
In 2010, Governor Rell cut the Energy Efficiency Fund, moving 35 percent of the fund into the state's coffers for the next eight years to fill the budget deficit. This cut will dramatically reduce the amount of money dedicated to providing the popular and money-saving efficency programs for residents, businesses and municipalities and likely force energy service businesses to lay off workers and move to neighboring states that are making higher levels of investment. The next administration will now have to work doubly hard to reverse the damage done by the cut to our economy and our environment.
# Recently, Governor Rell also vetoed landmark energy reform legislation. The bill was not perfect - few are - but it would have taken some substantial and important first steps in curbing air pollution as well as reducing energy consumption. I would have signed it. As Governor, I will push for many initiatives included in that bill, such as: Allow municipalities to bond for PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) financing, so property owners can take out low-interest loans to make energy efficiency improvements or add renewable technologies to their properties (the loan would be attached to the upgraded property, not the owner).
# Established current Energy Star guidelines as the minimum performance standard for televisions sold in the state, reducing carbon pollution by 105,000 metric tons - or the equivalent of removing 20,000 cars from the roads - and boosting energy savings enough to power 20,000 homes.
# Adding jobs to the solar industry by pushing for an increase in solar power usage. The bill that Gov. Rell vetoed would have added 300 megawatts in solar power over the next decade, with an estimated benefit of 1,200 jobs in the solar industry.
Transportation
It's no secret that Connecticut is over reliant on gasoline. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the state. It will take a multifaceted approach to change that. In addition to promoting new and cleaner transportation technologies - such as electric cars - we need to improve access to our railways and improve the railways themselves. In short, we need to provide people with more options from how they move themselves from point A to point B.
# As Mayor of Stamford, I instituted Transit Oriented Design (TOD) to better connect public transportation to everyday life and to give our residents options when it comes to transportation. We worked to make Stamford more walkable, and more connected to its historic center and street life. We restored the vibrancy of Main Street. And, I lead efforts to study the potential for light rail to connect our north-side and south-side residential neighborhoods to Metro-north and to integrate rail into Brownfield redevelopment projects. As Governor, I'll work to improve public transportation that will take cars off our roads and help clean up our air. That means supporting local communities in their efforts to build out parking at train stations, building new rail connections from New Haven to Springfield, working with Metro North to send more frequent cars up and down their lines, and partnering with Amtrak to increase Shoreline East service.
# I will actively work with our neighboring states to implement a Low Carbon Fuel Standard that reduces the carbon content of transportation fuels by 10% over the next decade, including taking the steps necessary to facilitate the roll out of electric vehicles.
More of my thoughts on transportation can be found at our website, and we'll be adding even more in the weeks ahead.
Land Use: Open Space Preservation and Brownfield Redevelopment
Connecticut's forests are our biggest weapon against climate change, and they need to be protected, both for our present well-being and for that of our children. I was a strong advocate of open space in Stamford, protecting and preserving 250 acres during my tenure as Mayor. I will continue that advocacy as Governor.
Unfortunately there have been instances at the state level when open-space purchases were perceived as providing sweetheart deals to politically-connected land-owners. Decisions about preserving open space and conserving nature should be driven by the goal of making Connecticut more livable, more attractive, and less wasteful - not driven by politics.
Additionally, as I laid out in my jobs plan, many of Connecticut's urban centers have had substantial portions of property wiped out because of brownfields. The contaminated industrial sites are a danger to public health and to our environment and a contributor to urban blight, but they're also an opportunity for economic growth.
We've seen what's possible when we make an investment in redeveloping these sites. In Stamford, the Harbor Point project recently won "Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design -- Neighborhood Development Gold" certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. The project is planned to include 4,000 residences, two hotels, and 400,000 sq. feet of retail and restaurant space.
# The Connecticut Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (CBRA) has made progress on many of the sites and should be commended, but the fact is more needs to be done. CBRA has identified hundreds of contaminated industrial sites in towns and cities throughout the state - the State should view each of these as an opportunity for economic development. As Governor, I will call for the creation of a $500 million revolving account to assist communities in paying for cleanup and restoration of brownfields, with the expectation that the state would recover all costs of that account in a reasonable time period.
Turning It Around
At times over the last decade and a half, the Governor's office has had a poor record when it comes to preserving and protecting our environment. The DEP, responsible for protection and enforcement, has been compromised by years of underfunding. On occasion the Governor's office has fought attempts to restore balance between conservation and development - but lasting, substantive progress has eluded us.
In 2008 the Governor threatened to veto the Global Warming Solutions Act passed by the legislature. Although Governor Rell eventually signed the bill, simply not vetoing it does not constitute leadership on issues as critical to the state's welfare as clean air, clean water and the negative impacts rising seas caused by global warming could have on the state.
While other states are making it easier for green energy companies to do business in the state, Connecticut's Governor has, over the past several years, threatened to undercut the very funding relied upon by solar manufacturers and installers. During her State of the State speech, Governor Rell waxed poetic about the benefits of the green economy and how "Kermit had it wrong all these years, it is easy being green." The very next day she proposed slashing the Clean Energy and Energy Efficiency Funds, which support thousands of efficiency and clean energy jobs in the state.
During this time of double talk, inaction, lax protection and planning, the environmental policy of the administration has primarily been to purchase land and preserve it as open space. Quite often these purchases are in more remote areas of the state - worthy of preservation when tied to preserving significant habitat resources, but also far removed from the everyday experiences of most Connecticut residents. Preserving natural habitat and rural vistas is important, but so too is restoring greenery to our more developed neighborhoods and communities.
As Governor, I will bring a new sensibility to preserving the environment - one that unites ecological stewardship with economic reality to find real solutions to the problems facing our state. I will not offer up the environment to industry like a sacrificial lamb, allowing polluters to roll back critical environmental protections simply to grow their profits.
Connecticut is a beautiful state with tremendous natural resources. Together we can achieve cleaner water, cleaner air, a healthier community, and a higher quality of life.
