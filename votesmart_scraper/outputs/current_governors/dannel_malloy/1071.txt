Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy, joined by Department of Housing Commissioner Evonne Klein, and state and local officials, today announced $4,973,865 in Main Street Investment Fund (MSIF) grants to 14 municipalities across Connecticut. The program, administered through the State Department of Housing, provides funding to develop or improve town commercial districts, attract small businesses, and improve pedestrian access and livability in town centers.

"Main Street Investment grants play an important role in strengthening economic development initiatives on the local level," said Governor Malloy. "This program is unique in that it builds a working partnership between state government and the smaller communities that are striving to strengthen their commercial centers and attract additional business. I applaud the leadership in Berlin, and in the other 13 towns, for their focus on creating accessible and livable downtowns."

"There is a recognizable link between housing, economic, and community development. All three are interdependent and all are crucial factors in the overall economic strategy that is moving Connecticut forward," said Commissioner Evonne M. Klein. "The Main Street Investment Fund is a vital tool that is helping communities revive commercial centers and downtown areas and lay the foundation for expanded economic activity and housing opportunities."

The Governor made the announcement at the Town Hall in Berlin, a community that is receiving $259,270 to revitalize Main Street and Farmington Avenue in the immediate vicinity of the Berlin Train Station. The project will improve pedestrian safety, encourage traffic calming, and add crosswalks and a median. It is part of the town's ongoing work to revitalize its commercial area.

"The new development funded by this grant will be a significant revitalizing force in downtown Berlin," said State Senator Terry Gerratana (D-New Britain). "Improving infrastructure around the Berlin Train Station will establish a pedestrian-friendly area that will prove instrumental in attracting new businesses and economic growth to the downtown area."

"This additional state investment allows us to move forward revitalizing Berlin's commercial area--promoting economic growth and growing jobs, which is my top priority. I want to thank Governor Malloy for his strong support for this project. I also want to thank Senator Gerratana and Representative Abercrombie who helped me secure this funding," said House Majority Leader Joe Aresimowicz (D-Berlin & Southington).

"I commend my Majority Leader, our Governor and all the people involved in recognizing the importance of prioritizing the allocation of funding for this project," said State Representative Cathy Abercrombie (D-Berlin). "I am proud of the work our legislative delegation is doing on behalf of our community. We are all in agreement that updates are needed if we want to revitalize and energize the train station area."

"This is great news for the Town of Berlin and I thank the Governor for his support," said Mayor Adam Salina. "Berlin's Main Street project plays an important role in our ongoing efforts to create a thriving, walkable, and pedestrian-friendly downtown. We are somewhat uniquely positioned with a rail line in our community--so we want to capitalize on that pedestrian traffic and offer commuters a great experience as well."
The Main Street Investment Fund provides financial incentives to eligible municipalities as well as owners of commercial private properties for expenditures that directly support and enhance a qualified project. Awards are not more than $500,000 and can be used for expenses such as building improvements, signage, lighting, and streetscape improvements.
