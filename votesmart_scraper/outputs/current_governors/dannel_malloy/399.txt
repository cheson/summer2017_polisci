Governor Dannel P. Malloy is applauding the Connecticut General Assembly for giving bipartisan, final approval today in favor of the "Second Chance Society" legislation he introduced that is designed to continue the progress being made in reducing the state's dropping crime rate, which is currently at a 48-year low, as well as ensuring nonviolent offenders are being reintegrated into society and become productive members of Connecticut's economy.
"We can truly be tough on crime by being smarter on crime, and that's why we're focusing on initiatives that work. The cycle our system currently encourages - one of permanent punishment - hurts too many families and communities," Governor Malloy said. "When we should have been focusing on permanent reform, we focused on permanent punishment. For too long, we built modern jails instead of modern schools. Because this bill passed, Connecticut has taken a giant step into the future. Our law enforcement professionals and courts can focus on lowering crime even further by channeling efforts towards serious, violent criminals and putting them behind bars for longer sentences. And most of all, these initiatives are focused on turning nonviolent offenders into productive members of our society that can contribute to our economy, rather than drain it. Ultimately, this will make our communities safer, and will make for a brighter tomorrow in Connecticut."
The Governor added, "These are smart criminal justice initiatives that are working in states throughout the country - both red and blue. And today in Connecticut, we have shown that Democrats and Republicans can come together to enact laws that will have a positive impact on crime reduction. I want to thank the leadership in the House and the Senate, including Senate President Looney, Speaker Sharkey, Senator Fasano, and Representative Klarides, as well as the Judiciary Committee chairmen and ranking members - Senator Coleman, Representative Tong, Senator Kissel and Representative Rebimbas - and the bipartisan majority who have moved this bill to my desk so that I can sign it into law."
Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said, "This legislation is part of a smarter, more strategic approach to reducing crime and recidivism. Under Governor Malloy's leadership, crime has dropped and Connecticut communities are safer - this is paramount to a better quality of life for all residents. Improving how we prepare and reintegrate ex-offenders into housing, employment, and services will bolster this progress. I applaud the legislature for sending this bill to the Governor's desk."
