Gov. Malloy: Bill Expanding College Access "Common Sense"
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement hailing a measure granting in-state tuition to students who reside in the state and complete four years of high school here, graduating with their diploma. Passing the Senate today, the same measure passed the House of Representatives earlier this month.

"This bill isn't controversial, it's common sense. At a time when we need to be helping our state's young men and women prepare for an ever-changing economy and compete with their counterparts in China, Japan and elsewhere, helping to make a college degree more accessible and affordable for those students who choose to pursue one is critically important. I'd like to thank Senators Martin Looney and Beth Bye and Representatives Juan Candelaria and Roberta Willis for their leadership on this issue, as well as those elected officials in both chambers who voted for this measure. I look forward to signing this bill into law, and with it, an increased opportunity for our state's students to succeed in whatever path they choose."
