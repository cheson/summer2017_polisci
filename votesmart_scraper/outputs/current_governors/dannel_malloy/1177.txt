Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman issued the following statement this afternoon upon final passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The U.S. House of Representatives voted 286-138 today to reauthorize the legislation.

"The bipartisan support of VAWA sends a clear message that we are committed to building a better, safer, more just life for women and girls everywhere. Ending violence against women requires us to engage on many levels -- through legislative and judicial action, increased access to mental health services, and through better education -- and it all starts with agreeing that violence, in all of its forms, is intolerable. This action by the House of Representatives is long overdue, but we applaud them for finally acting."
