Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

"Governor Christie's decision to pull out of the collaborative Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) reflects the kind of policymaking that must change if we are to move forward as a nation, take control of our energy future, and lead the way towards energy independence. While it is too early to know what the specific consequences for Connecticut may be, we remain committed to a leadership role in this innovative partnership with the remaining RGGI states. RGGI is an important mechanism for investing in the efficient, clean, low carbon economy of the future. RGGI funding supports energy efficiency programs, cuts greenhouse gas emissions, and promotes sustainable technologies that will mitigate our dependence on volatile energy markets. In Connecticut, RGGI auctions raised over $45 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. These investments are directly and indirectly responsible for creating nearly 7,000 jobs, reducing the energy consumption of 34,000 residential customers and 1,900 small businesses, and generating more than $137 million in employment income for the renewable and clean energy technologies that are the part of the economic future of Connecticut. This is a good program for Connecticut and the rest of the states in the partnership and we hope that Governor Christie will reconsider his decision."
