Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Connecticut Department of Housing (DOH) Commissioner Evonne M. Klein today announced that nearly $13 million is being awarded to 21 municipalities in Connecticut to provide important upgrades and improvements to the state's affordable housing stock and infrastructure.
Awarded under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Small Cities program, which is administered by DOH with funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the grants are awarded to small towns that have a population below 50,000 residents to advance projects that develop and preserve affordable housing, provide services to the most vulnerable residents in their communities, and also create and retain jobs.
"These projects will help so many local communities increase quality of life and make our state an even more attractive place to live, work and do business," Governor Malloy said. "These are investments in our neighborhoods, in the people who live here, and in our economic future."
"The CDBG program allows us to provide aid to some of our smaller towns for a variety of important projects. This year, we awarded a total of 21 grants. Twelve will fund public housing modernizations, seven will fund housing rehabilitation programs, one will fund a public facilities project, and one will fund a public service program," Commissioner Klein said. "These grants are available to Connecticut residents who, without this financial assistance, would be unable to make important repairs to their homes such as leaky roofs, replacing inefficient windows, and other structural repairs. These grants will have a lasting impact for years to come."
"From Killingly to Trumbull, these federal dollars will help local communities improve their housing and provide critical services that will allow folks throughout Connecticut to provide for their families and live healthier lives," the members of Connecticut's Congressional delegation said in a joint statement.
