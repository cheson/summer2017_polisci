Press Release
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Nov. 10, 2014
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy highlighted the release today of the FBI's Crime in the United States 2013 report, which shows that Connecticut had one of the largest decreases in violent crimes and property crimes in the nation.

According to the report, the state saw a 10.1% decrease in violent crime in 2013, compared to a 4.4% average decrease nationally. Additionally, Connecticut saw an 8% decrease in property crime over the year, compared to a 4.1% national drop. The number of reported violent crimes in the state is the lowest since 1977, and property crime the lowest since 1967.

"As the release of these national statistics today show, Connecticut is making sustained progress in crime reduction," Governor Malloy said. "Our approach prioritizes violent crime and is based on state-of-the-art risk assessment tools. We credit our success to close collaboration between local, state and federal agencies. We also have an extraordinary array of community-based non-profits committed to prevention, especially among at-risk youth. These partnership efforts are working, and preliminary statistics are showing that this trend is continuing into 2014. Connecticut's hardworking law enforcement professionals are making real change in our communities."
