06.08.2006. Category: Health Care
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dan Malloy on Wednesday unveiled a plan to provide affordable health care to nearly 400,000 people who currently lack coverage.
Malloy, the mayor of Stamford, said the plan builds off of his earlier proposal to extend health coverage to all Connecticut children.
"We must expand access to insurance so that every man, woman and child in our state has access to health care," Malloy said. "We must reduce the costs of coverage so that it is affordable; and we must make a serious commitment to wellness and preventative medicine to improve the health of everyone in our state."
