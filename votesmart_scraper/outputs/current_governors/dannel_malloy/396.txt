Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statements regarding the passing of Lewis Rome:
Governor Malloy said, "Lew Rome dedicated his career to public service. Whether as a leader of the State Senate or as chairman of the UConn Board of Trustees, he advocated for issues he cared about deeply. He will be missed by many throughout the state, and our condolences go out to his family and friends."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "This is very sad news for Connecticut. While Lewis and I may not have seen eye-to-eye on every political issue, he was one of the most caring people I've known and he was deeply respected in government. His leadership on higher education leaves a legacy for Connecticut students, his work in the community resulted in a stronger capital city and improved healthcare in the region, and his public service set a strong example of advocacy. My thoughts and prayers are with his family. Lew lived many lives - as a public servant, a husband and father, and an attorney. He was a true gentleman, and he will be missed."
