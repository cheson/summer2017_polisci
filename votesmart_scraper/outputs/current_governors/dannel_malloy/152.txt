Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today highlighted part of the agreement that Lockheed Martin reached with the state that - in addition to committing to keep Sikorsky Aircraft and approximately 8,000 jobs in Connecticut through at least 2032 - will see the company's annual spending with in-state Connecticut suppliers nearly double. Currently, Sikorsky spends about $350 million per year with local suppliers, which are located throughout all regions of the state.
This morning, the Governor visited Cambridge Specialty Company in Berlin, where he spoke with the company's executives and staff about the agreement and how it could potentially benefit local companies like their own, which is a current supplier to Sikorsky.
"We have an opportunity to make the next generation of helicopters in Connecticut. The impacts of this agreement not only directly benefit thousands of jobs at Sikorsky, but will also extend into every region of the state as the company has committed to nearly double its spending among in-state suppliers," Governor Malloy said. "These are suppliers that provide thousands of good jobs to Connecticut residents all across the state, and by adopting this agreement we can expect to see more of these jobs in the near future."
House Majority Leader Joe Aresimowicz (D-Berlin, Southington) joined the Governor on the tour of the Berlin aerospace manufacturing company today.
"Cambridge Specialty is a great company that we are proud to have in Berlin. They are the perfect example of why Connecticut's agreement with Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin is so significant to our economic development," Representative Aresimowicz said. "With Sikorsky planning to nearly double its spending with their local Connecticut suppliers, hundreds of local manufacturers, like Cambridge Specialty, all across the state are going to benefit greatly from this investment."
The state's agreement with Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky is subject to legislative and union approval. The Governor has signed a proclamation calling the General Assembly into special session on September 28 for its consideration.
