Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he has proclaimed Tuesday, May 7, 2013, National Teacher Day in the State of Connecticut. National Teacher Day is part of Teacher Appreciation Week, which is celebrated May 6-10, 2013.

"While today is National Teacher Day, the fact is that the work our teachers do is something that deserves celebration every day," said Governor Malloy. "Improving our public schools is a top priority of my administration, and that includes getting more and better resources and quality professional development to our teachers, so they can prepare the next generation for success in the 21st Century. I know firsthand the difference a teacher can make. My teachers were instrumental to ensuring I had every educational opportunity available, despite my learning differences. Their work, faith and professionalism were a major reason that I went to college, graduated from law school, and entered public service."

"There are few things more important than the education of our children, and that means there are few things more important than the work our teachers do in the classroom day after day," said Lt. Governor Wyman. "Teachers are the very foundation of our education system, and this week is a great time for all of us to recognize the critical role they play in the lives of their students -- our children -- and in the future of our great state."
