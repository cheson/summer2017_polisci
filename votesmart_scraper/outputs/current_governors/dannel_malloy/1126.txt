Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's budget director wrote lawmakers Thursday to tell them if there's a budget surplus in this year's budget then it will go into the Rainy Day Fund.
Office of Policy and Management Secretary wrote all six legislative leaders and told them that if they end the year with a budget surplus based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles then the administration wants to put the money in the Rainy Day Fund. Currently, Barnes is predicting the state will end the year with a $2.8 million surplus on a cash basis, but there's still a $44.7 million deficit when the numbers are projected under GAAP, so the letter may be a bit premature.

In his letter Barnes explained that if there is a surplus it's likely due to the fiscal cliff debate in Washington which caused "many well-off taxpayers to shift income and wealth transfers into 2012 that otherwise would have occurred the following year, in order to reduce their tax liability."
Barnes warned lawmakers that it could amount to a one-time revenue increase so no one should get too giddy over the prospects of a surplus.
"Until an updated revenue estimate for FY 2014 and FY 2015 is completed, we should remind those that have an eye on any surplus that we are in a very different time from the years before the recession when prosperity drove surpluses every year," Barnes said. "Today, we are not yet in a position to predict with sufficient confidence that economic recovery will produce lasting increases in revenue collections."
