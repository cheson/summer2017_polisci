Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced nearly $600 million worth of investments across Connecticut were approved today by the State Bond Commission that will help move the state forward, attract jobs, improve quality of life, and fund important community projects in every region of the state.

The projects include major economic development initiatives such as moving Future Health Care from New York to Bridgeport and expanding AdChem in Manchester, as well as local projects in New Haven like the revitalization of the Q House and remediation of the former Connecticut Department of Transportation bus garage site.
The state's Small Business Express initiative, which is supporting over 1,500 companies and helping them grow, will see an infusion $10 million to further expand jobs, and the Manufacturing Innovation Fund will see a $5 million investment.
Funding for brownfields - turning eyesores into livable, workable spaces to boost local economies - will see $12.5 million to help improve local communities.
Transportation and infrastructure will see important investments like $17.5 million for work on the Danbury Branch Line for Norwalk, $30 million in Town Aid Road grants, $68.9 million for state road resurfacing, and $7 million for recreational trails across the state.
Further, schools in Alliance Districts will see roughly $28.5 million aimed at improving education outcomes.
Housing - critical to economic growth - will have nearly $78 million in funding earmarked for projects in areas spanning Bethany to Bridgeport.
The funding is part of a long-term revitalization strategy spanning every corner of Connecticut. Central Connecticut will receive about $69 million, Eastern Connecticut will see almost $38 million, Southern Connecticut will see $46.7 million, and Western Connecticut will see $64.3 million. In addition, there are statewide investments totaling another $359 million.
"Today we launched a wide-variety of projects that reach many portions of our state - it's all part of a long-term revitalization strategy. The world is changing, and we need to adapt with it. Central to that is making strategic investments to enhance our competitiveness in long-term," Governor Malloy said. "From Hartford to Eastern Connecticut to Fairfield County, we are making important investments to build a stronger Connecticut. Today's investments will help move us forward tomorrow."
