Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced today an agreement with Amtrak to complete the Hartford line, receiving guaranteed agreements for cost ceilings and a clear timetable for work completion.
The completed Hartford Line will triple the number of trains between New Haven and Hartford and doubling the service between Hartford and Springfield. The program is now in construction and work is progressing rapidly. Four station projects are in construction and due to be completed prior to the launch of service, while critical fiber optic signal cable and communication nodes are installed along the corridor to power a brand new signal system including Positive Train Control. Every weekend, centuries-old and undersized culverts and drainage structures are replaced. The roadbed is currently being excavated for the second track.
"We are getting this project done. Instead of letting this languish for years and years, we are stepping up to the plate as a state to stand up for better transportation, more jobs, and economic development. This is a transformative project - and we have a commitment to get it done," said Governor Malloy, who chairs the Bond Commission. "The future Hartford Line will provide access to jobs for residents along the corridor as well as better connections to Metro-North service along the Connecticut coastline. Communities that will be served by the Hartford Line are planning transit-oriented development projects around their stations, including Meriden, which already has a mixed use development in construction right across the street from the station. With this agreement, we are taking the next steps to achieve a best-in-class transportation system."
