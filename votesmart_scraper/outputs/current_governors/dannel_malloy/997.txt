Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy on Friday afternoon released the following statement after the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury issued a final rule implementing the Mental Health Parity Act of 2008:

"This rule issued today is a major, long overdue step towards expanding access to treatment for people in our country living with mental health conditions. I thank the Administration for acting. For too long, mental health issues have been unfairly stigmatized in our society to the point that has resulted in many Americans not having access to the critical treatment that could change their lives. We have seen too many examples of unfortunate events that could have been prevented if only this sort of medical treatment was accessible and utilized."
