Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman applauded the members of the Senate on the passage of HB 5024, legislation that will increase participation in elections and improve voter access to the ballot box.

"Today is a great day in Connecticut," said Governor Malloy. "Despite the pervasive climate across the U.S. to restrict voting rights, Connecticut has moved in the opposite direction--one that ensures the integrity of our electoral process and fair, accessible elections. People are the key to our democracy, and this legislation improves participation in the most fundamental way --the ballot box. I applaud the General Assembly action on this bill."

"These reforms allow more people to have their voices to be heard in a place where it truly matters -- the voting booth," said Lt. Governor Wyman. "More of our residents will have the power to decide who they want to represent them in government, how they want their tax dollars spent, what kind of health care system they want and how they want their children to be educated. And I believe there is nothing more important than that."

To make registration more efficient and create a more accurate voter file, HB 5024 will create web-based voter registration that will allow eligible Connecticut citizens who have a valid and current driver's license to register to vote online. It will also allow for Election Day registration to improve voter turnout.

The Governor introduced this legislation on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January with Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman and Secretary of the State Denise Merrill.
