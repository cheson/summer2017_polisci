Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: May 2, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement following the news that Osama bin Laden has been killed.

"The news tonight that Osama bin Laden has been killed is 10 years in the making. As mayor of Stamford on 9/11, I remember waiting on the train platform there as scared, confused, and overwhelmed commuters made their way home, none of us fully understanding what had just happened. I also cannot forget the Connecticut residents we lost that day. Over the last decade, Connecticut men and women have served our country honorably, and some have made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf. This news is a testament to the hard work, dedication and perseverance of our Armed Forces and our country."
