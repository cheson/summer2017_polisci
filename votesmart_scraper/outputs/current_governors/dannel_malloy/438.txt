Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that over $1.2 million in grants are being awarded to eight nonprofit organizations in Connecticut as part of the state's Nonprofit Collaboration Incentive Grant Program (NCIP). The grant program supplements one-time infrastructure costs related to the consolidation of programs and services resulting from the collaborations between two or more nonprofit organizations providing services in Connecticut.
"These funds help the nonprofit organizations that are providing so many good services to our state to maximize efficiencies gained by streamlining and collaboration," Governor Malloy said. "By partnering with nonprofit agencies on these efficiency measures, we can ensure that they can focus on what they do best - getting services to those who need them most."
Over a four-year period, the state invested $5 million to support 18 nonprofit organizations under this program.
In addition to the awards issued through this Nonprofit Collaboration Incentive Grant Program, the state is currently accepting Requests for Applications for a third round of grants under the state's Nonprofit Grant Program - a state bond pool specifically designated for nonprofit community-based organizations that provide direct health and human services for state agency clients through contracts or agreements with state agencies.
The Request for Applications under this third round of grants is for $30 million, and applications must be received by June 26, 2015. Guidelines and application instructions can be found online.
