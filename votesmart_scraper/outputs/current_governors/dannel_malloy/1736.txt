Malloy: New Republican Radio Ad Appears To Be Just A Loophole
04.03.2006
Category: Better Government
Says, "More proof that the more things change the more they stay the same"
The following is a statement from Democratic candidate for Governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's Mayor:
Governor Rell made a big show of saying she wasn't going to take lobbyist or contractor money into her campaign coffers and that "I am not taking money from the Republican Party, period," [Source: "Rell Says She Won't Use GOP Funds." Hartford Courant 10 December, 2005] but it turns out she may not need to in order to benefit from those very same people -- because she's found a way for other people to do it for her.
News reports tonight indicate that starting tomorrow there will be radio ads attacking Democrats for defeating her misguided Car Tax proposal, in a radio advertisement paid for by the State Republican Party, which does take lobbyist and contractor money.
So Jodi Rell tells the people of Connecticut she won't take lobbyist and contractor money -- but what she doesn't tell people is that she will still benefit from that same money in her politics-as-usual attack ads.
Now we know -- after all the promises Governor Rell made when John Rowland resigned -- that the more things change the more they stay the same.
