Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the State of Connecticut has been awarded a $7 million federal grant to improve access to care for people seeking drug and alcohol treatment in the state.
The announcement comes as Governor Malloy continues to advance his "Second Chance Society" crime reduction initiatives, which among other things redefines simple possession of drugs for personal use as a misdemeanor to better ensure that resources and tools are available to reintegrate into society and lead productive lives. The proposals focus on treatment rather than prison for those with addiction.
"We need to build a brighter tomorrow for people - to help them overcome addiction and become productive members of society. As we lower crime, reduce recidivism, and focus on permanent reform rather than permanent punishment, these dollars will go a long way," said Governor Malloy. "Our Second Chance Society initiatives are aimed at making progress - ensuring those who need treatment get it, expanding opportunities, and helping people be productive members of society. These commonsense proposals are central to Connecticut's future for our urban areas. Let's get it passed."
The Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) will utilize the grant to support vouchers to pay for a range of community-based recovery support services, targeting adults who have substance use disorders.
The Connecticut program will remove barriers to care and improve treatment outcomes for high-need groups, such as adults involved in the child welfare or criminal justice systems and for racially or culturally diverse populations.
The state will offer a choice of services through a certified provider network that includes a variety of traditional and non-traditional providers, including those who are faith and peer-based. Services provided to individuals under the auspices of the grant may include recovery assessment, case/recovery management services, housing assistance, employment services and job training, educational services, and transportation.
"I applaud Governor Malloy, Commissioner Delphin-Rittmon, and the DMHAS team for their work to expand treatment options to residents with addiction," said Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman, Chair of the Governor's Commission on Youth and Urban Violence. "These programs help us build stronger communities and support adults that will model responsible behavior to at-risk youth, reduce violence, and further drive down crime rates in Connecticut."
Connecticut is one of five states to receive a grant award under this round of funding for the federal Access to Recovery IV grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration.
"This is the fourth time Connecticut has applied for and received this competitive federal grant award to support substance abuse treatment and recovery services," said DMHAS Commissioner Miriam Delphin-Rittmon. "The grant was awarded because the federal government recognizes the tremendous collaboration that has evolved in Connecticut between state government, the faith community and recovery community groups. It also recognizes that Connecticut's recovery-oriented system of care emphasizes that access to quality services is the highest priority."
The grant will be distributed to Connecticut in $2.3 million allocations over each of the next three years.
