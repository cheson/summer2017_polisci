Governor Dannel P. Malloy today was selected to serve as Chairman of the Coalition of Northeastern Governors (CONEG), a bipartisan association of the seven governors of the northeastern states, including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

The organization works with governors, their staff, and policy advisors to examine current and emerging regional issues, develop effective solutions, and work together to benefit individual states as well as the region.

"Some of the biggest challenges of our time require us to partner together and work in unison today to build a brighter tomorrow. Whether it's transforming transportation or realizing regional solutions to energy constraints, when northeast states work together they have a powerful voice," Governor Malloy said. "I'm proud to be appointed as chair and look forward to working with fellow Governors to improve our economies, grow jobs, and put us on a path for success in the short and long-term."

The position of Chairman is a one-year term. During the last year, Governor Malloy served as Vice Chairman of the group. In addition to serving as its Chairman, the Governor will also continue serving as CONEG's Lead Governor for Transportation, a position that he has held since 2012.

Last week, Governor Malloy was named by President Obama as co-Chair of the ten-member Council of Governors, which serves as a forum for discussion of National Guard and homeland defense issues and advises the White House and U.S. national security leadership.
