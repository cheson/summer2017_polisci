Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that - in accordance with a proclamation from President Barack Obama directing flags to be lowered to honor the memory of former President and Prime Minister of Israel Shimon Peres - U.S. and state flags in Connecticut should be flown at half-staff beginning immediately until sunset on Friday, September 30, 2016.
Accordingly, since no flag should fly higher than the U.S. flag, all state, local, municipal, corporate, and other flags should also be lowered during this same duration of time.
