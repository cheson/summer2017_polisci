Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the ruling released this evening by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals against reinstating President Trump's travel ban:
"The Ninth Circuit has made it clear that there are numerous constitutional and procedural issues raised by the rushed executive order. I welcome the fact that the court has ordered continuing review and I am optimistic that the constitutional protections that apply to every resident of the United States, including immigrants, will be upheld and that the President will not be allowed to undermine the rule of law."
