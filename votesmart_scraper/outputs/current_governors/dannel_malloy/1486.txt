Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the Connecticut State Police Union.

"Despite the unprecedented fiscal challenges facing the State of Connecticut, I refuse to compromise public safety. To be clear, I deeply appreciate the troopers' service, as I do the service of all state employees. The troopers put their lives on the line every day, and we are a safer state thanks to their service. Also to be clear: I'm sensitive to the troopers' concerns. But I have to manage the entire workforce, and given the massive budget problems I inherited, I believe asking all state employees to take a two-year wage freeze -- in return for job security -- is fair. By rejecting that two-year wage freeze the state police have rejected the job security; therefore, they're subject to layoffs. I have total confidence in the leadership demonstrated by Commissioner Bradford and Col. Stebbins, and I'm completely confident they will manage the State Police with the resources they have without jeopardizing public safety. As for whether or not the State Police Union should remain a member of SEBAC, I view that as an internal conversation between the State Police and other members of the coalition."
