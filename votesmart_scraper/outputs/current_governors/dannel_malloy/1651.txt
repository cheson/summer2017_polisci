showing that qualified applicants for a position within the Department of Agriculture were passed over for a candidate without similar qualifications who had direct connections to the Governor and her Chief of Staff, Lisa Moody. Said Malloy:
"This is just another example of what's broken in Hartford, and what will change when I'm Governor. How can we in good conscience ask Connecticut residents to put their faith in state leadership when we keep giving them reasons not to?
"And it isn't just confidence in state government that's impacted. Handing out jobs to people who aren't qualified is a major reason Connecticut is dead last in job growth, and continues to lose ground to other states in the region. A report yesterday showed that Connecticut agriculture contributes $3.5 billion to the state's economy, and accounts for more than 20,000 jobs. If nothing else, what this embarrassing episode has shown is that the State simply doesn't take the gravity of this industry very seriously.
"It's also a matter of public health. We just got through a very serious national recall of eggs containing salmonella, yet we hire a former pizza chef and school bus driver with no experience in farming to "inspect livestock and poultry at farms.'
"As Mayor of Stamford, I worked hard to put in place the best, most qualified people to help run city government. I reached across party lines -- of my four direct reports when I took office, two of them were Republicans. And, I worked to shrink the size of city government to make it more efficient and cost-effective; there were less city-side employees on the day I left office than when I entered 14 years earlier, despite an increase in population.
"That's the kind of leadership we need in Hartford."
