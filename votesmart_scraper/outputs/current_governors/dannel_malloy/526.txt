Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements regarding President Obama's calls today for paid family and sick leave:

Governor Malloy said, "Connecticut was the first state in the nation to pass paid sick leave because this shouldn't just be a privilege for some, but a fundamental right for all. This shouldn't be a partisan issue -- it's a basic quality of life one for all of us. President Obama is making proposals that are smart, bold, and most of all, morally right. I'm proud that Connecticut has led the nation on this issue, and I applaud the President for the steps he plans to take to support working families. I also thank our state's Congressional delegation for long championing this issue, and I urge the entire Congress to heed the President's call for action."

Lt. Governor Wyman said, "I applaud President Obama for his commitment to the nation's workforce -- and to the millions of women who are full-time employees, heads of family, and the primary caretakers of multiple generations. These proposals are among those that are key to economic security and upward mobility for the country's middle class. Connecticut was the first state in the country to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act. We achieved paid sick leave and increased the minimum wage. We continue to be diligent, and we stand proudly with the President, our Congressional delegation, and the other leaders who are poised to act on behalf of the workforce that is the very backbone of this country."
