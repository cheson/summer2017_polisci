Gov. Malloy on Decriminalization of Marijuana: Common Sense Reforms to Our Criminal Justice System
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: June 4, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement after the Connecticut State Senate approved a measure which would reduce the penalty for the possession of less than an ounce of marijuana from a crime to an infraction carrying a fine.

"I applaud the Connecticut State Senate for passing these common sense reforms to our criminal justice system. The punishment should fit the crime. Let's be clear -- we are not making marijuana legal and we are not allowing people who use it and get caught to avoid the repercussions. But we are acknowledging the reality that we are doing more harm than good when we prosecute people who are caught using marijuana -- needlessly stigmatizing them in a way we would not if they were caught drinking underage, for example, and disproportionately affecting minorities. As a former prosecutor in Brooklyn, my opinion on this issue was formed a long time ago. While our focus will continue to be on prevention and juvenile offenders will be referred to court officials for treatment, this proposal frees up more of our police and prosecutors to fight violent crime. I'm pleased that the Senate took this action, and I urge the House of Representatives to take up the measure and pass it, as well."
