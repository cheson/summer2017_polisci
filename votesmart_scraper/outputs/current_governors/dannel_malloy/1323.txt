Statement

Date: May 9, 2012
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in reaction to final legislative approval early Wednesday morning of legislation he introduced requiring state agency regulations to be published on the internet:

"Connecticut is one of the last states in the nation that doesn't publish its state regulations online. Quite frankly, that's unacceptable.

"This bill will begin a policy change that should have been implemented years ago. Instead -- as is the case with several other areas of our state government -- we are playing catch-up when it comes to embracing the technology of the information age.

"One of the ways we will make Connecticut a better place to do business is to make sure all of our state regulations are available for the public in an easily accessible and updated online format, and that's what this bill accomplishes.

"I applaud the House for passing the bill today in concurrence with the Senate and look forward to signing it."

The legislation is Senate Bill 27 -- An Act Transitioning the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies to an Online Format.
