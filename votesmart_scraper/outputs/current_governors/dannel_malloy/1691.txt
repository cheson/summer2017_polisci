News and notes from the campaign trail
HARTFORD, Conn. -- Standing in Hartford's troubled North End, Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy unveiled a crime reduction plan Monday that calls for adding 1,000 more police officers across the state.
Malloy, who is running against New Haven Mayor John DeStefano in the Aug. 8 Democratic gubernatorial primary, also wants to strengthen state gun control laws, beef up resources to enforce existing laws and expand services for young people.
"It is time Connecticut's leadership recognized that an increase in crime and illegal gun activity can be slowed and eventually stopped; but only with strong, progressive leadership that takes into account community involvement and acts as a true partner," he said.
