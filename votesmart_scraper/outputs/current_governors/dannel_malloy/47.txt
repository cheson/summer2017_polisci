Statement
By: Dan Malloy

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement following the decision by a federal judge to block the implementation of President Donald Trump's executive order, which would allow for the withholding of federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities:
"Once again, the federal court gets it right on the facts where the Trump administration gets it woefully wrong. There is ample court precedent that clearly outlines what the federal government can and cannot do with respect to the withholding of funds to state and local jurisdictions. Although our state is fully compliant with federal laws cited in this executive order and not under threat of losing funding, we are relieved nonetheless that justice prevailed and that rights enshrined in the constitution were upheld."
