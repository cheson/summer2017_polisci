Today Congressman John B. Larson announced his support as an original cosponsor for the Marketplace Fairness Act, which was introduced yesterday. The act would allow states including Connecticut to collect sales tax from out of state online retailers.
"Connecticut's small businesses deserve a fair shake against larger, online retailers," said Congressman Larson. "This bipartisan act would bring greater equality to the marketplace and help Connecticut collect revenue that it should already receive. I am pleased to support this legislation, and look forward to working with members on both sides of the aisle on its passage."
Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy and Revenue Services Commissioner Kevin Sullivan are strong supporters of the federal legislation. Said Sullivan, "We appreciate Congressman Larson's being part of the leadership for federal tax fairness. This legislation will finally level the playing field for Connecticut businesses competing with online retailers, encourage smaller businesses to market online, increase state tax collections without increasing state taxes and end the personal tax liability of state taxpayers when remote sellers fail to collect and remit sales tax."
