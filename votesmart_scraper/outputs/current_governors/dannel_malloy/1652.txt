Democratic nominee for Governor Dan Malloy today released the following statement:
"Health care is a critical issue for Connecticut residents. Ever-rising costs continue to overburden our middle class, while hundreds of thousands of uninsured go without care until they're forced into expensive ER visits that we all pay for. During the past week, one thing has been made abundantly clear -- Tom Foley and I have very different views when it comes to health care.
"The "core plan' Tom put out last week would do away with breast cancer screenings, prostate screenings, maternity care, hearing aids for children and leukemia treatment -- and, it would allow insurers to deny people based on preexisting conditions. Tom would also subject the elderly and disabled to "a modern managed care framework' -- code for an HMO that would add an extra layer of fee-driven bureaucracy for Connecticut residents to deal with.
"That's just wrong. The health care plan I put out in June wouldn't deny coverage for any of these critical needs, and it would work to lower costs and expand access to care, not restrict it.
"I believe every Connecticut resident should have access to quality, affordable health care. Tom says "people are already covered' in Connecticut, ignoring the more than 400,000 people in our state who aren't.
"Frankly, Tom's plans when it comes to health care are unconscionable. Fixing our health care system isn't just a moral issue, it's a fiscal imperative. I'm not sure who Tom had in mind when he came up with this "plan,' but it sure wasn't the families and small businesses struggling to make ends meet."
