Governor Dannel P. Malloy today hailed the Connecticut House of Representatives' bipartisan passage of a bill that supports an agreement the Governor reached last month with United Technologies Corporation (UTC) under which the company will invest up to $500 million to upgrade and expand its aerospace research and development and manufacturing facilities over the next five years. During the same time period, UTC expects to invest up to $4 billion in research and other capital expenditures in the state, impacting more than 75,000 jobs in the state.

"I commend the members of the House for helping to move our state forward with their approval of this legislation. I would also like to thank the many business leaders, chambers of commerce, and labor leaders for their work in support of this initiative.

"UTC is the catalyst of this initiative, but the investments called for in this bill go well beyond one company. The agreement will have a direct impact on employment in almost every city and town in Connecticut, not just at the UTC companies, but also in the hundreds of aerospace supply chain companies throughout the state and the region.

"UTC shares our faith in Connecticut's talented workforce, commitment to innovation, and determination to build a world-class business climate. We could not ask for a better partner and look forward to working together to send the message that Connecticut is committed to continuing its role as a world leader in the aerospace industry."

The legislation, House Bill 5465, is designed to bolster the Connecticut's aerospace companies, encourage business growth and foster the retention and creation of thousands of good-paying jobs with good benefits for residents.
