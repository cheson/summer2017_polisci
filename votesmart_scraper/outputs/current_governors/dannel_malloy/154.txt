Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) will be awarding over $6 million in funding to eight communities across the state aimed at efforts to prevent underage drinking and prescription drug abuse.
"By partnering with communities, we can broaden our efforts to educate youths about the dangers of underage drinking and prescription drug abuse, save the lives of those who may be suffering from addiction, and even prevent it before it has the opportunity to take hold," Governor Malloy said. "This funding will help save lives."
"One of the best ways to address addiction is by preventing it," DMHAS Commissioner Miriam Delphin-Rittmon said. "These funds will give communities a chance to implement a data-driven, public health approach to prevent underage drinking and prescription drug abuse in adolescents and young adults."
The funds come from part of a competitive grant awarded to the state by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Connecticut was awarded $8.2 million to implement the Partnership for Success Grant by funding community-level agencies in medium and large-sized urban areas that demonstrate a need to utilize strategies known to be effective in reducing youth alcohol and prescription drug use rates. The eight communities were selected through a competitive process based on their ability to address youth alcohol and prescription drug abuse/misuse with a focus on reducing health disparities.
The following community agencies will receive funding each year over the next five years:
Positive Directions, Norwalk (Region 1) - $137,102
Town of East Hampton (Region 2) - $150,000
City of Norwich, Human Services (Region 3) - $138,094
Klingberg Family Centers, New Britain (Region 4) - $183,004
Town of Manchester (Region 4) - $149,616
The Village for Families & Children, Vernon (Region 4) - $149,849
Institute for Community Research, West Hartford (Region 4) - $152,335
McCall, Colebrook, New Hartford, Barkhamsted, Norfolk, Winsted (Region 5) - $150,000
The awardees will receive training and technical assistance from existing state resources to strengthen their prevention services by implementing SAMHSA's Strategic Prevention Framework in their respective communities. A State Epidemiological and Outcomes Workgroup will review and analyze behavioral health data and use the results to guide decision making. Researchers at the University of Connecticut Health Center will be responsible for the grant evaluation.
