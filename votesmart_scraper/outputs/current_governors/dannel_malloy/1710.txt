Malloy: Rell Should Fire Chief Of Staff Immediately

Statement of Democratic candidate for governor Dan Malloy on the testimony of Governor Rell's chief of staff:
The testimony yesterday of Governor Rell's chief of staff Lisa Moody was one of the most unbelievable things I have ever heard. In light of it, Governor Rell should fire her immediately.
Yesterday the Governor's Chief of Staff -- one of the most powerful positions in state government -- testified under oath that she did not know it was illegal for her to engage in political activity during regular working hours. Despite briefings from ethics advisors and memos reminding employees of the prohibition -- which she herself signed! -- she claims she was unaware of it.
Lisa Moody either knew or should have known that public employees are not allowed to campaign while they are on the clock working for taxpayers. Her behavior in the fundraising scandal was inappropriate to begin with -- this latest explanation is simply unacceptable.
Governor Rell talks a lot about wanting to improve the ethical standards in state government -- but as these recent ethical questions show, she has done precious little to clean house and break with the holdovers from the previous administration or to lay down the law in her own staff on the difference between right and wrong. The governor can take an important step in restoring our confidence in state government by firing Lisa Moody today.
