Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding a report released from the state legislature's nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis, showing that state agencies saved nearly $33 million in overtime cost during Fiscal Year 2016, which ended on June 30, 2016. This amounts to a 13.9 percent drop when compared to the previous fiscal year, as indicated in a letter sent from Office of Policy and Management Secretary Ben Barnes to the Governor this afternoon.
"We are working exceptionally hard to make government smarter, leaner, and more efficient. As this report today shows, we are making strides towards that effort. Today, our state government is significantly smaller than it was when our administration assumed office five and a half years ago, and we are going to continue working to find ways that generate even more savings for taxpayers. We must continue to live within our means, and this report is no doubt a step in the right direction. I would like to thank Secretary Barnes, our commissioners, and all of the frontline employees for all their work in reducing overtime and protecting taxpayer dollars."
