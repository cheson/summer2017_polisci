Governor Dannel P. Malloy on Monday afternoon released the following statement in response to the awarding of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Yale professor James Rothman and two other professors, who have "solved the mystery of how the cell organizes its transport system."

"For quite some time, Yale University has been part of the ongoing, cutting-edge medical research that's been happening throughout several institutions in Connecticut, and it's exciting to have a professor in our home state receive such an acclaimed and internationally recognized honor," Governor Malloy said. "Right now in Connecticut, we are witnessing a new focus on medical research that's creating an energy and momentum needed to make our state a leader in discovery and innovation. I offer my congratulations to Dr. Rothman and his colleagues on this incredible honor."
