Governor Dannel P. Malloy issued the following statement regarding today's release of the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for September 2012.

"Every month, whether it's at the national or state level, we look to the unemployment numbers as an indicator of our overall recovery. For the last two months, that data has been questionable at best. And the data is being questioned in several states, by members of both parties.

"With the release of the numbers today, the only thing that's any clearer is how conflicting the data continues to be. Yes, the divide between the employer's survey and the household survey has narrowed. But they still tell two stories that can't both be true.

"We've learned over the past few months that the economic crash of 2008 was worse than anyone realized, which is why it's taking us longer to climb out of the hole than any of us would like. But it's also important to remember that we're making some progress. We are making smarter investments in industries that are poised for growth, such as bioscience, digital media and finance. Long term, we will be in a better position to compete once the recovery really picks up steam. And employers are telling us that they added 2,000 jobs this month. These are all positive steps.

"My administration is committed to working everyday to create the good paying jobs with good benefits that our residents need and deserve."
