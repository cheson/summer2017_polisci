Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on Thursday afternoon regarding President Obama's announcement of administrative changes to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act:

"I appreciate the President's efforts and want to assure all consumers of Connecticut that we are examining the ramifications of this announcement and how it will affect all policyholders. We understand there is uncertainty among some policyholders and that is why I have asked Commissioner Leonardi to carefully review the legal and regulatory questions that this poses. As a part of this review, Lieutenant Governor Wyman is also convening a meeting with the Exchange and other stakeholders. In the meantime, I would urge residents to go to the Access Health CT website and compare their existing policy to the ones offered there. As is often the case, these plans provide a superior level of coverage at a lower cost.

"At the end of the day, we have an obligation to ensure that each and every American has access to quality, affordable health care. That has been and will continue to be our ultimate goal. I am proud of the tremendous efforts that Access Health CT has made here in Connecticut to achieve that goal."
