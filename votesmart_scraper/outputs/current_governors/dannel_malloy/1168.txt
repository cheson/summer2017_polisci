Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements in response to the Connecticut General Assembly's unanimous, final approval this afternoon of legislation creating a special fund to assist individuals who suffered psychological trauma as a result of their work related to the Sandy Hook tragedy:

"I want to commend members of the General Assembly, Democrats and Republicans, for coming together to provide relief to those who have been affected by the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School," Governor Malloy said. "While eighty-two days have passed, the anguish of that day is still raw for many. In the depth of that anguish, we in government have undertaken a critically important debate, one where complete consensus will be difficult if not impossible. But that should not stop us from doing the good and decent things that honor those who serve our communities, especially those who have done so admirably in our darkest hour. It is moments like this that make me grateful for the opportunity to serve the residents of our state, and I look forward to signing the bill."

Lt. Governor Wyman said, "This bill is another example of how Connecticut has responded to this tragedy with unity and compassion and a real desire to do whatever we can to help those directly affected on that horrible day. I congratulate the leaders of both parties and their corporate partners in this effort and hope that this spirit of cooperation continues to guide us as we address the numerous and complex issues that Sandy Hook has presented."
