Environment: Dan Malloy's Plan For Cleaner Connecticut
For far too long, people have said you can either grow the economy or protect the environment. I strongly reject that argument because it's a false choice - these two goals are not mutually exclusive. If you're committed to doing both and if you're willing to think outside the box in a creative, innovative, thoughtful fashion, then both can be achieved.
Connecticut deserves a governor who recognizes that we must both foster economic development and protect the environment. That's a commitment I've lived up to as Mayor, and one I'll continue as Governor.
In fact, Connecticut is poised to be a global leader in the production of cleaner and more efficient energy generating fuel cells - technology that may help us reduce our national dependence on foreign oil. My administration will promote this cleaner alternative - which will help Connecticut become greener and more economically competitive at the same time.
As mayor of Stamford, I have worked to build a stronger economy, a cleaner environment, and a more livable community. And I am proud to have made Stamford a national leader in environmental protection by being an early advocate of innovative policies. For example:
* Stamford's was the first solar system installed by a municipality under the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, and we are planning for two more systems.
* Our energy conservation plan has both helped the environment and passed cost savings on to taxpayers. Last year Stamford earned one of six "Clean Air-Cool Planet Climate Champion Awards" for our innovative energy efficient emissions reduction plan and we saved more that $1.1 million in energy costs since instituting an action plan to reduce global warming emissions by 20% in publicly-operated facilities.
* Our new recycling initiative not only provides for a cleaner city, but increases revenues to the city by $2 million.
* We completed a state of the art $105 million sewage treatment plant upgrade that will significantly benefit Long Island Sound.
* We made Stamford an early national leader in Brownfield redevelopment. Our efforts earned us an EPA Brownfield Showcase Community award, and our early successes helped show that older industrial areas of the city could be successfully redeveloped. That work resulted in the creation of hundreds of units of new housing.
* And we've been a leader in the state in other areas as well, including preserving open space and promoting environmentally sound planning policies including Transit Oriented Development.
I'm proud of our record of building a healthier, safer, and more prosperous community, and as Governor, I will continue to work to find new, innovative environmental policies. Among the initiatives my administration will pursue are:
* Support Connecticut becoming a global leader in the development of alternative energy sources, such as hydrogen fuel cells. Fuel cells are a promising clean energy source for the future - one that has the added benefit of helping us reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We should use our university research capabilities, our skilled workers, and entrepreneurial spirit to develop these and other commercially viable clean energy alternatives. Not only is this good for the environment, but since Connecticut is a leading producer of fuel cells, it makes good economic sense and can help us create jobs as well.
To encourage the growth of this industry and achieve environmental benefits, my plan will help our state market this home grown industry by converting large state office buildings and facilities to fuel cell technology. Using bonds that leverage future savings from reductions in electricity costs, this cost-neutral plan can begin to convert our own high-use facilities to cleaner technology - while at the same time showcasing our industry to the world.
* Promote Smart Growth development to preserve open space and farmland. Smart Growth policies which control sprawl not only promote better planning and the creation of more options for housing and transportation but also have tremendous environmental benefits - including preserving open space and preventing the loss of farmland and natural habitat, as well as reducing the number of vehicle miles traveled, which will promote better air quality.
When I am Governor, I will prioritize spending of state funds for projects that support Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and other Smart Growth solutions, in order to give local community leaders incentives and tools to make these projects a reality so that we can achieve the goals of less sprawl and preserve our natural resources while creating more housing and less congestion.
* Encourage energy conservation. Expanding upon the award winning strategies developed in Stamford, my administration will make Connecticut a national leader in energy conservation and emission reductions.
To help promote conservation, I will call on the legislature to require utility companies to provide both residential and commercial customers comparative data on energy use on a square foot basis so that customers can tell if their usage was more or less than other customers with the same size home or business. Having information like this is an important first step in conserving energy.
* Protect our natural resources and toughen enforcement of environmental protection laws. The state will use proceeds from fines to fund additional environmental cleanup and energy efficiency efforts.
* Develop and implement a real multi-modal transportation plan to improve air quality and reduce congestion. When I am governor, we'll finally address the traffic and congestion issues that face the state, with a real multi-modal transportation plan that will help our air quality, promote economic growth and improve our quality of life.
