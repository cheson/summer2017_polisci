Governor Dannel P. Malloy today signed an executive order suspending and modifying certain state statutes in order to permit the Town of Newtown and the Town of Monroe to enter into an agreement that will immediately allow Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School to temporarily utilize Monroe's Chalk Hill Middle School building for its classes.

"Understanding that this is an emergency situation for Sandy Hook Elementary School, it is necessary to act immediately so the school can move forward with its needs," Governor Malloy said. "I know that I speak on behalf of all residents of the state in thanking the Town of Monroe and its elected officials for acting so quickly and allowing the use of their school building at this incredibly difficult time."
