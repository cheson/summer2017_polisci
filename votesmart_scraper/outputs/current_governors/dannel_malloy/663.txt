Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced today that the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will open a Photo License Center in Stamford to better meet the needs of Fairfield County's growing population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Fairfield County is the fastest growing county in Connecticut.

"Since taking office, one of our priorities has been to make it easier and more convenient to do business with state agencies," said Governor Malloy. "We have received positive feedback from DMV customers so far and this new photo center is another significant step towards that goal."

The DMV Photo License Center was approved this year by the state legislature and will offer a variety of services. The state is planning to lease office space at 137 Henry St., in the Lathon Wider Center for the Photo Center which is expected to open mid-to-late fall.

"The Governor's announcement today is the culmination of months of close collaboration between the City and State, and we are very pleased that a DMV office will be re-opening in Stamford," said Stamford Mayor David Martin. "Stamford is the fastest growing city in the state and it is critical to have essential state services conveniently available for residents. We look forward to opening this new office as soon as possible."

The specific service available will be:

-Driver's License (non-commercial) - Renewals, duplicates, and name changes;
-Learner's Permit - Duplicates and name changes;
-Non-Driver ID Card - Renewals, duplicates and name changes;
-Registrations - Renewals, duplicates and name changes;
-Plate Returns and Cancellations;
-Disabled Parking Permits - New, renewals and replacements;
-Driver Histories.

"With the legislature's commitment to this region and our estimates of a strong need to bring services back to this community and surrounding area, we are pleased to be able to address this need for the convenience of people who otherwise would need to travel to Bridgeport, Norwalk or Danbury for this set of services," said DMV Commissioner Melody A. Currey.

The U.S. Census Bureau reports that Stamford gained more than 3,800 residents between 2010 and July 2013 to rank it third-largest city in Connecticut behind Bridgeport and New Haven. The bureau also reports a 2.5 percent growth in Fairfield County between 2010 and July 2013.Studies show that the Southwest region in Connecticut is seeing significant growth.

The Stamford Photo License Center will also offer a pilot project with service by appointment in which residents can schedule a time that is convenient for them to visit a DMV office. DMV initially introduced this service for those seeking a learner's permit. To date, more than 95 percent of people using the system rate it as excellent.

The Photo License Center is expected to be open Tuesday through Friday, with extended hours on Thursday. The project is currently moving through the city-approval process and will also need various state approvals. DMV will hire three employees to staff the office.
