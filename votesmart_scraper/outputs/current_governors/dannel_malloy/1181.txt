Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that more than $50 million in federal assistance to date has been approved to help individuals and businesses with disaster expenses since President Obama approved his Disaster Declaration request as a result of Storm Sandy.

"I want to thank FEMA for extending the deadline to apply for disaster assistance not once but twice," said Governor Malloy. "With over 12,000 claims filed, clearly many residents took advantage of the help they were entitled to. Getting back to normal after a disaster like this is paramount, and the assistance from FEMA was undeniably a big factor for many in making that possible."

To date, more than $50 million in federal disaster assistance has been approved:

12,380 Connecticut residents registered for federal disaster assistance during the application period which ended Feb. 11;
$11,688,520 has been approved for housing assistance, including short-term rental assistance and home repair costs;
$934,961 has been approved to cover other essential disaster-related needs, such as medical and dental expenses and lost personal possessions;
6,340 inspections of damaged properties have been conducted statewide;
$36,795,400 in low-interest disaster loans for homeowners, renters, businesses and private nonprofit organizations has been approved by the U.S. Small Business Administration;
$10,969 in Disaster Unemployment Assistance has been approved as a result of Sandy; and
$1,562,258 in Public Assistance grants has been obligated to municipalities statewide for Sandy-related expenses.
Although the registration deadline has passed, applicants may check status of applications or receive other assistance by calling the FEMA Helpline, 800-621-3362. Helpline hours are from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern, seven days a week. The TTY number is 800-462-7585. Multilingual operators are available.
