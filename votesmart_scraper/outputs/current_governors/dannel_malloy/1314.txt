Gov. Malloy Statement on Layoffs
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding layoffs at two Connecticut companies:

"When these announcements are viewed in the context of our overall economy, it's still clear we are moving in the right direction. The unemployment rate is down 20% from last January, and it's a full half-point below the national average. In the case of Pratt and Whitney, it's my hope that the announcement today of their continued involvement in the assembly of engines for Airbus will in the long run make up for the jobs lost today. The multi-million dollar investment they're making in their facility in Middletown will set the foundation for growth that will mean well paying jobs for our residents. All of that said, it's still discouraging to hear about job losses -- and it's why our top priority every day is job creation."
