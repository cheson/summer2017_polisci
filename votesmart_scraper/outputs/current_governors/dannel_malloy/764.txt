Governor Dannel P. Malloy today said that he looks forward to signing legislation protecting the owners and handlers of domesticated horses now that the bill, which he introduced, has been approved by both chambers of the Connecticut General Assembly.
The State Senate approved the bill early this morning by a unanimous vote of 35-0. It was approved in the House of Representatives last month by a vote of 138-0. It will now be transferred to the Governor's desk.
"With final passage secured by the state legislature today, I look forward to signing this bill, which has been a top concern to many horse owners and handlers, and our state's associated agriculture industry," Governor Malloy said. "The agriculture sector of Connecticut's economy has been growing significantly over the past couple of years, and we need to ensure that the laws in our state statutes encourage this growth. I'd specifically like to thank Environment Committee co-chair State Senator Ed Meyer and the entire Connecticut General Assembly for their support of this bill."
The bill clarifies into law that domesticated horses are not wild animals and as such are not "inherently dangerous." The Governor introduced the legislation in response to a recent court decision, which he said went too far.
