Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the Educators' Common Core Implementation Taskforce will hold its first meeting on Tuesday, March 25, at the offices of the Department of Education, located at 25 Industrial Park Road in Middletown.

The Governor announced the creation of the group earlier this month, explaining that teachers and education professionals have raised legitimate concerns that preparations for the implementation and incorporation of Common Core State Standards in the teaching curriculum have been uneven across the state.

"Seeking the input of the teachers, education professionals and parents who are directly involved in the day-to-day activities of our public school system will help the state in our efforts to improve our schools," Governor Malloy said. "Everyone involved in the education system will benefit by having this review, identifying challenges, and highlighting best practices and lessons learned."

Tuesday's meeting will begin at 4:30 p.m. and will be held inside of Conference Room MCR3.

The taskforce is comprised of 25 members, including 12 teachers, four principals, four superintendents or district curriculum leaders, two parents, two local board of education members, and the Chief Academic Officer of the Department of Education. It is tasked with identifying challenges and gaps in Common Core preparation, and making recommendations on improving the quality and consistency of its implementation.
