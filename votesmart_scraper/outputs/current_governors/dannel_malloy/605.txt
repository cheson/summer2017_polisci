Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement concerning an action initiative by the state's Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) which resulted in a $30 million rebate to electric ratepayers from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
"This is very good news for Connecticut electric customers -- and demonstrates the state's commitment to ensuring ratepayers are treated fairly. Thanks to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority's careful scrutiny of charges, our families, seniors and businesses will see a refund and will not be burdened with additional costs that drive up electric bills."
