Governor Malloy on House Passage of Sunday Sales Bill
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement after House passage of a bill to amend Connecticut's Blue Laws:

"Tonight, the House voted in favor of one of the most significant changes to our state's blue laws in recent memory.

"Under the current law, we lose millions of dollars over the border every Sunday. It's a bad policy that inconveniences consumers and makes businesses less competitive. But after tonight, there will be an additional 55 days where sales will be permissible. It's a good first step.

"I continue to believe there's more we can do to make our package stores more consumer friendly. I am encouraged that the legislature will study this issue, a sign I hope that there may be more we can accomplish in the near future. This much is certain - the more we can lower prices for consumers, the more competitive our businesses will be. And the hundreds of millions of dollars our state would recapture will unquestionably benefit our economy."
