Malloy: 'Foley's Promises Just Don't Add Up'

"Tom Foley is making a lot of big promises to voters. The trouble is, his math just doesn't add up. This morning Tom and I both spoke at an economic summit hosted by UConn. In his written remarks Tom claims that he will cut $2 billion from our state budget without raising taxes. But during his speech he claimed that Connecticut has a $3.4 billion deficit.

"My question to Tom is simple: Where will the other $1.4 billion dollars come from?

"If he's saying he can make up the full $3.4 billion just in cuts, what's his plan for doing that? In March, Tom said that one way he'd save money is by eliminating a mandate that provides wigs for cancer patients who'd undergone chemotherapy. But that only gets you so far. What else has he added to his list since March?

"I know something about balancing budgets, holding the line on taxes, and wringing savings out of government by shrinking it in a responsible fashion. That's what I did for 14 years as Mayor of Stamford. It wasn't always easy, but our City government and our taxpayers knew that, no matter what, they'd get a transparent, open dialogue about the City's finances. That's something Connecticut desperately needs from its next Governor -- not more empty promises and budget tricks.

"Tom's math is off and he's making promises he can't keep.

"These are difficult times, and I'm not willing to make any promises I can't keep as Governor. What I can promise is an honest discussion of where we stand and what steps my administration will take each and every day to move Connecticut back toward prosperity."
