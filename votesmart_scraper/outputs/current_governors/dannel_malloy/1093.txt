Governor Dannel P. Malloy applauded final passage of House Bill 6360 -- An Act Concerning the Implementation of Connecticut's Comprehensive Energy Strategy. The legislation is expected to lower consumer utility rates, expand energy choices, and create at least 10,000 clean energy jobs.

"My thanks to Senators Williams and Duff and the legislators who worked so hard to get this bill passed," said Governor Malloy. "Connecticut consumers have been paying among the highest energy costs in the nation, and this bill will help reduce that burden and create good paying jobs with good benefits, all with an eye on protecting our environment and reducing greenhouse gas pollution. This marks an important change in how we address our energy needs in Connecticut, and the beginning of a holistic approach to meeting our long-term energy goals."
