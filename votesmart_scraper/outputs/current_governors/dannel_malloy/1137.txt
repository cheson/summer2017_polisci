Governor Dannel P. Malloy, following a proclamation from President Barack Obama, has ordered U.S. and Connecticut flags to fly at half-staff in honor of the victims of yesterday's bombing at the Boston Marathon.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Massachusetts during this difficult time," said Governor Malloy. "Connecticut is ready to lend whatever assistance is needed in the wake of this tragedy. Our emergency responders and law enforcement have offered support and resources to Massachusetts, and we will continue to stand by our neighbor throughout their recovery efforts."

"I know I speak for everyone in Connecticut in saying that the victims and their families are in our hearts and thoughts today as they deal with the horrible aftermath of this senseless attack on an event whose beauty and rich tradition draws people from all over the world," said Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman. "This was an assault on innocent people and an assault on our values, and we must respond with solidarity for all of those affected."

Flags will remain at half staff until sunset on Saturday, April 20, 2013.
