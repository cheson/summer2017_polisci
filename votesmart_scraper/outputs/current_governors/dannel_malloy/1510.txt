Gov. Malloy: Work to Streamline State Government Underway
Press Release

As the new fiscal year begins Friday, state agency consolidations and mergers proposed in February by Governor Dannel P. Malloy are well underway. The initiative will reduce the number of state agencies by 30% and will streamline government and improve efficiency.

"State government must be leaner and more efficient while still being responsive to residents," said Governor Malloy. "This is the beginning of a new way of doing the state's business, one that will certainly lead to cost savings for taxpayers, but as importantly, will make it easier for citizens and businesses to work with government. State agencies are not immune from the same decisions being made in corporations and households across the state -- doing more with less -- and this step will ultimately give us a leaner, more efficient Connecticut."

Governor Malloy reminded state residents that the effort to merge and consolidate agencies will be an ongoing process, but staff has been working ahead of July 1 to try to ensure that the transitions occur as smoothly as possible and with the least amount of service disruption to residents. New consumer-friendly state websites are being launched in the coming weeks as well.
