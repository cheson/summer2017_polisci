Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to the results of today's referendum in the Town of Old Saybrook in which voters approved funding that will support the public acquisition of the 1,000-acre property known as The Preserve:
"The permanent protection of "The Preserve' has been a goal of the land conservation community across our state for more than 15 years, and now with voters' approval, this land will be protected in perpetuity and enjoyed by residents for generations to come. As the last, large unprotected coastal forest between New York and Boston, this land is rich in natural resources, wildlife and habitat areas that not only offers residents with outdoor recreational opportunities, but also provides an important coastal buffer against storm waters during natural disasters. I am glad that the State of Connecticut could partner with the Town of Old Saybrook and the Trust for Public Land on this purchase that will provide lasting benefits for everyone."
