Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the first checks under the Elderly Renters Rebate Program are being released Friday. The checks, totaling $21.7 million are being mailed to 42,332 elderly renters to help offset a portion of their rent and utility expenses. Other eligible persons will receive checks over the next several weeks.

"This state program helps some of our most vulnerable citizens -- lower income elderly and disabled persons who rent. With payments being made at this time, these citizens will receive assistance in time to help offset the cost of heat and other utilities as colder weather approaches," Governor Malloy said.

The program, administered by the Office of Policy and Management, has been in existence since 1974 and provides for payments to renters either over the age of 65 or those younger than 65 and disabled. Payments range from $50 to $900 for qualifying married persons, and $50 to $700 for qualifying single persons. In order to qualify, married persons must have an annual income no greater than $39,500, and single persons must have an annual income no greater than $32,300.

Eligible persons may apply between May 15 and September 15 each year at either their town social service agency or local assessor's office, depending on the town. Questions about the program and payments should be directed to the Renter's Rebate Hotline at 860-418-6280 or 1-800-617-8889.
