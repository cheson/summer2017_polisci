Welcome To TalkCT
Welcome to talkCT! I am extremely excited to be opening the discussion on our new blog. This promises to be the most up to date and compelling issues driven gubernatorial blog in the State of Connecticut. I am looking forward to being able to interact with people across Connecticut and hear what you have to say about your community, your region, and your State. This blog is about you; it is about your thoughts and ideas on the critically important issues facing Connecticut, and how we can confront those issues together.
With this in mind, I encourage you to join me by posting on talkCT. Whether it be a thought about our new blog, a question about our campaign, or a concern about an issue; your comments are welcome here. My campaign will be taking cues from the talkCT dialogue to further bolster and refine our vision for realizing an economically viable and livable Connecticut for the 21st century.
I urge you to bookmark this page and become an active member of our new online community. I look forward to blogging with you!
