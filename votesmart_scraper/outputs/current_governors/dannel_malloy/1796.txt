Malloy Campaign Invests In Clean Energy

Category: Environment
-- Last week, Dan Malloy's gubernatorial campaign became the first Connecticut political campaign office to invest in clean energy. Responding to a challenge issued by the environmental group New Haven Action, the Malloy campaign purchased Renewable Energy Credits [RECs] from the clean energy producer Sterling Planet. The credits guarantee that hydroelectric power produced in Griswold, Connecticut will offset the electricity used by the campaign office.
"This is an initial step in an important statewide initiative," said Malloy, "If every campaign office follows suit, we could make a real impact. With hundreds of campaigns in operation throughout the State each year, campaigns can take a lead on this issue through actions as well as words."
According to the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, for every 100 homes or offices that sign up for clean energy in Connecticut, we keep 425 tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and use nearly 900 fewer barrels of oil. Malloy added that for Connecticut, which is situated on the receiving end of pollution from New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and the Midwest, and which pays some of the highest costs for electricity in the nation, investing in clean energy is an "economic and public health imperative."
