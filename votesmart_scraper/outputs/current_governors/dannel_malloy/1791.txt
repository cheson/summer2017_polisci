Malloy Statement On AG Announcement
10.11.2005
Category: Campaign News
Today, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal announced that he would not run for Governor in 2006. I respect Dick's decision. The people of Connecticut will continue to have the finest Attorney General in the nation fighting every day for them -- all of us are truly lucky that Dick is such a dedicated, honest, hard-working public servant. He takes on fights no one else would, and he does so without regard for what they mean for him politically. He takes them on because it's the right thing to do. I'm proud to count Dick as a close friend of more than 20 years, and I look forward to being on the statewide ticket with him in 2006.
