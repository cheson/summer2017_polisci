Governor Dannel P. Malloy today thanked the Connecticut House of Representatives for approving legislation he introduced that will protect the owners and handlers of domesticated horses by clarifying into law that domesticated horses are not wild animals and as such are not "inherently dangerous." The Governor introduced the legislation in response to a recent court decision, which he said went too far.

"I'm glad that the General Assembly continues to advance our timely legislation protecting owners and handlers of domesticated horses, and I'm confident that the Senate will also look favorably on approving this so that I can sign it into law," Governor Malloy said. "Connecticut has a large population of horse owners and handlers, and the associated agriculture sector of our economy continues to grow, contributing $3.5 billion annually in our state's economy and accounting for 28,000 jobs. I want to thank State Representative Linda Gentile, Co-Chair of the Environment Committee, for her efforts in advancing this bill."

The legislation, which the House approved by a unanimous vote of 138 to 0, is House Bill 5044 -- An Act Concerning Domesticated Horses. It next moves to the Senate for consideration.
