Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that a new state Web page streamlines resources to help families with insurance coverage and reimbursement for behavioral health and substance abuse treatment.
The Insurance Department's "Mental Health Parity" Web page is a compilation of free resources, publications and tools that consumers can easily access through the Insurance Department's Web site.
"Our focus remains sharply on removing barriers to mental health treatment and allowing families to get the help and support they need," Governor Malloy said. "We continue to enhance our mental health infrastructure in a number of ways and this online resource is one more example of that."
The new site includes the Insurance Department's Behavioral Health Took Kit, a step-by-step plain-language template that families and providers can use to submit to insurance companies for preauthorization of medically necessary behavioral health services. The Tool Kit was launched in October, the same time the state announced it was dedicating $9 million in federal funds to address the needs of children in schools.
Insurance Commissioner Thomas B. Leonardi encourages consumers to visit the new page and take advantage of the resources there that can help them navigate the claims process and gain a better understanding of their rights under state and federal laws.
"Sometimes those barriers to access are piles of insurance paperwork and it doesn't have to be that way," Commissioner Leonardi said. "Our staff is here for you -- the consumer -- to answer your questions, investigate your complaints and get you the care and coverage you need. Each year we help recover more than $4 million on behalf of Connecticut consumers."
