Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to the release of the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for July 2014, which indicated that the unemployment rate dropped to 6.6% -- its lowest level since December 2008 -- and the private sector grew 3,100 jobs during the month. This is the sixth consecutive month of job growth.

"This latest report is yet another sign that we are making steady progress in improving Connecticut's economy. With the addition of 3,100 private sector jobs this month, we have created nearly 60,000 private sector jobs since January of 2011. All of this comes as the number of unemployed residents shrinks and our labor force grows.

"Since taking office, we have made long-overdue investments that will make sure Connecticut's economy is positioned for long-term growth and we're starting to see results. It's absolutely critical that we keep working and making these changes so that our residents can find good paying jobs with good benefits."
