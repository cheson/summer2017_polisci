Malloy: Our Kids' Health Should Come First

Calls for statewide ban of soda and junk food to help combat soaring rates of childhood obesity - and will call for ban in all of Stamford schools
The following is a statement from Democratic candidate for governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's mayor:
Governor Rell missed her opportunity to sign the ban on sales of soda and junk food in our schools last year when it was first passed -- and now she has shown a complete lack of the leadership necessary to get it through the legislature this year. Our kids deserve better.
That's why I am once again announcing my support for the proposal to ban the sales of soda and junk food in our schools -- and I am calling on the state legislature to pass this ban, and on Governor Rell to finally sign it.
We must never put corporate profit and the influence of lobbyists ahead of the health of our kids.
Our kids have already waited long enough for us to act. What we need today is leadership. In Stamford, for example, we've already eliminated sales of soda in most of our schools -- including the elementary and middle schools and two high schools -- and today I am calling for a ban on junk food and soda sales in the remaining schools in the City of Stamford.
This ban would have a tremendously positive affect on our children's health -- and our kids' health should come first.
