Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statements regarding the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for November 2015. The report shows that Connecticut's private sector grew 5,200 jobs last month and has now recovered 113,400 of the 111,600 jobs that were lost during the Great Recession, bringing its recovery rate to 101.6 percent. In addition, the unemployment rate is at 5.1% - its lowest level since March 2008, before the start of the recession.
Governor Malloy said, "Today's data shows that Connecticut's private sector is continuing to grow from the 2008 recession - and we've hit yet another milestone. Our state's businesses have shown strong growth this year, adding over 26,700 new jobs, while our unemployment rate is at a nearly eight-year low. We know that numbers can and may fluctuate from month to month, but what is undoubtedly clear is that we are making significant progress.
