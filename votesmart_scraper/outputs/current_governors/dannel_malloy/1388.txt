Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement regarding reports of possible discrimination during traffic stops by law enforcement officers:

"The apparent discrimination by police officers undermines our resident's confidence in the criminal justice system. These statistical findings are very troubling, especially considering the fact that they do not include reports from towns that are not complying with the requirements of state law. My office is developing a new system for reporting and analyzing this data, and we expect to be able to obtain real-time analysis of all traffic stops in the near future.

"In the meantime, I have asked all of our law enforcement training agencies to place a new emphasis on the dangers of racial profiling and other forms of biased policing."
