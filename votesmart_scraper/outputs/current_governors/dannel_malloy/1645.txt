Democratic nominee for Governor Dan Malloy today responded to news that the nation's four largest health insurers denied coverage to hundreds of thousands of people based on pre-existing conditions. Said Malloy:
"It's wrong that insurance companies in this country denied coverage to 651,000 people and declined to pay claims to another 212,800 people based solely on the fact that they had pre-existing conditions. This underscores the need to have protections in place to help people in Connecticut qualify for and afford health insurance for themselves, and for their loved ones.
"Tom Foley's healthcare plan would eliminate state mandates, including protection for people with pre-existing conditions, and he'd repeal protections contained for consumers, too. At a time when we need to expand coverage to affordable quality health care while simultaneously lowering the overall cost, Tom's plan would leave people with no other option than an emergency room, and it would stick them with the bill, too."
