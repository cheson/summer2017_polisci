Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in reaction to the final passage of legislation strengthening the state's racial profiling laws:

"More than 10 years ago, as the Mayor of Stamford, I was proud to stand with the men and women of the Stamford Police Department on Martin Luther King Day to announce that we did not tolerate racial profiling and would lead the efforts to ensure its elimination. As Governor, I will continue to insist that every effort is taken to protect individual rights in every community and that racial profiling is eliminated.

"Our administration has already begun taking some of the steps required under the legislation. Last year, I instructed the Office of Policy and Management, with the help of Central Connecticut State University, to create the advisory group called for in the bill, and they have begun to develop standardized methods and guidelines to improve collection of racial profiling data.

"In recent months, I have met with a number of groups to hear their concerns. This is a real problem that deserves a real solution, and my administration is committed to carrying out the spirit and letter of this law. I look forward to signing the bill when it arrives at my desk."
