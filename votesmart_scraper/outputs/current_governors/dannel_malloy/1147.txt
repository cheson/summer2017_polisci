Pursuant to state statute, Governor Dannel P. Malloy has approved $95 million in bond funding for Connecticut State University System (CSUS) 2020 projects during fiscal year 2014. CSUS 2020 is a comprehensive, long-term capital infrastructure investment plan which began in fiscal year 2009. It includes funds for infrastructure improvements, mechanical and electrical upgrades, renovation and equipment, code compliance, and new construction that will replace antiquated or inadequate facilities.

"Connecticut businesses must have the talent to compete globally, and our state university system is critical for training our future workforce," said Governor Malloy. "Over the past two years we've made unprecedented investments to improve education--ensuring that Connecticut's state universities have the resources to modernize and grow is an important part of strengthening Connecticut's economy."

"Thirty-five percent of Connecticut high school graduates attend one of our 17 colleges and universities, and the majority of those students stay in our state upon finishing their program of study. An investment in our institutions is an investment in our state's future workforce," said Philip E. Austin, Interim President of the Board of Regents for Higher Education, which now governs the four state universities. "These projects will help our universities update and renovate older buildings, purchase new equipment, and expand the capacity on the campuses by constructing state-of-the-art buildings which will enhance our students' learning experiences. I thank Governor Malloy for furthering this investment in our campuses and our students, and the Board of Regents for their continued support."
