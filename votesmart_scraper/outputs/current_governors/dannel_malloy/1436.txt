Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced Small Town Economic Assistance Program (STEAP) grants for projects in Thompson and Putnam.

"STEAP grants highlight how important the partnership is between government and municipalities," said Governor Malloy. "Working together, we can identify the best opportunities for investing in our communities, rebuilding our infrastructure and creating jobs."

The Governor visited both communities today to announce the awards.

Putnam was awarded $469,000 for improvements to Quinebaug Regional Technology Park. This project is expected to lead to more than 1,200 jobs in the tech park, increase the value of the town's grand list, and bring in an additional $500,000 in real estate taxes annually.

Thompson was awarded $150,000 to replace the roof on the West Thompson Fire Department.

"This is a perfect example of how targeted state funding can spur job creation, upgrade local infrastructure and build stronger communities. These projects are necessary and in these tough economic times, this investment will save tax dollars for the residents of Thompson and Putnam," said Senator Donald Williams.
"What a great way to celebrate the holidays with these generous gifts for such great purposes," said State Representative Danny Rovero (D-Killingly, Putnam, Thompson). "Public safety, job creation and infrastructure improvements are at the core of what makes these STEAP grants so critical."

Under Governor Malloy's leadership, the State Bond Commission allocated $20 million for STEAP grants on September 23, 2011. The awards were granted in part due to project readiness and their impact on overall regional economic development.
