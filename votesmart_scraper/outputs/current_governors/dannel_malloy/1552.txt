Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement after President Obama's fiscal policy address.

"I commend President Obama for tackling the issue of our long-term fiscal sustainability in such a measured, responsible way. All too often, a tough conversation like this can start off with overheated rhetoric that divides us when we most need to work together, causing people on both sides to dig in their heels before the tough work has even begun. President Obama set the right tone for the bipartisan negotiations to begin in May and I hope that any agreement will significantly reduce our national debt, stay true to our core values of shared responsibility and prosperity, and accelerate economic growth."
