Malloy Responds to Foley's Plan

"This isn't a health care plan, it's a lifeline to the insurance companies and HMOs that got us into this mess in the first place. I have a fundamental belief that health care is something everyone should have -- Tom Foley apparently disagrees.
"He proposes a moratorium on benefit mandates to private insurance carriers. What does this mean? That the state would no longer be able to ensure coverage for patients with existing conditions. I suppose taking wigs away from cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy wasn't far enough -- Tom wants to take their insurance too.
"Tom proposes placing "the current state Medicaid program for the aged, blind and disabled into a modern managed care framework.' That's a nice way of saying that Tom will add one more layer of fee-driven bureaucracy for our seniors and disabled to have to muddle through in their attempt to receive care.
"Of course, none of this should be terribly surprising. This is a candidate who believes that health reform is a "bad deal' because enough Connecticut residents already have coverage. Tom Foley apparently isn't concerned about the more than 400,000 Connecticut residents who don't have health insurance."
