Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on National POW/MIA Recognition Day, September 16, 2011:

"While we owe a debt of gratitude to all of the men and women who have served our nation, today we pay a special honor to those who, because of their service, have become prisoners of war or are missing in action in a country far from home. Prisoners of war and those who are missing in action leave behind loved ones and family members who can speak to their courage, fortitude and strength of character, even if they can't speak to their whereabouts. While we rejoice each and every time our servicemen and women return home safely, today is a stark reminder that our work will continue until all of our military service members are home."
