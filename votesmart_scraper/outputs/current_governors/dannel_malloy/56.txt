Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the Senate confirmation today of Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court:
Governor Malloy said, "This is a sad day for American democracy. The U.S. Senate has a long history of civility and the good of the people coming before partisan dogma, but today we witnessed the unraveling of that esteemed tradition. The confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court is the culmination of a sordid maneuver by Republican Senators to steal a U.S. Supreme Court nomination from a sitting U.S. President who was a Democrat. They refused to even give President Obama's nominee a hearing, much less an up or down vote -- not because his nominee was unqualified, but for partisan, political reasons. Not only did Senate Republicans steal this nomination, but they had to undermine the Senate rules to get it over the finish line because the nominee couldn't gain the confidence of at least 60 Senators."
