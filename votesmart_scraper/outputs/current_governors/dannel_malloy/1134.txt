Gov. Malloy Statement on U.S. Senate Vote

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the vote in the U.S. Senate this afternoon on legislation that enhances federal background checks on potential purchasers of firearms:

"On the issue of enhanced background checks, the American people are clear -- 92 percent support them. The real question is how do the senators that voted against this most basic, common sense reform justify their vote against this measure?

"We are fortunate in Connecticut to be represented by two people in the United States Senate -- Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy -- who are clearly working to improve public safety. There is much more that needs to be done on the issue of gun violence prevention. But when the Senate cannot come together on an issue that is supported by the vast majority of Americans, there is little to no hope that common sense will prevail. The members who voted against this proposal should be ashamed of themselves."
