Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement on the Senate's passage of S.B. 33, the Governor's Design Build Legislation:

"This bill will help us create thousands of good paying jobs. Once it becomes law, Connecticut will join 46 other states that have embraced Design Build, putting us in a better position to get federal money for critically important investments in our state's infrastructure. Design Build is a time tested policy that will save time and money by reducing the number of steps it takes to get shovels the ground, all while lowing the cost and improving the quality of construction projects.

"As far as project labor agreements are concerned, I've been a supporter of project labor agreements since I was Mayor of Stamford. At a time when too many people in our state are still searching for gainful employment, project labor agreements ensure that we have the best trained workforce in place for our more important projects.
"Contrary to some of the assertions opponents of project labor agreements make, this is not another unfunded government mandate. All this bill does is give municipalities the option of entering into a project labor agreement if they choose to do so, without the added risk of costly litigation. It's just a common sense measure, one that will ensure that the hardworking men and women in the building trades can find employment that will support their families."

"I want to thank members of the Senate for their hard work on this issue. I urge the House to pass this bill, so I can sign it into law."
