Governor Dannel P. Malloy today congratulated the Connecticut House of Representatives for giving final passage to legislation that increases the minimum wage in the state and reaffirmed his intention to sign the bill, which was approved in the State Senate last week, after it gets transmitted to his desk.

"This change will make it just a little easier for working people in our state without adversely impacting the business community," Governor Malloy said. "This is the right thing to do for hard working men and women, and the right thing to do for families. I look forward to signing this bill into law."

The legislation, Senate Bill 387 -- An Act Increasing the Minimum Fair Wage, increases the minimum wage by 75 cents per hour over a two-year period to a total of nine dollars per hour.
