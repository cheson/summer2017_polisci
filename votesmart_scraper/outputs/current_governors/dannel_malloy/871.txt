Governor Dannel P. Malloy today reminded Connecticut residents of the importance of clearing snow from their roofs prior to more winter weather hitting the state.

"With several weeks of winter still remaining and substantial snow already on many roofs, it is imperative that residents, businesses and governments guard against potential collapses," said Governor Malloy. "Residents should be aggressive about protecting their structures. With forecasters predicting an active storm pattern to continue over the next few weeks, now is the time to start clearing snow from your roofs to prevent heavy buildup."

Governor Malloy directed the state Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) to send a memorandum today to all state agencies and municipalities asking them to assess snow buildup on their public buildings and agricultural facilities and, if necessary, begin the process to remove the snow.

Governor Malloy also encouraged residents with elderly or disabled neighbors to offer assistance with roof clearing if appropriate. In addition, residents who cannot clear their own roofs and need to pay for services to do so should contact the Better Business Bureau to ensure the quality of the vendor.
