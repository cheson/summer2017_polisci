Dan Malloy today called on Tom Foley to cut ties with Carl Feen, who Foley touted yesterday as a "leading Democrat" endorsing his campaign. Feen, a broker, was caught taking a commission from Cigna at the same time that the company was providing dental insurance for state workers. While negotiating the contract with Cigna, Comptroller Nancy Wyman warned Cigna that the contract must not include commissions to agents or brokers. Cigna agreed, but was later caught paying a commission to Feen. Wyman helped lead the charge to get Cigna to pay back more than $870,000 in commissions. Feen personally received nearly $500,000 of those funds.
In his endorsement of Foley, Feen focused on the need to elect an "outsider" to reform state government.
"The hypocrisy here is stunning," said Malloy. "Carl Feen is the consummate "insider' -- he raised money for candidates and bragged about his connections to them, while using state government to rip off taxpayers and pocket close to $500,000 in the process. Tom Foley is touting the endorsement of someone who took money out of the pockets of hard working people in this state, and my running mate, Nancy Wyman, is actually the person who lead the charge to force Cigna to put that money back into state coffers. If providing new leadership and a break from the status quo really is so important to Tom, then he must immediately renounce Carl Feen's endorsement, who certainly represents none of those qualities."
