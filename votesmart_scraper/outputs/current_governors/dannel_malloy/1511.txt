Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued a Call of Special Session for Thursday, June 30 at 10 a.m. Governor Malloy issued the call to expand his rescission authority and enact legislation to close the budget deficit for the biennium ending June 30, 2013.

"It was always my hope that the SEBAC Agreement would be ratified and we could move forward with the process of getting our state's fiscal house in order and creating new jobs," said Governor Malloy. "But that looks increasingly unlikely. Calling both chambers into session next week is necessary to close the budget deficit that we will be facing. I am loathe to make the decisions facing us at this juncture -- including layoffs, programmatic and municipal aid cuts -- but I am left with no choice. Working with the legislature, we will have a balanced budget and one that, while making painful cuts and difficult decisions, will be balanced honestly without tricks or gimmicks."
