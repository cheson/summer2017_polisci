Gov. Malloy: 'First Five' Will Send Strong, Clear Message to Business Community
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement today hailing the Senate passage of legislation he proposed creating the "First Five" program -- a new jobs initiative that will provide a unique set of incentives to the first five businesses that each bring a minimum of 200 new full-time jobs to Connecticut within the next 24 months.

"For too long, Connecticut has been reactive to news that jobs are leaving the state or companies are closing their doors, instead of being proactive in trying to keep them here. That stops now. With Senate passage of the "First Five' initiative, we are sending a strong, clear message to the business community -- small, medium, and large -- that we want your companies here and we'll work with you to make that happen. I urge the House to pass this legislation as soon as possible so we can start inking those First Five deals and ultimately increase it to more than just five. We need new jobs, and we need them now."
