Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court decision on the Clean Power Plan:
"I believe in science - the data is real. Global warming is happening. Urgent action is needed on a national and an international basis to combat it. That's why the Supreme Court's ruling to pause implementation of the Clean Power Plan is disappointing and shortsighted. However, it is not a final decision on the legal merits of the Clean Power Plan, so it is important that we continue with preparations for compliance with the plan while these issues are being worked out in the courts.
"Connecticut is already a national leader on global warming - and that will not change. We're going to continue to cut carbon in a cost-effective, reliable manner while growing a clean energy economy. Through programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, we already have achieved significant reductions in carbon pollution from the electric sector, while growing our economies and maintaining reliable power. We have an obligation to combat greenhouse gases, and Connecticut is going to continue to do just that."
