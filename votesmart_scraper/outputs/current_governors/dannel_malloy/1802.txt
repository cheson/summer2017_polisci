Hometown Hero
Sunday night, Stamford lost one of its most beloved citizens, Marcia Lieberman. Marcia was a woman of undying energy, love and enlightenment. She was a moral and civic leader of our community; strong-willed, feisty, courageous and devoted. She made a lasting positive difference in Stamford, in Connecticut, and in the nation, as well as with each individual she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Senator Lieberman and his family. Stamford will miss Marcia dearly, and will always remember her.
