Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: June 7, 2013
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy has signed into law Public Act 13-108, An Act Unleashing Innovation in Connecticut Schools, and issued the following statement upon signing:

"I am signing this bill into law because it makes incremental improvements. But when the path to unleashing innovation and removing barriers to continued success in our schools is clear, this bill does too little. The bill I proposed in February was the product of an extensive, rigorous study by a broad range of education stakeholders, and would have substantially reduced the bureaucratic burden on our schools. This bill proposes to study an issue that's been studied enough. I look forward to working in the coming months, and again in next year's legislative session, to push for more meaningful change."
