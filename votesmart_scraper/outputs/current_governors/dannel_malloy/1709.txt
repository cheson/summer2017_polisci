HARTFORD -- Democratic candidate for governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's mayor, today announced his selection of Mary Messina Glassman of Simsbury as his running mate.

Malloy will make the official announcement at a press conference with Glassman in Hartford this afternoon.
"Mary Glassman has dedicated her life to public service, working hard to make our state a better place," said Malloy. "She has experience in state government and as a local elected official. She will be a tremendous partner to me, both in this campaign and governing this state, and I am proud that she will join my ticket as our candidate for Lt. Governor."
"Mary began her political career by pulling off a stunning political upset by beating an incumbent Republican to win an office that no Democrat had won for decades -- and I know that together she and I are going to do it again!" said Malloy.
