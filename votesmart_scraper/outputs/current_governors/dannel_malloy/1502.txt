Statement from Governor Dannel P. Malloy in response to SEBAC action:

"It's good news that the unions have changed their ratification process to one that respects the will of the majority. Over the next few days Mark Ojakian will be speaking with SEBAC leaders to understand which issues in the agreement need to be clarified. Given the limited number of issues that have been identified as problematic, it shouldn't take more than a couple of days to have a clarified agreement that's ready to be voted on by all state employees."
