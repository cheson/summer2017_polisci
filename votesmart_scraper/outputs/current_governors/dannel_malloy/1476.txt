By the end of the day today, FEMA teams will have been to all 169 cities and towns in the state, and we will continue to press for public assistance in the remaining three counties in the state. This storm was unprecedented in terms of the amount and scope of damage, and I'm pleased the President has agreed and made available these federal funds and services."
