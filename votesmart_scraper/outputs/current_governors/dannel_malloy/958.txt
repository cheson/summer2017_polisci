Governor Dannel P. Malloy today urged residents to avoid travel during the first significant snowstorm of the season. The National Weather Service has issued Winter Storm Watches for most of the state from tomorrow afternoon until Sunday morning.
"Although this does not appear to be a major storm, it does have the potential to produce a significant amount of snowfall and create hazardous driving conditions," said Governor Malloy. "I am asking residents to use caution as they head out on Saturday and to limit their travel during the height of the storm beginning at 8:00pm on Saturday night."
Total snow accumulations are currently forecasted to range from 6"-- 9" in Southern Connecticut and up to 10"--14" in Northern Connecticut. Travel is expected to become very hazardous after midnight with heavy snow blowing across roads and Northeast winds 15 -- 25 MPH gusting to 35 MPH at times.
The Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) will continue to monitor the storm's progress and is ready to coordinate any response or assistance that may be necessary.
