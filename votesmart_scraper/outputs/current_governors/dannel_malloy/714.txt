Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements regarding the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision today in the case of Mueller v. Tepler:

Governor Malloy said, "Once again, Connecticut is leading the nation in recognizing the rights of LGBT Americans, who for too long were denied the marriage rights afforded to other couples. The Supreme Court today took another step forward to ensure equality."

Lt. Governor Wyman said, "I applaud the court on their ruling -- this is an important decision for Connecticut and the nation. We are fortunate to have strong advocates working to achieve equality and justice for LGBT couples, and it is critical that we continue these efforts on behalf of families across the state. This is a very good step forward."
