Gov. Malloy Statement on Equal Pay Day
Statement

Governor Malloy released the following statement today on Equal Pay Day.

"My wife, Cathy, an advocate for victims of sexual assault; my mother, a nurse and a union organizer; and the Lieutenant Governor, Nancy Wyman, are all examples of women who have worked as hard and become as successful as men in their respective fields. Despite decades of fighting for reform, on average, women in Connecticut working full time still earn only 76 percent of what men earn doing the same job. The time to end this systemic discrimination is long past due, and I commit to working with others to help make sure that men and women earn the same amount of money for the same job. In these tough economic times, it's unfair, and frankly, embarrassing, that we're making it any harder for families to make ends meet."
