Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement on the Senate's passage of his storm legislation:

"While I hope that the two major storms we endured last year in a little more than six weeks were an aberration, the reality is we need to take every possible precaution to make sure we learn from those two unprecedented events. While we can't control what Mother Nature throws our way, enacting tougher standards for utility companies and improving communication and training for state and local officials are two actions that will make sure we're in a better position to respond once a storm is over. In addition, by making a concerted effort to invest in micro-grids, we are embracing a 21st Century solution to an age old problem.

"Emergency preparedness is a process that must continue to evolve. This bill makes sure that we've taken the best of the recommendations of both the Witt Associates and Two Storm Panel Reports and put them into practice. I want to thank the Senate for their action today, and look forward to watching this bill's progress as it makes its way through the House."

The Governor's storm response plan (S.B. 23) included legislative proposals in addition to changes to administrative procedures to improve operations in four individual policy areas: performance; management and communications; preparedness and training; and infrastructure strengthening.
