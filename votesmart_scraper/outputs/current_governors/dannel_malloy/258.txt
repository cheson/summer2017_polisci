Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that 34 nonprofit providers in 26 municipalities have been selected to receive a total of $15 million in grants as part of Connecticut's Nonprofit Grant Program.
Created by Governor Malloy in 2013, this is the third round of grants under the program, which helps nonprofit providers that do business with the state invest in projects that will achieve new efficiencies so they can enhance the delivery of services.
"These organizations play an important role in our state, and we're proud to partner with and support them," Governor Malloy said. "It's our goal to help organizations focus on what they do best - getting services to those who need them most."
The first round of Nonprofit Grant Program funding in the amount of $20 million was approved by the State Bond Commission on January 9, 2014 with awards announced on March 6, 2014. The second round, also for $20 million, was approved by the State Bond Commission on January 12, 2015 with awards announced on January 23, 2015.
Anne Foley, Undersecretary for Policy and Planning at the Office of Policy and Management and Chair of the Governor's Nonprofit Cabinet said, "The number of applications we received shows how very much nonprofit providers need this kind of financial assistance. The Governor's Nonprofit Grant Program helps them make capital investments they otherwise cannot afford."
