Governor Dannel P. Malloy on Tuesday afternoon met in his office with a group of advocates who were visiting the State Capitol to testify at a public hearing of the General Assembly's Labor and Public Employees Committee in support of his proposal to increase the state's minimum wage to $10.10 by 2017.

"There is a debate happening across our country on how to tackle the growing income inequality that is detrimental to our middle class families and to our economy. Part of tackling that critically important challenge is making sure that we recognize that a decent wage is good for workers and good for business," said Governor Malloy. "For too long, the minimum wage has not kept up with the cost of living. As studies have shown, the workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase brought home 46 percent of their household's total wage and salary income in 2011. When workers earn more money, businesses will have more customers. This modest boost will help those earning the least to make ends meet."
