Governor Dannel P. Malloy tonight released the following statement on President Barack Obama's State of the Union address:

"Tonight, the President unveiled an optimistic and ambitious agenda for our country. He called on Congress to end its partisan bickering and obstruction and pass meaningful legislation to bolster our recovery and accelerate economic growth.

"I couldn't agree more.

"The President and I share a common vision for a strong and thriving economy -- an economy that creates jobs and grows our middle class. In Connecticut, Democrats and Republicans have worked together to improve the lives of Connecticut residents. We passed a far-reaching jobs package that will attract new investment and strengthen our economy. We continue to work long and hard to stabilize our state's finances so that future generations aren't saddled by a staggering debt.

"And we are beginning to see some improvement -- unemployment is down to 8.2 percent, and in my first year as Governor we created more than 9,000 jobs, the first time in more than 3 years that Connecticut has grown jobs. But we still have a long way to go, and we need Washington to help us get there.

"The President is right, now is the time to rebuild our nation's aging infrastructure. Now is the time to restore the United States as the best nation in the world for advanced and precision manufacturing. Now is the time to once again make our education system the envy of the world through long overdue reforms. Now is the time to restore our bargain with our citizens, that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can make it in America.

"This President has challenged Washington to get it done.

"We can't wait. We shouldn't have to wait. The time is now."
