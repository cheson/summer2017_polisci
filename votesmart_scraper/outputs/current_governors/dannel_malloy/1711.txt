Democratic candidate for governor receives major endorsement during visit focusing on jobs and transportation improvements
HARTFORD - Democratic candidate for Governor Dan Malloy met with Democratic Party leaders in Bristol to discuss economic development needs of the town and the region.
In Council Chambers in Bristol Town Hall, Malloy was joined by City Councilman and former mayor Frank Nicastro, City Councilman Kevin McCauley, City Councilman Craig Minor and members of the Bristol Democratic Town Committee including Town Chair Dean Kilbourne.
Malloy was in Bristol to highlight his economic development plan to create 100,000 more jobs in the state, as well as the need to better coordinate state agencies to foster economic growth.
"Creating jobs and strengthening the economy is the most important challenge facing our next governor. Connecticut has been last in the nation in job growth for far too long. That's why when I am governor, I will make Connecticut work again," said Malloy.
