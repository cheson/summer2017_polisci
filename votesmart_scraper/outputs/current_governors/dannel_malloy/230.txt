Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement:
"The intentions laid out by the Speaker today are literally the opposite of how I've tried to consistently move the budget conversation forward this year.
"I've put all my ideas on the table in the form of two balanced budgets. The Speaker has not put a balanced plan on the table, and now says he doesn't plan to do so until the very end of session.
"I've faced difficult realties head on and made tough decisions, even cutting things that I'd rather not cut, like ECS. I've said we can't do this while still holding every line item sacred. The Speaker is now saying we can somehow get to the bottom of a $900 million problem without touching any of the numerous priorities each of us have, and without raising taxes.
"I've invited input from legislators, local leaders, and the public via town hall meetings. It appears the Speaker is now saying he will produce a budget with zero public input and hand his caucus and the legislature something to vote on in the waning hours of session.
"This kind of thinking is business as usual in Hartford. None of this is a recipe for a good budget, it's a recipe for gimmicks and band aid solutions. This kind of thinking has failed us in the past. This year, we need to do things differently.
"I want to reiterate that I am willing to meet with Democrat and Republican leaders to move this conversation forward."
