Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement concerning final passage of legislation on motor vehicle licenses:

"This bill is first and foremost about public safety. It's about knowing who is driving on our roads, and doing everything we can to make sure those drivers are safe and that they're operating registered, insured vehicles. There's a reason these measures have been supported by local police and city leaders, and that other states are taking similar common-sense steps. They're changes that benefit everyone taking a car out onto our roads and highways.

"It should also be noted that, like many issues, action on the federal level would address this problem in an even more comprehensive and sensible way. I continue to support those broader efforts at national reform, and urge Congress to follow the example being set by Connecticut and other states."

The legislation is House Bill 6495 -- An Act Concerning the Issuance of Motor Vehicle Operators' Licenses.
