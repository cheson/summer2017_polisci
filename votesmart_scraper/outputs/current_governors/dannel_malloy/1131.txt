Governor Dannel P. Malloy this afternoon signed legislation he proposed in collaboration with state lawmakers that requires the president of the Board of Regents for Higher Education be appointed by the members of the board. The Governor said that the change will help the next leader institute a long-term vision that increases stability and academic growth for the students at the state's colleges and universities.

"I want to thank the members of the House and the Senate, including the chairs of the Higher Education Committee, for working with my administration on introducing this bill and acting quickly on its passage," Governor Malloy said. "Over the past two years, with the goal of strengthening Connecticut's economy, my administration has made unprecedented investments to improve education, and our state's colleges and universities are a vital component of that vision to create a talented, well-educated workforce that drives businesses to our state and grows jobs. This bill builds on those efforts."

The Board of Regents for Higher Education governs seventeen Connecticut state colleges and universities: four state universities, 12 community colleges, and Charter Oak State College.

The legislation is House Bill 6648 -- An Act Concerning the Board of Regents for Higher Education.
