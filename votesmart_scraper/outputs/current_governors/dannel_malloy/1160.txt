Governor Dannel P. Malloy this afternoon released the following statement regarding today's deliberations of the Sandy Hook Advisory Commission for their interim report:

"Today's deliberations by the Sandy Hook Advisory Commission mirror the conversations taking place in living rooms and towns halls across Connecticut on how best to make Connecticut safer. While I appreciate their hard work, I want to be very clear on one point -- I do not support, and will not advocate for, the confiscation of firearms owned by law abiding citizens. Again, I appreciate the hard work of the commission in reaching these interim recommendations, and look forward to receiving their final report."
