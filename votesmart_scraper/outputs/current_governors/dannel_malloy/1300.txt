Governor Dannel P. Malloy has signed legislation he introduced that will require all state agency regulations to be published on the internet and made available for easy access by the public.

"To put it simply, it's unacceptable that many state regulations are not available electronically," Governor Malloy said. "As I've said numerous times since I took office last year, Connecticut has lagged behind for too long when it comes to utilizing modern technology. Transitioning the services of state government into the Information Age must be a top priority."

The new law requires agency regulations to be published on the Office of the Secretary of the State's website and on the individual regulating agencies' websites.

Governor Malloy added, "One of the ways we will make Connecticut a better place to do business is to make sure all of our state regulations are available for the public in an easily accessible and updated online format, and that's what this bill accomplishes."

The legislation is Public Act 12-92, An Act Transitioning the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies to an Online Format.
