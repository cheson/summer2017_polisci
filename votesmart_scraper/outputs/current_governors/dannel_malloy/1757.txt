Remembering Coretta Scott King
Today the country is saddened by the news that Coretta Scott King, widow of slain civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr. has died.
Mrs. King embodied the qualities that Americans admire. She was intelligent and talented--applying those gifts to better her life and the lives of those around her. She was devoted--to her children, her husband and to the cause for which he died. And leading by example, Mrs. King believed. She believed that if you work hard enough and never give up you can make a difference in people's lives.
Even in her darkest hour, Mrs. King inspired a nation, handling her husband's tragic death with dignity and grace.
Elegant and eloquent, Mrs. King remained a prominent figure on the American stage. We are all better off because of her commitment to the cause of justice and equality for all. I for one will use her life as an example to follow.
My heart goes out to her family at this sad time. I hope they take solace in the fact that we too are mourning her passing.
