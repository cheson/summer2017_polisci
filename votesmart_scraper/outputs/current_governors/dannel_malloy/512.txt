Gov. Malloy: State Asks FEMA to Begin Preliminary Damage Assessments
By: Dan Malloy

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced today that at his request, the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP) has formally requested the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct a joint Federal/State Preliminary Damage Assessment in New London, Tolland, and Windham Counties as a result of the severe winter snow storm this week.

"This was a devastating storm for parts of our state that many cities and towns are still recovering from," said Governor Malloy. "This assessment is the first step in the process of securing possible federal assistance for those communities that were hit the hardest."

Once the preliminary assessments are complete, Governor Malloy, based on the data provided, will determine whether a major disaster declaration request should be made. If a major disaster declaration is asked for and granted, eligible costs would be reimbursed based on a 75-25 split, meaning that FEMA will reimburse 75 percent of eligible costs, and the state, tribal nations, or municipalities (or certain non-profits) are responsible for 25 percent.

The request is asking for the damage assessments to begin the week of February 9, 2015. DESPP's Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security will coordinate the entire damage assessment with FEMA and the affected towns and cities, state agencies, and tribal nations.
