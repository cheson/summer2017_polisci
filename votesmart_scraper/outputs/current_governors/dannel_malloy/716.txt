Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today was named to the National Governors Association (NGA) Executive Committee for the 2014-2015 year by his fellow governors at the association's annual meeting in Nashville, Tennessee.

In this NGA leadership role, Governor Malloy will help lead the organization whose mission is to share best practices among states and advocate on behalf of all states to federal policymakers.

"I am honored to have been chosen to serve on the NGA Executive Board and to have received the bipartisan support and confidence of my fellow governors," said Governor Malloy. "The NGA is a valuable organization that supports state-led innovation and solutions, and is a venue for governors to discuss the national issues confronting our nation so that we speak, when possible, with one powerful and unified voice in Washington, DC."

The new NGA Chair, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, and NGA Vice Chair, Utah Governor Gary Herbert, will lead the nine-member Executive Committee through which the association's priorities and activities are determined. The committee's other members include Iowa Governor Terry Branstad; Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton; Montana Governor Steve Bullock; North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory; Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin; and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.

This past year, Governor Malloy served as the Vice Chair of the NGA's Natural Resources Committee, which successfully pushed Congress to pass a maritime infrastructure bill that reflected governors' priorities concerning coasts and inland waterways. He previously also served as Chair of that committee, as well as the NGA's Education and Workforce Committee.
