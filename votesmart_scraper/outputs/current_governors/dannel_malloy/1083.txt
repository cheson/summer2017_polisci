Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he will meet with the state's utility companies on Tuesday, June 18 to discuss preparedness efforts and readiness in advance of the height of hurricane season in Connecticut, which is from mid-August to mid-October.

"This year's forecast is calling for a very active hurricane season," Governor Malloy said. "All levels of government and the state's utilities must be prepared. This meeting will allow us to hear directly from the state's utility companies on their readiness as the height of hurricane season approaches."

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) hurricane forecast is predicting 13 to 20 named storms. Around 7 to 11 of them could become hurricanes, with 3 to 6 possibly becoming major hurricanes. This is well above the seasonal average of 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes.

The following companies will participate in the meeting: Connecticut Light and Power, United Illuminating, AT&T, Dominion, Sprint, Verizon, Cablevision, Charter Communications, Comcast, and Cox Communications.

The meeting, which is closed to the press but will be followed by a media availability, begins at noon in Hartford at the State Emergency Operations Center in the William A. O'Neill State Armory.
