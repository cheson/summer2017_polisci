Governor Malloy on Florida Health Care Ruling
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Feb. 1, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding a Florida judge's decision striking down parts of the Affordable Care Act.

"I believe Judge Vinson's ruling was a clear case of judicial overreach. We need to figure out ways to make healthcare more affordable and accessible to people, but the way to do that is not by scrapping the entire law and starting all over again. As I've said before, the rising cost of health care is a major detriment to job creation here in Connecticut, and I commit to resolving open SustiNet issues with all parties at the table on behalf of Connecticut residents and businesses."
