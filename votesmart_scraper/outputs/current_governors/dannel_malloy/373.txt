Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Connecticut Department of Housing (DOH) Commissioner Evonne M. Klein today announced that 22 municipalities in Connecticut have been approved to receive nearly $12 million in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Small Cities Program awards from the state that will provide important upgrades and improvements to their local communities.
Under the program, eligible applicants include smaller towns that have a population of not more than 50,000 residents. The grants are awarded to the municipalities to facilitate projects that will enhance their communities in a variety of ways, including developing or preserving affordable housing, providing services to the most vulnerable residents in our communities, and creating and retaining jobs.
"These projects will help so many local communities increase quality of life and make our state an even more attractive place to live, work and do business," Governor Malloy said. "These are investments in our neighborhoods, in the people who live here, and in our economic future."
The CDBG Small Cities program is administered by DOH using federal funds allocated to Connecticut by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Funding criteria for the state-administered program are developed in an open and public process, and are submitted for review and approval each year by the legislature's Appropriations, Housing, and Planning and Development Committees.
"The CDBG program is a great opportunity for our smaller towns to apply for, and receive, funding for important projects in their communities," Commissioner Klein said. "When the improvements to these homes are completed, it will have a positive impact on the residents who live there. In the State of Connecticut, we are making critical investments in housing that will have a lasting effect on individuals, families, and communities for years to come."
