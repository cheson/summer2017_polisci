Governor Malloy: Connecticut is Back on the Map
Press Release

Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced today that Connecticut is back on the map. Discover New England, the official tourism website for New England, had removed Connecticut from its map, marketing materials, and efforts because the state failed to pay its dues to the organization. Much broader than a website, however, Discover New England works to raise international consumer, travel trade, and media awareness of New England as a memorable, high-quality, four-season destination.

In the past, Governor Malloy has spoken at length about the pennywise and pound foolish decision to drastically reduce tourism marketing funds. While the money for dues to Discover New England was removed from the budget last year from the commission's marketing budget, Governor Malloy directed other funds within existing resources to be used for Discover New England dues immediately.

"I'm pleased that we could release this money -- which had already been allocated to the Connecticut Commission on Culture & Tourism -- so quickly and get the state back on the map with its New England neighbors," said Governor Malloy. "Connecticut has so much to offer, and it's a shame more people don't know about it. Connecticut's exclusion from overseas marketing materials and efforts -- and with it, information about the state's cultural venues, tourist attractions and other events -- was embarrassing, and spoke to a larger lack of understanding about the decisions we need to make to invest in our state and our region. As I've said before, my overarching goal is to ensure people know Connecticut is open for business. With our inclusion once again in Discover New England, we're sending that message loud and clear."
