Gov. Malloy Releases Economic Impact Numbers of Modernizing the New Haven Line
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Nov. 20, 2015
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that an economic analysis performed on the Governor's proposed upgrades to the New Haven Line demonstrates that the economic benefits of replacing the commuter rail system is more than twice the cost of the project upgrades, and will be a major factor in being able to attract and retain businesses and grow jobs.
"The New Haven Line has the potential to carry thousands of additional commuters, and do so at a faster and more frequent rates. That means we will be far more attractive to businesses -- our economy will benefit greatly from these investments," Governor Malloy said. "Inaction is not an option. Improving the New Haven Line is critical to our economic success, not just because it will attract new businesses and grow jobs, but improve quality of life. Everyone should be able to live in Connecticut with a car-or without one."
