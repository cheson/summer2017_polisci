Governor Dannel P. Malloy will continue his promotional visits to state tourism destinations this week in Norwalk, Hartford and Bloomfield as part of his summer-long effort to highlight the role Connecticut's hospitality, tourism and recreation attractions play in strengthening the state's overall economy.

On Tuesday afternoon, the Governor will tour Norwalk's Maritime Aquarium, which will be followed by visits on Wednesday at the Connecticut Science Center in Hartford and the Thomas Hooker Brewery Company in Bloomfield.

Connecticut's hospitality and tourism industry employs more than 110,000 people, generates $1.15 billion in state and local tax revenue and is responsible for $11.5 billion in spending, according to 2011 statistics.

"Tourism has always been a good investment for the state -- it is a sector that returns three dollars for every one dollar invested," Governor Malloy said. "These venues are important economic drivers that employ Connecticut residents. This summer is an excellent opportunity to build on our earlier work and strengthen the state's competitive edge."

The Governor's promotional tour follows the unveiling in May of the state's new "Still Revolutionary" marketing campaign, a new initiative that will boost revenues and draw attention to the state's distinctive attractions and extraordinary destinations through an aggressive marketing campaign. Earlier this month, the Governor made similar visits to tourism destinations in Bristol, Cheshire, Redding, Wilton and Goshen. He plans on visiting attractions in other portions of the state during the coming weeks.
