The plan includes common sense policing strategies, as well as prevention measures and administrative steps that protect the rights of victims and ensure greater accountability in the bail bond system. The proposal's actionable items fall into three categories: policing, prevention and public policy. Among other specifics, the plan calls for:
· Putting more police officers on the street, including adding 55 state troopers to meet the 1,248 mandated level
· Modernizing the state's criminal justice information system
· Enforcing gun laws and adopting anti-violence strategies
· Reforming our bail bond system
· Designating an existing position at OPM to be the administration's criminal justice policy professional

"The strategies that are put forth in this plan are largely informed by my experience as Mayor of Stamford, where we lowered crime by 63 percent during my tenure," said Malloy. "As a former Assistant District Attorney I have a deep appreciation for the criminal justice process. As Mayor, I fostered a real collaboration with the police department, community leaders, and other stakeholders to make Stamford a better place to live, work, raise a family, and do business. As Governor, I'll do the same for Connecticut."
Malloy's running mate, State Comptroller Nancy Wyman, added that improved public safety impacts other public policy goals.
"If you don't feel safe in your home, on your street, in your school, in your place of worship, and in your place of work, very little else matters," said Wyman. "Making Connecticut a safer place to live and work will help us invigorate our city centers, make us more business-friendly and revitalize our neighborhoods."
