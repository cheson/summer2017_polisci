Governor Dannel P. Malloy this afternoon announced that he has signed the deficit mitigation and deficiency bills that were adopted by the General Assembly during the final days of the legislative session and will keep the fiscal year 2017 budget in balance.
"The General Assembly has proven that they can take action to resolve a difficult budget situation -- just as they did by passing the deficit mitigation and deficiency bills to keep our FY17 budget in balance without resorting to imprudent practices like borrowing," Governor Malloy said. "We hope this serves as a reminder that we can find common ground to develop and adopt and a responsible, stable, and predictable budget that will put Connecticut on the best financial path forward into the upcoming biennium. This is a great state and our taxpayers deserve the best of its lawmakers."
The bills are Public Act 17-51 (An Act Concerning Deficit Mitigation for the Fiscal year Ending June 30, 2017) and Special Act 17-3 (An Act Making Deficiency Appropriations for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2017).
