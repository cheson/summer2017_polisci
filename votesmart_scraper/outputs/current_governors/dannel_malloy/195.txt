Location: Hartford,CT

With the first day of the 2016 Atlantic Hurricane Season beginning today, Governor Dannel P. Malloy and state emergency management officials are reminding Connecticut residents to be prepared for any severe weather that may impact the state. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with the principal threat period for Connecticut occurring from mid-August to mid-October.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane season forecast is calling for 10 to 16 named storms, 4 to 8 hurricanes, and 1 to 4 major hurricanes this year.
"One single hurricane or tropical storm can have a lasting impact on our state - it's time to prepare," Governor Malloy said. "We urge all residents to take three simple preparedness steps: get a kit, make a plan, and stay informed. These three steps will help to ready everyone for any weather emergency you may encounter."
"Now is also the time to become acquainted with the weather hazards to which your community may be prone, such as storm surges, areas that flood, and road or bridge closures," Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection Commissioner Dora B. Schriro said. "If a storm is approaching your area, monitor weather reports carefully and follow all of the instructions provided by public safety officials."
