Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement, heralding final passage of a bill granting protections from gender identity discrimination under Connecticut law.

"This bill is another step forward in the fight for equal rights for all of Connecticut's citizens, and it's the right thing to do. It's difficult enough for people who are grappling with the issue of their gender identity, and discrimination against them has no place in our society.
