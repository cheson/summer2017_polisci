Governor Malloy Seeks Presidential Disaster Declaration, Federal Aid for January 12 Record Snowstorm
Press Release

Date: Feb. 22, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy has formally requested that President Barack Obama declare a major disaster in the State of Connecticut -- a move that could bring federal financial aid to Connecticut cities and towns impacted by the record snowfall on January 12, 2011. Earlier this month, Governor Malloy wrote to the President explaining the context in which his formal request would be made -- one of the snowiest winters on record, coupled with a number of structure collapses across the state. Governor Malloy is requesting this declaration on behalf of all eight counties in the state.

Governor Malloy's letter was sent after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the state Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) confirmed that expenses and snowfall amounts met FEMA established thresholds in most, if not all, Connecticut counties. The preliminary damage assessment estimated eligible costs at over $14 million.

"This aid is intended to begin to help meet the mounting costs associated with the historic snowstorm that hit Connecticut on January 12, 2011 that stretched both state and local resources to and beyond the breaking point," the Governor said. "My top priority right now is to provide all of the disaster assistance we possibly can to our cities and towns during these very tough economic times. I am hopeful that President Obama will act quickly on my request."
