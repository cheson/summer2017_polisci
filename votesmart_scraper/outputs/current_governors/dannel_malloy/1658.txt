Democratic nominee for Governor Dan Malloy visited Bradley International Airport (BDL) in Windsor Locks on Monday to lay out his proposal for restructuring the governance of the airport to enhance its ability to generate economic growth. Malloy says his plan has the potential to generate thousands of new jobs for the state, at no additional cost to taxpayers.
This jobs initiative is part of a larger, more comprehensive proposal to create jobs in Connecticut that Malloy and his running mate, State Comptroller Nancy Wyman, unveiled in Danbury on June 15. You can view the plan here. The plan was praised at the time by, among others, The Day of New London.
Malloy said BDL has been hampered by complex personnel recruiting, cumbersome procurement policies, and a fragmented decision-making process. His solution involves the creation of a "Bradley Airport Authority," an independent board composed of unpaid appointees with jurisdiction over the operation and management of BDL and five other state owned airports, with a goal of improving administrative efficiencies and spurring more robust international trade and travel.
"Bradley International Airport is an incredible tool for doing exactly what Connecticut needs to do most -- creating jobs and getting our economy moving again," said Malloy. "Unfortunately, it's a tool we haven't fully utilized in recent years. Usage of the airport has declined significantly, right when we need it most. My proposal streamlines administration and decision making at the airport -- it will drive activity and use of BDL, and create thousands of jobs in the process."
Malloy said that, despite talk in recent years about selling the airport, he has no intention of exploring that option.
