Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding sexual assault prevention and response procedures at UConn:

"I absolutely support the idea of holding public hearings on UConn's sexual assault prevention and response procedures. As a parent and someone whose wife spent years working with victims of sexual assault, my heart goes out to the women that came forward this week. One of the most basic responsibilities of our institutions of higher learning is to keep our young people safe. If they have failed in that responsibility in any way, or if any victim of sexual assault has been treated with anything but the utmost respect, I will be outraged.

"I have spoken with President Herbst, and she has assured me that the University is taking these allegations very seriously. I expect the University to act quickly in cooperating with the U.S. Department of Education as they investigate the complaint."
