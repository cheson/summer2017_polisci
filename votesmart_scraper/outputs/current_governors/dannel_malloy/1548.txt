Governor Dannel P. Malloy today wrote to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Citizenship & Immigration Services, asking them to grant deferred action on the enforcement of an order of deportation for Mariano Cardoso. Cardoso is the subject of a deportation order even though he has been living in the United States since he was twenty-two months old after his parents brought him here from Mexico illegally, eventually settling in New Britain. Cardoso is a month away from earning his engineering degree from Capitol Community College in Hartford.

"Congress needs to address immigration reform in a comprehensive and commonsense manner, but until that happens, we cannot allow young men and women like Mariano, who, through no fault of their own, were brought here as children, lose this chance at a better life," said Governor Malloy. "For all intents and purposes, Mariano is American. To send him back to a country he has no recollection of and did not grow up in makes little sense, particularly as he is finishing his degree and looking to contribute to his community and this state."

Governor Malloy supports the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act ("DREAM Act") that would provide individuals like Cardoso the opportunity to apply for temporary legal status and eventually permanent legal status and citizenship. But even if the measure is eventually approved, it would not be accomplished in time to assist Cardoso. In Connecticut, Governor Malloy has proposed a bill that would allow students who graduate from a Connecticut high school to pay in-state tuition to state colleges and universities.
