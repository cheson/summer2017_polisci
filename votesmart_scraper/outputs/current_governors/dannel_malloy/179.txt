Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statements in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt concerning abortion laws.
Governor Malloy said, "This decision represents a resounding defense of women's rights against those who seek to roll back the clock. This is a majority opinion rooted in common sense - and it was the right one. As the world moves forward, many still continue to try to take us backward. We must continue to stand up for progress and for women's rights. That's why I applaud the Supreme Court's decision today."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "This is an important decision that affirms a woman's right to safe, legal, accessible healthcare. These restrictions were nothing more than an underhanded attempt to re-litigate women's healthcare and weaken the laws that protect a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and future. I applaud the Supreme Court for seizing this opportunity to protect the availability and accessibility of healthcare for women."
