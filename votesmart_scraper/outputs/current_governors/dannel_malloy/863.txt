Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Gov. Nancy Wyman released the following statements in support of HB 5126, An Act Concerning an Agreement Among the States to Elect The President of the United States by National Popular Vote. The Government Administration and Elections Committee today is holding a public hearing on HB 5126.
"I fully support a national popular vote for President. All Americans deserve to have their votes counted equally for the highest office in the country," said Governor Malloy. "Connecticut should join the nine other states and the District of Columbia in taking this important step. The candidate who wins the most votes should be President. An equal vote for every American citizen, regardless of in which state they happen to live, is the fairest and most democratic way to go."

Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman stated, "Unfortunately, too many presidential elections have focused on swing states, leaving a host of voters in states across the country feeling disenfranchised. The United States of America is one of the most diverse countries on earth. We should take pride in our diversity by weighing each vote equally in Presidential elections."

When enough states to represent the 270 electoral votes needed to elect the President have signed on, an inter-state compact will go into effect. Connecticut would join 10 other jurisdictions who have already enacted this legislation, currently representing 136 electoral votes of the requisite 270 necessary to elect a president. The other jurisdictions are: Calif., DC, Hawaii, Ill., Mass., Md., N.J., R.I., Vt., Wash.
