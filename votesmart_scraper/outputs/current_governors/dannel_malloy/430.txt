Location: Hartford, CT

In light of today's announcement by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that nearly 34 million vehicles made by 11 companies are being recalled for replacement of faulty Takata-made airbags, Governor Dannel P. Malloy, Department of Motor Vehicles Commissioner Andres Ayala and Department of Consumer Protection Commissioner Jonathan A. Harris issued the following joint statement:
"We are obviously concerned about the widespread safety recall announced today by the NHTSA, and will continue to monitor the situation. We will continue to relay details to Connecticut vehicle owners as additional information is available and the situation evolves. We encourage consumers to take this recall seriously, stay informed, and take appropriate action as needed. Residents should immediately check their vehicle's VIN number, visit www.safercar.gov, and periodically check the site in the coming days and weeks as more information becomes available. If you find that your vehicle is one of the millions affected by the air-bag recall, follow-up with your vehicle manufacturer to get advice, and make an appointment to have the vehicle repaired as soon as parts are available. Consumers with additional questions are encouraged to call their automobile manufacturer's customer service line.
"Connecticut residents should know that the Governor and state agencies will be updating them with as much information as possible, and will do everything we can to ensure the safety of residents, protect consumers, and help ameliorate the effects of this nationwide recall."
