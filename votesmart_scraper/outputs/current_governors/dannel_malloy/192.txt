Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he has signed into law legislation that he introduced earlier this year that strengthens the laws on carrying a firearm while under the influence, aligning it to similar limits currently in state statute on drunk driving and drunk boating.
Under prior law, a person could be found in violation of carrying a firearm while intoxicated if their blood alcohol level reached 0.10. This was inconsistent with similar laws on driving or boating under the influence, which has a legal limit of 0.08. This new legislation the Governor signed, which was adopted by unanimous votes in the state legislature, reduces the blood alcohol level for carrying a firearm to match that of drunk driving and boating.
"If you are too drunk to drive, then you are too drunk to carry a firearm - there should be no question about that. This was an inconsistency that had to be addressed, and we did just that. This is a smart law. I want to thank the members of the General Assembly for their unanimous, bipartisan support for this bill," Governor Malloy said. "Guns and alcohol are a deadly combination, and when it comes to firearm safety, we should all agree that commonsense laws like this are necessary."
