Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to President Obama's announcement that he will be taking a series of actions to reduce gun violence and make our communities safer:
"This is a commonsense issue - and one that demands action. President Obama is doing just that. We cannot sit back and let guns get into the hands of those who shouldn't have them, and we cannot simply watch almost daily tragedy occur. Too many loved ones have been lost, and too many families have been torn apart by gun violence. That's why President Obama deserves enormous praise for leading on this issue in Washington, just as we have in Connecticut. It's time to step up - and we deeply appreciate the smart, commonsense steps the White House announced today. These actions will no doubt make a difference and make our communities safer."
