Press Release

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement on the Department of Labor's monthly Labor Situation Report. The report shows that job totals are at a recovery high, while unemployment among residents is at a recovery low. The state added more than 10,000 private sector jobs in September and the unemployment rate now stands at 6.4% - the lowest point since November 2008.

"Today's jobs report is another sign that we are making steady progress in improving our state's economy. With the addition of these jobs, we've added nearly 70,000 private sector jobs since January of 2011. That's one of the best periods for private sector job growth since the 1990s. And when you look at annual job growth on a monthly basis, what you see is that the state has gained jobs every single month.

"There is still much more that must be done so that our state is better prepared to continue this progress in the future. I've said it before and I'll say it again -- we can't be satisfied until everyone in our state who wants a job has one."
