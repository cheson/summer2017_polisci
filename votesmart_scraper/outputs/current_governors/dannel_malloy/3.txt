Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the ruling issued today by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals maintaining the injunction on President Trump's travel ban:
"Yet again, another federal court has ruled in favor of reason and against President Trump's unconstitutional travel ban. The administration can continue to try to claim that this ban is not based upon religion, but previous and recent public pronouncements by President Trump in fact state otherwise.
"We are a nation of immigrants and refugees, a nation of people in search of a better life for themselves and their kin -- and this executive order attempts to block those who look towards our nation for hope simply based on their religion. While today is yet another victory, this fight will likely end in the United States Supreme Court, where I believe this travel ban will ultimately be ruled unconstitutional."
