Malloy Announces Job-Growth Proposal

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dannel P. Malloy said Thursday that his ideas for economic development could create 100,000 new jobs in Connecticut by 2010.
Malloy, the mayor of Stamford, would create a nonprofit organization called Venture Connecticut that would absorb existing job programs, provide centralized services and set benchmarks for accountability.
"Let me say this, that if I fail to meet reasonable standards as governor, I want the public to hold me responsible," Malloy said. "I will never try to put a happy face on job-production numbers that are half the national average."
Malloy also would create "wage insurance" for workers who have to take lower-paying positions if their jobs are outsourced. And he would give state companies preference for state contracts.
Malloy delivered his proposal a week after his Democratic rival, New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr., said Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell's administration must stop trying to "bribe" companies to expand in Connecticut with loans, grants and tax credits.
