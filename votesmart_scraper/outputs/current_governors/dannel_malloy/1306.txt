Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: June 1, 2012
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy this afternoon released the following statement:

"The Speaker made the right decision today when he decided to turn his responsibilities for the Special Session over to Rep. Sharkey. There's a lot of important work to do between now and June 12th, and then on June 12th, and the Speaker's active participation would have been a distraction. In terms of what comes next for the Speaker, I urge him to give it a lot of thought, quickly, and come forward and speak to the people of Connecticut."
