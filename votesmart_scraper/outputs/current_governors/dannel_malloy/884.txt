Governor Dannel P. Malloy today declared a State of Emergency in an attempt for the state to pursue a request to the federal government to help some municipalities in Connecticut that are experiencing road salt shortages for the remainder of this winter season. Today's winter weather event is the twelfth of the season.
"I have asked our state emergency management personnel to reach out to our cities and towns tonight and get more information on what their salt supplies look like right now, indicating to us how much they currently have on hand and how much they use in a typical storm," Governor Malloy said. "This will enable us to pursue a request to the federal government to assist these communities to increase their supplies as the winter season continues."
The Governor added, "I want to stress that this request is to address the issue of salt supplies for the remainder of this winter season as there surely will be additional snow and ice events this year. With winter storms impacting many parts of the country, some of which don't typically see this type of weather, salt supplies are being stretched throughout the entire eastern portion of the US."
More information on a request to the federal government will be announced as soon as the plan is formalized.
In addition, Governor Malloy announced that all non-essential, first-shift state employees should report to work on Friday, February 14, on a one-hour delay based on the time that each employee would normally report to work. This will help stagger the early morning rush hour commute.
