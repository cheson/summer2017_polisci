Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement upon final passage of Senate Bill 840 -- An Act Concerning Next Generation Connecticut.

"This bill positions UConn as one of the leading research institutions in the nation and prepares students for jobs in the fields we are expanding right here in Connecticut--bioscience, engineering, digital media, and technology," said Governor Malloy. "I applaud Speaker Sharkey and the legislature for their action on this bill. It will support a major expansion at UConn, bring thousands of jobs to the state, and attract millions of dollars in research investment and business activity."

The proposal is endorsed by more than 100 businesses and positions UConn as a leading research institution by investing $1.5 billion to support major expansions on three campuses. It will also ensure:

$137 million in state funds to support a 30 percent increase in enrollment at UConn--adding 6580 students and 259 faculty to the UConn Storrs and UConn Stamford campuses.
Expansion of the School of Engineering by increasing enrollment by 70 percent.
A 47 percent expansion in the total number of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) graduates.
Addition of 50 STEM doctoral fellowships and creation of the premier STEM honors program in the U.S.
Relocating the Hartford campus to improve accessibility, strengthen collaboration with regional business, and addition of real-world internships to help students launch careers.
