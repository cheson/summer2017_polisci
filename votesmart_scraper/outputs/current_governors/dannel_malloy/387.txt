Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement on President Obama's speech on criminal justice reform:
"Our state should be proud - the President is emphasizing at a national level many of the steps we've recently made here at home. Criminal justice reform is too important to ignore, for individuals and their families, for our communities, and for our nation. That's why we've led by making Connecticut a Second Chance Society - and that's why we're so pleased President Obama is showing such extraordinary leadership at the federal level."
