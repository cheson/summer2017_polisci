Malloy Addresses Economic Renewal At New Haven Rotary Club
06.27.2006
Category: Jobs
Endorsed Democratic candidate for Governor Dan Malloy today told the New Haven Rotary Club that a key component to urban renewal, creating jobs and moving a community forward is an effective crime prevention strategy.
"The number one mission of government is keeping people safe," Malloy told the group of New Haven business leaders. "If people are safe they will want to live, work and raise a family in that community, and employers want to locate there. You can't grow jobs if you don't invest in law enforcement strategies that include community policing."
Malloy said that to create jobs across the state and revitalize urban areas Connecticut needs a different kind of leader in the Governor's office, one who can solve the state's most compelling problems. "He pointed to the need for universal health care as not only a moral imperative but a competitive tool in the global fight for jobs, fundamental property tax reform, affordable housing for our workforce, a long range transportation strategy, an energy policy that makes Connecticut more affordable and competitive, and a life long learning approach to education from universal pre-K to job training.
