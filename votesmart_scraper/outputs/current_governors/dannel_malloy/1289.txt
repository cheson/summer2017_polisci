Gov. Malloy on Obama Administration Announcement of Deferred Action Process for Young People
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano's announcement today of a deferred action process for certain young people who are low enforcement priorities.

"The Administration's announcement today to not begin removal proceedings for children who were brought to this county by their parents lifts the specter of deportation from their lives and will allow them to contribute to the economic future of our state and our nation. There are thousands of school age children in this situation in Connecticut, some who have lived here since they were infants. They committed no crime. Many are in school, working toward the American Dream, contributing to the strength of our workforce and ultimately our ability to compete in a global economy.

"We are a nation of immigrants, and for too long we've had policies in place that do not celebrate the many contributions that immigrants have made to our history. President Obama's decision today is a great step toward honoring our nation's legacy, one that will help to move our country forward."
