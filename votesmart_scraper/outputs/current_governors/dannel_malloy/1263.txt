Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on the Affordable Health Care Act and the impact on women's health care:

"The Affordable Health Care Act is a tremendously important step forward for women's health care. I've said it time and time again: decisions about women's health should be made by women and their doctors, not by insurance companies or politicians. Certainly we must rein in burdensome costs, but we need to do it in a smart and strategic way that ensures preventative screenings and services are available to women and their families. The Affordable Health Care Act means that important, possibly life saving, treatment will be accessible and affordable for millions of women across this country. I commend President Obama for this initiative and for putting women's health care back in the hands of women and their doctors."
