Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding a report released today from the state legislature's nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis showing that state agencies saved more than $37 million in overtime costs during Fiscal Year 2016, which ended on June 30, 2016 - about $4 million more than reported last month. This amounts to a 14.5 percent drop when compared to the previous fiscal year, as indicated in a letter sent from Office of Policy and Management Secretary Ben Barnes to the Governor this afternoon.
"This updated report demonstrates our state employees, managers, and commissioners are doing a tremendous job of delivering top-notch services efficiently," Governor Malloy said. "These steps are critical to right-sizing government, but there is still much work to be done. The world is changing and we are working to change state government with it."
