Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that nearly $1.5 million in federal assistance has been received by Connecticut since President Obama approved his Disaster Declaration request for New Haven, New London, Tolland, and Windham Counties as a result of the January 2015 blizzard. During the storm, some areas saw more than two feet of snow, with many towns - particularly in eastern Connecticut - devastated for several days or more.
To date, the state has received $1,497,213 in federal assistance to reimburse municipalities, state agencies, and eligible non-profit organizations in the eligible counties for disaster expenses.
"We experienced extraordinary weather this winter - and through smart decisions, we got through it. After fighting hard for federal reimbursement and receiving it, we're going to continue working with our local and federal partners to get the job done - together," Governor Malloy said. "I would like to thank President Obama and FEMA for their continued support. These federal funds are providing much needed assistance to areas that faced a heavy financial toll."
President Obama approved Governor Malloy's Disaster Declaration request in early April for New London, Tolland, and Windham Counties and approved New Haven County to be added in early May.
FEMA's Public Assistance Program provides state and local governments and eligible private non-profit organizations in designated counties federal funds to pay 75 percent of the approved cost for assistance categories.
