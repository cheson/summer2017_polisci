Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released a revised, balanced budget proposal that addresses the entirety of the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis's deficit projection by closing a projected $922 million deficit for FY2017. Falling under the statutory spending cap, this is the only budget presented thus far that tackles the full scope of the challenge. It includes no tax increases.
"We have an obligation as elected officials to tackle the full scope of our challenge. That means we must align our spending with the revenue we actually have, not the revenue we wish we had. Our expectations need to change - we cannot afford to fund everything we always have. And we need to change the way we budget," Governor Malloy said. "If we are to do what's right for the state, if we are to put Connecticut on a better path for the long-term, then we need to make tough but necessary decisions now to adapt to our new economic reality. That's what this budget does."
