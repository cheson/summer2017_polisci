Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that his longtime Chief of Staff, Mark Ojakian, will depart the administration by the end of 2015.
"I will miss working with Mark on a daily basis, but I understand it is time for him to turn the page to a different chapter in his life. Mark has been one of my most trusted friends and advisors," Governor Malloy said. "Through his efforts, we have been able to make an agreement with labor that allowed the state to cut billions in long-term debt, passed an increase in the minimum wage, implemented paid sick leave, made record investments in transportation, and passed a sweeping reforms to our criminal justice system."
"It has been an honor to serve Governor Malloy. He is not only a dedicated, hardworking public servant who has put our state on the path of progress, but he has also been a great friend," Ojakian said. "I will miss working with Governor Malloy, as well as the talented people throughout our administration. It has truly been an honor and privilege to serve the people of Connecticut in this role."
Ojakian received a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from St. Anselm's College in Manchester, New Hampshire in 1975 and a Master of Arts degree in International Relations from the American University in Washington, DC in 1977. He lives with his husband Jason Veretto in West Hartford. He has two children, Brandon and Kyle, and two grandchildren, Connor and Madison.
Prior to joining the Governor's office, Ojakian served as Deputy Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, and served as Deputy Comptroller under then-State Comptroller Nancy Wyman for 16 years when she headed that office. In his role as Deputy Comptroller, he acted as senior policy advisor, oversaw over 250 employees, and had fiscal responsibility for over $1 billion in state accounts.
The Governor will announce a replacement for Ojakian at a later date.
