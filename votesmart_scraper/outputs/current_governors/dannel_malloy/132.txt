Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the announcement made today by the U.S. Department of the Interior that two Connecticut sites - the James Merrill House in Stonington and the Steward's House in Cornwall - have been designated as national historic landmarks:
"Connecticut has a long and rich history as a cultural destination, with a revolutionary spirit that has led the nation and continues to this day. The designation of these two sites today as national historic landmarks is particularly notable, given our state's history as a leader on issues concerning civil rights - especially in regards to racial justice and equal rights for our LGBT brothers and sisters. We are proud of this revolutionary spirit, and are grateful to have this history acknowledged and celebrated for years to come."
