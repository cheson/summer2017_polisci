Malloy Unveils Tax Plan

Democratic gubernatorial contender Dannel P. Malloy says he believes the state could pump $500 million-plus into municipal school grants if the state would cut even a modest portion of the nearly $4.4 billion in tax breaks it provides each year.
Malloy, the mayor of Stamford, recently unveiled a state tax overhaul plan that also would levy a higher income tax on wealthy households and use that revenue to offer a refundable tax credit for the elderly.
"If the people of Connecticut were tasked today with designing a tax structure to pay for local government, to pay for education, to support our senior citizens, this current system is not the one we would choose," said Malloy, who faces New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr. in an Aug. 8 Democratic gubernatorial primary.
Malloy's plan, in part, cites the Tax Expenditure Report, a biennial assessment of all state tax exemptions and credits, prepared by the state legislature's nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis.
With over $4.39 billion of tax breaks on the books, some of which haven't been reassessed in nearly three decades, Malloy says the state owes it to taxpayers to tackle the huge task of re-evaluating all of these.
"When I am governor, the measure of what is good and what isn't is simple: Does this tax break produce jobs or stimulate the economy?" Malloy said. "I take this very seriously."
Malloy said he believes there is the potential to find "hundreds of millions of dollars" to help ease the burden on municipal property taxpayers if even a portion of these tax breaks are ended.
