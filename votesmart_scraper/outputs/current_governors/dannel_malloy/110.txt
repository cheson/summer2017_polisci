Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statements condemning what has been reported to be dozens of threats at Jewish community centers across the country, including in Connecticut:
Governor Malloy said, "Hate-filled threats of this nature are alarming, disgusting, and deserve no place in our society. Our state and our country were built on values of acceptance, compassion, fairness, and respect for people from all backgrounds of life. I thank our federal, state, and local law enforcement officials for their quick response today to ensure the safety of everyone involved. Acts of this nature will not be tolerated, and we remain resolved in fostering diverse, resilient communities free from such acts of hate."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "One of the very foundations of this democracy is the freedom to safely practice religion. I am heartsick at the thought that this kind of bigotry has happened here in Connecticut and across the nation. I stand with Governor Malloy and the many others who are outraged by these events and join those who are calling for an end to this divisiveness."
