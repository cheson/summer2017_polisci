Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy, following a request by Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick, has asked Connecticut residents to observe a moment of silence at 2:50 p.m. today in recognition of the victims of the bombing at the Boston Marathon last week.

"Connecticut stands with Massachusetts in honoring the victims of the tragedy last week in Boston," said Governor Malloy. "I've directed state agencies to join Massachusetts in a moment of silence at 2:50 today, and am encouraging Connecticut residents to do the same. We thank law enforcement and first responders for their actions at the marathon and in the days that followed. Our thoughts remain with the victims of this senseless tragedy and the families mourning the loss of their loved ones."
"This is an opportunity not only to recognize those innocent people who taken from us or injured one week ago and the first responders who bravely came to their aid, but to reaffirm our resolve against those who attack and threaten our freedom," said Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman.

Governor Patrick has directed bells throughout Massachusetts ring at 2:50 p.m., marking the time of the explosions.

Governor Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Wyman will observe the moment of silence at Minuteman Park in front of the State Armory in Hartford.
