Statement

Governor Malloy released the following statement today about China's proposed plan to curb emissions and tackle climate change. The plan builds upon international progress made at an event in California last week, which the Governor spoke at and attended at the invitation of the White House:
"Just last week we gathered at the U.S. - China Climate Leaders Summit to commit to stronger cooperative efforts to combat climate change. We told Connecticut's story on an international stage - highlighting our first-in-the-nation initiatives and emphasis on tackling global warming. This is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive solution only possible through cooperation and collaboration. Connecticut is no doubt doing its part. We've pledged to reduce emissions by 80 percent below 2001 levels by the year 2050 - and we'll get there by building on the innovative solutions we've implemented. As we reduce demand, we're aiming to boost efficiency and move to cleaner power. We are deploying renewable energy resources in our state like never before, and the key to our success so far has been utilizing a combination of public and private sector solutions. And as a result of our work with numerous other states through the RGGI program-a flexible, market-based solution-carbon emissions from power plants in Connecticut have declined 34 percent from 1990 to 2012, with $137 million generated for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. Indeed, new jobs have been added to our economy because we've shown leadership on climate change."
"Today, China's national government is taking a dramatic step that builds upon the subnational commitments made last week in Los Angeles to reduce China's greenhouse gas emissions. I was proud to be a part of it - and today we should all be proud to see a major step forward on this critical issue. I would like to congratulate President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the White House for its work with China on this agreement."
