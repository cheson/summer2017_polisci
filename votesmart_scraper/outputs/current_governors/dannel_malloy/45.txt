Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the unanimous approval this evening of a revenue package in the General Assembly's Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committee:
"The revenue bill that passed in committee today is obviously not going to be the final package -- there is much work still to do, and projections continue to change. But here's what should be obvious: today's committee vote confirms a clear and growing consensus between our administration, and legislative Democrats and Republicans that this year's eventual budget should not and will not be driven by new revenue."
