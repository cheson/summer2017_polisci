Gov. Malloy Signs Executive Order Banning State-Funded Travel to North Carolina
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he has signed an executive order banning state-funded travel to North Carolina in response to its recently adopted HB2 legislation, which discriminates against members of the LGBT community.
"When we see discrimination and injustice, we have to act. This law is not just wrong, it poses a public safety risk to Connecticut residents traveling through North Carolina. That's why I have signed an executive order banning state-funded travel to the state. This law endangers the welfare not just of North Carolina's citizens, but of all people visiting that state," Governor Malloy said. "Nearly two decades ago, Connecticut was among the first states to pass a comprehensive anti-discrimination law concerning sexual orientation, and three years ago I proudly signed a law adding gender identity and expression to those statutes. We need to do what we can to stand up and act against laws that encourage - as a matter of public policy - discrimination and endangerment of our citizenry. It's unacceptable, and Connecticut is acting."
