Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection today of a challenge to a California state law that bans the so-called practice of "conversion therapy," which attempts to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity by oftentimes using destructive practices that are harmful to youths, such as electric shock therapy:
"The U.S. Supreme Court's action today confirms that laws banning this so-called therapy are not only constitutional, they are needed to protect minors from this destructive practice that can have lifelong, damaging effects. The framing of sexual orientation as an illness or condition requiring correction is as destructive as it is uninformed. Today's judicial decision comes at the same time that our own state is considering adoption of a law similar to the one that our nation's highest court upheld, which only validates the reasons why Connecticut lawmakers should vote to act favorably on the pending bill. I urge the General Assembly to approve this legislation so that I can sign it into law."
The pending Connecticut legislation is House Bill 6695, An Act Concerning the Protection of Youth from Conversion Therapy
