"High temperatures can be dangerous for your health, especially for the elderly, young children, and people who work outside," Governor Malloy said. "Remember to keep cool and follow common sense tips like drinking lots of water, staying in the shade, and monitoring those who are at greatest risk when temperatures are extremely high."
"Heat stress can severely impact a person's health to the point where they need to seek emergency medical care," Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Jewel Mullen said. "Even healthy people can be impacted by high temperatures, so it is important that everyone take precautions when it is hot."
"We are now into the height of the summer season, and everyone should take the necessary precautions as temperatures rise," Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection Commissioner Dora Schriro said. "A few simple steps can greatly reduce heat-related issues, especially for the elderly, the very young, and people with respiratory ailments who are more susceptible to the effects of high temperatures."
