Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to the Obama Administration's announcement today that it will invest $100 million in mental health centers and facilities.

"I commend President Obama and VP Biden on making mental health a priority as states move to implement the Affordable Care Act. Choosing to invest in our nation's mental health infrastructure is one of the wisest things we can do in our efforts to prevent acts of violence.

"As we approach the one year anniversary of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, many questions remain for which we may never know the answers. But as we increase our focus on mental health, it's important that we further discussions within our communities and schools to decrease the stigma and discrimination faced by individuals diagnosed with mental illness."
