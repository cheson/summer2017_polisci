HARTFORD - Democratic gubernatorial contender Dannel P. Malloy unveiled a proposal Thursday to guarantee health insurance for all Connecticut children.
Calling it "a moral imperative," Malloy said his Every Child Matters program to close a gap as large as 71,000 uninsured children by expanding the state insurance safety net for an estimated $21.4 million per year.
Malloy, who is expected to face New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr. in a Democratic gubernatorial primary this August, added he believes his plan could save some middle-income families hundreds of dollars in premiums each month.
"It is, in a word, 'shameful' that there are approximately 71,000 Connecticut children who don't have access to health care coverage in this, the wealthiest state in the wealthiest nation in the world," Malloy said. "It's something that we have a moral obligation to fix."
There are no exact numbers on uninsured children in Connecticut.
