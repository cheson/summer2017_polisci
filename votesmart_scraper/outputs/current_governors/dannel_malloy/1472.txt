Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Insurance Commissioner Thomas B. Leonardi today announced that several more insurance companies, including Allstate, have agreed to waive the higher cost hurricane deductible for coastal property owners in the wake of Tropical Storm Irene.

The Malloy administration has been working closely with insurers that write homeowners policies in Connecticut to address the issue, which would have cost some homeowners tens of thousands of dollars in out-of-pockets costs.

"We are grateful that so many companies have stepped up do the right thing and we will continue our efforts with others in the industry," Governor Malloy said. "Certainly, what has been accomplished so far is gaining a much-needed financial break for many, but the long-term benefits of helping individuals put their lives back together are incalculable."

Commissioner Leonardi said the companies that have either waived the hurricane deductibles or have coastal policies in which their triggers have not been met represent about 80 percent of homeowners' insurance market in Connecticut.
