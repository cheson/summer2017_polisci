Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) has exceeded its goal of advertising $1 billion worth of bids on construction projects in the current federal fiscal year by 20 percent. At the end of the fiscal year on September 30, ConnDOT will have advertised bidding on $1.2 billion for 107 individual projects across Connecticut.

"According the Federal Highway Administration, 21 jobs are created or sustained for every $1 million in transportation infrastructure spending, meaning that $1.2 billion translates to 25,200 jobs in direct construction and supplier jobs," said Governor Malloy. "Many thousands of additional jobs are sustained indirectly by transportation spending, ranging from sandwich vendors on construction sites to engineering firms that design major projects."

Highlights of the projects advertised this fiscal year include:

-Widening of I-84 in Waterbury, $403 million;
-New Haven Commuter Rail Line overhead power line replacement, $116 million;
-New stations on the New Haven-Hartford-Springfield rail line (in Wallingford, Berlin and Meriden), $70 million;
-Road and safety improvements in Stratford, $29 million;
-Replacement of four Route 8 bridges in Bridgeport, $41 million;
