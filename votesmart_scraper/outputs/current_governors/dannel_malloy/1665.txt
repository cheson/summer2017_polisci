Democratic nominee for Governor Dan Malloy today commented on news that neighboring states Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island will all receive funding as part of the federal "Race to the Top" program. Connecticut applied for both rounds of the grants, but was not considered a finalist for funding in either round. Said Malloy:
"All the states that border Connecticut are getting a share of this fundingÂ… but we're not. Has there ever been a more prime example of why we need new, energized leadership in Hartford? It's not a surprise, since we already knew that Connecticut wasn't in consideration, but today's announcement is just a reminder that Connecticut has shown a complete inability to compete against other states -- including its immediate regional competitors -- for federal funding. We can't keep losing like this.
"We shouldn't let anyone tell us that it has to be this way, or that change isn't possible. As the former Mayor of a large city I know what's involved in fighting for every penny that's available. My administration formalized a rigorous process for going after federal money, and the result was millions of dollars in funding for things like transportation and affordable housing. How? By going to Washington -- in person -- and fighting tooth and nail for every dollar.
"Those kind of results are possible for the state, but achieving them will take nothing short of a fundamental change in the way we do business in Hartford."
