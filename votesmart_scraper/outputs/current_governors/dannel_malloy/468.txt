Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that as the result of a new state law he introduced and signed last year, nonprescription drugs and medications are exempt from sales taxes in Connecticut beginning today.

"Making nonprescription medications exempt from the sales tax will mean lower costs for consumers while ultimately leading to a better public health outcome for all," Governor Malloy said. "Preventative care is a necessity, and by eliminating these sales taxes, we are helping our residents save some money, stay healthy, and improve quality of life."

"Connecticut's leadership on healthcare means stronger families and a more competitive economy," Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said. "Exempting nonprescription medicines from the sales tax is part of the state's overall commitment to improving access to healthcare, supporting healthy families, and building a healthy state."

Some examples of nonprescription items that are now sales tax free include things such as vitamins; antihistamines; cough, cold, asthma and allergy medicines; pain relievers; antacids; and other similar medications. Prescription medications have already been exempt from sales taxes.

The Connecticut Department of Revenue Services has created a document to provide guidance on the types of products included in the newly enacted exemption.
