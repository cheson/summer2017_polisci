Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding his signing of the campaign finance legislation:

"Today, I signed into law a bill that will vastly increase disclosure requirements for independent campaign expenditures. As the first candidate for governor elected under the state's public financing system, I am deeply committed to the principle that the people of Connecticut have a right to know who's paying for the advertisements and other expenditures that are designed to sway public opinion prior to an election. This bill does that.

"Let me be very clear about why I'm signing this bill into law. The Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case was a tragic decision. The Citizens United decision reversed years of campaign finance reforms and allowed unlimited private money into politics, empowering the wealthy few at the expense of our democracy. Faced with that tragic decision, which is now the law of the land, we can at least shine a light on the sources of private money in politics. The bill I'm signing today requires a level of disclosure that few if any other states require. No bill is perfect. But this bill makes Connecticut a national leader in requiring disclosure and transparency."

The legislation is Public Act 13-180 -- An Act Concerning Disclosure of Independent Expenditures and Changes to Other Campaign Finance Laws and Election Laws.
