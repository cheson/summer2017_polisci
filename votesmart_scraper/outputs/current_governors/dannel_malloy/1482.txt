In advance of Hurricane Irene's likely impact on Connecticut, Governor Dannel P. Malloy today signed a Declaration of Emergency this afternoon. The Declaration of Emergency provides Governor Malloy with a number of emergency powers, including:
* The ability to order evacuations of all or part of the population of a stricken or threatened area and take necessary steps for receipt and care of evacuees
*
The ability to modify or suspend any state statute, regulation, or requirement (for example: altering work hours, waiving licensing requirements, etc.)
* The ability to order civil preparedness forces into action
* The ability to designate vehicle and person routes and movements

"The forecast path of Hurricane Irene has convinced me that the signing of this declaration is necessary, and will help us react more quickly and effectively in the event of a serious weather event," said Governor Malloy. "I will continue to work with state and local officials and authorities to ensure that our state is as prepared as possible for Hurricane Irene, and can react as efficiently as possible on behalf of our residents."
