Date: March 11, 2016
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statements in response to the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for January 2016:
Governor Malloy said, "While the numbers demonstrate progress - with the private sector growing over 11,000 jobs over the year - these numbers are also emblematic of our new economic reality. We have been positioning the state to support long-term growth to meet our new reality as we work to make changes that will lead to even greater gains in both total job growth and overall wages. I won't be satisfied until everyone who wants a job has one."
