Gov. Malloy Launches Conversation on Expanding "Second Chance Society' Initiatives in Connecticut
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Nov. 6, 2015
Location: Hartford, CT

"We need to become a society of permanent progress, not permanent punishment. That means we need to continue innovating, and we need to keep leading. Some of these ideas are first-in-the-nation initiatives. Mass incarceration has, for far too long, jailed a generation of men of color. If this sounds like Second Chance Part Two in Connecticut, that's because it is. We have no doubt seen leadership from the White House and at federal levels, and here in Connecticut, I hope to keep forging ahead," Governor Malloy said in his address, which was held at the UConn School of Law. "Our inmates cost us $120 per night - every single inmate. Let's be sure that when they leave, they don't come back."
"If we are to acknowledge that a one-size-fits-all approach to criminal justice hasn't worked, that permanent punishment hasn't worked, then let's think about changing the artificial barriers society has imposed to get it right. We must recognize that what may be trailblazing today may be the norm tomorrow. That's how progress happens," Governor Malloy said.
"At this very moment, there are hundreds of low-risk offenders sitting in Connecticut jails - pretrial - on low bond. Because they are unable to come up with even a few hundred dollars, the state is housing them in jail for weeks or even months," Governor Malloy said. "All of it is costing taxpayers - and it needs to change. We need to revisit our existing laws on the bail bond system that keep these low-risk individuals in jail pre-trial in the first place. And we must ensure - for those with bail under $20,000 - that our criminal justice system is guided not by wealth or income or privilege, but on the severity of the crime."
