Gov. Malloy Applauds Committee Approval of Legislation Reforming the State's Pretrial Justice System
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: April 4, 2017
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the vote in the General Assembly's Judiciary Committee this evening approving legislation he introduced that will reform the state's pretrial justice system to help break the cycle of crime and poverty:
"Across the nation, courts are ruling that the current system of bail is unconstitutional. Today's vote by the Judiciary Committee is the first step in correcting Connecticut's bail system and moving toward a more just and equitable procedure by taking into account public safety risk rather than a defendant's ability to pay. Being poor should never be a crime, and this bill is a start to fixing a current system that penalizes poverty. In addition to the members of the committee who voted to approve this legislation, I want to acknowledge the members of the Connecticut Sentencing Commission whose ongoing work is helping to bring about these needed changes."
