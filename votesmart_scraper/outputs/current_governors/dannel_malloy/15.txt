Gov. Malloy & Lt. Gov. Wyman Hail Senate Passage of "Person First' Legislation
By: Nancy Wyman Dan Malloy

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman are applauding the State Senate for voting tonight to approve legislation the Governor introduced that updates outdated language within the Connecticut state statutes that are in reference to persons with disabilities and replaces them with person-first, respectful language.
The idea to make these modifications first came to the Governor's attention through the Department of Developmental Services, which pointed out several areas of state statute that use words that are out-of-date and do not promote inclusion and respect for any person who has a disability.
"Making these updates to our state statutes is another step in the state's evolution of disability advocacy, disability rights, and disability action," Governor Malloy said. "Words have meaning, words have power, and words have impact. The shift to person-first language within our statutes signifies an important reflection of how we think about people -- most notably as individuals and not generalizations that fit into entire populations."
"This change encourages respect for people with disabilities," Lt. Governor Wyman said. "Dignity and inclusion should be part of all of our conversations. I applaud the Senate and urge the House to take action to send this bill to the Governor's desk."
The legislation is Senate Bill 796, An Act Concerning the Use of Respectful and Person-First Language. It next moves to the House of Representatives for consideration.
