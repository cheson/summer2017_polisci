Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in reaction to the final passage of his education reform legislation:

"I am tremendously proud of the work we've done over the last few months to fix what's broken in our public schools.

"Once again, against the backdrop of Washington, DC -- a place paralyzed by partisan bickering -- Democrats and Republicans in Connecticut have come together to take on an issue of tremendous importance.

"We all know that we can't keep doing what we've done for more than twenty years when it comes to public education. Our kids can't afford it, and quite frankly, neither can our state.

"I believe education reform is the civil rights issue of our time, and once I sign this bill, the table will be set for real and fundamental reform of our public schools.

"I want to thank Speaker Donovan and Majority Leader Sharkey for their leadership, and I want to thank Representative Cafero and the members of his caucus for putting politics aside in the best interests of Connecticut's children.

"This session, my priority was reforming public education, and working together we've taken real steps toward that goal. Now, it's time to get to work."

The legislation, which passed the House today in concurrence with the Senate, is Senate Bill 458 -- An Act Concerning Educational Reform.
