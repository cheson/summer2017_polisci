Governor Malloy to Sign Bill Capping Gross Receipts Tax on Gasoline
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: March 30, 2012
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he will sign legislation unanimously approved Wednesday by the General Assembly that provides for a cap on the per-gallon price at which gasoline is taxed and protects consumers from profiteering and price gouging by big oil wholesalers.

"We are all very concerned about the national rising cost of gasoline and its impact on Connecticut residents, businesses and the state's economy as a whole, especially as the summer driving season approaches," Governor Malloy said. "I want to be clear that although this is not going to provide consumers with the type of relief they need and expect, it will slow the rise in cost at a time when our residents need it. But what we really need to do as a state and a nation is move toward policies that lead us in the direction of energy independence."

The legislation is Senate Bill 457. The Governor will sign the bill on Tuesday so that Connecticut businesses have time to adopt the changes.
