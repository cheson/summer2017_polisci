Gov. Malloy Urges AAA Northeast to Reconsider Decision on Driver Licensing Services for Non-Members

Governor Dannel P. Malloy is urging AAA Northeast to reconsider its decision to discontinue offering driver licensing services for people who are not members of its motor club, a new policy that the company indicated in a letter to the state that they plan on implementing shortly.
AAA Northeast has offered this service to all Connecticut residents since 2001, whether or not they were members. The Governor notified AAA Northeast President and CEO Mark A. Shaw that if the organization refuses to serve non-members, he will direct the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to take any and all necessary legal steps to resolve the matter.
"This is unacceptable," Governor Malloy wrote in a letter to Shaw. "AAA Northeast's decision to stop servicing non-members is rather shocking since Connecticut has always valued our working relationship with AAA. The State of Connecticut and AAA have enjoyed a mutually beneficial private-public partnership for many years. Up to this point, the history of our partnership has been nothing but positive."
AAA Allied, which serves the other half of the state, has indicated that they will continue to serve both members and non-members.
"DMV has made real, demonstrable progress throughout this year to lower wait times and improve customer experience," the Governor wrote. "We will not allow the actions of AAA Northeast to disrupt that progress."
