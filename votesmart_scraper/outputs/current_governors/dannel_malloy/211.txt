Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement after speaking with MTA President Thomas Prendergast this morning regarding current delays on the Metro-North system due to a fire last night in Manhattan:
"I spoke with MTA President Thomas Prendergast this morning to receive an update directly. Our office, in conjunction with the Connecticut Department of Transportation, is closely monitoring the situation in New York City and we are receiving real-time updates on the status of the Metro-North rail line. The MTA has assured me that it is working around the clock to complete repairs and return to full service. Those residents who can work from home or can avoid Metro-North should do so until repairs can be completed - if residents have alternative means of travel, we would strongly urge them to utilize it. Trains this evening will no doubt be busy, and service will continue to be delayed and disrupted in the hours and days ahead. This will take time, and while it's undoubtedly very frustrating for residents, we would urge patience. The MTA assures us that it is doing all that it can to bring the line back to full capacity, and our office will continue to monitor this situation exceptionally closely."
