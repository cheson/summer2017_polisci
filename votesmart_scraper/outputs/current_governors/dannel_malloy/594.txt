Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement on the second anniversary of Super Storm Sandy:

"Our state continues to recover but there's more work to do. In the months that have passed since Super Storm Sandy, Tropical Storm Irene, and the October Nor'easter of 2011, we have taken steps to make sure our state can weather the effects of climate change. We've created the nation's first microgrid program, providing town centers with the capability of sustaining power during large-scale outages. We're holding utility companies accountable by imposing penalties on them if they don't take proper precautions or if they don't restore service in a timely manner.

"We're investing millions in hardening infrastructure along our shoreline to protect from future flooding, especially along our transportation system. We've created Shore Up CT to help shoreline residents who are subject to coastal flooding elevate their homes and businesses from future severe weather, filling a funding gap left by federal programs. We've designated thousands of acres of forest along our shoreline as open space, preserving the land in perpetuity and acting as a coastal buffer against storm waters. And, working with our Congressional delegation, we've secured hundreds of millions to help communities in need rebuild.

"Without question, there is more work to do. But we are making progress, and we're committed to seeing this through to the end."
