Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today applauded the Connecticut General Assembly for approving legislation the Governor introduced that will raise the minimum wage to $10.10. The Governor plans on signing the bill at a ceremony in New Britain on Thursday evening.

"I am proud that Connecticut is once again a leader on an issue of national importance. Increasing the minimum wage is not just good for workers, it's also good for business," said Governor Malloy. "This modest increase will give working families a boost, and it will contribute to our economy by getting just a little more money into the pockets of people who will spend it in their communities. I want to thank the leadership of the General Assembly, including Senate President Williams, Speaker Sharkey, and Labor Committee Co-Chairs Senator Holder-Winfield and Representative Tercyak for their helping to ensure that working families in our state will earn a decent wage."

Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said, "This is an important workforce issue -- raising the minimum wage will also benefit the 125,000 women across the state who are earning at or just above minimum wage, ensuring these hardworking women can improve their own economic security and better support their families. I applaud Senate President Williams, Speaker Sharkey, Senator Holder-Winfield, Representative Tercyak and the legislature for their work to protect and support Connecticut's workforce."

Thursday's ceremony will be held at 6:00 p.m. at Caf√© Beauregard, which is located at 2 Main Street in New Britain.
