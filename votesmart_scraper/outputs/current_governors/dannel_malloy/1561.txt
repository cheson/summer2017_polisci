Governor Dannel P. Malloy issued the following statement today in recognition of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.

"Unlike the victims of other crimes, sexual assault survivors may feel shame or embarrassment that may prevent them from seeking the help, treatment and services they need and deserve. It is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that survivors find protection and justice under the law, and that advocates have the resources they need to provide the care and support to victims and their loved ones. We recognize the extraordinary work done by the thousands of dedicated sexual assault crisis service employees, medical professionals, lawyers and police officers who protect and help heal survivors of sexual assault. But as a former prosecutor, and through conversations with my wife, Cathy, a sexual assault crisis center executive director, I have seen first-hand the successes and failures of our system. I am committed to working to build safer communities, prevent the escalation that leads to sexual violence, and protect our citizens from sexual assault and the devastation left in its wake."
