Press Release

Governor Dannel P. Malloy, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and the Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) are urging residents to seek information regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's recall - affecting nearly 34 million vehicles made by at least 11 companies - because of Takata-made airbags.
The DMV and DCP have done a review of the recall notice sent out by the federal government, and the state will monitor the progress of fixing this important safety issue. The DMV will ask over 5,000 new and used car dealers, along with car repair shops, in the state to check whether vehicles coming to their businesses for service or otherwise are listed among millions in a safety recall for defective air bags.
"It's our goal to get as much information out as possible, so we can protect the safety of residents in Connecticut - and we're doing just that. While some details are still unclear and the situation is evolving, we do know this: people should act. Residents may understandably be concerned, but there is no need for immediate panic. It is still early in the process, and people can and should still drive their cars," Governor Malloy said. "Nonetheless, residents should take this recall seriously."
"Safety is important and that is why we have recalls," DMV Commissioner Andres Ayala, Jr. said. "The DMV will be doing everything it can to work with car dealers, repairers and manufacturers to assist customers with this issue."
"The Department of Consumer Protection will continue to work with the Governor and DMV to gather information and get it out to the public as quickly as possible," DCP Commissioner Jonathan A. Harris said. "We also strongly urge consumers to promptly take the steps suggested to see if their vehicle may have an issue, and to be ready to make any necessary repairs."
The final number of affected automakers may change when a full federal review is completed.
