Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding President Obama's nomination of Loretta E. Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, as United States Attorney General:
"Loretta Lynch is a very well-respected prosecutor not only in the State of New York, but throughout the country, and I congratulate her on her nomination to become our nation's top law enforcement official. Over the last couple of years in Connecticut, my administration, in cooperation with our state's law enforcement community, has worked closely with the U.S. Justice Department in our efforts to reduce violent crime -- particularly when it comes to gun-related crimes within our urban areas. And our efforts have been working, showing a reduction in violent crime that has been more than double the national average over the last year. But we cannot stop there. I am confident that U.S. Attorney Lynch has the expertise to lead the Justice Department, and I look forward to working as a partner with her to continue these efforts in our state."
