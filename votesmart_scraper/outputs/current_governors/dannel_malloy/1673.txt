August 24, 2005 - Dan Malloy, Mayor of Stamford and Democratic Candidate for Governor, today applauded the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's vote to keep Connecticut's Sub Base open.
"I am thrilled and gratified by today's announcement," Malloy said. "Our first priority has to be to ensure that this reversal stands."
Malloy, who published a framework for keeping the Sub Base open in the June 1 edition of The Day, said, "I applaud all those who took part in this bipartisan effort to save the base, the workers' jobs, and to preserve this vital national security asset. This is a welcome relief."
Malloy added that "Connecticut cannot afford to be caught unprepared again. Once this process ends and the base is secure, we must look back at how this almost happened in the first place. Why is that important? Because the base should never have been on that list in the first place and if we'd had a proactive plan in place it wouldn't have been. We need to examine that issue so that something like this never comes close to happening again."
Malloy credited countless Connecticut citizens who devoted their time, sweat and tears to this fight for months. "Connecticut owes them a profound debt of gratitude. We must call on them again in the coming weeks to continue this fight, and to remain central to the planning and development process over the coming months and years to ensure the base's ongoing safety and security in the future."
