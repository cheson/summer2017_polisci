Governor Dannel P. Malloy today highlighted the release of a new report on national crime punishment rates by the Pew Charitable Trusts, which shows that Connecticut's approach of focused deterrence, including prioritizing violent and predatory offenders for incarceration, is reducing crime.
The report introduces a new metric known as the punishment rate, which compares the number of people in prison to the rate of crime for Part I crimes, including homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle thefts. The report shows Connecticut ranks 13th nationally in the punishment rate - which is the highest of any state in New England - while its imprisonment rate ranks 34th. That indicates that violent criminals are serving longer sentences even as Connecticut's crime rate is hitting new lows.
The report comes as the legislature considers the Governor's Second Chance 2.0 initiatives, which aims to end the cycle of crime and poverty among nonviolent offenders.
"This report validates what we in Connecticut already know - our nationally recognized approach to criminal justice is working," Governor Malloy said. "Those who commit violent crimes in Connecticut are serving longer sentences, while our crime rate has dropped to a nearly 50-year low. We are not just taking a tough approach to crime, but also a smart approach. Coupled with our Second Chance Society initiatives that are designed to end the cycle of crime and poverty, this report demonstrates that we are making progress to improve our communities."
