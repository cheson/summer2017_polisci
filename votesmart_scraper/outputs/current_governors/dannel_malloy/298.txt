Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's today decision to not take up a challenge to a 2013 law passed in Highland Park, Illinois that bans the sale, purchase, or possession of semi-automatic weapons that can hold more than ten rounds in a single ammunition clip or magazine:
"This is a moment in which our nation and elected officials across the country are recognizing the dangers that high-capacity magazines and assault weapons can pose to our citizenry. In the wake of our own state's tragedy, we passed some of the smartest gun laws in the nation. It's a law that we are proud to have passed.
"Today, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of a Chicago suburb's assault weapons and large-capacity magazine ban - a law very similar to what we have in Connecticut. That represents not just another step forward for commonsense gun safety - it also means that the constitutionality of Connecticut's law is strengthened as its opponents attempt to undermine it. The Supreme Court's decision is indeed another step forward for our own gun violence safety laws.
"As a nation, we need to take steps to prevent more unnecessary gun violence. Too many loved ones are being lost to needless tragedy. This is a moment to not only act in Congress, but to protect and uphold smart gun laws at the state level."
