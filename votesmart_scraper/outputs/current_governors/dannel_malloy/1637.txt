Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dan Malloy, sworn into office earlier today, signed three executive orders this afternoon, which will demand fiscal responsibility and honest budgeting, and the transparency in and continuity of government. As promised, these orders were his first official acts as Governor.

"These executive orders will open this new chapter in our state the right way," said Governor Malloy. "I ran for this office to create new jobs, keep the ones we have and importantly, get our state's fiscal house in order once again. By signing an order mandating that our state begin to transition into Generally Accepted Accounting Principles -- the same standard used in other states, Fortune 500 companies and required of municipalities -- we will begin to move toward honest budgeting and fiscal responsibility.

"In addition, to ensure the transparency in and the continuity of our state government, I've signed two additional executive orders on my first day in office. One mandates the preservation of Rell-era emails for historical use and archival purposes, and the other ensures that, while my administration transitions into office, the people of Connecticut do not experience any delay in or discontinuation of services or programs. These three orders will set the tone for my administration, and I'm looking forward to getting down to business on behalf of the people of Connecticut."
