Governor Dannel P. Malloy today said that his office and state emergency management officials are closely monitoring the activity of Hurricane Joaquin, which is currently in the Atlantic Ocean, and is advising Connecticut residents to closely follow weather reports and prepare for the possibility of its arrival in the region over the next five days.
"We are monitoring the storm closely, and our state emergency management officials have been in regular contact with the national weather service. While there are many variables with this storm, we are paying close attention to its track," Governor Malloy said. "Just as the state and its agencies are monitoring the weather and preparing appropriately, residents should do the same and closely watch forecasts over the next few days."
Officials with the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection are prepared to coordinate any potential state response and are participating in ongoing National Weather Service conference calls to receive the latest information on the storm's track.
