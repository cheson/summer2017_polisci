Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the decision of a federal appeals court today, which ruled that Indiana Governor Mike Pence cannot block federal funding that will help Syrian refugees resettle in Indiana:
"The federal appeals court today ruled on what we have been stating all along - individual governors cannot constitutionally or legally discriminate against a particular group of people based on their nationality. These refugees - many of whom are children fleeing a horrific, war-torn country - are vetted by the federal government through a rigorous process. We are a nation of immigrants, and we are a stronger nation because of it. Welcoming Syrian refugees who are escaping tragedy is the right way to address a humanitarian crisis."
