Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that funding has been approved to advance the upgrade of two major infrastructure projects in need of improvement: I-84 in West Hartford and Route 15 between New Haven and Woodbridge. The funds were approved as part of the Governor's ongoing "Let's Go CT!" transportation plan, which will make unprecedented investments to upgrade Connecticut's transportation system. The Governor aims to revitalize the state's aging infrastructure to make it best-in-class, attract business, and grow jobs.
"These two projects we are announcing will improve overall driver safety, capacity, and traffic flow on two of our busiest highways: I-84 in West Hartford and Route 15 in New Haven," Governor Malloy said. "I cannot stress enough how important Connecticut's economic future and our ability to grow jobs are tied directly to the condition of our transportation system. We can't afford to wait - the cost of inaction is far greater than the cost of making these critical investments. If we want to grow jobs and attract companies in the future, then we need to move forward with Let's Go CT now. And as we take these steps, we must get a constitutional lockbox for transportation funds on the ballot as soon as possible."
