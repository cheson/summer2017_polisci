Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the resignation of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder:

"I commend Attorney General Eric Holder for his many years of service to our nation. As Attorney General, he has been a true partner in our state's effort to lower crime, particularly in our larger cities. So far this year, fatal shootings in Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport are down by more than 30 percent thanks in large part to Project Longevity. General Holder also has been a great champion of civil rights and a defender of the Voting Rights Act. I wish him well in whatever he decides to do next."
