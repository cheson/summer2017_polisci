Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement after the Senate passed Senate Bill No. 36, An Act Concerning The Governor's Recommendations To Improve Access to Health Care:

"Due to Connecticut's successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act, nearly 200,000 residents now have access to health care. As the healthcare industry grows and changes, the role of advance practice registered nurses remains critical. This legislation will make sure that residents have access to high-quality preventative care, so they can lead healthier lives.

"The Senators who voted for this bill today should be commended for taking this critical step to improve access to healthcare across Connecticut. I particularly want to thank President Williams, Leader Looney and Committee Chair Gerratana for their hard work."

Senate Bill 36 upholds existing requirements for advance practice registered nurses (APRNs) to maintain a collaborative practice agreement with a physician during his or her first three years of practice, after which the requirement for a collaborative practice agreement is eliminated.
