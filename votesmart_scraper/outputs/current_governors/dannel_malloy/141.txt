Gov. Malloy Announces Funding to Upgrade the DMV Customer Contact Center

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the State Bond Commission has approved funding to upgrade and improve the Department of Motor Vehicles' (DMV) outdated customer contact center into a modernized system that will give customers even more convenient options when conducting business in an effort to decrease the amount of time customers may often experience on hold when making telephone calls to the center.
The technology used currently in the customer contact center was last updated in 1993 and annually leaves several hundred thousand telephone callers stranded and unable to get through to a DMV agent because of the system's limited capacity. The new, upgraded system will give customers the option to complete registration renewals over the telephone as a convenience for those who choose not to use the agency's available online services. When customers call for general information and a DMV representative is unavailable for immediate assistance, customers will be able to schedule a convenient time for a return call from the DMV. In addition, the system will also continue to have e-mail assistance, which the agency currently offers customers.
Last year, the DMV customer contact center provided answers to over 2.1 million callers.
"We are focused on delivering the residents of our state more convenience when conducting business with the DMV. The technology currently used at the customer contact center is several decades old and is in desperate need of being replaced. These upgrades will offer customers many different options for getting information more quickly," Governor Malloy said.
DMV Commissioner Michael Bzdyra said, "The new customer contact center will be a highly visible service, showing our commitment to become more customer-focused and cut wait times."
The department will consolidate customer service contact points in the agency for more efficiency in answering calls and any increased volume from providing more options. Work is expected to start in December or January for designing the new system and will take about nine months to complete. The new technology improvements are estimated to cost $1.8 million.
