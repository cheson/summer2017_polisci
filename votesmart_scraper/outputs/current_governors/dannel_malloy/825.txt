Governor Dannel P. Malloy and state Department of Agriculture Commissioner Steven K. Reviczky today announced that more than 40 farms, agricultural non-profits and municipalities will receive state funding totaling $880,327 as part of an ongoing effort to expand Connecticut's growing agricultural economy.

"Our diverse and vibrant agriculture sector is an important economic driver for our state with enormous potential for future job creation and economic growth," said Governor Malloy. "These grants are a clear sign that we can both preserve our agricultural heritage and help it expand and create jobs."

Funding was made through the Agriculture Department's Farm Transition Grant and Farm Viability Grant programs, designed to increase farm production, promote Connecticut Grown products and create jobs. The funding -- which requires a match from the grantee - will leverage nearly $2.4 million in investments.

Approved projects include:

Improvement of dairy, mushroom, Christmas tree and fruit farms
Construction of greenhouses
Building/modernization of retail farm-product and maple syrup stands
Expansion of wineries
Promotion of farmers' markets
Construction of an aquaculture eel-raising facility
