Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy is applauding the final passage of legislation in the Connecticut General Assembly that will create a pilot program allowing manufacturers and fleet service providers to test fully autonomous vehicles in Connecticut. The legislation, which was adopted in the House of Representatives tonight in concurrence with the Senate and next moves to the Governor for his signature, establishes strict requirements for testing under the program and requires participating municipalities to enter into agreements with autonomous vehicle testers.
"This legislation will help put Connecticut at the forefront of this innovative, burgeoning industry," Governor Malloy said. "Autonomous vehicles are already being tested in several states throughout the country, and we cannot allow our state to be outpaced as this technology grows. The final language of this legislation, which was overwhelmingly approved with bipartisan votes, includes specific qualifications through limited and controlled testing areas. By adopting this legislation, we will show this growing industry and those around the country that we embrace and promote innovation in Connecticut. In particular, I want to thank Senator Carlo Leone and the members of the Transportation Committee for their vision and leadership in helping this become a reality in our state."
The legislation is Senate Bill 260, An Act Concerning Autonomous Vehicles.
