At the request of Governor Dannel P. Malloy, the Federal Highway Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation is making available to Connecticut $1 million in Emergency Relief Funding for clean-up and bridge and roadway infrastructure repairs as a result of Hurricane Irene. The Connecticut Department of Transportation will have immediate access to the funding stream to pay for clean-up costs and for damages incurred to the roadway network as a result of the powerful storm.

"As Hurricane Irene swept toward Connecticut, I stressed the importance of preparation on the part of our state agencies and our residents," said Gov. Malloy. "But now that the storm has passed, we're focused on undoing what has been done to our homes, properties, and infrastructure. This funding source, which our federal partners have made immediately available, will allow our DOT to pay for ongoing clean-up, and to continue to make repairs as quickly as possible to damaged portions of our roads and bridges. We need to keep people and goods moving, and this will allow the DOT to do just that."

While there were no catastrophic failures of state roadways or bridges, damages did occur on a statewide level. Early estimates from the DOT expect cleanup and repair costs to top $5 million, including roughly $1 million in clean-up for local roads. The state of Connecticut will continue to work closely with its federal partners to maximize federal funding streams available to the state.
