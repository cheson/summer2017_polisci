Governor Dannel P. Malloy, following a proclamation by President Barack Obama, today ordered U.S. and Connecticut flags to fly at half-staff until sunset on September 16, 2012 in honor of Ambassador John Christopher Stevens and the American personnel who were killed in Benghazi, Libya yesterday.

"Our prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, friends and colleagues of Ambassador Stevens and the American personnel who were killed in this brutal attack," said Governor Malloy. "We know that the work to build nations and strengthen our global relationships is difficult and dangerous, and we are cognizant of just how many Americans undertake these efforts in embassies and consulates across the world. We stand with the President and the rest of the country in condemning the perpetrators of this attack."

"The attacks in Libya are a terrible reminder of the dangers that American personnel continue to face in some of the more troubled parts of the world," said Lieutenant Governor Wyman. "Ambassador Stevens and the rest of the embassy staff served our country with honor and dignity. Our hearts go out to everyone who is grieving their loss today."
