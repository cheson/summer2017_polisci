Governor Dannel P. Malloy today responded to news that the Air Force has awarded a $35 billion contract to Boeing for 179 refueling planes whose engines will be assembled at Pratt & Whitney in Middletown, Connecticut.

"Our Congressional delegation, especially Congressman Larson, is to be congratulated for their efforts in ensuring jobs stay in Connecticut. These manufacturing jobs are great news for a sector which has been particularly hard hit," said Governor Malloy. "Pratt & Whitney has been hard at work for decades building a skilled labor force and excellent reputation, and the recent contracts they have been awarded demonstrate the success of their efforts. My administration is working to rebuild the state's economy and stabilize the business environment. This contract is particularly meaningful as it will help move Connecticut in the right direction. This is excellent news for Pratt & Whitney and for the state. I applaud the Department of Defense choice to buy American."
