As Congress prepares to consider FY20111 funding for the Department of Defense, (DOD), I respectfully request your support for full funding of the Virginia Class Submarine Program.
The FY2011 DOD budget requested $3.44 billion for procurement of two submarines, along with $1.69 billion in advanced procurement to support future production. Those amount were subsequently authorized by Congress. However, the current Continuing Resolution (CR) provides only the FY2010 appropriated level of $1.97 billion for submarine production. This amount supports procurement of only one submarine.
The Virginia Class production schedule of two submarines per year beginning in FY2011 represents a policy decision carefully arrived at after substantial consideration with in DOD and by the congressional oversight committees. THis production rate is highly important for our national security interests, and for maintenance of the critical submarine industrial base in Connecticut and other states. I ask that the full amount requested in the DOD FY2011 budget for the Virginia Class program be included in either a regular defense appropriations act or a year-long CR.
Thank you for your continuing support in the production of two Virginia Class submarines annually in the years ahead. This level of investment will help stabilize our industrial base and provide for our national defense.
Sincerely,
Dannel P. Malloy
