Governor Dannel P. Malloy this evening released the following statement:
"I want to thank members of both parties in the General Assembly for their work this session. The budget agreement is honest, sustainable, and adjusts to Connecticut's new economic reality. It adheres to our principles that we will balance the budget without raising taxes, without raiding the rainy day fund, and without borrowing to cover operating expenses. It is based almost entirely on recurring, structural reductions in spending.
"It's a good agreement. If it happened too late in session to finish on time, and this delay is about giving members more time to understand what they're voting on, that's fine and even admirable. I said in February that we should not pass a budget on the last day of session.
"However, if this delay begins a discussion about re-opening the agreement in order to find a way to avoid difficult decisions, that's unacceptable. I will not move from the principles we've agreed to. I want to reassure the citizens of Connecticut that if we don't take the necessary action together, I will take whatever steps necessary to bring our budget into balance.
"I urge the General Assembly to pass this budget as soon as possible."
