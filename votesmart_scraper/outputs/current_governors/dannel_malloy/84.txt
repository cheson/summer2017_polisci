Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding President Trump's decision to rescind protections for transgender students:
"Discrimination of this kind is outrageous and has no place in our society. This shouldn't be a partisan issue -- the president's regressive actions must be rejected by all compassionate people, regardless of party affiliation. In 2011, I was proud to sponsor and help win passage for a comprehensive transgender rights bill here in Connecticut, and to subsequently lead fights nationally against efforts in North Carolina, Indiana, and elsewhere to restrict the rights of people who are transgender. In Connecticut, we will defend the rights of all students -- regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, race, ethnicity, and disability status -- and will continue to protect their access to welcoming learning environments."
