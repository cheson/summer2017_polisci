Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the five-year anniversary of marriage equality in Connecticut:

"Today's five-year anniversary of marriage equality is a reminder that when equality triumphs for one, it triumphs for all. Throughout history, Connecticut has had a revolutionary spirit, particularly when it comes to the understanding that all people are created equal and have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Five years later, it is encouraging to see other states around our nation looking to our own laws as a model as they pursue marriage equality in their states. There's still a long way to go across our country, but I am confident that as time goes on and the momentum continues, people will look towards states such as our own as an example of a leader of equal rights."

Connecticut's marriage equality law took effect on November 12, 2008.
