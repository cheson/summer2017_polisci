Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement regarding the release of the Connecticut Department of Labor's "Labor Situation" report for the month of November 2013. The monthly report announced that Connecticut's unemployment rate decreased for the third consecutive month to 7.6 percent.

"While a decrease in the unemployment rate and the addition of more than 4,000 private sector jobs in a month is clearly a step in the right direction, we still have much work to do," said Governor Malloy.

"We are making steady progress at growing our economy in a way that will create good paying jobs with good benefits for middle class families," continued Governor Malloy. "But if you haven't been able to get one of these jobs, then you're not feeling the impact of these changes. I want to make it clear that we can't and won't stop making progress until everyone that wants a job in our state has one."
