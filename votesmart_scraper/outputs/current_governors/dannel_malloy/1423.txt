Gov. Malloy Welcomes Two Storm Panel Report
Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today said that recommendations included in the final report of the working group he created to review the preparedness, response and recovery efforts of Tropical Storm Irene and the October Nor'easter will help the administration shape the package of initiatives and legislation it plans to announce in the coming days. The legislation will be introduced during the upcoming legislative session, which begins in February.

"We've been working on some ideas since the days immediately after Tropical Storm Irene, and we've been watching the work of the Two Storm Panel every step of the way," said Governor Malloy. "During that time, we've been working to develop a set of proposals to address how the state, its municipalities, and its utilities can better respond in situations like the two we witnessed in August and October. These 82 recommendations are welcomed because they will help us make what we've been getting ready to propose an even better product."

The Two Storm Panel's recommendations come just a little more than a month after the Witt Associates Report on both the utility companies' and state's response to the October Nor'easter. Immediately after receiving that report, Governor Malloy directed State Emergency Management Director William Hackett to update and improve the state's "Master Plan" in a way that creates a more unified response for state and local governments and utility companies during a disaster. The outline of that plan was release in the beginning of January.

"We did many things right in the wake of these two storms, but when the margin of error is zero -- like it was for these two storms -- we have to do better," said Governor Malloy. "In my time as Mayor of Stamford, we were constantly examining and updating our policies and procedures as they pertained to the preparedness of the City to aid and protect its residents in crisis situations. And that's what we've been doing at the state level since I became Governor. I want to thank the Two Storm Panel for their hard work, and for helping us to ensure that the actions we take will have a meaningful impact on the safety of our residents."

Governor Malloy created the Two Storm Panel, originally named the S.T.O.R.M. Irene Panel and renamed following the October Nor'easter, in the immediate aftermath of Tropical Storm Irene. Its eight members, who have backgrounds in the military, disaster relief, municipal government, non-profit and labor sectors, held nine public hearings during which they received extensive testimony from a number of experts on a range of issues impacted by emergency situations.

Members of the Two Storm Panel included:
* Joe McGee (Co-Chair): Vice President, Business Council of Fairfield County
* Major General James Skiff (Co-Chair): U.S. Air Force, Retired
* Peter Carozza: President, Uniformed Professional Fire Fighters
* Terry Edelstein: President, Connecticut Community Providers Association
* Lee Hoffman: Attorney, Pullman & Comley
* Scott Jackson: Mayor, Hamden
* Robert McGrath: Former Fire Chief, Stamford
* Cathy Osten: First Selectman, Sprague
