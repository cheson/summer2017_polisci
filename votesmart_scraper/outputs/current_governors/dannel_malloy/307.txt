Governor Dannel P. Malloy and First Lady Cathy Malloy are inviting Connecticut residents to attend the annual holiday open house of the Governor's Residence, located at 990 Prospect Avenue in Hartford, which will be decorated for the season and open to the public for tours. This year's holiday open house will be held:
Friday, December 4, 2015 from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
Saturday, December 5, 2015 from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
Sunday, December 6, 2015 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
"Cathy and I love holding this holiday open house each year because it gives us an opportunity to showcase not only our own family's personal collection of Christmas decorations, but also the seasonal agricultural decorations that have been generously donated by Connecticut growers and small businesses," Governor Malloy said. "We look forward to continuing this longstanding Connecticut tradition, and encourage everyone to visit and join us in the holiday spirit."
