Gov. Malloy Says CL&P Will Not Meet Its Goal; Releases Updated Power Restoration Information Request from Company Last Night
Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today said that CL&P would not meet its self-identified goal of 99% power restoration in each city and town by midnight tonight, and released the document (attached) he asked CL&P yesterday, outlining updated town-by-town restoration times. This update will allow cities and towns across the state to more accurately plan for sheltering and warming centers, school schedules and give their residents more accurate restoration information.

"The closer we got to CL&P's self-identified goal of 99% restoration in each city and town by midnight tonight, the more skeptical I became of their ability to meet that goal," said Gov. Malloy. "It's now clear they are not going to meet their goal -- and I'll have more to say about that at noon today.

"I'm releasing this information because towns and cities need to make preparations based on the reality of the situation -- not what CL&P hopes to have happen -- and residents need to make individual decisions about what to do over the next few days."

Gov. Malloy will be available to reporters at 12 noon today at the EOC.
