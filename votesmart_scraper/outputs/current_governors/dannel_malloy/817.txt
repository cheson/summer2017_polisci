Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to the State Supreme Court's decision in Anthony Vendrella et al. v. Astriab Family Limited Partnership et al.:

"While we are still reviewing the opinion released today by the Supreme Court, at first glance it appears that our legislation is now all the more timely. Connecticut's agriculture sector contributes $3.5 billion to our economy and accounts for about 28,000 jobs in our state," Governor Malloy said. "Protecting owners and handlers of domesticated horses is important to supporting this portion of our economy."

The Governor's legislation is House Bill 5044, An Act Concerning Domesticated Horses.
