Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding President Obama's announcement that the U.S. Department of Labor will expand overtime pay to millions of American workers:
"It is a bedrock principle of our nation that workers and their families deserve a fair wage for their hard work. I commend President Obama, Vice President Biden, and Secretary Perez for modernizing overtime protections for the nation's workers. The steps taken today by the U.S. Department of Labor will extend overtime protections to 4.2 million more Americans and are expected to boost wages for workers by $12 billion over the next ten years. These enhanced overtime protections will strengthen and grow the middle class and boost our economy at the same time. I thank the administration for their leadership, their enduring support of American workers, and their commitment to broad-based economic growth."
