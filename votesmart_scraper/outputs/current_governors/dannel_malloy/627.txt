Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following joint statement regarding the suspended negotiations between Anthem Health Plans, Inc. and the Hartford HealthCare Corporation:

"We are extremely disappointed that Anthem Health Plans, Inc. and the Hartford Healthcare Corporation have allowed their contract to expire today without negotiating a new one.

"We're not interested in assigning blame. We want to make sure that everyone in our state has access to affordable, high-quality healthcare. We simply cannot let profit margins stand in the way of that goal.

"Both companies need to return to the table and work out a deal that protects the health of Connecticut residents."
