Gov. Malloy: State Grant to Help Hartford Combat Gun Violence
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: March 31, 2016
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced that an expansion of the ShotSpotter gunshot detection system in Hartford will become operational by today as a result of a $300,000 state grant. The technology detects and conveys the location of gunfire or other weapon fire using mounted audio sensors. Those sensors triangulate signals and identify the point of origin of a gunshot, immediately communicating that information to law enforcement.
The expansion of the technology allows the city increase the technology's coverage to 11.25 square miles, up from just 3 miles. The expansion will now cover most of the city, including all residential areas and schools.
"We've made significant strides reducing crime statewide, and this grant will play a major role in helping Hartford expand this gunshot technology city-wide." Governor Malloy said. "This system has been implemented in major urban areas across the country, and it will prove to be a major benefit to our local law enforcement in keeping our communities safe. We are pleased that Hartford is putting this technology to good use, and thank law enforcement for its efforts to combat crime."
"Public safety is a top priority in Hartford, and there is nothing more important to quality of life in our city than having safe streets," Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said. "That's why I want to thank Governor Malloy and state leaders for helping us secure the state funds necessary to purchase this state-of-the-art crime fighting technology in the state's capital city. I also want to thank our hardworking police officers who put their lives on the line each and every day, and will put this technology to use while making our city safer and more secure."
The grant comes as part of an award given to the State of Connecticut by the U.S. Department of Justice under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program. Administered by the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management, the state allocates funding received under the program to a broad range of criminal justice functions.
