Governor Malloy today filed a brief with the Connecticut Supreme Court regarding the appointment of a Special Master who will assist the Court in resolving the issue of redistricting the state's Congressional Districts.

The Governor and legislative leaders from both parties have agreed on two people who could serve in such a capacity.

* Professor Nathaniel Persily, the Charles Keller Beekman Professor of Law and Political Science at Columbia University Law School; and
* Professor Bernard Grofman, the Jack W. Peltason Endowed Chair and Director of the Center for the Study of Democracy at the University of California, Irvine

"While I still believe the Reapportionment Commission should have reached a solution on this issue in a timely fashion, I'm confident that whoever the Court selects from the individuals we've all agreed to can develop a plan that will ensure residents of every community have a real say in who represents them in Washington," said Governor Malloy. "Professor Persily is someone who, based on his work on voting rights around the country, is exceptionally qualified for this task. Prof. Grofman seems to be very well qualified as well. I look forward to the Court's decision."

The Supreme Court has said it will select a Special Master by January 5, 2012.
