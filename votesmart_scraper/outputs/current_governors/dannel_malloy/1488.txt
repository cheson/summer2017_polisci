Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced the members of a newly-formed task force that will review the effectiveness of the state's Education Cost Sharing (ECS) grant and how it relates to state constitutional requirements. The group, whose membership was appointed by Governor Malloy and legislative leaders, will develop recommendations on possible ways to change how money is divided up by school district.

"It is our responsibility to routinely review the distribution of education grants to municipalities to ensure that communities are receiving a fair share of dollars under grant distribution rules, especially in light of constitutional requirements. Unfortunately, it has been quite a while since the state last had a thorough review of this system," Governor Malloy said. "We must ensure this formula focuses on improving educational outcomes for all of our students, regardless in which city or town they live."

The Governor continued, "As I've said before, much more needs to be done to improve the education our children are receiving in this state, and I intend on focusing the 2012 legislative session on education issues, concerns and ways in which we can better prepare our students for a global economy."

In addition to focusing on the ECS formula, the group will also consider state grants to interdistrict magnet schools and regional agricultural science and technology centers as well as special education costs for the state and municipalities. Under state statute, the group is required to submit an initial report on its findings and recommendations by January 2, 2012 and its final report by October 1, 2012.
