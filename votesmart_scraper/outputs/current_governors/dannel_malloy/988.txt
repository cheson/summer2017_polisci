Governor Dannel P. Malloy's Director of Communications Andrew Doba this afternoon released the following statement regarding calls from Senator John McKinney for a special session on the Affordable Care Act:

"This administration is moving forward with implementing the Affordable Care Act so that more residents will have access to quality, affordable healthcare. In the wake of the decision yesterday in Washington, the Governor has asked the Lieutenant Governor and his Insurance Commissioner to gather the facts and determine what action, if any, needs to be taken by the state to ensure we are achieving this goal. Until all the facts are in, there is no reason to call a special session."
