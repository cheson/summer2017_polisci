Gov. Malloy on Racial Profiling
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Jan. 4, 2012
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released this statement following a legislative press conference calling for stronger enforcement of the racial profiling law.

"More than 10 years ago, as the Mayor of Stamford, I was proud to stand with the men and women of the Stamford Police Department on Martin Luther King Day to announce that we did not tolerate racial profiling and would lead the efforts to ensure its elimination. As Governor, I will continue to insist that every effort is taken to protect individual rights in every community, and that racial profiling is eliminated. It appears that for the past five years federal funding has been available to pay for racial identity data gathering and analysis. I cannot speak to the actions of the previous administration in allowing these funds to languish, but I can assure Connecticut residents that my Administration is committed to enforcing the laws on the books and has moved forward to get this data collected, reported, and evaluated. Let me be clear: it is simply unacceptable that Connecticut law hasn't been followed. To that end, I have directed my staff and the Department of Transportation to ensure police departments continue to collect, or begin to collect, this data and submit it to an appropriate outside evaluator for analysis and report."
