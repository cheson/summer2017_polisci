ON CT JUVENILE TRAINING CENTER: MALLOY CALLS UPON GOVERNOR RELL TO AGGRESSIVELY INVESTIGATE ROWLAND-ERA APPOINTEES
Stamford - Connecticut State government cannot move beyond the Juvenile Training School contracting scandal without first investigating and taking action on Rowland-era political appointees at all levels of government who still hold jobs in Governor Rell's administration, stated Dan Malloy, Stamford Mayor and Democratic gubernatorial candidate.
"Governor Rell should immediately launch a thorough and open investigation of the Office of Policy and Management, the Department of Children and Families and the Department of Public Works at all levels to determine who knew about any wrongdoing and when they knew it, who engaged in inappropriate behavior, and who may have turned a blind eye to corruption," Malloy said. "Given the breadth of the corruption in the Rowland Administration, it is disconcerting that most of Rowland's political appointees in these departments remain in the Rell Administration. What's more, many people had warned that this was an ill-conceived facility and officials in the Rowland Administration pushed forward nonetheless.
"This is not just about criminal wrongdoing, but importantly about accountability and how people on the State's payroll performed their jobs," Malloy said. "To truly change Rowland's climate of corruption, we need to change government at all levels, and that can't happen unless Governor Rell holds everyone accountable.
