Governor Dannel P. Malloy and the members of Connecticut's Congressional delegation today announced that the Connecticut Department of Labor (CTDOL) is receiving a $200,000 federal grant from the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) to increase and expand participation in the state's apprenticeship training program.
The award, part of the ApprenticeshipUSA State Accelerator Grant, will help integrate the apprenticeship model into Connecticut's education and workforce system by working with industry and related partners to bring apprenticeship to new industries and populations.
"We're continuing to align workforce training with the needs of our employers. This grant helps us to continue and expand a vital workforce program that has helped thousands of our residents earn while they learn," Governor Malloy said. "By combining on-the-job training with classroom instruction, the apprenticeship system excels in developing an experienced workforce for high-skilled careers in manufacturing, construction, business and healthcare."
"Apprenticeship training is key to unlocking the vital skills needed for the high-paying, in-demand jobs of the 21st Century. These federal dollars - aimed at expanding an incredibly important program in our state - will go a long way in boosting our workforce and meeting the demands of employers," the Congressional delegation said in a joint statement.
There are currently 6,125 individuals and nearly 1,700 employer sponsored enrolled in Connecticut's Apprenticeship Training Program, which is administered by CTDOL. Recent data shows that 87 percent of all apprentices are employed after completing their programs, with an average starting wage above $50,000 a year.
"Apprenticeship has proven itself to be a successful way to build a career that can last a lifetime, leading to well-paying jobs and increasing opportunities," CTDOL Commissioner Scott D. Jackson said. "This grant will assist us in building upon its success, and help employers expand and diversify their workforce, and contribute to the economy."

The state's apprenticeship program offers wage subsidies, tuition reimbursement, employer tax credits and scholarships.
