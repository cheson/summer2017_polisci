Gov. Malloy Statement on Committee Approval of Constitutional Amendment Protecting Transportation Funds
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: March 27, 2017
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding a vote tonight in the state legislature's Government Administration and Elections Committee approving a constitutional amendment he introduced that will protect funds set aside for transportation:
"Businesses across that state have made it known that in order to be competitive on a regional and national level, Connecticut must upgrade its roads, bridges and mass transit systems. Today's vote is the next step towards addressing the state's transportation infrastructure needs by moving us closer to a constitutional transportation lockbox. I commend the members of the Government Administration and Elections Committee for passing this out of committee. Republicans and Democrats have supported the lockbox in the past and I urge them do so once again as this constitutional amendment moves forward."
