Gov. Malloy: Investigation Into Possible Fraud Continues
Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

As the investigation into the Federal Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) continues, Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the Department of Social Services (DSS) and the Office of Labor Relations (OLR) have forwarded the names of an additional 10 state employees to various agency heads to begin their administrative reviews, bringing the total number of instances of possible fraud up to 44.

To date, the investigation has prioritized the applications of state employees with the highest incomes. 824 state employees filed for D-SNAP benefits in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Irene. Aside from the 44 referrals, an additional 29 employees have been cleared of any wrong doing. The remaining 751 applications are in varying stages of review by DSS.

"Since we first announced our investigation, we've uncovered dozens of cases where it appears that state employees may have deliberately lied on their federal disaster assistance applications to receive benefits," said Governor Malloy. "Everyone is entitled to due process, but if these allegations prove true, it constitutes a serious violation of the public trust. We can and must demand better from public employees."

Governor Malloy announced the investigation into federal disaster aid program on December 4. D-SNAP funding was made available to low-income Connecticut residents who incurred disaster-related expenses from Tropical Storm Irene, including loss of income, temporary shelter costs and property repairs.
