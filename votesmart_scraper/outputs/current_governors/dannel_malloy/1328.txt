Governor Dannel P. Malloy today issued the following statement on the House's passage of S.B. 33, the Governor's Design Build Legislation:

"I want to thank the House Leadership, especially Speaker Donovan, for their clear commitment to ensuring that thousands of hard working men and women in the building trades have good paying jobs.

"Once I sign this bill, Connecticut will join 46 other states that have implemented 'Design Build,' making us more competitive in the quest for Federal money. But more importantly, this bill will give us the ability to make long overdue investments in our infrastructure, all while lowering the cost and improving the quality of construction projects."
