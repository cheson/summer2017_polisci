Governor Dannel P. Malloy today said that with Hurricane Joaquin currently forecast to impact the east coast over the next several days, he is asking Connecticut residents to closely monitor the storm's path and be prepared for severe weather conditions. The Governor continues to work with state emergency management officials to monitor the storm and make preparations for necessary state response.
"Just as the state is monitoring and preparing, the public should do the same," Governor Malloy said. "Weather models are predicting that Hurricane Joaquin may move onshore in the area of the northeast coast this weekend. Although its potential impact on Connecticut is still developing as forecasts adjust, we need to be prepared because these types of storms can oftentimes be unpredictable. We will continue to update residents, and in the meantime we urge folks to begin making preparations."
The state Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) has been participating in National Weather Service conference calls to receive the latest information on the storm's track.
Governor Malloy and DEMHS offer the following preparedness tips:
Basic Emergency Supply Kit
One gallon of water per person per day for at least three days, for drinking and sanitation
At least a three-day supply of non-perishable food
Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert and extra batteries for both
