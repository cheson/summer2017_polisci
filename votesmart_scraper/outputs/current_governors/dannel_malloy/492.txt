Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has granted his request to extend the deadline to file a Presidential disaster declaration request for the January blizzard to March 28, 2015.

"I would like to thank FEMA for granting my request," said Governor Malloy. "Connecticut continues to experience severe weather conditions and this extension will give our towns and cities additional time to assess their costs and damages associated with this storm."

The Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection's Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security will be coordinating Preliminary Damage Assessments with FEMA and the towns and cities most affected by the January blizzard, in order to determine the next steps for a Disaster Declaration Request.
