Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements in response to an affirmative vote in both chambers of the Connecticut General Assembly this afternoon approving the state's agreement with Lockheed Martin that will keep Sikorsky Aircraft's worldwide headquarters located in Stratford through at least 2032, where the company will retain and grow approximately 8,000 direct jobs. As part of the agreement, Sikorsky has also pledged to nearly double its spending of $350 million per year among in-state suppliers.
Governor Malloy said, "Connecticut is proud of its reputation as a worldwide aerospace leader, and I want to thank the leaders of the General Assembly and all of its members who voted today in support of a nearly unanimous, bipartisan bill to reaffirm our state's commitment to supporting high-quality, good-paying manufacturing jobs. This is a bold, forward-thinking agreement that will not only support thousands of jobs at Sikorsky's headquarters, but also has a direct impact on hundreds of small businesses all across our state that serve as suppliers to Sikorsky and will benefit from the company's continued growth here. Competition in today's worldwide economic climate is fierce, and Connecticut is showing that we remain a valued leader where businesses can maintain a competitive edge well into the future."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "Today's votes highlight Connecticut's commitment to aerospace and defense - and the talented men and women who've made us a national leader in the industry. For years, we've been making important investments in education, technical training, and workforce development. We've prioritized economic growth and improving the business climate. These investments have made a difference. I applaud Governor Malloy's leadership, the General Assembly, and the Sikorsky team on this important partnership and the many benefits it brings to Connecticut, our workforce, and our economy."
The State Senate approved the agreement by a vote of 35-1. The House of Representatives approved it by a vote of 136-6.
