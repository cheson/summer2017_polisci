Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Department of Housing (DOH) Commissioner Evonne M. Klein today announced that the State of Connecticut is awarding $17,960,000 in loans and grants to help fund ten affordable housing developments in the State Sponsored Housing Portfolio.
"My administration has made increasing the availability of affordable housing a key component of our strategy to invigorate Connecticut's economy," said Governor Malloy. "When we secure more housing for our state's residents, we are making a proactive effort to stimulate economic activity and create more jobs in Connecticut. We are working on a detailed ten-year plan that recommends priorities and plots out capital investments to revitalize some of the state's existing affordable housing and will make the properties sustainable for the long term."
The grants come as part of the ten-year, $300 million State-Sponsored Housing Portfolio Revitalization Initiative, which is jointly administered by DOH and the Connecticut Housing Financing Authority (CHFA) to fund the rehabilitation of a portfolio of over 340 properties at which approximately 19,000 people reside. In many cases, this housing offers the only affordable option for some of the state's lowest income residents.
"I am proud that Governor Malloy has made housing such an important part of his administration," said Commissioner Klein. "By taking these necessary steps to rehabilitate our housing portfolio, we are ensuring that Connecticut residents will have an affordable, quality, and safe place to call home for years to come."
