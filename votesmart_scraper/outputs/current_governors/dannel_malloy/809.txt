Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee's approval this afternoon of his plan to invest in "Transform CSCU 2020" and his "CHET Baby Scholars" initiative, which is designed to make it easier for Connecticut families to save for college:

"In February, I unveiled two proposals that would support Connecticut children from birth all the way through college. Both Transform CSCU 2020 and the CHET Baby Scholars initiatives address a critical part of our effort to build a future for Connecticut where all children have access to high-quality educational opportunities. Thanks to the work of our partners in the legislature, we are getting closer to making both programs a reality. I want to thank the co-chairs and Committee for their hard work and I look forward to working with legislative leaders to pass these proposals that invest in Connecticut children and families."

House Bill 5048 creates the "CHET Baby Scholars" program to make it easier for hardworking families to save for college by offering new parents up to a $250 investment in a tax-free college savings account to encourage college savings right from the start.

In addition, Senate Bill 30 will bring all 17 of Connecticut's community colleges and universities into a single cohesive, student-centered, technology-enriched system, improving the learning experience for hundreds of thousands of students that will go on to 21st Century careers right here in Connecticut.
