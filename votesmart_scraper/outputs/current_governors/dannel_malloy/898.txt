Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in response to the agreement reached between union leadership and Lawrence + Memorial Hospital management.

"I have always profoundly respected workers' rights to collectively bargain and organize. By all accounts, this agreement sets a new path of common principles that will improve the relationship between labor and management and chart a new path for the future.

"The healthcare industry will continue to change, but the traditional role of patient caregivers was preserved here and should be preserved going forward. I am grateful to labor and management for coming together for the sake of patients and the community as a whole."
