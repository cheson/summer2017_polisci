Malloy-Glassman Campaign Raises $650,000 in Last Quarter
Out-raises opponent for fourth consecutive quarter; this time by over a quarter million dollars
STAMFORD -- Democratic candidate Dan Malloy will file his quarterly fundraising report today, showing that the Malloy-Glassman campaign for Governor and Lt. Governor raised a combined $650,000 and retains an aggregate amount of nearly $1.3 million cash-on-hand.
"This is the fourth quarter in a row that the Malloy campaign has substantially out-raised his opponent," said Campaign Manager Chris Cooney. "Four-for-four is a record of which to be proud, and reflects the continuing momentum we are feeling statewide."
"Mary and I are dedicated to providing a different kind of leadership in Connecticut. We have a clear vision for our state; and we have concrete ideas to move the state forward, enabling all of Connecticut's citizens to seize opportunities and enjoy the fruits of honest labor," said Malloy.
"With the primary in sight, our strategy to and beyond the primary is to sustain our energy and tireless efforts. We will continue to share our vision for the better Connecticut that we can and will provide. Connecticut's Democratic Party endorsed us in May and many generous supporters continue to invest in our campaign and in the achievable hope for more prosperous future for our state." Malloy added.
Malloy-Glassman has raised a total of over $3.4 million after active fundraising and campaigning since the start of their campaign.
