Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that - with Connecticut facing more frequent and severe weather events as a result of global warming - he is directing state agencies to develop new building code standards that will better protect residential and commercial structures from damage caused by flooding and high winds.
Through an executive order issued on Earth Day, the Governor is instructing the Department of Administrative Services (DAS), the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), and the Insurance Department (CID) to work with the State Building Inspector to ensure that the next revision to the State Building Code contains standards that increase the resiliency of new and renovated homes and buildings.
"The science could not be more clear - global warming is real. Knowing what the science says, we should plan and be prepared as we take steps to mitigate our carbon footprint," Governor Malloy said. "Over the past several years, revisions to the state the building code have incorporated higher energy efficiency standards to help reduce demand for electricity, heat, and water. We believe it is now time to strengthen building codes to help protect buildings from damage caused by the high winds and flooding that come with severe weather conditions. Experts say that every dollar invested in more resilient construction can save $4 in insurance claims, which is a significant return on investment. This is a commonsense step to help plan and prepare for the future."
Many of these measures are relatively inexpensive when compared to the significant damage to homes and businesses they can prevent or mitigate.
