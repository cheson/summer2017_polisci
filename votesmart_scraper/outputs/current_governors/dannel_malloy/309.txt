Gov. Malloy & Lt. Gov. Wyman Statements on October Jobs Report
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Nov. 19, 2015
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman today released the following statements in response to the Connecticut Department of Labor's monthly "Labor Situation" report for October 2015, which shows that the state unemployment rate dropped one tenth of a point to 5.1 percent - its lowest level since March 2008, before the start of the Great Recession.
Governor Malloy said, "Over the past year, Connecticut's private sector has seen a net growth of almost 24,000 new jobs - healthy economic growth - and our unemployment rate has been steadily declining. We have now reached our pre-recession unemployment rate, a new and important milestone. While this month is comparatively flat, we're no doubt seeing positive signs. We're going to keep working each and every day to make even more progress and move Connecticut forward."
