Governor Dannel P. Malloy today highlighted a new state law that puts Connecticut in a better position to obtain federal funding for critically important infrastructure investments, reduces the number of steps it takes to get infrastructure projects started, lowers costs, and ensures that we have the best trained workforce in place for these projects.

Public Act 12-70 enacted both "Design Build" and Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for certain development projects around the state. Governor Malloy said the law will help create thousands of good paying jobs and ensure that the hardworking men and women in the building trades can find employment that will support their families.

"Design Build will make us more competitive in the quest for federal funding, and more importantly, it will give us the ability to make long overdue investments in our infrastructure, all while lowering the cost and improving the quality of construction projects," Governor Malloy said. "The PLA provisions will give municipalities the option of entering into such an agreement if they choose to do so, without the added risk of costly legislation. Simply put, this law is about ensuring that thousands of hard working men and women in the building trades have good paying jobs."

The Governor was joined by state officials, legislators and labor representatives at the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) for a ceremonial signing of the law. UCHC is currently the site of one of several large construction projects in the state.

Governor Malloy noted that Connecticut now joins 46 other states with similar Design Build statutes.
