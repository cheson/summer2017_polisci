Saturday, January 22, 2011 marks the 38th anniversary of the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion and guaranteed that the 14th amendment right to privacy is extended to a woman's control of her reproductive health care.

"I've been a lifelong advocate and strong supporter of a woman's right to choose," said Governor Malloy. "It is critical that high quality health care is made available to women, and I will continue to work hard to ensure that accessibility. Personal health care choices are just that -- personal -- and they should be made between a woman and her doctors."
