Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements regarding a vote in the Connecticut House of Representatives today that gave final legislative passage to a bill concerning the expansion of casinos in the state:
Governor Malloy said, "I commend and thank both chambers of the General Assembly for keeping Connecticut jobs and workers at the center of this debate. Our state has a longstanding partnership and compact with the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot tribal nations who employ thousands of Connecticut residents in their casinos. I have been very clear that I will not sign a bill that puts these jobs at risk, and I look forward to reviewing this proposal."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "Connecticut has strong partnerships with both the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribal nations. These partnerships have helped grow our economy and bolster tourism and commerce -- they've also cemented a deep mutual respect. We hope this will continue long into the future. I thank the Senate and House for sending this bill to the Governor's desk."
The legislation is Senate Bill 957, An Act Concerning the Regulation of Gaming and the Authorization of a Casino Gaming Facility in the State. It was adopted by the State Senate last month. In the coming days the bill will be transmitted to the Governor's desk for his signature.
