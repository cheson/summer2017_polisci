Gov. Malloy Statement on Supreme Court Ruling in Juvenile Sentencing Case
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Jan. 25, 2016
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling today that juveniles previously sentenced to life without the possibility of parole are covered retroactively by a 2012 court decision that banned the practice going forward. Last summer, the Governor signed into law legislation proposed by the Connecticut Sentencing Commission that made these sentencing changes in Connecticut that the Supreme Court is now mandating nationally.
"Today's decision marks the fourth time in recent years that the U.S. Supreme Court has cited brain development science when ordering changes to sentencing policies for younger offenders. Last year, I signed Public Act 15-84, which includes the retroactivity provision mandated by the court today. In Connecticut, we have led the way in rethinking our approach to younger offenders, and the results speak for themselves. We know that a one-size-fits-all approach to criminal justice across America hasn't worked, and we know that we should be a society focused on permanent reformation. We are continuing to lead the way on juvenile justice, since so many of our current inmates today were at one point part of the juvenile system. We know that the initial Raise the Age effort has helped reduce Connecticut's prison population to its lowest level in 17 years, while crime is down to a nearly 50-year low. We need to drive it down even lower. That's why Connecticut and states across the nation are having important conversations as to how to deliver results to reduce crime rates and ensure young offenders become productive members of society. We believe the trend that this decision reflects will continue, and we believe Connecticut will continue to lead the discussion."
