Governor Dannel P. Malloy, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), and Congressman Jim Himes (D-4) today announced $10 million in federal Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) funds for the construction of Barnum Station, a new commuter rail station that would serve Metro-North on the east side of Bridgeport.
Malloy said: "Our administration has prioritized the creation of this new train station for Bridgeport's East Side and East End neighborhoods because we know that it is local capital projects like these that will help create livable, walkable communities that spur economic development and job creation. We need to think big in Connecticut when it comes to our rail system, and it's these types of investments that will make our state more regionally competitive and more attractive for employers and employees alike. I would like to thank Secretary Foxx and his staff at the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as Senators Blumenthal and Murphy and Representative Himes for their support of these federal dollars."
Blumenthal said: "This award is a game changer for the East Side and East End of Bridgeport-bringing new commuter rail service that will catalyze development and investment in not only those neighborhoods, but the city as a whole. In addition to serving as an anchor for major mixed-use, transit-oriented development in Bridgeport, the station will expand options for commuters throughout the region, offering much-needed express and local service along the nation's busiest commuter rail corridor. TIGER grants are highly competitive awards that inject major federal investment in state and local transportation priorities. Past Connecticut projects, including Steelpointe in Bridgeport, have produced transformational economic development opportunities. I will continue to serve as a vocal and vigorous advocate for Connecticut's TIGER applications, as well as for increased investment in transportation infrastructure nationwide."
Murphy said: "The new Barnum train station could really be ground-breaking for Bridgeport, and I'm thrilled that we are able to deliver this sizable grant to help make this station a reality. This project will give travelers more options, but more importantly, help revitalize the eastern section of the city," said Murphy. "I was proud to work with city leaders to advocate for this support from Washington. Connecting our communities is a critical step in growing Connecticut's economy, and this is exactly the kind of federal-state partnership we need to make our state a more accessible, appealing place for students, residents, and businesses."
Himes said: "The ongoing rejuvenation of Bridgeport is critical to its citizens and to the economic health of our region. Barnum station will eventually host retail stores, housing and critical transportation options. It will transform a bleak and neglected neighborhood into a vibrant source of opportunity for the people of Bridgeport. I am proud of the work that my office did, in conjunction with local and state leaders and Senators Blumenthal and Murphy, to help secure this TIGER grant."
