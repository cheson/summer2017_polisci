Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) Commissioner Daniel C. Esty today issued the following statements applauding the U.S. Senate confirmation of Gina McCarthy to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). McCarthy was nominated by President Obama in March.

"Simply put, Gina McCarthy is a great choice to lead the EPA," said Governor Malloy. "As the former Commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection, she was a staunch advocate for ecological stewardship--promoting initiatives to curb greenhouse gas pollution and improve water quality, as well as launching Connecticut's successful No Child Left Inside program. She is committed to environmental protection and will safeguard our natural resources."

"The confirmation of Gina McCarthy is good news for our country and the environment," said Commissioner Esty. "She is the right person to move forward President Obama's key initiatives -- such as his new climate change agenda -- and to ensure that we make the kind of progress Americans are looking for to better protect the quality of our air, water, and lands."
