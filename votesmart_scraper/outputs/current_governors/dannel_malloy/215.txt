Newspaper editorial boards across the state are showing strong support for adopting Governor Dannel P. Malloy's Second Chance Society 2.0 initiatives.
Editorial from the New Haven Register, "Reforming bail bonds a must for a Connecticut Second Chance Society":
"Studies show individuals who are held in jail for 8 to 14 days are 56 percent more likely to be rearrested before trial and 51 percent more likely to recidivate after sentence completion. Advocates believe it's because as people sit in jail waiting for their case to go before a judge, they are likely to lose their home, job, or contact with family or people in their support network.

"Malloy's proposal is a winner and takes a step forward as a complement to his Second Chance Initiative that lawmakers approved last year, which among other things reduced penalties for drug possession."

Editorial from the Record Journal, "Eliminate bail for most misdemeanors":

"As rare as it may be, once in a while an issue emerges on which there is agreement across a broad swath of political thought, and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy seems to have found one when it comes to bail reform. In this case the governor, a Democrat with credentials as a social liberal, seems to be on the same page with the ACLU as well as two conservative groups, the Yankee Institute for Public Policy and the California-based Reason Foundation."

Editorial from the Hartford Courant, "Why CT Legislators Should Raise the Age for Juvenile Offenders":

"The legislature should pass the bill at its earliest opportunity."

Editorial from the New York Times, "Connecticut's Second-Chance Society":

"For decades, the politics of crime and punishment in America has been driven by fear and vengeance. That has begun to change, thanks largely to smart and effective new experiments in both conservative and liberal states.

"Congress may yet pass major federal sentencing reform in 2016, but if America is to reverse its decades-long incarceration boom, it will require the continued efforts of leaders like Mr. Malloy."

Editorial from the New Haven Register, "Raising age for youthful offenders important step for Connecticut":

"Young people make mistakes. That's part of life. Those mistakes should not be hurdles preventing them from becoming responsible, productive adults. This bill goes a long way to help ensure that path is clear."
