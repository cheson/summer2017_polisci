Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement on the Connecticut Department of Labor's (DOL) annual revision of the prior year's labor situation. After economists at DOL conducted their yearly analysis, they determined that private sector job growth had actually exceeded both initial estimates and expectations, revising their total upward to more than 21,000 private sector jobs created last year. That figure represents one of the best years for job growth in the last 20 years.

"The annual restatement of labor figures is yet another sign that we are making progress in turning our economy around. With 53,000 private sector jobs created through the end of last year, we are experiencing one of the best periods of growth that Connecticut has seen in decades.

"When you combine that with what we are doing to invest in public education and stabilize our state's finances, what you have is a roadmap to a sustainable future.

"Clearly, we have much more work to do. But we are making steady progress in our effort to create good paying jobs with good benefits for middle class families in Connecticut."

According to the annual revision, the state added nearly 53,000 private sector jobs from January of 2011 to December 2013. In addition, weekly unemployment claims have steadily declined during that same period of time.
