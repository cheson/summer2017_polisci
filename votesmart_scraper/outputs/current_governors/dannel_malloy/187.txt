Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements regarding failed votes in the U.S. Senate this evening for the Feinstein amendment that would have prevented those on the terror watch list from legally purchasing firearms in the United States, as well as the Murphy/Blumenthal amendment establishing universal background checks:
Governor Malloy said, "When it comes to guns, Connecticut continues to lead time and time again. On a day in which the Supreme Court upheld the smartest gun law in the nation here in our state, we see Congressional Republicans in Washington vote down these basic, commonsense amendments to make Americans safer.
"The senators who voted against this legislation tonight should be ashamed, not only for voting against the vast majority of Americans who overwhelmingly support these commonsense policies, but also for putting their own interests before safety. It's simple - everyone should have to pass a background check, and if a person is on a watch list because of suspected terrorist activities and cannot board an airplane, then we should not be selling them military-style assault weapons. Enough is enough. Yet, this Republican Congress has again failed to act and has stood in the way of meaningful, commonsense steps to make us safer. It is as discouraging as it is baffling.
"I applaud Senator Murphy, Senator Blumenthal, and our entire federal delegation for helping us get to this point. While the vote is disappointing, the fact that there even were votes on commonsense gun safety proposals is due directly to their leadership."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "Connecticut, under Governor Malloy's leadership and with solid public support, has taken a strong stand on gun violence and public safety. As a state, we've come together - first in grief, and then resolute that we would meaningfully strengthen anti-violence initiatives. It is long since time that Congressional Republicans show the same strength of character and the same respect for the American public by enacting common sense gun reforms.
"I applaud Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal, Congressman Larson, Congresswoman DeLauro, Congressman Himes, Congressman Courtney, and Congresswoman Esty for their commitment to all of our citizens."
