Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy on Thursday morning signed legislation that increases the minimum wage in two stages over the next two years. Under the new law, it will increase from $8.25 to $8.70 on January 1, 2014, followed by a second increase on January 1, 2015 to $9.00.

"This gradual increase over two years is a balanced approach to helping hard working men and women without adversely impacting the business community. Although I believe our nation as a whole should move in this direction, I also think Connecticut needs to lead the way in helping working families," Governor Malloy said. "We know there is no better way to pull a child out of poverty than to increase the minimum wage. I want to thank Senator Williams, Senator Looney, Speaker Sharkey, Representative Aresimowicz and Labor Committee Co-Chairs Senator Osten and Representative Tercyak for their advocacy of this issue."

The legislation is Public Act 13-117 -- An Act Increasing the Minimum Fair Wage.
