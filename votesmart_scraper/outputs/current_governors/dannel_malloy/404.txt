Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: June 22, 2015
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he has signed into law legislation that improves access to higher education opportunities for Connecticut residents by allowing the children of undocumented immigrants to attend state institutions of higher education and pay the in-state tuition rate if the student has attended a Connecticut high school for at least two years and has graduated from a Connecticut high school. Under prior law, students were required to attend a Connecticut high school for at least four years.
"By making in-state tuition available to more students and expanding access to college, we will be bolstering Connecticut's labor market by adding new, professional workers to our workforce - the type of residents that attract employers who are looking to fill the high-skilled, good-paying jobs that are needed compete in a 21st Century economy," Governor Malloy said. "Expanding education opportunities and delivering more access to a degree will ultimately support our overall economy, and again show employers that Connecticut has some of the best trained, best educated workers in the nation."
