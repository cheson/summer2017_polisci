Regional Issues: Dan Malloy's Eastern Connecticut Initiative
Statement of Dan Malloy, Democratic candidate for governor, on his plans for eastern Connecticut:
Economic Development and Diversification:
In just the last few weeks we've seen more disturbing news of further job losses in eastern Connecticut: perhaps as many as 150 people already laid-off at Electric Boat, with as many as 2,400 coming later this year; talk of job cuts at Computer Sciences Corp. in Norwich; the loss of Franklin Farms.
Economic Development and Diversification are desperately needed - throughout Connecticut, but particularly here in the eastern part of the state. I know what it takes to build our economy. I've done that as mayor of Stamford, and I've released a plan - Every Job Matters - that describes in detail how we will build the economy of the entire state.
Here in eastern Connecticut, thanks to the leadership and hard work of local elected, community and business leaders, we already have a specific blueprint for diversifying the economy and making the investments we need for the future. What we are lacking is a governor with the will to commit the resources we need to implement that plan, and the leadership ability and vision to get it done.
What we need right now is to have the same intensity and focused effort on developing the future of eastern Connecticut that we had for fighting base closures during the BRAC process. But instead, the Rell Administration has failed to act - actually removing the cost estimates in some of the recommendations! You can't lead when you stick your head in the sand and ignore the hard choices and the difficult details because they are controversial.
