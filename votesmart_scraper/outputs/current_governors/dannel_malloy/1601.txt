Public Statements
Governor Malloy to Hold Series of Town Hall Meetings Across Connecticut
Press Release
By: Dan Malloy
Date: Feb. 15, 2011
Location: Hartford, CT

Over the next seven weeks, Governor Dannel P. Malloy will hold a series of 17 town hall-style meetings across the state. These meetings will allow the Governor to discuss the state's pressing economic and budgetary issues face-to-face with state residents, while listening to their own thoughts and suggestions, as well.

Beginning February 21 in Bridgeport and culminating in Danbury on April 6, Governor Malloy's town hall series will reach all sections of the state, will be open to the public, and will provide residents with the ability to meet with the Governor in a way that will be unprecedented in recent state history.

"It really is my preference to be out there, talking with people in the flesh, hearing their thoughts and communicating in a civil manner that will bring out the best and most productive changes benefitting the State of Connecticut," Governor Malloy said. "It's important that we have a chance to talk about some of the changes I'm proposing to help create new jobs and get our state's fiscal house in order, and I want to hear what people think."

The Governor held similarly styled constituent meetings during his time as mayor of the City of Stamford and he said he would like to continue meeting with residents in a similar fashion. He is scheduled to deliver his proposed budget to a joint session of the Connecticut General Assembly on Wednesday.
