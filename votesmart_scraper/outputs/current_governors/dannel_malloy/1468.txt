Governor Malloy on President Obama's Job Speech
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding President Barack Obama's address tonight before a Joint Session of Congress.

"Tonight, the President made clear that the time for politics is over, and the time for action is now. President Obama proposed a plan to put Americans back to work, cut their taxes and step up the pace of our economic recovery.

"The President's proposals will be a direct benefit to Connecticut residents and businesses. For example, by investing in infrastructure his proposal would put people to work; by funding education he will avoid layoffs of teachers and increased class sizes; and by extending unemployment insurance he will keep out of poverty the approximately 78,000 Connecticut workers who will have exhausted their unemployment benefits by the end of this year.

"Importantly, this plan will not increase our national debt. Indeed, if enacted it will accelerate economic growth and reduce the nation's long-term deficit. I applaud the President for acting boldly in the face of recent data suggesting that our economic recovery has slowed. Congress should act quickly to pass this plan."
