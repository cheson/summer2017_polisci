FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MALLOY LOOKING FORWARD TO ATTENDING MEETING WITH GOVERNOR RELL ON URBAN VIOLENCE, BUT WONDERS WHAT TOOK GOVERNOR SO LONG TO REACH OUT FOR HELP
STAMFORD - Democratic candidate for Governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's Mayor, today said he welcomed Governor Rell's invitation and hopes to be able to attend the meeting to help her address the issue of youth violence in Connecticut urban areas. Malloy was responding to an invitation he and other mayors received from the Governor earlier today.
"One of the most important things a Governor is charged with is the public safety of the people of this state -- all the people," said Malloy. "As the Mayor of what the FBI has labeled 'Connecticut's Safest City,' and one of the '10 Safest Cities in the Nation', I look forward to sharing with Governor Rell what's worked for us in Stamford."
"Because dialogue between state and local leaders is so important, I'm a little perplexed why it took so long for the Governor to reach out," said Malloy. "In fact, this outreach comes only in the wake of the Governor being criticized for not reaching out. This is another example of an Administration that reacts instead of acting, and usually only does so in response to criticism."
"Going forward, for the remainder of her term, I hope the Governor can find a way to be more proactive -- in acting and in reaching out. Leadership requires at least that much."
