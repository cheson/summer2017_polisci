Women's Issues
Vision

Promote and achieve equality for women and aggressively eliminate discrimination and harassment of women in the workplace, schools, the justice system and everywhere, focusing on but not limited to reproductive rights, pay and promotion, violence.
Problems
* While a woman's right to choose is of course a deeply important one -- and one that I fully support -- by limiting those discussions to things such as reproductive rights and other privacy issues, some leaders have created the impression that women only care about hearing candidates say they're "pro-choice."
* But I believe that women also care about many if not most of the same issues men care about: good jobs, health care for their families, transportation, safe streets, good schools.
* Although I think men's attitudes towards women have improved greatly over the years, one of the results coming out of generations of gender discrimination is that women did in fact fall behind men in some very critical areas.
Solutions
* Address the pay inequity between men and women caused by unequal access to different occupations. The federal Equal Pay Act has not accomplished its goal; meanwhile, the pay gap continues to widen. We must provide opportunities for workers in female-dominated occupations to attain higher-levels of education and training - and with them, higher salaries.
* My economic development strategies are also inspired by the goal of spreading opportunity. My plan to enhance small and micro-business investment will provide a great opportunity for more women-owned business to grow and flourish. The number of self-employed women is growing - up 1.9% in 2003 - and I believe micro-business loan programs will help this growth become stronger.
* In addition to my plans for enhanced economic opportunity, I recognize there is still much to be done to improve the workplace for women and protect women's rights and protections in law.
* Within state government, the persistent disregard for workplace equality, the pattern of hostility and retaliation in certain state agencies must end immediately. How many newspaper reports or harassment and equal treatment lawsuits will it take for our leaders to get the message? For every whistleblower, how many women are forced instead to sit in frightened silence for fear of retribution? As Governor, I will institute a zero-tolerance policy regarding harassment, intimidation, and unequal treatment. I will also institute Glass Ceiling audits of state government agencies and privatization contracts to protect against inequities in pay between men and women.
* As Governor, I will be fully committed to stopping right-wing assaults on reproductive rights. It is likely that right-wing opponents will push a number of proposals that would effectively open up a backdoor to limiting reproductive rights. I will fight against all blatant and covert attacks on the reproductive rights of women.
* I will continue to strengthen domestic violence and related privacy protections.
* Finally, I believe state efforts to help women win the battle against dead-beat dads have failed miserably. Despite improved legislation, state agencies lack the will and commitment from the Governor's office to enforce the laws.
