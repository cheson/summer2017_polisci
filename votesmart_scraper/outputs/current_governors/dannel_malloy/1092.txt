Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today signed Senate Bill 1138, An Act Concerning Connecticut's Clean Energy Goals. The bill modernizes the state's Renewable Portfolio Standards, which currently call for 20 percent renewable power by 2020. The change will allow Connecticut move away from dirtier fuels like biomass to cleaner large scale hydroelectric power.

"I want to thank Senators Williams and Duff, Speaker Sharkey, Representative Reed and the legislature for their work to get this bill passed," Governor Malloy said. "Updating our renewable energy portfolio strengthens Connecticut's competitiveness while also protecting our environment for future generations. This legislation creates clean energy jobs right here in Connecticut, moves us away from polluting fossil fuels, and provides cleaner, cheaper, more reliable energy to ratepayers."
