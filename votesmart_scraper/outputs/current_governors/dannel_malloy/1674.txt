Dick Blumenthal, Denise Nappier And Nancy Wyman Endorse The Campaign
Topic: Campaign News
I have exciting news to share with you. This afternoon, my candidacy for Governor was endorsed by Connecticut State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, Treasurer Denise Nappier and Comptroller Nancy Wyman.
This campaign began over two years ago, with hundreds of supporters sharing a message of a better Connecticut. That message, along with their tireless efforts, has propelled us forward. It brought the endorsement of major cities and towns throughout our state. Two months ago it was what won us the Connecticut Democrat Party's endorsement. Less than one week ago it helped secure the backing of the New York Times. And now, it has brought the endorsement of Connecticut's ranking constitutional officers.
I would like to thank Dick, Denise and Nancy for their support. These are three elected officials who for years have served Connecticut's working men and women and their families with the utmost compassion, dedication and fortitude. It is truly an honor and a privilege to stand alongside some of the finest public servants Connecticut has ever known, and I look forward to working with them in the years ahead.
As our party's nominee for Governor, I will provide the citizens of Connecticut with an alternative to the stagnant Rowland-Rell administrations. I will fight to bring sensible and effective solutions to the major issues facing our state -- jobs, transportation, health care, housing, energy costs, and education. I look forward to the campaign ahead and working to build a better Connecticut.
