Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the Board of Regents.

"The developments of the past week at the Board of Regents' central office have unfortunately overshadowed the accomplishments that have been achieved over the past year as the result of the reforms that were implemented.

"In that time, the central office was able to identify $5.5 million in savings through office consolidation; thanks in large part to those savings, 47 new faculty and student support positions have been approved. At a time when similar college systems in other states are cutting back on faculty, this is no small accomplishment.

"The community college system has launched three new manufacturing centers across the state. We are trying hard to compete for the good-paying jobs the precision manufacturing industry can produce, and these centers will go a long way toward giving our students the tools they'll need to win those competitions.

"In addition, the Board approved a seamless transfer and articulation proposal that will allow students throughout the system to transfer schools much more easily. That proposal languished for close to 30 years. Now it's happening.

"It's achievements like those, and others as well, that have gotten lost in the mix in the past week, which I quite frankly think is a shame.

"All of that said, serious problems have been identified in recent days, and they need to be fixed.

"I believe the Board of Regents needs to step in, conduct a review of these matters, and take appropriate steps based on their findings.

"The credibility of the central office has been damaged, and it needs to be restored as quickly as possible."
