Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the three remaining counties have been granted disaster assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Hartford, Tolland, and Windham counties have been declared disaster areas by FEMA, and are now eligible for federal funding to assist in clean up and recovery efforts from tropical storm Irene. Eight Connecticut counties now qualify for disaster assistance, which will allow individuals, as well as local governments, to tap into federal funds for storm remediation.

"I am gratified that President Obama and our federal partners recognize just how damaging this storm was to Connecticut residents, our infrastructure, and our economy," said Governor Malloy. "Secretary Napolitano will tour the devastation on the shoreline tomorrow, but with the assistance of the President, our Congressional delegation and FEMA, Connecticut residents can begin to clean up and move forward."
