Letter to Speaker Boehner
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today wrote a letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner urging him to reconsider his decision to adjourn the 112th Congress without holding a vote on the bipartisan, Senate-passed Hurricane Sandy relief package.

"Your decision to postpone consideration of a disaster supplemental until after the 113th Congress commences likely delays delivery of relief for months, and therefore delays the process of rebuilding from Sandy," Governor Malloy wrote. "It sends a terrible message to the citizens of the affected states that the leadership of the House of Representatives feels no sense of urgency, with winter upon us, to aid fellow citizens in their great time of need as the Congress has done time and again when other natural disasters have devastated communities elsewhere in the country."

Governor Malloy has been working with Connecticut's Congressional delegation and the governors of New York and New Jersey on a federal relief package for the states impacted by the storm.
