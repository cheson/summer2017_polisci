Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that over the past twelve months, Connecticut experienced the sixth largest decline in unemployment of any state in the nation. According to the most recent federal and state data, jobless numbers dropped from 6.3 percent in November 2014 to 5.1 percent in November 2015. That 1.2 percent decrease is among the largest nationwide.
"Our private sector businesses are seeing steady growth, and the data that we're seeing is encouraging," Governor Malloy said. "Looking ahead into 2016, I want to make it clear that we remain committed to working with employers to continue this momentum and expand opportunities for Connecticut workers. Progress is no doubt happening - and we intend to ensure it keeps happening."
