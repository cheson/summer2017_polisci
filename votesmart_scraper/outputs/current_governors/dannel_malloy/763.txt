Governor Dannel P. Malloy today applauded the U.S. Department of Defense's announcement that it has awarded Stratford-based Sikorsky a contract valued at $1.2 billion for six test aircraft, and twenty-one overall, with most of the work to be done in Connecticut.

"Connecticut is proud of our long tradition as a leading producer of high quality products for our aerospace and national defense supply chain," said Governor Malloy. "At a time when defense budgets are being significantly reduced, Connecticut firms continue to earn the major contracts because they are building the right things at the right time; high quality products specifically called for in the Pentagon's national security strategy."

"This contract combined with our agreement to keep Sikorsky and other United Technologies companies in our state for years to come means our residents will continue to have good paying jobs with good benefits. I want to thank our Congressional delegation for their continued support of Connecticut's manufacturers."

Last month, Governor Malloy announced the final bipartisan passage of legislation that supports an agreement the state reached last month with United Technologies Corporation (UTC) under which the company will invest up to $500 million to upgrade and expand its aerospace research and development and manufacturing facilities over the next five years. During the same time period, UTC -- parent company of Sikorsky -- expects to invest up to $4.5 billion in research and other capital expenditures in the state, impacting more than 75,000 jobs in the state.
