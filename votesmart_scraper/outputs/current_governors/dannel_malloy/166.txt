Governor Dannel P. Malloy is applauding an announcement made today by the Obama Administration to form a new cross government partnership - the Clean Energy savings for All Initiative - that aims to increase access to solar energy and promote energy efficiency across the United States, particularly in low and moderate-income communities.
"Here in Connecticut, we've been focused on making our state greener, cleaner, and more efficient than ever before, all while lowering energy costs and creating local jobs in the green energy economy. This announcement today by the Obama Administration presents an innovative approach for people of all income levels to finance residential home improvements that will reduce their monthly utility costs while at the same time making a positive impact on carbon emissions," Governor Malloy said. "I look forward to working with our federal counterparts to utilize these opportunities and increase the use of solar electricity generation to keep Connecticut at the forefront of these issues."
Connecticut has been a national leader in providing access to commercial and residential green energy. In 2011, Governor Malloy created the Connecticut Green Bank - a first-in-the-nation initiative that is leading the clean energy finance movement by leveraging public and private funds to scale-up renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency projects across Connecticut.
Late last year, Governor Malloy wrote a letter to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro urging federal guidance to provide clarity for R-PACE programs, and establish consumer protections while ensuring residential homeowners have access to critically needed funding to make energy upgrades to their homes.
