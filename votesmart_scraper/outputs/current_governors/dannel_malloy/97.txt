Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that it halted the implementation of President Trump's executive order regarding refugees and immigration in response to the ruling issued by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart:
"The recent injunction issued by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart temporarily ends what many believe is an unconstitutional order from the President. The Department of Homeland Security's decision to abide by the judge's order is reassuring. These actions safeguard a fundamental element of a safe and free democracy -- that an unconstitutional action by one branch of government will be held in check by a separate and independent branch of government.
"It is unconscionable and outrageous that the President would take to Twitter to denounce a judge for acting in accordance to his constitutional obligation to the people our nation. Perhaps if President Trump's administration had spent more time consulting the policy, legal, and national security experts employed by the executive branch, this executive order would not have been so unconstitutionally conceived and would not have harmed our nation's image on the world's stage.
"While these recent developments have brought hope that this ill-advised and un-American order will be permanently reversed -- the fight is far from finished. Connecticut stands ready to protect the rights of all residents and those who wish to call our state home."
