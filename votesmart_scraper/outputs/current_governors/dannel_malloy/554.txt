Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding President Obama's nomination of Ash Carter as the United States Secretary of Defense:

"Ash Carter is a very well-respected and distinguished national security and defense expert, and I congratulate him on his nomination to lead the Department of Defense. Throughout his public service career, Mr. Carter has demonstrated leadership, strategic vision, and a deep dedication to the men and women of our armed forces. As a member of the Council of Governors, I had the pleasure of working with him when he was Deputy Secretary of Defense, and I look forward to working with him again, not just on matters affecting the National Guard, but also our Submarine Base New London, and our defense industry which is such a vital part of Connecticut's economy. I also commend and thank Secretary Hagel for his lifetime of public service to our nation, including as a combat veteran, United States Senator, and most recently as Secretary of Defense."
