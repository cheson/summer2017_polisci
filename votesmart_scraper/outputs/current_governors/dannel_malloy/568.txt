Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the announcement on immigration made this evening by President Obama:
"Over one year ago, the United States Senate passed legislation to fix our broken immigration system by strengthening our borders, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, stimulating our economy, and creating jobs. I supported that bipartisan, commonsense immigration reform bill. Soon after, I joined with governors from fourteen other states and called upon House leadership to pass similar legislation. Unfortunately, House Republican leadership failed to act.
"That is why I commend President Obama for using his executive authority to do what he can to alleviate this problem -- just as numerous presidents before him have done. Immigration is a federal issue. But in Connecticut, we've done what we can to respect our values as a nation of immigrants, including providing in-state tuition for children who have lived in Connecticut for most of their lives and have attended and graduated from Connecticut schools. But the actions we've already taken in Connecticut and the actions that the President will take are no substitute for a comprehensive reform law. And it is not too late for Congress to act before the steps President Obama outlined tonight take effect. There is no excuse for inaction."
