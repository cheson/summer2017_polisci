Gov. Malloy & Lt. Gov. Wyman on Record Low Homelessness in Connecticut
Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements regarding an annual point-in-time count of homelessness in the state that was released today by the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness. The report shows that homelessness in Connecticut is down nearly four percent compared to 2015, and has declined 13 percent since 2007. With this new drop, homelessness rates have dropped to a new record low.
The number of people who are chronically homeless (those with severe disabilities experiencing long-term homelessness) decreased 20 percent across Connecticut compared to the 2015 point-in-time count, continuing a sharp downward trend.
Governor Malloy said, "We've set high goals, and these statistics demonstrate that we are moving in the right direction. Ensuring and delivering housing is critical to building stronger communities for everyone, everywhere. Housing is key to economic development, and by building partnerships between the state, municipalities, and community nonprofit organizations, we're tackling an issue that is critical to our future. I want to thank each of our partners and those working on the front lines every day to help us reach these goals."
Lt. Governor Wyman, "Over the past six years, we've made historic investments in housing - it's part of our overall economic development strategy and our commitment to improving quality of life in Connecticut. Housing is fundamental to attracting a talented workforce, encouraging young families to put down roots, and keeping seniors in their communities. I applaud Governor Malloy, our Department of Housing, advocates, and partners for ensuring Connecticut is on the right track."
In 2014, Governor Malloy signed Connecticut up as one of the first states to join Zero:2016 - a national initiative that sought to secure commitments from communities across the country to end all chronic homelessness by the end of 2016. In February, the federal government certified that Connecticut became the second state in the nation to effectively end homelessness among veterans, meaning that the state has created a successful system that has the capacity and sustainable systems in place to quickly find and connect homeless veterans to the assistance needed to achieve stable, permanent housing, and ensures that when there is a new episode of homelessness, it is brief and non-recurring.
