Governor Dannel P. Malloy today testified before the General Assembly's Education Committee in support of legislation he proposed to restore Connecticut's education system into a national model of excellence for all and help advance an economic revival for the state.

"There has never been a moment when jobs and education have been more connected and dependent on one another," Governor Malloy stated in his testimony submitted to lawmakers. "For the sake of our state's economic competitiveness -- if we are to continue to make strides and create jobs in this state, as we have over the last 14 months -- it is imperative that we transform the public system in which our students learn and prepare for college and a career."

Legislation proposed by the Governor earlier this month calls for comprehensive reform of the state's education system, including increasing the access to and quality of early childhood education slots; allocating new funding and implementing new approaches that will improve low performing schools; expanding slots for public schools of choice including charter schools; removing red tape and other barriers that stand in the way of local school districts; repositioning the state's vo-tech schools to promote job readiness and job linkages; and improving teacher preparation so professionals have the skills they need to excel when they enter the classroom.

"Our public schools once led the nation, and now Connecticut leads in achievement gaps," Governor Malloy testified. "Education is the civil rights issue of our time. This is our opportunity. The time is now to transform the status quo. We must provide our children with the opportunities they so richly deserve if we are to revive our state's economy and lead the country once more."
