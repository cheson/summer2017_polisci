Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the strike at Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London:

"I am extremely disappointed that negotiations between L+M and the AFT have fallen apart. While it certainly takes two to negotiate, leadership at L+M have shown no desire to reach consensus, as evidenced by their behavior today. To walk out on the last day with more than 9 hours left shows a blatant disregard for their employees and, equally important, the patients they care for. These are good, middle-class jobs that are critical to providing care for countless Connecticut residents who rely on L+M. There is simply too much at stake -- both sides need to get back to the table and work out their differences."
