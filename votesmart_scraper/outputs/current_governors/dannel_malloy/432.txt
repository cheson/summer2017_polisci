Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he is directing U.S. and state flags in Connecticut to be flown at half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Friday, May 15, 2015, in recognition of Peace Officers Memorial Day.
The national observance pays tribute to local, state, and federal law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. It is recognized annually during National Police Week, which this year runs from May 10 to 16.
"The men and women of law enforcement put their lives on the line day-in and day-out to selflessly protect the people of our state and our nation. We are deeply indebted to them for the protection they provide to our communities," Governor Malloy said. "As they protect us from harm, they personify what it means to be a public servant. We pay tribute to the fallen law enforcement members who've made the ultimate sacrifice, and we keep in our hearts their families and loved ones. We are forever grateful for their service to our communities."
"We deeply appreciate the service and sacrifices made by our peace officers," Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said. "This week, we reflect on the fallen - what they have given to protect our communities and our freedoms, and what their families have endured in service to Connecticut and the nation. We continue to be grateful to our law enforcement officers for their courage and their commitment to a fairer, stronger democracy."
