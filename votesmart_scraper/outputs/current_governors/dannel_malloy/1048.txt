Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced the launch of the state's first-ever Nonprofit Grant Program -- a new state bond pool specifically designated for nonprofit community-based organizations that provide health and human services through contracts or agreements with state agencies. The program will help nonprofit providers that do business with the state invest in projects that will achieve new efficiencies so they can enhance the delivery of services.

"Connecticut's nonprofit organizations serve every resident of Connecticut and play a substantial role in maintaining our safety net. Partnering with our nonprofit organizations is a smart fiscal investment to ensure that these agencies can continue to provide services while doing so in an efficient, cost-effective way," said Governor Malloy, who proposed creating the program earlier this year as a way of helping nonprofit health and human service agencies ensure that their funding goes towards assisting those most in need of their services. "By supporting capital purchases that enhance service delivery, efficiency and effectiveness and addressing health, safety and accessibility issues, nonprofit agencies can focus on what they do best -- getting services to those who need them most."

Under legislation adopted during the recently adjourned legislative session, the State Bond Commission is authorized to issue up to $20 million in bonding to support eligible projects, which are dependent upon the review and approval of the Office of Policy and Management (OPM).

Applications for the first round of funding must be received by October 4, 2013. Guidelines and application instructions will be made available on the OPM and Department of Administrative Services websites.
Examples of eligible projects include:

- Facility alterations, renovations, improvement, additions, purchase and new construction;
- Health, safety and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act;
- Energy conservation, improvements or projects;
- Information technology projects, including encryption or client confidentiality systems;
- Technology that promotes client independence;
- Purchase of vehicles;
- Acquisition and upgrades to electronic health or medical records and other health information technology systems; and
- Converting use of property to address mutually agreed state agency service needs.

Grant awards will be limited to generally no more than $1 million for any project or nonprofit provider per year, and typically should not exceed 25% of the annual amount of state and state-administered federal funding received through health and human services contracts or agreements.

Eligible applicants are qualified health and human services organizations that are exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, that have contracts or agreements with state agencies, including the Court Support Services Division of the Judicial Branch, to provide direct health and human services to agency clients and populations in Connecticut.
