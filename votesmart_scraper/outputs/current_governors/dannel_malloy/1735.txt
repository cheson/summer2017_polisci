Is Gov. M. Jodi Rell hiding behind ill-gotten state GOP money to campaign against Democrats on the car tax?
One Democratic gubernatorial candidate is accusing Rell of doing just that, by airing a radio ad today touting her proposal to eliminate the car tax. The candidate, Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy, says that Rell broke her her promise against using contributions from contractors or lobbyists for her campaign, because the radio ad was paid for by money from the Republican Party.
Rell's campaign disputes Malloy's claim, but Malloy's campaign is sticking by its statements.
"Governor Rell made a big show of saying she wasn't going to take lobbyist or contractor money into her campaign coffers, but it turns out she may not need to in order to benefit from the same people -- because she's found a way for other people to do it for her," Malloy said in a press release.
Malloy said that because the Republican Party takes money from lobbyists and state contractors, in effect Rell did the same thing by allowing party money to be used to pay for the radio spot.
