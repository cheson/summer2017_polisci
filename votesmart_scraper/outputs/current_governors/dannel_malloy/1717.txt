Malloy: Rell Must Clean House Of Rowland Holdovers
05.01.2006
Category: Better Government
Statement of Dan Malloy, Democratic candidate for Governor:
News reports today have brought to light the disturbing fact that a key player in the John Rowland corruption scandal remains on the government payroll in the Rell Administration -- earning $104,000 taxpayer dollars to serve as a government fraud investigator.
It is simply unimaginable and unacceptable that someone who has admitted taking part in defrauding the people of the state of Connecticut and being part of one of the greatest scandals in our state's history would be on the public payroll at all -- let alone as a top official to investigate wrongdoing in government.
If it is the case that this individual is a protected classified employee, then I call on the governor to transfer her immediately to a position that is less sensitive than top fraud investigator.
It's the latest indication that Governor Rell, no matter what she says, is just unable or unwilling to really break with the past and clean house in the executive branch. It is clear we desperately need a change at the top in order to put and end to this and to restore the public's faith in government.
