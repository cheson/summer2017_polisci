Governor Malloy on Earth Day
Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on the 42nd celebration of Earth Day, April 22:

"Earth Day is an excellent opportunity to reflect on where we are going in our work to protect the environment and clean up the planet. Certainly we've made progress--in Connecticut we've invested in remediating brownfields, giving formerly toxic land new life; planned smarter transportation projects that strengthen our economy and reduce carbon emissions; and launched initiatives that curb the polluted runoff that poisons Long Island Sound and closes our beaches every summer. But we need to remain diligent in this work to clean up our planet and better balance our need for development with the imperative of a clean, healthy, and safe environment. The work to better plan our cities and transportation systems, and minimize our impact on the Earth continues."
