HARTFORD, Conn. -- Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy, one of two Democratic candidates for governor, said news of layoffs at Pfizer Inc. and Lego Group on Tuesday highlight Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell's poor jobs record.
"Sadly for Connecticut and the hardworking men and women who live and work in our state, this governor has been a complete failure when it comes to showing the leadership we need to create new jobs - or even to keep the ones we have," Malloy said in a written statement.
Danish toy maker Lego said it will end its production in Enfield and lay off 300 people there in early 2007. Pfizer said it will phase out its manufacturing operations in Groton by the end of 2008, eliminating about 300 jobs.
"The governor continually seems surprised at events where she should be playing a highly active role," Malloy said. "How often has the governor reached out to these major, name-brand employers in the last 12 months?"
