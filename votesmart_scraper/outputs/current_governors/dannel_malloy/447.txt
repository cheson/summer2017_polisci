Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that his office has completed an exhaustive review of all executive orders that have been signed by previous Connecticut governors and he has signed a new order directing all outdated, unnecessary, or obsolete orders be repealed, and those benefiting the State of Connecticut to remain in effect.

In addition, the new executive order that Governor Malloy signed today directs that all currently active orders, including those that were signed by prior governors, be published electronically on the Governor's website in order to be conveniently accessed by members of the public.

"My office's legal staff has been conducting a very thorough, exhaustive review of every single executive order and has brought to my attention the large number that are outdated, unnecessary, and no longer provide any benefit to the residents of our state," Governor Malloy said. "This systematic review was long overdue. Streamlining the executive orders and making them easily accessible to the public will ultimately benefit the residents and businesses of our state."

The executive orders from prior administrations that will remain in effect are:

Governor Thomas Meskill's Executive Orders No. 3 and 17
Governor Ella Grasso's Executive Order No. 18
Governor William O'Neill's Executive Orders No. 6, 9, and 19
