Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced the award of nearly $10 million in stem cell research funds to 18 Connecticut--based researchers. The awards were made earlier this month by the State of Connecticut Stem Cell Research Advisory Committee at its grant review meeting.

"These grants represent another example of Connecticut's unprecedented investment in biomedical research," said Governor Malloy. "The Connecticut Stem Cell program helps to foster an environment in our state where scientists can pursue innovative research -- work that is already promising new therapies for debilitating diseases."

One hundred and eleven stem cell fund applications were received in December 2013. The Connecticut Stem Cell Research Peer Review Committee reviewed these applications in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and provided to the Advisory Committee its recommendations with respect to the scientific merits of each application.

"We are fortunate to see such outstanding applications from Connecticut researchers," said Department of Public Health Commissioner and Advisory Committee Chairperson Dr. Jewel Mullen. "The research supported by the Connecticut Stem Cell program provides hope to future generations of patients for medical therapies that will treat some of our greatest health challenges."
