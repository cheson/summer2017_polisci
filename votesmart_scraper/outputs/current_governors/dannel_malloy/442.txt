Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today joined state and local officials at the train station in Old Saybrook to highlight transit-oriented development (TOD) initiatives in the surrounding area. The projects represent the state's continued commitment to provide Connecticut and its local communities with a best-in-class transportation system, delivering economic development, job growth, and improved quality of life.
Upgrades in the area surrounding the Old Saybrook station include increased parking, a new bus shelter, improved connections to the station platform, four electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, bicycle facilities, and new residential housing units.
"Projects we deliver today mean a brighter future for Connecticut tomorrow. These upgrades will mean economic growth and higher quality of life - and they're all part of the smart decisions we're making today to make Connecticut stronger in the long-term. Through public and private sector investments, we are helping build an Old Saybrook that is an even greater place to live, work, and raise a family," Governor Malloy said. "Our economic growth is directly tied to our transportation system, and for too long we have under-invested. We have built a strong consensus that now is time to act. Projects like this one are examples of what we can accomplish across Connecticut if we make smart investments now to make our state's future brighter."
The Old Saybrook station serves the Shore Line East commuter rail line and Amtrak train service through Connecticut and the Old Saybrook Junction Marketplace.
Connecticut Transportation Commissioner James P. Redeker said 196 parking spaces are being added on the west side of the station, augmenting the existing parking lot that has 128 spaces.
The commissioner also said that the Town of Old Saybrook and the Lower Connecticut River Valley Council of Governments have been successful in undertaking improvements to the local streets surrounding the station, providing safer pedestrian and bicycle access to the site as well as streetscape improvements to North Main Street.
There will be a bus turnout lane on the eastern half of the new parking lot. It will service both CT Transit buses and Nine Town Transit shuttles.
These improvements are complemented and supported by the private investment in a new residential development, to be known as Eastpointe at Saybrook Junction, made up of 186 one- and two- bedroom units. The development, by Eastpointe LLC of Greenwich, will have a dog park and have access to the Old Saybrook Junction Marketplace and the train station and bus stop. The EV charging stations are being manufactured and installed by an Enfield company, Control Module. The parking lot and other improvements are being done by Dayton Construction of Watertown.
Together, these improvements result in development that leverages the state's investments into its rail infrastructure and support sustainable TOD.
