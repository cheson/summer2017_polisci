Gov. Malloy: State Prepared for Temporary Federal Government Shutdown
Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

To ensure that Connecticut will be prepared in case the Federal Government shuts down, Governor Malloy last week requested that all Executive Branch department heads submit an initial assessment of potential impacts of a shutdown on each agency's programs, services, operations and employees. As a result of the responses received, including input from the Office of the Treasurer and the Office of the State Comptroller, Governor Malloy determined that the state will be able weather a short term shut down -- 2 to 3 weeks -- without any disruptions. He questioned, however, the state's ability to navigate a longer-term shut down and ordered contingency plans developed in the event that occurs.

"Nobody wants the Federal Government to shut down, but it's a real reminder that there are consequences if the political gamesmanship in Washington doesn't end soon," said Governor Malloy. "Connecticut residents won't notice a disruption in services or operations for a temporary shutdown, but anything longer than three weeks, and there is a real concern about our ability to continue to deliver vital state services. My office is in contact with the offices of our representatives in Washington -- all of whom are working to ensure our Federal Government does not shut down -- and we will prepare a contingency plan."

In order to thoroughly address questions about longer-term viability, Governor Malloy established a task force to prepare a contingency plan in the event of prolonged shutdown of the federal government. Serving on the task force will be the representatives from the Treasurer's Office, Comptroller's Office and the Commissioners of the Department of Social Services, Public Health, Labor, Transportation, Education, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, and a representative from the Office of Labor Relations.
