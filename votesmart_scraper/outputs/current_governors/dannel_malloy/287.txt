Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy is urging drivers in Connecticut who will be partaking in festivities this holiday season as Christmas and New Year's Eve approaches to drive safely, have a plan in place to get home if they plan on consuming alcohol, and take extra precautions when getting behind the wheel. Connecticut State Police will continue to enforce all motor vehicle laws in order to ensure the safety of our roads.
"As the holidays approach over the next few days, everyone should enjoy themselves - but we should all be safe," Governor Malloy said. "If you are going to consume alcohol, have a plan to get home and stick to that plan. Don't put your life, the lives of loved ones, and the lives of others in danger. Please be smart, and please be safe."
