Why It Matters
Topic: Better Government
As the fundraising scandal inside the Governor's office continues to unfold, I'm urging the Governor to be more forthcoming, and I'm urging her to tell everyone in her Administration to do the same. The Governor's Office should not wait for investigators to come to them and then play a cat and mouse game to delay the process. The Governor should seize the initiative and disclose any and all information immediately. Any other course of action will only stretch the process out -- and the people of Connecticut have been through more than enough already.
People have asked me whether or not I think this is an important issue. My answer is "yes, it is," for the following reason: The scandal-ridden years of the Rowland-Rell Administration took their toll on the people of Connecticut. People lost faith in their government and in their leaders. Story after breaking story of unethical conduct cascaded in the press. As a result, we spent so much more time discussing who was going to jail than we did talking about providing health care for children, property tax relief for families, and growing jobs and the economy.
The twin dangers here are that people across Connecticut may again begin to lose faith in their government, and that stories about investigations will once again dominate the news -- distracting from the important issues that affect people in their everyday lives.
The person who can best prevent both of these events from occurring is Jodi Rell. The sooner she takes the initiative, the faster the Chief State's Attorney's office can complete its investigation. The sooner that happens, the sooner we can get back to a discussion of the issues affecting the people of Connecticut.
