Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in response to a Connecticut Superior Court judge's ruling today to allow a lawsuit filed by families of Sandy Hook school shooting victims to move forward:
"We've passed the toughest gun laws in the nation for a reason. These families deserve this - the ruling is the right one. The gun industry should not have protections that no other industry in America sees. This is a victory for the families and a victory for those who stand for commonsense gun laws."
