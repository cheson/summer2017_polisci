Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion and guaranteed that the 14th amendment right to privacy is extended to a woman's control of her reproductive health care:

"A woman's right to control her own reproductive health care--her own body--is not and should not be a question for politicians," said Governor Malloy. "I've always been a strong supporter of a woman's right to choose, and the anniversary of Roe v. Wade certainly marks a milestone. That said, across this country we are witnessing a tremendous erosion of a woman's access to quality healthcare. Through defunding and the egregiously burdensome regulation of fundamental healthcare services, women are being denied their rights to control their own bodies and their futures. Just as we recognize how far we've come in 40 years, we also recognize how far we have to go."

"This anniversary is a reminder that the fight for a woman's right to choose is as crucial today as it was four decades ago--despite all the gains we have made over the years, the battle is not yet over," said Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman. "We are fortunate that Connecticut has a long tradition of being a leader on this issue, and that the Obama administration is clearly on the side of choice. But we must continue our commitment to keep and strengthen this important freedom--no matter who is in the White House."
