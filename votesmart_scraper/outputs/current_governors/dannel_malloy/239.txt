Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Connecticut Department of Housing (DOH) Commissioner Evonne M. Klein today announced that nearly $28 million is being awarded to support the development of affordable housing across Connecticut as part of the latest round of funding under the state's Competitive Housing Assistance for Multifamily Properties (CHAMP) program. These awards will play a role in helping to create, rehabilitate, or preserve approximately 200 units of affordable housing and focus on expanding access to transit-oriented development, creating new veteran's housing units, and adding supportive housing for those who are living with disabilities.
"Affordable housing is key to creating vibrant communities that attract families, workers, businesses, and private investments. Access to housing helps boost competitiveness, attracts business, and builds our economy. That's why our administration has been so committed to making these critical investments," Governor Malloy said.
"State government must be a strong partner in efforts to expand housing options - our business climate and our communities depend on it," Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said. "I applaud Governor Malloy and Commissioner Klein on these investments in our cities and towns."
CHAMP, administered by DOH, provides developers and owners of multifamily affordable housing the necessary gap financing to create more affordable units in their developments.
"Affordable housing is a key component of economic growth and stability," Commissioner Klein said. "These investments throughout the state ensure Connecticut's continued economic recovery and the ability to remain an attractive state to call home, work, and raise a family. The CHAMP funding rounds provide an excellent opportunity for municipalities to attract a workforce, keep seniors in their community, give young families a start, and provide a home to someone who has been homeless. I am proud to say that we have made real progress when it comes to expanding access to affordable housing, while working to prevent and end homelessness."
Since 2011, the state has created, rehabilitated, or preserved 7,584 affordable housing units. There are another 3,179 affordable units under construction, and funding commitments are in place to create approximately 5,200 additional affordable units. The state's investment in affordable housing totals about $1 billion dollars - a testament to the high level of commitment that is being made to prevent and end homelessness, while ensuring every resident has a place to call home.
