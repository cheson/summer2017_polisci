Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy Takes First Step In Campaign For Governor
Today, Mayor Dan Malloy took his first formal step toward becoming Connecticut's next Governor by opening a candidate committee with the Office of the Secretary of the State.
Mayor Malloy is the first candidate to file papers in the race for Governor.
Dan Malloy has a long record of achievements, both as a former prosecutor, and as the Mayor of Stamford for the last nine years. During his tenure as the Mayor of Connecticut's fourth largest city, Malloy's administration has rebuilt and revitalized Stamford - drastically reducing crime, rebuilding its education infrastructure, obtaining unprecedented federal funds for redevelopment, and reengineering and streamlining city government.
Upon filing his committee papers, Mayor Malloy said, "This is the first step in what will no doubt be a political marathon. I look forward to bringing the creative ideas and fiscal discipline I developed in Stamford to people throughout the state."
Malloy continued, "After almost sixteen years out of the State's top executive position, Democrats are in a position to win back the Governor's Office. Our party needs a strong candidate who not only has the ability to win, but who can lead Connecticut in the right direction. I am best poised to be that candidate."
Malloy's decision follows months of speculation on his candidacy. The filing of papers today has been anticipated for some time and launches what is expected to be a two-year battle for the Governor's Office.
