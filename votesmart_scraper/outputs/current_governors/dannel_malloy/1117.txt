Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding attempts by Senate Republican legislators to block a vote on the confirmation of Gina McCarthy as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. McCarthy served as commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection from 2004 to 2009 under Governor M. Jodi Rell.

"Republicans in the Senate need to stop looking at every vote as an opportunity to score political points against the President. The election is long over. It's time for them to do their jobs. Gina McCarthy is exceptionally qualified to lead an agency that is doing critically important work. She's been confirmed by the Senate before, she deserves to be again."
