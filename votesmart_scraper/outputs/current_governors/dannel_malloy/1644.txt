Democratic nominee for Governor Dan Malloy today responded to a Connecticut Law Tribune article regarding Republican candidate for Attorney General Martha Dean, who said she believes that states "absolutely" have the right to secede. Malloy's opponent, Tom Foley, has appeared at numerous rallies and events with Dean in recent months in support of her candidacy.
Said Malloy:
"To have a candidate for constitutional office suggest that secession is an option on the table for states isn't just bizarre, it's completely irresponsible. As my friend George Jepsen has rightly pointed out, our country fought a war over this issue -- and it was settled in 1865. The question has to be asked -- if this kind of extreme rhetoric is coming from one Republican Party endorsed candidate, does Tom Foley believe it as well? My hope is that he doesn't, and that he condemns these comments thoroughly and without delay."
