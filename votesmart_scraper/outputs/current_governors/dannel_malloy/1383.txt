Andrew Doba, Governor Malloy's Director of Communications, today released the following statement regarding the civil motion filed yesterday on the Governor's behalf:

"The motion filed yesterday was for a protective order, but the term is being misinterpreted by some as being akin to a "restraining order,' which this is not. Yesterday's motion was filed to ensure that the Governor does not have to respond to Lee Whitnum's baseless and improper discovery requests in a civil case.

"The court recently ruled that Ms. Whitnum's amended complaint was improper and knocked out her complaint in its entirety. Since Ms. Whitnum no longer has a civil complaint against the Governor, the Governor is not obligated to respond or object to Ms. Whitnum's improper discovery requests.

"Ms. Whitnum has now had two unsuccessful bites at the apple in her attempt to maintain a complaint against the Governor. Her litigious conduct lacks merit and she has no claims against the Governor."
