Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that - in accordance with a proclamation from President Barack Obama directing flags to be lowered to honor the victims of the attack in Nice, France - U.S. and state flags in Connecticut will fly at half-staff beginning immediately until sunset on July 19, 2016.
Accordingly, since no flag should fly higher than the U.S. flag, all state, local, municipal, corporate, and other flags should also be lowered during this same duration of time.
