Governor Dannel P. Malloy, in response to a proclamation issued this evening by President Barack Obama, has directed U.S. and state flags in Connecticut to fly at half-staff from sunrise until sunset on Friday, November 22, 2013, in recognition of a national Day of Remembrance for President John F. Kennedy.

"Half a century after his assassination, President John F. Kennedy's call to action for every citizen to better our great nation and serve our fellow man continues to inspire generation after generation of Americans," Governor Malloy said. "We should all take a moment today to pay tribute to this extraordinary public servant and reflect on how we each can do our part to carry on President Kennedy's legacy."
