MALLOY REACTS TO GOVERNOR RELL'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PRESS RELEASE
"Why did Gov. Rell wait until she'd been Governor for 18 months before putting forward an economic development plan? Considering Connecticut's anemic job growth, prospects for future job growth, job losses, and the state's dysfunctional economic development agencies -- all of which have been the case since she took office -- this issue should have been one of the first things Gov. Rell addressed after taking office. And without a comprehensive plan to address our health care needs, reform our tax structure and fix our transportation system and infrastructure, this is but one piece of a larger puzzle that needs to be put together. Governor Rell, the political candidate in an election year, is now putting forth a campaign strategy for jobs. As Mayor of Stamford, my team and I have been working to create jobs for more than a decade, and we have a successful track record of doing so, not just in election years. That said, there are some long overdue ideas in her press release that I have been calling upon Governor Rell to take on for many months, including fixing the disastrous DECD. During the course of this campaign, I'm looking forward to laying out my ideas and real initiatives -- many of which have worked in Stamford -- about how Connecticut can once again be a leader in economic development, a mantle we lost years ago."
