Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement in advance of Armed Forces Day, marked this year on Saturday, May 21, 2011.

"For more than six decades we have been celebrating Armed Forces Day and honoring the men and women in uniform who go to extraordinary measures to protect the freedoms we enjoy. Like the wars we have fought before, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have taken a toll on Connecticut's brave soldiers and their families. Tomorrow, as we celebrate our military and the many people in uniform who make incredible sacrifices for our freedoms, we must also remember those who are no longer with us. We are grateful for the work being done by the men and women of our armed forces and we thank our soldiers and our veterans for their dedicated service to the state and to the country."
