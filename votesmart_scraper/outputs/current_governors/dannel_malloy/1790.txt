Jodi Rell Enters The Race
Topic: Better Government
It's a statistical fact that Connecticut's families are losing ground economically, they're losing health care coverage, it's harder for them to find good jobs, and it's harder for them to pay for their children's education. We have more children sliding into poverty and more seniors who can't afford prescription drugs. As someone who is focused on solving problems, those are the issues I think about every day, and that's why a substantive, issue-oriented campaign is exactly what this state needs. I welcome Jodi Rell to the race. I look forward to a debate with her that will benefit this state: a conversation about my record of the past 10 years versus her record of the past 10 years, and about the choices we've each made. Perhaps more important, I look forward to a conversation about how each of us plans to address the fact that Connecticut has been losing ground for the past 10 years.
