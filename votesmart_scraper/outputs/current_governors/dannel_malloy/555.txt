Governor Dannel P. Malloy is directing U.S. and Connecticut flags to fly at half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Sunday, December 7, 2014, in recognition of Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. The national observance honors the lives lost in the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.

"We will never forget the courageous service of those who made the ultimate sacrifice on that day in 1941. The thousands of men and women who served the U.S. during World War II deserve our thanks and continued admiration," Governor Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said in a joint statement. "Today, the nation comes together to reflect upon all that the Armed Forces have given to protect our freedoms, defend our values, and further our democracy. And while we pay tribute to the past, know that our thoughts and prayers are with those who are currently deployed. We hope for their safe and speedy return."
