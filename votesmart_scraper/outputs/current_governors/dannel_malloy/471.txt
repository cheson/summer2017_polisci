In response to developments in Indiana, Governor Dannel P. Malloy today signed an executive order that bans state-funded travel to states that have enacted legislation to protect religious freedom but do not prohibit discrimination for classes of citizens.

Connecticut has been a national leader in protecting against discrimination regarding sexual orientation and gender identity.

"We cannot sit idly by and do nothing while laws are enacted that will turn back the clock. We need to keep moving forward and stand up against forces that seek to roll back progress. I'm sending a clear message with this executive order: Discrimination can't and won't be tolerated by the State of Connecticut," Governor Malloy said. "Nearly two decades ago, Connecticut was among the first states that passed a comprehensive anti-discrimination law concerning sexual orientation, and three years ago I enthusiastically signed a law adding gender identity and expression to those statutes. We need to do what we can to stand up and act against laws that allow -- as a matter of public policy -- individuals to be discriminated against. It's unacceptable, and today, Connecticut has acted."

The order directs that all agencies, departments, boards and commissions, the University of Connecticut, and the Board of Regents immediately review all requests for state-funded or state-sponsored travel to states that create the grounds for such discrimination and to bar any such publicly funded travel unless necessary for the enforcement of state law, to meet contractual obligations, or for the protection of public health, welfare and safety.

The order takes effect immediately.
