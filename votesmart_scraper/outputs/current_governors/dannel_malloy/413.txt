Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the adopted FY 2016/2017 state budget includes funding to begin a major renovation of the area surrounding the Charter Oak Bridge in Hartford in order to alleviate a frequent traffic bottleneck that for years has been a source of congestion on I-91 North, often leading to motor vehicle accidents and traffic delays. Plans for the renovated highway will provide a more efficient connection from I-91 North to I-84 East.
The Charter Oak Bridge carries Routes 5 and 15 over the Connecticut River between Hartford and East Hartford. Due to a combination of factors, there are significant traffic delays from vehicles entering the bridge from Exit 29 on I-91 North, which connects to Route 15 North and I-84 East. The length of the backups vary, but has been observed at times extending approximately 1.4 miles to the vicinity of the Wethersfield Cove. The condition is exacerbated by the tendency of drivers to cut into the right-lane queue from the center lane, drastically reducing the capacity of the center lane and blocking traffic on I-91 North.
"When we talk about congestion reducing productivity and traffic hampering our economic output, the Charter Oak Bridge on I-91 North is the perfect example. For decades, the area has caused major traffic delays, posed safety concerns, and needed significant reconstruction - and it's all come at the expense of businesses, our economy, and quality of life. For too long, there's been no action, and it's time we stand up for a best-in-class transportation system if we want to improve our economy, stimulate growth, and deliver jobs. That's why we're fixing I-91 North in Hartford," Governor Malloy said. "While some may say we shouldn't think big or bold on transportation, with billions of dollars in productivity lost because of inaction, I say we can't afford not to. Our economic future hinges on it."
The Governor's plans involve widening I-91 North between Interchange 27 to Interchange 29, which will require modifications to four bridges: I-91 over Route 15; I-91 over a drainage crossing; I-91 over the entrance ramp to I-91 South and Route 15 South; and I-91 over Airport Road. The I-91 North ramp at Exit 29 will be replaced, Route 15 North will be realigned, and the southern approach to the Charter Oak Bridge will be widened.
The Governor stressed that the project does not involve replacing the bridge itself, but rather will widen the approaches that lead to the bridge, where traffic frequently backs up.
While the project is in the early stages of design, engineering is already funded and underway using available federal and state funds. Total costs are estimated to be $200 million, with an anticipated funding split of 80 percent federal and 20 percent state. The Governor's transportation plan includes $30 million for additional state construction dollars for the project and is expected to be included in the bonding package.
Construction is scheduled to begin in 2018 and is expected to be completed in 2023. The project is estimated to create or retain 1,100 jobs.
