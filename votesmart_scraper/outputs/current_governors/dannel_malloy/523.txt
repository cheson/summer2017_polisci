Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements commemorating Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, which is celebrated this year on January 19, 2015:

Governor Malloy said, "The lasting impact of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. has forever shaped this nation for the better. And while we passionately celebrate his legacy, we must also remember that the struggle for equal rights and equal justice for all is continuous -- it's something that we as human beings must constantly be reflecting on and determined to improve. Dr. King was fearless in his mission, and gave his life advocating for the very ideals that America strives to achieve -- justice, equality, and freedom for all. As we reflect on the life of this great man, let's continue his work together, in unity, to identify injustice where we see it, work to improve it, and keep moving forward."

Lt. Governor Wyman said, "Dr. King used the language in our history to speak to the dreams that are our future -- a future that Connecticut nourishes through investments in our children; our schools; our teachers; our working families; our healthcare and justice systems; and our civil rights. Today, we celebrate Dr. King's life, his legacy, his profound oratory, and his commitment to the potential of this country. Still today, his words remind us that our dream requires more nurturing, reflection, and the courage to live our own humanity."
