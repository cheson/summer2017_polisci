Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) has resurfaced 330 two-lane miles of roadways this construction season - about 25 miles more than 2014, and nearly 90 more miles than the prior year. The additional mileage was the result of an additional $5.7 million state investment into the CTDOT road program and marks the fourth consecutive year of increases in road resurfacing.
"We have stepped up the pace of road resurfacing in Connecticut in recent years, and we are committed to continuous improvement as we work toward a best-in-class highway system for commuters, truckers, and tourists alike," Governor Malloy said. "We are committed to maintaining and upgrading our infrastructure so that we can continue driving growth, economic development, and job creation while improving overall quality of life for our residents."
