Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy this afternoon released the following statement in response to President Obama's speech Wednesday on growing the U.S. economy to ensure the middle class has access to good jobs, quality education, housing, secure retirement, and affordable health care:

"Today, the President renewed his call to Congress to set aside rigid partisanship and ideology and act in the best interest of the American economy and the American people. Even amidst a national recovery that has created millions of new jobs, there is much more work to be done to rebuild a strong economic foundation that supports a growing middle class and rewards hard work.

"I applaud the President's enduring commitment to an economic strategy that creates jobs that pay a living wage, an education policy that equips our citizens for those jobs, and policies that strengthen homeownership and help Americans enjoy health and retirement security.

"There is much Congress can do right now to accelerate economic growth. What Congress must not do is reprise the reckless behavior of the House Majority in 2011 when they brought the U.S. government to the brink of shutdown and default. Such political brinksmanship damaged our economy then and will do so again if partisanship wins out over patriotism. It is my sincere hope that Congress will heed the President's call and act in the best interest of our citizens."
