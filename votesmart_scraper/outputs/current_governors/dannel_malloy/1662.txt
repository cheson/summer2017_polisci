As we've traveled the state in recent months, we've heard the same things in towns of every size and in every corner--too many people are out of work or underemployed, and the people who do have jobs are worried they'll lose them.

This Labor Day, as we honor the contributions of workers throughout Connecticut and the rest of the country, we should also pause to consider just how those people are faring in what has continued to be a very tough economy.

The truth is, America was built by its workers, but right now they're struggling. Connecticut has the unenviable distinction of placing fourth highest nationally in states ranked by long-term unemployment--37 percent of our unemployed workers have been jobless for 6 months or more, according to a recent report "The State of Working Connecticut 2010". That's why priority number one for Connecticut's next administration is to finally put in place a strategy that will help revitalize our economy and grow jobs.

It's true that Connecticut is facing unprecedented economic challenges, challenges that government can't fix by itself. However, what government can do is help put in place an economic development strategy that makes sense for the 21st century economy. It can partner with small business, new industries, and with the men and women who work every day to turn the wheels of our economy. Our roadmap for putting Connecticut back to work will do precisely that.

What we know for sure is that the old ways of doing things just won't cut it anymore. Hopefully, a year from now we can look back on this Labor Day and see it as a turning point --when Connecticut decided that it was time for a change.
