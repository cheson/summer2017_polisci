Governor Dannel P. Malloy today highlighted newly released statistics from the state's Division of Criminal Justice Policy and Planning, which signify a 12% decrease in criminal arrests statewide over the last year.

According to the data from the monthly indicators report, there were 6,175 criminal arrests in January 2015, compared to 6,976 in January 2014. In February 2015 there were 5,478 criminal arrests, compared to 6,175 during February 2014.

"Credit to the trends we're seeing in crime reduction must go to the close collaboration between local, state and federal agencies, and their partnerships with community leaders who are working together day in and day out to reduce crime," Governor Malloy said. "These numbers are moving in the right direction, and we must continue enforcing thoughtful criminal justice initiatives that ensure our frontline law enforcement have the tools they need to keep our communities safe, while also focusing on efforts that break the cycle of crime."
