Statement

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy this evening released the following statement in response to the U.S. Navy announcement that it has awarded $1.2 billion for the production of a second submarine by Electric Boat in FY 2011. In February, Governor Malloy sent letters to the Chairs and the Ranking Members of Congress' Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense urging the full funding of two Virginia Class submarines.

"Connecticut is fortunate to have such a highly effective Congressional Delegation working together to support our national and state interests in Washington. Even as our leaders in Washington must work together to reduce our national deficit and debt, we must not fail to perform the most essential functions of government such as providing for our national security.

"This is good news for our nation's defense, our submarine industrial base, the highly talented workforce at Electric Boat, and over 600 suppliers throughout our state. We are very proud of the Virginia Class program at Electric Boat. Electric Boat continues to be held up as a model in major defense acquisitions, delivering each submarine a little further ahead of schedule and a little more under budget. Their superb corporate leadership and focus on efficiency in construction and affordability in lifecycle support is a true success story all of Connecticut can be proud of."
