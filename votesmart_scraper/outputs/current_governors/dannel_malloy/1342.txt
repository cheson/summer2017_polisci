Governor Malloy on Final Passage of Sunday Sales Bill
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: May 1, 2012
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement after the Senate approved a bill in concurrence with the House to amend Connecticut's Blue Laws:

"Once I sign this bill, Indiana will be the only state in the nation to ban Sunday Sales. It's a measure that's long past due and a good first step to making our state's package stores more consumer friendly.

"Our current laws have cost Connecticut businesses millions of dollars as consumers have flocked over our borders in search of more convenient hours and lower prices. Like many other initiatives I've put forward since taking office, this bill has a simple focus: making Connecticut competitive once again.

"But as I said just a few days ago when the House passed this bill, I continue to believe there's more we can do to lower the cost to consumers in our state. I look forward to the study proposed by the legislature. It's a good first step and one that I hope lays the foundation for future action. This much is clear -- the more we can lower prices for consumers, the more competitive our businesses will be.

"I want to thank the members of the Senate for their work on this issue."
