Gov. Malloy Statement on Ruling by Fourth Circuit Court Blocking Travel Ban

Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the ruling released today by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upholding a lower court ruling blocking implementation of President Trump's travel ban:
"Today is a victory for the rule of law, but we know the fight is far from over. The administration can try to claim this is not a ban based on religion, however the facts speak for themselves. Throughout the campaign, President Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering this nation simply because of their religion. Our nation was founded on the principle that all people are created equal -- and this executive order violates that indelible promise. It seems likely that this case will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court -- and if that transpires, I look forward to that court ruling definitively in favor of justice and liberty."
