Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) Commissioner James Redeker today announced that - with the winter season steadily approaching - the state is making preparations with 114 new plow trucks, supplies, and support equipment to supplement the transportation agency's snow and ice fighting fleet.
"Our state's transportation infrastructure is directly tied to the economic wellbeing of our state and our ability to grow jobs, and it is imperative that we have the tools needed to provide our state's residents with a best-in-class system, including during the winter weather events," Governor Malloy said. "We are preparing for winter weather like never before - our efforts and new initiatives are critical to mitigating the impact of severe weather."
