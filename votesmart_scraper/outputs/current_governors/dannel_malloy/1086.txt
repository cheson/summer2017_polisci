Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he has signed an executive order directing all state agency commissioners and department heads to comply with the National Incident Management System (NIMS), a federal emergency management practice that provides a consistent, nationwide framework among governmental and nongovernmental agencies when responding to natural disasters or other emergency situations.

"By requiring state agencies to follow these specific standards and practices, we will better ensure a swift, coordinated response to emergency situations in Connecticut," Governor Malloy said. "We know that hurricanes and tropical storms are going to have an impact in Connecticut and all levels of government must be prepared."

Under Governor Malloy's Executive Order No. 34, commissioners and department heads will be required to work with the Connecticut Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) to receive NIMS training, including active participation in planning and training exercises. NIMS was used extensively by state agencies and municipalities in response to both Super Storm Sandy and the February blizzard, in addition to the Sandy Hook shootings.

Governor Malloy today also reminded Connecticut residents that the Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30 and residents should be mindful of preparedness measures. Although Super Storm Sandy affected Connecticut last year on October 29, the principal threat period for Connecticut is from mid-August through mid-October.

"I urge residents to know what potential risks your community and neighborhood may face, such as storm surge, flooding, road or bridge closures," Governor Malloy said. "Personal preparedness is essential."

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting a very active hurricane season with 13 to 20 named storms. Around 7 to 11 of them could become hurricanes, with 3 to 6 possibly becoming major hurricanes. This is well above the seasonal average of 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes.

Governor Malloy offered the following preparedness tips:

-Recommended Items to Include in a Basic Emergency Supply Kit

-One gallon of water per person per day for at least three days, for drinking and sanitation
-At least a three-day supply of non-perishable food
-Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert and extra batteries
-Flashlight and extra batteries
-First aid kit
-A whistle to signal for help
-Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties for personal sanitation
-Wrench or pliers to turn off utilities
-Can opener for food (if kit contains canned food)
-Local maps
-Cell phone with chargers, inverter or solar charger

Family Emergency Plan

Identify an out-of town contact. It may be easier to make a long-distance phone call than to call across town, so an out-of-town contact may be in a better position to communicate among separated family members.
Be sure every member of your family knows the phone number and has a cell phone, coins, or a prepaid phone card to call the emergency contact. If you have a cell phone, program that person(s) as "ICE" (In Case of Emergency) in your phone. If you are in an accident, emergency personnel will often check your ICE listings in order to get a hold of someone you know. Make sure to tell your family and friends that you've listed them as emergency contacts.
Teach family members how to use text messaging. Text messages can often get around network disruptions when a phone call might not be able to get through.
Subscribe to alert services. Many communities/states now have systems that will send instant text alerts or e-mails to let you know about severe weather, road closings, local emergencies, etc. Connecticut residents should go to www.ct.gov/ctalert to register for alerts.
