Gov. Malloy: President Obama to Speak at Central Connecticut State University
Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that President Obama will speak at Central Connecticut State University on Wednesday, in an effort to garner support for increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. They will be joined in New Britain by Governor Deval L. Patrick of Massachusetts, Governor Lincoln D. Chafee of Rhode Island and Governor Peter E. Shumlin of Vermont.
"There is a debate happening across our country on how to tackle the growing income inequality that is detrimental to our middle class families and to our economy. Part of tackling that critically important challenge is making sure that we recognize that a decent wage is good for workers and good for business," said Governor Malloy.
"For too long, the minimum wage has not kept up with the cost of living," continued the Governor. "As studies have shown, the workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase brought home 46 percent of their household's total wage and salary income in 2011. When workers earn more money, businesses will have more customers. This modest boost will help those earning the least to make ends meet."
"I am happy to welcome President Obama and my New England colleagues to Connecticut for the next phase of this incredibly important debate," concluded the Governor. "Working together, we can and will make sure that people who work 40 hours a week don't live in poverty."
More details about the event will be released later in the week.
