Gov. Malloy Says Nursing Home Owner, 1199 Should "Find a Way to Work Out Their Differences"

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the stalemate between Healthbridge, a company that owns 9 nursing homes in Connecticut, and New England Health Care Workers' Union SEIU/1199:

"Today I am urging both sides -- Healthbridge and 1199 -- to redouble their efforts so that a fair settlement can be reached. 1199 has reached agreements with owners representing more than 40 nursing homes, so it seems that a fair, reasonable contract pattern has been established that works for management and labor. I know that, thanks to the provider tax, Healthbridge will receive an additional $800,000 this year. While these are certainly challenging financial times for all institutions, one would think an influx of that amount of money would allow for a contract to be reached.

"There's already been a lockout in Milford. Lockouts, strikes, picket lines -- these things come at a great cost to both the workforce and the people they are supposed to serve. It also damages the critically important relationship between the healthcare worker and the senior citizen that not only relies on their care, but also on the companionship that comes along with it.

"Although it was difficult, and although it took a long time, my Administration reached an historic agreement with Connecticut state employees that allows for the continued provision of state services in a sustainable fashion.

"I am urging Healthbridge and 1199 to do the same."
