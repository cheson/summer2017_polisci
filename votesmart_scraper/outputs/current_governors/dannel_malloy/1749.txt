Malloy Calls for Legislative Inquiry into CDA Violations of the Law
Stamford -- With the Connecticut Development Authority (CDA) in the news again for failing to comply with state law by not publicly disclosing key details about the businesses to which it loans millions, gubernatorial candidate Dan Malloy, Stamford's Mayor, called the Rell Administration's mismanagement deeply disturbing, and called upon the Legislature to step in.
"Back in October 2005 I called upon Governor Rell to order the CDA to release the names of companies that have defaulted on millions of dollars in state loans," Malloy said. "Governor Rell did just that as a direct result of that call to action, but months later we find through an audit that the CDA ignored the Governor."
"There are troubling questions that we all should be asking," Malloy added. "Where was the follow up by the Governor? Why are people in State government ignoring her? Who is running the show here? And why is information that by law must be made public being withheld -- is there something improper happening with millions in bad loans? We don't know because public information is being withheld."
"Perhaps more chilling is the fact that the CDA's answer to a law that requires them to disclose basic information is that they want to get that law changed so they don't have to," Malloy said. "On the heels of criminal and civil investigations into the Rell Administration's fundraising operation, we now have a pathetic standard of public disclosure that paints a disturbing pattern of low ethical integrity in the Rell Administration. Simply put, the Governor and her administration are not walking the talk."
