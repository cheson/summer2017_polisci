Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement regarding the federal government shutdown.

"This morning, House Republicans failed to meet a most basic responsibility of a member of Congress: to fund the government operations and programs that they themselves have authorized. Consequently, the federal government has shut down and the American people are suffering the consequences. So, now, citizens of Connecticut who work for the federal government will not be paid, federal contractors will be laid off, new loans to Connecticut small businesses won't be made, and the list goes on and on. As much as we can, the state will work to mitigate the disruption caused by this wanton act of ideological excess.

"Again, I call on House Republicans to stop this irresponsible behavior and pass a clean continuing resolution that funds the government and increases the statutory debt cap. Then they should work with the President and the Senate towards a long-term, balanced and bipartisan plan that responsibly reduces the deficit while preserving our national priorities and ensures the creditworthiness of the United States. Yesterday the nation's governors sent a bipartisan letter to Congressional leaders to that effect. House Republicans would be wise heed our call made on behalf of all Americans."
