Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement in reaction to public protests regarding President Donald Trump's Executive Order entitled, Protection of the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States:
"I applaud those taking action today for seeking to give voice to fairness and compassion. I also applaud the swift legal action taken yesterday by the American Civil Liberty Union and other advocates on behalf of not just those directly impacted by this order, but on behalf of all Americans. This executive order conflicts with rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, and it must be contested in our courts. As a nation of immigrants, inclusivity and compassion are the hallmarks of who we are. We will not abandon our values. In the face of grave injustice, we will be neither silent nor idle, but stand ready to protect our neighbors and communities."
