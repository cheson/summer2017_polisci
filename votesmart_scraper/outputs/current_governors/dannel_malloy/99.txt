Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements today regarding the approval in the Connecticut General Assembly of an agreement announced in December that will aid the state in its efforts to fully fund pension obligations on a stable, predictable basis while continuing to support the state's retirement system:
Governor Malloy said, "This agreement was created to help put our state's finances on a path toward stability and predictability, which we need to create confidence and growth. That is why so many applauded the plan and urged its ratification when we announced it -- including the business community and national credit rating agencies. I am grateful for the legislators who took the time to review and support this agreement. It is a responsible approach that puts us in line with other states and strengthens confidence in the state's ability to resolve the unfunded liability."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "This is a good step toward building a budget that is both sustainable and honors our obligations to state employees. I applaud Governor Malloy, legislative leadership, and the unions for working together to find an agreement respects our realities. It honors the obligations made to state employees more than a decade ago and it addresses the very difficult fiscal situation that we face now. While we have more work to do, this is a very good beginning."
