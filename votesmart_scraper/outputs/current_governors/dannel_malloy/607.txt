Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding today's conviction of a University of New Haven student who pleaded guilty to importing a banned assault weapon and possession of two pistols while on campus in December 2013:

"Today's guilty plea brings an end to a potential tragedy that was prevented due to Connecticut's new gun safety laws.

"This individual imported a newly banned assault weapon into the state in violation of the new law. His weapon was a Bushmaster AR-15. His home and personal belongings contained news clippings on mass shootings -- the 2012 Aurora, Colorado theatre shooting in particular.

"Without the assistance of a citizen who saw something and said something, without the restrictions in the new gun law, and without the quick action of first responders at the University of New Haven and at the West Haven Police Department, December 3, 2013 might have been another tragic day in Connecticut's history. I congratulate the State's Attorney's Office in the Judicial District of Ansonia and Milford for a job well done."
