Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Last week low levels of radioactive material were found in rainwater in Massachusetts during routine testing that is conducted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Today, Governor Dannel P. Malloy informed Connecticut residents that officials here are continuing routine tests of rainwater in the state, and that radiation levels remain in the range that is normally seen.

"There have been a number of reports in the news about low levels of radiation found elsewhere in the country as a result of Japan's earthquake and subsequent tsunami and its effect on nuclear power plants there," said Governor Malloy. "But at this point, our routine testing shows no concern for public health. Even in other states where trace amounts of radiation have been detected, it's not at levels high enough to impact health and welfare. We will continue to be aware and alert while monitoring the situation."
