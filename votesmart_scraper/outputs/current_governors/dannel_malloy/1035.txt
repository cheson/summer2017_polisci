Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced small business owners impacted by Storm Sandy can now apply for federal relief funds online by visiting the "business" section of the state's CT Recovers website (ctrecovers.ct.gov).

"I've seen firsthand the devastation and lasting impact Storm Sandy has had on residents and businesses," said Governor Malloy. "This four million in federal funding will provide our businesses with the financial resources needed to continue the rebuilding process and put them on the road to full recovery."

In July, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Connecticut's action plan for disbursing $71.82 million, through HUD's Community Development Block Grant Program, to help residents, businesses and communities recover and rebuild after Storm Sandy. The state has allocated $4 million of the federal funding to support those small businesses that sustained damage or were impacted by the storm.

The EXP/Hurricane Sandy Disaster Relief Program, administered by the Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD), provides financial assistance to small businesses adversely affected by Hurricane Sandy, using a streamlined application process. It is open to small business located in Fairfield, New London, New Haven, and Middlesex counties and the Mashantucket Pequot tribal area.

Grants ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 are available. Eligible expenses are those not covered by insurance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or any other sources of funding. Specific work that is eligible includes:

Structural repair or replacement of damaged property;
