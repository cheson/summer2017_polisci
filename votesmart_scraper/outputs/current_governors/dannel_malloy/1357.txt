Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement on the negotiations between Connecticut Children's Medical Center and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield:

"These types of disputes have become all too common in our healthcare system. While I certainly understand the fiscal concerns that drive contractual negotiations like this one, when we're dealing with a facility like the Children's Medical Center, there is an added sense of urgency. The threat of disruption is particularly detrimental for the many people and children that rely on this facility for care, and in my opinion, mostly unnecessary.

"I urge both the Connecticut Children's Medical Center and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield to redouble their efforts at the negotiating table this weekend. They need to agree on a contract that will allow thousands of families to continue to have access to high quality healthcare."

The current contract between the parties expires this Sunday.
