Governor Dannel P. Malloy today applauded the Connecticut House of Representatives for approving legislation he introduced that will create a foundation to accept private donations in the immediate aftermath of an emergency and disseminate them as quickly as possible to victims in accordance with the donors' intent.

The foundation, called the Connecticut Coordinated Assistance and Recovery Endowment or CT CARE, will be operated by a governing board that has the ability to establish separate accounts restricted to each individual emergency, such as a natural disaster, act of terrorism, catastrophic event, or other unforeseen emergency. Governor Malloy explained that having a permanent infrastructure in place will allow the foundation to expedite assistance in a timely manner by not having to create a new arrangement each time an unforeseen emergency takes place, while also ensuring public oversight.

"Our state has unfortunately seen several different kinds of emergencies over the past couple of years and has been resilient in each one. Through each occurrence, we have seen people's generosity triumph over the harm that occurred," Governor Malloy said. "CT CARE will serve as a trusted repository for private donations -- an entity that will disseminate those funds to the victims in accordance with the intent of the donors."

While CT CARE will be governed by an independent board overseen by the State of Connecticut, the funds are not accessible to the state for any other use and are restricted to carry out the donor's intent.

The legislation is House Bill 6374 -- An Act Concerning Coordinated Long-Term Disaster Relief and Recovery.
