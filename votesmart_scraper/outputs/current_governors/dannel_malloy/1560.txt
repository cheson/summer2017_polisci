Press Release

Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that $40 million in previously allocated stimulus funding was released today to Connecticut. Governor Malloy spoke at length with U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood about this when they met last month. While the funding for high speed rail was previously allocated, if not actually released to Connecticut by April 8, the state would have lost the money altogether.

"There was a very clear deadline by which we needed to have these funds released, and I wasn't about to let $40 million in money for our state go somewhere else," said Governor Malloy. "When I spoke with Secretary LaHood, I made our state's case clearly and asked for his help cutting through the red tape to make sure that we got this money released to Connecticut by the deadline. I'd like to thank Secretary LaHood for his help on this matter, and I look forward to working with him closely on high speed rail and other transportation issues of import to the state."

"High-speed rail will open up a new world of economic opportunities for Connecticut," said Secretary LaHood. "The Administration's initial $40 million investment in upgrading the New Haven-Hartford-Springfield rail line will create jobs now and help ensure that in years to come, Connecticut residents will have access to world class high-speed rail service and economic opportunities throughout New England."

The $40 million in previously allocated funds will be used to double-track ten miles of existing track between Newington and Meriden, which is necessary for the full New Haven-to-Springfield rail line to move forward.
