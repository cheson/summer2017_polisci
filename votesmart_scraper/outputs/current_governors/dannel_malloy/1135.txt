Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy, joined by Department of Agriculture Commissioner Steven K. Reviczky, today announced $816,706 in competitive, matching grants to expand Connecticut's $3.5 billion agricultural industry. The investments are made through the Connecticut Department of Agriculture's Farm Transition Grant and Farm Viability Grant programs and will assist farms, agricultural nonprofits, and municipalities increase production, promote Connecticut Grown products, and create jobs.

"Connecticut's agricultural sector has enormous untapped potential," said Governor Malloy. "The investments we are announcing today in small farms and our Regional Market are a clear sign that we can both preserve our agricultural heritage and help it expand and create jobs."

Established in 2005, the grants protect and preserve Connecticut by supporting farm viability and preservation, agricultural infrastructure, municipal open space grants, historic preservation, and affordable housing programs. Funding is generated through a $40 fee collected for the recording of documents into municipal land records. These documents include deeds, mortgages, mechanics' liens, judgment liens, notices of lease, releases of mortgages and liens, name change certificates, notices of variances, and condominium declarations.

"These projects build upon the work and recommendations of the Governor's Council for Agricultural Development," said Commissioner Reviczky. "With feedback gathered over the past year from hundreds of farmers and associated stakeholders, the council has begun shaping a long-range, strategic plan that will vitalize Connecticut agriculture--in turn increasing its existing economic contribution and creating jobs. These matching grants will accelerate the achievement of those benefits for all state residents."

Grantees have one year to complete their projects and must match the award.

The Governor also announced that, at their next meeting, the State Bond Commission will vote on $400,000 in funding to assist the 1940s era Hartford Regional Market make essential roof repairs. The Regional Market is the largest perishable food distribution facility between Boston and New York, covering 32 acres and containing 230,386 square feet of warehouse space, an active railroad spur, and 144 farmers' market stalls. Authorized by state statute, it provides a central location for farmers and wholesalers to sell and distribute food and other agricultural products. The $617,100 roof repair project should be complete by the end of July and will not displace any vendors.
