Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding State Treasurer Denise L. Nappier's announcement this morning that the state's overall pensions and trust funds have reached an all-time high in asset value:

"This is great news and I want to commend Treasurer Nappier on her good work. Over the past three and a half years, we have cut the state's long-term obligations nearly $12 billion by reducing post-employment costs and increasing the state's contributions to the pension fund. Our actions, together with the Treasurer's investment strategy, have us on the path to get our long-term obligations under control."
