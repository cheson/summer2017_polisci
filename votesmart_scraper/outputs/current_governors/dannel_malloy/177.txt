Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements applauding the announcement made today by Defense Secretary Ash Carter that the Pentagon will lift the ban on transgender service members in the military.
Governor Malloy said, "It's another step towards a more equal America, another stride forward for fairness, and no doubt another commonsense action that demonstrates real progress. This is the morally right thing to do.
"If we are to be a nation of freedom and liberty, then we should not be a nation that precludes people from military service based on who they love or their gender identity. We should welcome all those who seek to wear the uniform instead of turning them away. We should celebrate military service instead of constructing arbitrary barriers to impede that service. We, as both a military and a society, should keep moving forwards instead of backwards.
"I want to applaud Defense Secretary Carter and President Obama on this important step. This is a meaningful day for many across the nation. Today's announcement reinforces the principle that all Americans deserve to be treated fairly and equally, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. It's a reminder of how far we've come on these issues - and also that we have more to do."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "This is an important step forward and better aligns our military with modern anti-discrimination policies that are in effect across our state and the nation. We are proud of all the men and women who serve our country and recognize the many sacrifices they make for all of us. I applaud Secretary Carter on this decision that will make our military more inclusive, reflective of our values, and stronger."
Earlier this month, Governor Malloy signed into law a bill he introduced to update the anti-discrimination statutes for the Connecticut Military Department to align them with recent policy changes in the U.S. military. The new law expands the guidelines to include religion, national origin, color, race, sex, gender identity or expression, and sexual orientation.
As LGBT pride month continues, the Governor is flying the pride flag outside of the Governor's Residence in Hartford.
