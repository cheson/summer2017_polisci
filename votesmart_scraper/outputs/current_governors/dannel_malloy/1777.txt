FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MALLOY AGAIN CALLS ON RELL TO HAVE HER ETHICS CZAR CONDUCT AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO TOP AIDE'S APPARENT VIOLATION OF ELECTION LAW
Democratic Candidate for Governor Dan Malloy, Stamford's Mayor, today again said that Governor Rell should order her "Ethics Czar," Rachel Rubin, to conduct an investigation of the apparent ethics violation by Rell's Chief of Staff. Malloy first made this suggestion yesterday, the same day that Rell's Chief of Staff admitted asking commissioners and deputy commissioners to raise campaign finance funds, despite the fact that they are barred by state statute from doing so.
"The Ethics Czar was appointed for this very reason: to make sure the Governor's office follows the letter and spirit of the law," said Malloy. "So, if the position of Ethics Czar is to mean anything at all, then the course of action is clear: the Governor should ask her Ethics Czar, immediately, to undertake an ethics investigation. If she doesn't, then it suggests that this appointment was nothing more than a public relations stunt. And if it was that, it's failed - miserably."
Malloy added that "When the State Police have an internal problem, they turn to Internal Affairs. Why isn't the Governor turning to her equivalent of Internal Affairs?"
