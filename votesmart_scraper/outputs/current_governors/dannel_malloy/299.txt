Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that he is directing U.S. and state flags in Connecticut to remain at half-staff on Monday, December 7, 2015, in recognition of Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. The national observance honors the lives lost in the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.
Governor Malloy said, "On this day, we recognize the extraordinary sacrifices of all who served in Pearl Harbor nearly 75 years ago, in addition to the over 2,400 people - both military and civilian - who lost their lives in the attack. This day of remembrance is also an opportunity to thank all of those who served our country during World War II, courageously responding to the call of duty. We are grateful to all who serve in our military to protect our freedoms and stand up for democracy."
