Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement on the 41st annual Earth Day:

"The first Earth Day in 1970 began a global movement towards recognizing our responsibility to the environment and understanding our role in caring for our natural space. Through education, leadership in public policy, and good citizenship we are moving toward ecological sustainability and will be better prepared to hand future generations a cleaner, safer planet. Only a year ago, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico offered a stark reminder about just how fragile our ecosystem is, and how important its health is to the economy. Earth Day is a great opportunity to celebrate our planet--and reminds us to keep doing the work necessary to keep it strong."
