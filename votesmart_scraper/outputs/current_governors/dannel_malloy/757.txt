Governor Dannel P. Malloy, Attorney General George Jepsen, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, and U.S. Representatives Rosa DeLauro, John Larson, Joe Courtney, Jim Himes and Elizabeth Esty, today released the following joint statement regarding the proposed revisions to tribal recognition rules:

"Today, the U.S. Department of the Interior released a new draft of a proposed regulation governing federal tribal recognition standards. We appreciate the Obama Administration's willingness to engage in a discussion of the concerns we have raised over the past nine months, and its latest revisions are a step in the right direction. However, we believe additional changes and clarifications are necessary to ensure that Connecticut's interests are protected, and we will continue to work for their inclusion."
