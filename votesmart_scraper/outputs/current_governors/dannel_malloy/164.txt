Gov. Malloy Statement on NBA All-Star Game
Press Release
By: Dan Malloy
Date: July 21, 2016
Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy today released the following statement on the NBA's potentially moving the 2017 All-Star game from Charlotte, NC in response to its HB2 legislation:
"Discrimination in any form shouldn't be rewarded. That's why our travel ban remains in place. The law should be repealed, so the people of North Carolina aren't punished because their elected leaders pass and celebrate backwards legislation," Governor Malloy said. "Here in Connecticut, we have led on these issues because we believe in progress, and we believe in standing up for the LGBTQ community. I have said and continue to say that any businesses, residents, or events should relocate to our state if they are negatively impacted by discriminatory legislation."
The past March, Governor Malloy signed an executive order banning state-funded travel to North Carolina. That ban remains in place.
