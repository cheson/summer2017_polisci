Governor Dannel P. Malloy released the following statement regarding the final legislative passage today of Senate Bill 837, An Act Concerning the Department on Aging. The State Department on Aging (SDA) will ensure that Connecticut's seniors have access to the supportive services necessary to live with dignity, security, and independence.

"With the senior population expected to grow in Connecticut, it is imperative that we have an office that can coordinate programs, services, and care for these residents," Governor Malloy said. "Under the leadership of Commissioner Edith Prague, the Department on Aging will better protect our seniors, improve the quality of care provided in nursing homes and residential care, and assist older residents in accessing the programs and services they need."

The SDA will be responsible for administering a variety of federally-funded programs under the Older American's Act. All appropriate functions, programs, and duties within the Department of Social Services' State Unit on Aging and Office of Long Term Care Ombudsman will be transferred to SDA.
