Gov. Malloy's General Counsel on D-SNAP Expedited Arbitration Hearings
Statement
By: Dan Malloy
Date: July 24, 2012
Location: Hartford, CT

There were 27 expedited arbitration hearings held on Friday, July 20. Assuming Mr. Rochlin received a copy of these decisions, and his reporting of them is accurate (which is not guaranteed since he claims there were 40), Andrew J. McDonald, General Counsel to Governor Dannel P. Malloy, issues the following statement:

"All of the arbitrator's decisions confirmed that the decision of the Governor to have these matters investigated was correct, and the arbitrator has agreed with the Governor's position that these employees are guilty of substantial misconduct. The arbitrator has also agreed that the state employees' misconduct merits significant sanctions, imposing severe economic punishments of up to 12 weeks of lost wages. While some of these employees still have their jobs, they have forfeited almost 25% of their salary. It's hard to see how this can be characterized as a "win.'"
