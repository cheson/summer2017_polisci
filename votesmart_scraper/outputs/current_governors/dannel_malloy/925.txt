Location: Hartford, CT

Governor Dannel P. Malloy issued the following statement in response to consensus revenue estimates released on Wednesday afternoon by the General Assembly's Office of Fiscal Analysis and the state Office of Policy and Management:

"To go from a record-setting $3.6 billion deficit to a surplus of nearly $500 million in three years is an extraordinary achievement, and speaks to the commitment of this administration to hold the line on spending, while at the same time making smart investments in public education and job creation. There's much work to do, but make no mistake: our economy is improving, private sector jobs are growing at the strongest pace in decades, and we are reducing the state's overall indebtedness. And we are accomplishing all of this at the same time we are putting money away in the rainy day fund. That's a record to be proud of."
