Governor Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman released the following statements following a vote in the Connecticut House of Representatives this evening approving the Governor's legislation that protects victims of domestic violence. The bill prohibits the possession of firearms for anyone who becomes subject to a temporary restraining order.
Governor Malloy said, "This is a commonsense step forward to strengthen and enhance our gun violence prevention laws. We must protect domestic violence victims - we have a moral obligation to work to prevent needless tragedy. We know that the period of time immediately following a temporary restraining order is critical. Clearly, access to a firearm in that situation can only increase the chances that something tragic might happen. This is about standing up and acting. I want to thank Judiciary Committee co-chair State Representative William Tong, State Representative Caroline Simmons, State Representative Robyn Porter, and everyone in the House who voted today for this bill."
Lt. Governor Wyman said, "I applaud the House on passage of this bill - it will save lives. Every year in Connecticut, women are killed in domestic violence incidents. This legislation is a common sense step to help protect those victims during the most dangerous times in their lives - when they get a temporary restraining order. I urge the Senate to pass this bill and ensure Connecticut is among the many other states working to protect victims of family violence."
The legislation is House Bill 5054, An Act Protecting Victims of Domestic Violence. It next heads to the State Senate for consideration.
