Governor Dannel P. Malloy today joined lawmakers, state officials and advocates for a bill signing ceremony to commemorate the final passage into law of the "Second Chance Society" legislation the Governor introduced earlier this year. The package of initiatives is designed to continue the progress being made in reducing the state's dropping crime rate, which is at a 48-year low, as well as ensuring nonviolent offenders are successfully reintegrated into society and become productive workers in Connecticut's economy.
The legislation was approved late last month with a strong bipartisan vote in both chambers of the General Assembly.
"By signing this legislation into law, we are making real, systematic change to our state's crime fighting strategy. We can truly be tough on crime by being smart on crime," Governor Malloy said. "The cycle our system currently encourages - one of permanent punishment - hurts too many families and communities. When we should have been focusing on permanent reform, we focused on permanent punishment. For too long, we built modern jails instead of modern schools. Because this bill passed, Connecticut has taken a giant step into the future."
The Governor added, "Our law enforcement professionals and courts can focus on lowering crime even further by channeling efforts towards serious, violent criminals and putting them behind bars for longer sentences. And most of all, these initiatives are focused on turning nonviolent offenders into productive members of our society that can contribute to our economy, rather than drain it. Ultimately, this will make our communities safer, and will make for a brighter tomorrow in Connecticut."
Governor Malloy noted that the initiatives are similar to criminal justice policies being implemented in states throughout the country - both red and blue - and are supported by elected officials on both sides of the aisle.
Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman said, "This legislation represents a new era in smarter criminal justice policy - initiatives we know are effective at driving down crime, keeping our neighborhoods safer, and ensuring ex-offenders become participants in our economy and assets in our communities."
