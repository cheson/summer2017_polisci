A first round of state grants will go to seven communities hit hard by Hurricane Mathew to repair water and sewer systems, improve drainage and rebuild a local airport, Governor Cooper announced Tuesday.
Also this week, North Carolina begins to seek public comment on the state's Action Plan to use $198.5 million in its initial allocation of federal Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funds. Governor Cooper wants the funds to help communities in eastern North Carolina address critical housing and economic development needs.
"North Carolina is working to help communities impacted by Hurricane Matthew rebuild even stronger and better than before," Gov. Cooper said. "We still have a long way to go before those devastated by the storm are whole again but these grants and this action plan are key steps to get us there."
The CDBG-DR Action Plan will direct the state's recovery for the initial federal funding awarded in January; Cooper plans to ask Congress for additional funds now that damage assessments have been compiled across all 50 disaster-affected counties.
