As Governor, I will fight to:
Reinstate same-day voter registration
Extend early voting from 10 to 17 days
Allow for online voter registration
Rollback voter ID and pass laws that encourage voting
Governor McCrory is making it harder for people to register and vote when we should be making it easier. I will work to expand voter opportunities and create a non-partisan Redistricting Commission to make voting districts fair and competitive.
