Gov. Pat McCrory defended a law striking down a local LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance as a move against government intrusion Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press.
Speaker: Gov. Pat McCrory
Statement: "The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private-sector employer in Charlotte, N.C."
Ruling: The city did pass an ordinance that applied to many businesses, but not all of them. It only covered places of public accommodation. We rate this claim Mostly False.
