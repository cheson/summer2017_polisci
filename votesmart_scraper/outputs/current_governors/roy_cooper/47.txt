Governor Roy Cooper has recommended eight community and regional projects in Western North Carolina for Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) funding. The recommendations total more than $3 million in ARC funds.
"The Appalachian Regional Commission is a longtime, valued partner in regional economic development for our state," said Governor Cooper. "From enhancing STEM education to improving broadband access, these projects support jobs and local businesses in communities across Western North Carolina."
The North Carolina ARC program, part of NC Commerce, makes an initial review of funding requests in order to assure consistency with state and federal guidelines. Final recommendations are formally made by Governor Cooper. Then ARC makes the final decision on the grant recipients which will be announced later this year.
Governor Cooper recommended the following applicants and projects:
Town of Blowing Rock - $10,000 ARC grant request
Funds would be used to expand the town's Wi-Fi network to cover the entire downtown business district off Sunset Drive. It will serve 10 businesses.
Blue Ridge National Heritage Area - $90,000 ARC grant request
Funds would be used to plan, develop and implement the Blue Ridge Craft Trails. This relaunch of the Handmade in America craft trails would focus on supporting the crafters with accessing markets online. This project will result in improving 75 businesses.
