Governor Cooper Issues Statement in Support of Proposal to Raise the Age
Statement

Location: Raleigh, NC

Today, Governor Cooper issued a statement in support of a proposal to raise the age:
Law enforcement, the courts and experts on juveniles agree that raising the age makes sense for North Carolina, and that's why my budget includes initial investments to make this happen. Raising the age can actually save North Carolina money in the long run if juvenile justice needs are adequately funded, and it makes communities safer by giving young people an opportunity to turn away from a life of crime. I believe we can find common ground across political lines to raise the age and make progress for North Carolina.
