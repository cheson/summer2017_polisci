Governor Cooper released the following statement on the North Carolina House budget:
"This budget shortchanges our future at a time when we don't have to. As our economy rebounds, we must invest in our people to create good new jobs and more opportunities for middle class families. This budget misses huge opportunities to spur economic development and help North Carolinians learn the skills they need to succeed in the workforce."
