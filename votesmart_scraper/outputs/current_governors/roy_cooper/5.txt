Location: Raleigh, NC

Governor Cooper released the following comment on the state's need for new maps and early elections:
"North Carolina shouldn't hold another session or have another budget voted on by an unconstitutional legislature. Maps should be drawn this month and an election held before next year's legislative session. If the legislature doesn't do its job soon the courts should."
