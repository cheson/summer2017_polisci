Governor Cooper Comments on Senate Health Care Bill
Statement
By: Roy Cooper III
Date: June 22, 2017
Location: Raleigh, NC

Governor Cooper released the following comment on health care legislation introduced by U.S. Senate Republicans today:
"Health care should be affordable and accessible but this new Senate plan, like the House bill before it, does the opposite. As I said at last week's White House Opioid Commission meeting, taking away health care from millions of people hurts our battle against the opioid crisis. This Senate plan especially hurts children, seniors and the disabled and it dumps more of the cost of health care on state taxpayers. North Carolina's senators should oppose it."
