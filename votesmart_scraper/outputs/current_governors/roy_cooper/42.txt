Governor Roy Cooper today announced a multi-year investment in North Carolina teachers that would raise teacher salaries to first in the Southeast in three years and at least the national average in five years. Cooper's plan includes a 5% raise this year and another 5% the next year. This is the largest two-year investment in North Carolina teacher salaries in the last decade.
"These aren't just investments in our teachers, they are lasting investments in our economy and in our own children's future," said Governor Cooper. "Education is part of North Carolina's legacy, but recently we've fallen behind. My proposal is a serious, multi-year increase in teacher salaries that will get us to the national average so we can show our teachers the respect they deserve."
Cooper's proposal would bring average salaries to more than $52,000 in 2017-2018 and nearly $55,000 in 2018-2019.The budget proposal would also give teachers a direct annual stipend of $150 to offset out-of-pocket expenses for classroom supplies since many teachers stretch their already tight budgets to pay for basic classroom supplies themselves.
Governor Cooper's plan to raise North Carolina teacher salaries will be included in the Governor's budget to the legislature, which he plans to release in full in the coming weeks.
