By: Roy Cooper III
Date: June 5, 2017
Location: Raleigh, NC

Governor Cooper released the following statement on the Supreme Court decision striking down gerrymandered legislative districts in North Carolina:
"Whether the election is November 2018 or earlier, redrawing the districts is good for our democracy by leveling the playing field for free and fair elections. The people should be able to choose their representatives in competitive districts instead of the representatives being able to choose the people in lopsided, partisan districts."
