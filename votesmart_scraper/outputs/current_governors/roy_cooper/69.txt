North Carolinians should be able to get a doctor's help when they need it without breaking the bank. I am appalled by North Carolina's failure to expand Medicaid to its neediest residents, especially when our tax dollars are already going to pay for it in other states. Republican governors nationwide have said yes to health care for the working poor, why not North Carolina?
I remain concerned about the rising cost of health care and the consolidation of health care providers across our state, especially in underserved areas. Expanding Medicaid would give us more providers and an economic boost from jobs.
But what we shouldn't do is walk away from successful provider groups like NC Community Cares, which economizes and prioritizes care for Medicaid eligible recipients. Turning to MCOs is a risky move, which has had questionable results in other states, and I have concerns about their safeguards for patients and taxpayers.
While North Carolina alone can't solve the problem of rising healthcare costs, I worked with legislators to restore some fairness for consumers in 2013. The ideas include multiple reforms to hospital collection practices that help consumers, giving patients more time to request an itemized health care bill, requiring that bills be written in easy-to-understand language, requiring providers to verify whether they are in a patient's insurance network, requiring health care facilities to give refunds for billing errors within 60 days, and prohibiting hospitals from charging patients for services that would have been covered by an insurance plan if the hospital submitted paperwork on time.
