Governor Cooper Signs Bill Strengthening Rainy Day Fund
Statement
By: Roy Cooper III
Date: April 13, 2017
Location: Raleigh, NC

Today, Governor Roy Cooper signed into law House Bill 7, An Act to Strengthen the Savings Reserve, as Recommended by the Legislative Research Commission.
Governor Cooper shared the following statement on the bill signing:
"Today I signed HB 7 that saves 15 percent of each year's tax revenue growth for the state's rainy day fund. The budget I proposed saves even more than this for the rainy day fund. However, I caution lawmakers that bills like this combined with others could ultimately hurt efforts to give tax breaks to middle class families and to invest in schools and economic development."
