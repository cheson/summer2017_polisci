Statement
By: Roy Cooper III

Location: Raleigh, NC

Governor Roy Cooper issued the following statement on the recent Presidential executive order:
The executive order issued by the President will make our homeland and our troops serving overseas less safe. Our vetting process has to be tough and thorough, but we should not impose a religious test to enter the country. It's especially troubling that individuals who risked their lives to protect our troops and served alongside them are now being turned away. We can secure the safety of our country without separating families, hurting our businesses, and turning away good people who need our help.
