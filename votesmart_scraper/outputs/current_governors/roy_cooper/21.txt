Senate GOP Cut Food Assistance for Families and Children
Statement
By: Roy Cooper III

Location: Raleigh, NC

Senate Republicans quietly inserted a provision in their budget to cut SNAP food assistance benefits for 133,000 North Carolinians last week, including 51,000 children.

The cuts were not debated or mentioned by Republican leaders, and would not save the state any money, as the food assistance program is 100% federally funded. The cuts are also expected to cause many students from low-income families to lose free and reduced lunch eligibility.

Governor Cooper issued the following statement:

"In addition to giving millionaires tax breaks 60 times larger than middle class families, Senate Republicans quietly slipped a provision in their budget to cut 100% federally-funded food-stamps for 133,000 North Carolinians. This includes 51,000 children, many of whose free or reduced lunch status is jeopardized with this action. This food makes a real difference for families who need it and doesn't cost North Carolina any state tax money. Lining the pockets of millionaires while going out of the way to make it harder for children to eat is just wrong."
