Governor Cooper Shares Statement on White House Budget Proposal
Statement

Governor Cooper shared the following statement on the White House's 2018 budget proposal:
"I'm working every day to help our people become better educated, healthier, and have more money in their pockets. The President's proposed budget would have a harmful effect on that goal -- gutting healthcare for millions of working people who need it including many susceptible to the opioid crisis, robbing public schools while making college more expensive, and damaging our ability to respond to natural disasters. After the North Carolina Senate budget cruelly eliminated food assistance for tens of thousands of kids and seniors, the cuts in the federal budget would make the problem worse."
"After the Trump Administration funded just $6 million of our $930 million request for additional federal funds to recover from Hurricane Matthew, I'm particularly dismayed to learn that the proposed budget begins to eliminate federal flood insurance and limits disaster relief funding. This budget amounts to a second punch in the gut from this administration when it comes to helping our communities prepare for and respond to natural disasters, and I urge Congress to take a more reasonable approach."
