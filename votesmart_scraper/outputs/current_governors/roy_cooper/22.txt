Gov. Cooper Issues Statement on SCOTUS Voter Access Decision
Statement
By: Roy Cooper III
Date: May 15, 2017
Location: Raleigh, NC

Today, Governor Cooper responded to the Supreme Court's decision not to reinstate the voting restrictions law overturned in federal court last year:
"Today's announcement is good news for North Carolina voters. We need to be making it easier to vote, not harder -- and the Court found this law sought to discriminate against African-American voters with "surgical precision." I will continue to work to protect the right of every legal, registered North Carolinian to participate in our democratic process. "
In February, Governor Cooper and Attorney General Stein moved to end the case by withdrawing the state's petition for appeal to the Supreme Court.
