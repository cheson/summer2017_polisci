Press Release

Location: Raleigh, NC

Governor Roy Cooper today released his recommended budget for 2017-2019, Common Ground Solutions for NC, to invest in a better educated, healthier and more prosperous North Carolina without raising taxes or fees.
"As our economy recovers, we need to invest with an eye toward the future," Governor Cooper said. "By bringing common ground solutions front and center, North Carolina's economy can grow strong. Today I present a budget that I believe will get us there."
Governor Cooper's budget makes critical investments in education, health care, economic development and public safety, positioning North Carolina to become a top ten educated state, with healthier and safer communities and growing middle class paychecks.
The budget achieves these goals without raising taxes or fees, cutting services, or borrowing from special funds. It maintains North Carolina's Triple A bond rating with responsible fiscal management including an investment of $300 million in the state's Rainy Day Fund. It offers relief to middle class families by restoring the state's Child and Dependent Care tax credit.
"These goals don't come with party labels," Governor Cooper said. "They're universal and bipartisan, and I'm ready to work with legislative leaders to accomplish them."
Raise Teacher Pay
Governor Cooper's budget puts North Carolina on a path to lead all southeastern states in teacher pay in three years and reach the national average in five years. His budget calls for an additional $271 million each of the next two years to raise teacher salaries, the largest investment in teacher pay in a decade. That equates to a more than 5% average increase for teachers in 2017-18 and 2018-19. For more about teacher pay, click here.
