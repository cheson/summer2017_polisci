Statement
By: Roy Cooper III
Date: May 4, 2017
Location: Raleigh, NC

Governor Cooper issued the following statement on the health care bill passed today in Washington by House Republicans:
"Under the House Republican health care bill, 24 million Americans would lose their health coverage, costs for seniors would go up, and people with pre-existing conditions would no longer be protected. That's wrong, and I strongly urge our state's two U.S. Senators to stand up and fight for hard-working North Carolina families who just want to keep their health insurance."
