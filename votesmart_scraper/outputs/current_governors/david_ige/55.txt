Statement
By: David Ige
Date: June 12, 2016
Location: Honolulu, HI

By order of Governor David Ige, the United States flag and the Hawai"i state flag will be flown at half-staff at the State Capitol and upon all state offices and agencies as well as the Hawai"i National Guard in the State of Hawai"i until sunset, June 16, 2016. This action is to honor the victims of the terrible attack that occurred last night in Orlando, Florida.
"We see on the news today yet another horrific instance of man's inhumanity to man, triggered by the fear of differences. Let us reject fear and hostility. Let us embrace diversity. Let us affirm life," said Gov. Ige.
"Hawaii has some of the toughest laws regulating gun ownership in the nation. This presumed act of terror is a reminder that we cannot become complacent. We must do all that we can to ensure the public's safety."
