Governor Signs Proclamation Extending Emergency Period for Puna Lava Flow
By: David Ige
Date: March 3, 2015
Location: Honolulu, HI

Gov. David Ige signed a supplemental emergency proclamation yesterday, Mar. 2, 2015. The supplemental proclamation extends the emergency period for the lava flow that threatens the Puna district on Hawaii Island.
"The state stands ready to support Hawaii County in its response to the lava flow," said Gov. Ige. "This extension of the emergency proclamation aids current monitoring and response and recovery efforts. The lava isn't going to just go away and we need to work together to ensure the community's health and safety."
The extension suspends certain laws as needed for emergency purposes. Copy of the proclamation text can be found at http://www.scd.hawaii.gov/Proclamations.htm.
A request to expand the Presidential Disaster Declaration to include debris removal and permanent work to repair eligible government and private non-profit infrastructure damaged by the lava flow was submitted in early February.
