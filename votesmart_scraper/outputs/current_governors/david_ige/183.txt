The Ige Administration will support our growing senior population and their families. By 2030 nearly 25 percent of Hawaiʻi's population will be 65 years of age or older. Hawaiʻi has the fastest growing senior population in the country so we must start now to ensure we are prepared to meet the needs of older persons. We will seek to help kupuna remain as independent as possible so they can continue to live in their homes rather than in an institution. This will enable our kupuna to age in place with dignity, and with love and support from their families and communities.
Hawaiʻi is rooted in caring. We cherish our kupuna and value all that they have given us. They have laid the groundwork for what we have and have been able to achieve today. They have modeled honesty, trust, and pride of work that forms the foundation of our culture. We owe them our gratitude, and we will demonstrate that with action.
Seniors' Action Plan:
* The 2014 Legislature provided $9 million for Kupuna Care -- double the amount requested by the Governor -- but this does not meet the huge demand for services, like meal delivery, transportation, and respite services for caregivers. Legislation enacted this year expands eligibility for Kupuna Care to Medicaid recipients, although Medicaid recipients already qualify for similar services, and expanding eligibility makes a small pot of money even smaller. As Governor, I will propose legislation that ensures Medicaid recipients receive services equivalent to those available through Kupuna Care.
* My family is among the quarter-million family caregivers in Hawaiʻi, as we are looking after my mother. One of the major shortcomings in our health system is the lack of training for caregivers when their loved ones are discharged from the hospital. It makes common sense and also financial sense, because when patients have to return to hospitals soon after their discharge because of failure of caregivers to adequately tend to their needs, hospitals are penalized by Medicare. Unlike our present governor, I will propose -- and actively lobby for -- legislation to provide caregivers with needed training to care for their loved ones when they are discharged from hospitals
* Expedite establishing Aging and Disability Resource Centers in each county. These centers provide kupuna and their families with a single point of entry to receive information about long-term care provided by a multitude of agencies, public and private
* Work with the City and County of Honolulu -- and eventually other counties -- along with the AARP to help Hawaiʻi become the first age-friendly state in the nation by meeting guidelines established by the World Health Organization (WHO) on outdoor spaces and buildings, transportation, housing, social participation, social inclusion, and health services.
* Coordinate acute medical care with long-term care so that there is collaboration and coordination of both systems.
My track record: To address challenges faced by our seniors and their families, I supported the following bills that are now in law:
* Act 241, which requires the State Department of Human Services to apply to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to allow Medicaid funds for nursing home care to be used for care to remain at home
* Act 93, which formally established the Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman to resolve long-term care issues.
* Act 11, which extended the joint legislative committee on family caregiving and expanded its responsibilities.
