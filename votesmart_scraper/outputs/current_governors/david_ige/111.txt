Gov. David Ige today announced the release of more than $40 million for the state's capital improvements program (CIP) that will be administered by various state departments and agencies.
"Building a Hawai"i we are proud to call home requires us to maintain and improve state facilities. These priority projects are investments that will boost our economy and better serve Hawai"i's people.
"Funds spent now to repair and maintain the state's housing facilities and schools will reduce project backlogs and prevent the maintenance requirements from becoming more significant in the coming years. More importantly, they will support families and children allowing them to thrive.
"The airport projects will enhance the operation and safety of the major gateways to our islands, and the highway improvements are necessary for the safety of all who travel on our roadways. Airports and highways must be maintained not only for our residents, but, also, for our visitors, as they are the welcoming face to our islands state and help support Hawai"i's economic vitality," said Gov. Ige.
