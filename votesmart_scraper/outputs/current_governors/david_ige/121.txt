News Release: Governor Ige Signs Emergency Rule for Mauna Kea
Statement
By: David Ige
Date: July 14, 2015
Location: Honolulu, HI

"Today I signed the Land Board's emergency rule limiting usage of the road between the hours of 10 pm and 4 am. The rule is in effect for 120 days only and gives the state an additional tool to keep the road safe for all. My administration believes firmly in the right of free expression. At the same time we cannot let some people put others at risk of harm or property damage. This temporary rule helps strike that balance. I respectfully ask everyone using the road to exercise caution and obey the law."
