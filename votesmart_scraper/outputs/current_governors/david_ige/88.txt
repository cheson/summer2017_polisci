Governor Ige Calls for Safe Access to Summit of Mauna Kea
Statement
By: David Ige
Date: Nov. 17, 2015
Location: Honolulu, HI

Gov. David Ige today released the following statement about the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) team's plan to repair equipment already on Mauna Kea and re-secure the site this month:
"The maintenance and equipment repair work TMT plans to undertake will protect the environment and enhance public safety as we head into the winter season. This is not the start of construction of the telescope.
"As governor, I am committed to upholding the law and providing safe access for those who need to get to the summit of Mauna Kea, and that includes those involved with the TMT project. Our primary concern is for the safety of all.
"If this work is stopped, it is not a victory. It will harm the environment. If there is violence, as some have suggested, that is not a victory. We are one community and we must continue to search for a resolution that will keep this community together."
