News Release: Governor David Ige Applauds United States Supreme Court Ruling on Marriage Equality
Statement
By: David Ige
Date: June 26, 2015
Location: Honolulu, HI

Governor David Ige released the following statement after the United States Supreme Court announced its historic decision that same-sex couples have the right to marry.
"In 1993 Hawai"i galvanized the national conversation on the right of same-sex couples to marry. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that "the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.' I was proud to be part of that arc when I voted for marriage equality in Hawai"i in 2013 as a State Senator. Hawai"i has truly led the way. Now more Americans than ever support marriage equality and our nation's highest court has affirmed that it is a fundamental right for all Americans. This is a great day for Hawai"i and for our country. I echo President Obama's words this morning when he said that "we have made our union a little more perfect.'"
