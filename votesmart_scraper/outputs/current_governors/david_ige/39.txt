Governor's Office: Governor Ige's Statement on the Veto Override of SB 2077
Press Release
By: David Ige
Date: July 20, 2016
Location: Honolulu, HI

Our primary concern is and always has been the health and well-being of Maui's residents and visitors as we work to privatize Maui region hospitals.
We are committed to a successful transfer and transition to a new Maui health care system for all stakeholders, which includes our employees.
However, this transaction must be done correctly for the common good. The concerns expressed in my veto message have not changed. Three areas of concern remain:
The bill jeopardizes the Employees Retirement System's tax exempt status.
The bill does not appropriate funds for lump-sum cash payments for affected employees.
The bill adds an additional unfunded liability of about $17.2 million to the ERS and $18.4 million to the Employer Union Benefits Trust Fund (EUTF). This puts the state's long-term financial position, along with its bond ratings in jeopardy. Bond ratings determine what the state pays in interest on borrowed funds.
The next steps for my administration include:
Conferring with the attorney general to assess and evaluate the impact of the veto override.
