The Department of Human Services (DHS) is pleased to announce that Judy Mohr Peterson, Ph.D., will join the department as the new Med-QUEST Division (MQD) Administrator. Dr. Mohr Peterson is a nationally-recognized leader in Medicaid, health care transformation and Affordable Care Act implementation.
Dr. Mohr Peterson begins work on July 1, 2015 and will bring 18 years of public health care experience to Hawaii. She has served as Oregon's State Medicaid Director since September 2009 and in that role was an architect of Oregon's successful health system transformation and coverage expansion. During her tenure, local community and primary care increased through coordinated care organizations, which reduced emergency department visits and hospitalizations for chronic conditions for Medicaid clients. Oregon also began publicly reporting on health disparities, believing that is the first step to reducing those disparities and improving health for everyone.
"Dr. Peterson's leadership as Medicaid director in Oregon is ideal for Hawaii as we consider innovations within our own Medicaid programs," says Governor David Y. Ige. "I expect she will work closely with DHS Director Rachael Wong to reshape the culture of government and improve services for our keiki, kupuna, and all Hawaii people."
Throughout her career, Mohr Peterson's work has focused on improving care for people who need it the most. Using the tools available as a major health care purchaser in Oregon, she brought physical, mental and dental services together in a way that puts patients at the center of care.
"I'm excited that Judy is joining the DHS team," says Director Rachael Wong, DrPH. "She brings with her the experience, expertise and passion that align with my vision for the Department and the Med-QUEST Division."
