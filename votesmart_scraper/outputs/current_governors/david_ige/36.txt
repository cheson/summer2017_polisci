Gov. David Ige announced that the Section 8 waiting list is opening on O"ahu for the first time in 10 years. There is currently no one on the waiting list, which will reopen on Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016 for families under the first tier of preferences which includes homeless individuals and families, victims of domestic violence, and families involuntarily displaced. More than 8,000 people have found housing through this program in the last decade.
"We know that affordable housing is the primary concern for many families in our state," Gov. Ige said. "Today's announcement shows progress and confirms there is movement through the system."
The state has worked diligently to increase access to housing by establishing an online application process. It estimates that approximately 12,000 new applications will be accepted before the list closes at midnight on Aug. 18, 2016. Applicants are strongly encouraged to work with homeless service providers to access the online application portal.
Hawai"i Public Housing Authority Executive Director Hakim Ouansafi acknowledged Hawai"i's landlords who make their properties available to Section 8 renters. There are currently more than a thousand landlords participating in the program, a 375 percent increase over the last decade. "Each landlord provides more than a home to a local family," said Ouansafi. "Landlords who open their properties to Section 8 renters provide the stability families need to thrive in our community. Applying for Section 8 has never been more convenient. Now applicants can even submit their online application from their mobile devices."
