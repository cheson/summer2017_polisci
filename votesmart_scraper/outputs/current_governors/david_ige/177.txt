Our campaign has demonstrated that we are committed to a positive vision for Hawaii and our advertisements reflect this positive message of competence, hope, and change. The Ige campaign did not run negative ads in the primary against Governor Abercrombie and the Ige-Tsutsui campaign will not run negative ads against our General Election opponents.
Under federal law, independent groups are allowed to produce advertisements for and against candidates. We have no control over these ads and are prohibited from collaborating or communicating with these groups on the content of these ads.
