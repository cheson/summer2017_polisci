Press Release
By: David Ige
Date: April 10, 2015
Location: Honolulu, HI

Governor David Ige this afternoon signed a proclamation authorizing the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) to begin emergency highway repair work on Kamehameha Highway in Kaʻaʻawa between the Makaua Village condominium and the Crouching Lion Inn. These repairs will include restoration of the highway foundation and pavement surface and stabilization of an adjacent retaining wall at an estimated cost of $3 million.
A public informational meeting will be scheduled to discuss the emergency repairs with the community and collect public input. Time and location details will be publicized as soon as they are finalized.
"Reconstruction of the highway foundation is necessary to maintain public safety for our residents and visitors," said Governor Ige. "An average of 11,000 vehicles pass through this area daily. These emergency repairs will help to ensure access to and from North Shore communities remains open."
Construction is expected to begin in April and last approximately three months. Daily work schedules will be dependent on the final design. An archaeological monitor will be on-site during the excavation and trenching process.
