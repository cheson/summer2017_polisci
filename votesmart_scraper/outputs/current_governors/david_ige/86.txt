Hawai"i Health Connector Board to Accelerate Transition to State Authority

The Executive Committee of the Hawai"i Health Connector (the Connector) voted on Thursday, November 19 to recommend to its Board of Directors to accelerate the transition of remaining functions of the Connector to state authority. The Connector's ongoing financial challenges have forced the state to accelerate the transition beginning December 1, 2015. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determined that Hawai"i was not in compliance with certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). One of the provisions required the Connector to be financially self-sustaining beginning Jan. 1, 2015.
This open enrollment is for Hawai"i residents not eligible for health insurance through their employer or not enrolled in a government insurance program. Individuals seeking insurance are encouraged to enroll by Dec. 15 to ensure that their coverage begins on Jan 1, 2016. Individuals who are currently enrolled in ACA plans will need to re-enroll through healthcare.gov.
"Through the leadership of several members of my cabinet, including Directors Rachael Wong, Linda Chu Takayama, Catherine Awakuni Colon, Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito, and Chief Innovation Officer Todd Nacapuy, the state has collaborated with federal officials to facilitate this transition so that we can work toward restoring compliance with ACA. I especially appreciate the diligence of the Connector's volunteer board of directors and the support of Sen. Roz Baker and Rep. Della Belatti," said Gov. David Ige.
