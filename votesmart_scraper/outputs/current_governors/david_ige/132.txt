By Chief of Staff Mike McCartney
Eleven adults were arrested by the Hawai"i Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement (DOCARE) Wednesday, during a protest to stop construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope atop Mauna Kea.
The arrests are unfortunate, but the state's number one priority is the safety of the people on Mauna Kea -- from TMT workers to protestors who are exercising their first amendment rights to peaceably assemble and protest in a civil manner.
We are disappointed and concerned that large boulders were found in the roadway leading to the summit of Mauna Kea. This action is a serious and significant safety hazard and could put people at risk.
Because of this, we are making an assessment to determine how to proceed.
We will be working to clear the roadway tomorrow. Therefore, construction is on hold until further notice.
