Governor and Mrs. IGE to Attend White House State Dinner Honoring Japanese Prime Minister
Press Release
By: David Ige
Date: April 23, 2015
Location: Honolulu, HI

At the invitation of the President and First Lady of the United States, Governor and Mrs. Ige will represent the State of Hawai'i at a White House State Dinner honoring the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe on Tuesday, April 28, 2015 in Washington, D.C.
President Obama and Prime Minister Abe will recognize the strong global partnership that the United States and Japan have developed during the 70 years since the end of World War II, and underscore the common values and principles that have made the bilateral relationship so enduring.
As the closest U.S. state to Japan, Hawai'i shares a rich history with Japan. "It is an honor for us to be invited to represent our state and reinforce Hawai'i's strong cultural and economic ties with our Japanese neighbors," said Governor Ige.
President and Mrs. Obama have hosted very few State Dinners during the President's two terms. This event will be only the eighth State Dinner of the Obama Presidency.
