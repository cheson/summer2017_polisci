Date: July 21, 2015
Location: Honolulu, HI

At the direction of President of the United States, the United States flag and the Hawai"i state flag will be flown at half-staff until sunset, July 25, 2015. This action is a sign of respect for the service members killed last week in Chattanooga.
"The tragedy in Tennessee reminds us that our service men and women risk their lives every day to ensure our freedoms. We grieve along with the families of those who lost loved ones," Governor Ige said.
