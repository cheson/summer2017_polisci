At the direction of the President of the United States, the national and state flags shall be flown at half-staff at the State Capitol and upon all state offices and agencies as well as the Hawai"i National Guard in the State of Hawai"i, as a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on March 22, 2016, in Brussels, Belgium. The flags will be flown at half-staff until sunset, March 26, 2016.
"It saddens me that this international surge of terrorism has become the "new normal' that can happen anywhere at any time. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured in the attacks in Brussels and we send our deepest condolences to the victims of this tragedy and their families," said Gov. David Ige.
