Press Release

Location: Honolulu, HI

Gov. David Ige is applauding the U.S. Department of Transportation's approval of Hawaiian Airlines' application to serve Kona from Haneda Airport in Tokyo.
"This creates the opportunity for us to open up Kona as an international point of entry. This is a significant step toward making that happen," said Mike McCartney, Gov. Ige's chief of staff.
Hawaiian Airlines has been flying passengers on the Haneda-Honolulu route since 2010, providing 107,000 round-trip seats a year and generating $564 million in direct spending.
Gov. Ige, who is traveling on the mainland, submitted a letter of support of Hawaiian Airlines' application for a second route, which said, in part:
"Providing direct service to Kona will open a new Haneda gateway to a market that has significant pent-up demand. Kona is the third largest U.S. airport without nonstop service to Tokyo. It has more point-of-sale Japanese passengers than eleven markets that currently enjoy nonstop service to Japan's most populous city," said Gov. Ige.
The U.S. DOT has given Hawaiian Airlines until Jan. 29, 2017 to start the new service.
