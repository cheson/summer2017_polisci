Governor Ige Announces Increases in Shelter Beds Through New State Contracts
Press Release
By: David Ige
Date: Jan. 12, 2017
Location: Honolulu, HI

Gov. David Ige announced the state Department of Human Services will award contracts to 33 homeless shelters. Funding will total $13,000,000 for 12 months. The new contracts require shelters to focus on outcome measures such as the number of people they will permanently house over the coming year.
The results of the competitive bids show a net increase in state-funded homeless shelter beds, with 3,761 for the next year vs. 3,577 for last year. Additionally, the shelters are proposing to double the number of people they place in permanent housing from approximately 3,000 to 6,200.
"This is about more than increasing shelter beds," said Gov. Ige. "It's about increasing results. For the same taxpayer investment as last year, we're doubling the number of people getting housed. We are finding better solutions, getting better efficiency, and creating better cooperation."
The Request for Bids (RFP) process was open to all shelters statewide and follows state law which requires shelters to increase accountability, privacy, and safety for residents while moving people more quickly into permanent housing. In accordance with the state procurement process, shelters were encouraged to ask questions about the RFPs and received written answers. Revisions were made to the RFP based on their feedback. A written record can be found on the state's procurement office website at:

Contracts will be effective as of Feb. 1, 2017. All state-funded shelters will receive training by the Department of Human Service's Homeless Programs Office.
