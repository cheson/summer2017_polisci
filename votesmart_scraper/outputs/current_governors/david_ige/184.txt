My administration will be proactive in preserving and protecting Hawaiʻi's fragile natural environment for future generations. We can have both a healthy environment and responsible economic growth through comprehensive planning that engages environmental interests, development interests, and other community interests.
Environment Action Plan:
* Direct the newly-created Pacific-Asia Institute for Resilience and Sustainability, which I helped enact, to mitigate risks from natural and man-made hazards, as well as to develop solutions for sustainable economic growth and adaptive plans for climate change
* Move for implementation of Department of Health rules that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I will also work with businesses and the community to implement those rules. Hawaiʻi can and must be a role model for environmental stewardship and clean energy.
* Increase funding to control the damage by invasive species through prevention, control, and outreach activities. An immediate action will be to step up the inspection of baggage and cargo for invasive species.
* Provide funding to protect Hawaiʻi's watersheds to ensure a continuous supply of clean drinking water for all.
My track record: My record reflects my commitment to protecting our natural resources and for community participation:
* Developed an innovative plan to fund the $40 million needed to preserve lands around Turtle Bay.
* Helped repeal the Public Lands Development Corporation (PLDC) because it went too far in exempting itself from land use and zoning regulations and did not adequately consider community input.
* Initiated a community task force to plan for transit-oriented development on State lands surrounding future Oahu rail stations.
* Provided $19.5 million for the State purchase of Lipoa Point on Maui, a 280-acre site rich in marine resources, historical and archeological sites and a popular recreation area.
