Governor's Statement on Hawai"i County's Emergency Proclamation on Dengue Fever Outbreak
Statement
By: David Ige
Date: Feb. 8, 2016
Location: Honolulu, HI

The state supports the county's effort to break the cycle of dengue fever infection and transmission on Hawai"i Island. Our number one priority is the health and safety of Hawai"i's residents and visitors. We will continue to work with county officials on a daily basis.
The state will issue an emergency proclamation if and when conditions meet the following criteria:
The dengue outbreak requires additional resources beyond current levels
The dengue outbreak has spread to other islands
The outbreak has expanded to include zika and other vector borne diseases
It is necessary to waive certain laws and regulations
The state determines it will need federal assistance
At this time, the state is working to release the State Health Department's 5 percent budget restriction ($250,000) to fund eight vector control positions, one entomologist and one communications position.
The state previously released another 5 percent ($250,000) restriction so the department could fund costs incurred while responding to the onset of the dengue outbreak.
Governor David Ige
