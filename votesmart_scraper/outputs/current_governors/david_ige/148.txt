Governor David Ige announced today that the House and Senate have agreed to his request to take to conference HB 1075, SD2 on Maui healthcare reform.
"We are committed to moving a bill forward that provides us with the best opportunity for a public/private partnership and healthcare reform on Maui," said Governor Ige. "We agree that we need to move forward on a public/private partnership in order to move our hospitals forward. There are some technical issues that we've agreed to work on together, to come up with a bill that will best serve the people of Hawai'i."
Through this measure, the legislature, in collaboration with the administration, seeks to establish the necessary legal and financing framework for a successful public/private partnership for health care facilities within the Hawai"i Health Systems Corporation.
"I'm pleased that the governor is involved and will be taking a leadership role in the transition of moving Maui Hospital from government to a private, non-profit entity. I think it is important to work with the administration and with the House and the Senate and other major stakeholders on resolving this very important healthcare issue for all of our citizens," said House Speaker Joe Souki.
"We want to assure the public that we are all on the same page, that we are working together to come up with a good bill that we can all be proud of," said Senate President Donna Mercado Kim.
