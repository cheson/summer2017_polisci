Gov. David Ige accepted a $660,422 award on behalf of the State of Hawai"i today, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Jesus Mendoza, administrator of the Western Regional Office of the Food and Nutrition Service. The award recognizes the exceptional performance by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and acknowledges the exemplary work of the Department of Human Services' (DHS) Benefits, Employment and Support Services Division (BESSD) over the last four years, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness in determination of SNAP eligibility for people in Hawai"i. In fiscal year 2014, BESSD achieved a 94.4 percent timeliness rate, placing Hawai"i in the top six states for highest timeliness rates.
The bonus award will help further transform SNAP processes and services. Gov. Ige, who accepted the award, believes this achievement is integral to his administration's promise to deliver efficient, effective and open government.
"This bonus award demonstrates that the State of Hawai"i SNAP eligibility team is a leader in service and performance nationwide. The award is also a promise to reinvest in Hawai"i's future as the funds will further transform and improve the way the State of Hawai"i serves its people," said Gov. Ige.
