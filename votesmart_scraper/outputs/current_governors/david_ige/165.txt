Governor David Ige today announced his nomination of Leonard Hoshijo to be the Deputy Director in the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.
Hoshijo's professional experience spans decades in which he has worked on behalf of those who labor in Hawaii and gained valuable insights about the role employers play in solving workplace issues. To take on this responsibility, he will be leaving his position as the Education and Political Director for the Hawaii Regional Council of Carpenters where he has run member-education programs, participated in the successful negotiation of contracts and Project Labor Agreements, and administered contracts. Prior to this, he carried out various responsibilities for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union including Housing Representative, Organizer, International Representative and International Vice President. He is an active nonprofit board member for a number of organizations including the Hawaii Housing Development Corp., the Labor Education Advisory Board, University of Hawaii Center for Labor Education and Research, and the Hawaii Labor Heritage Council, among others.
"Leonard Hoshijo understands the history of labor in Hawaii and the current needs of working people and employers," Governor David Ige said. "He is well respected by both those within labor and the businesses that grow our economy, create jobs and hire local employees."
Hoshijo earned a bachelor's degree from Antioch College and a P.Ed. from the University of Hawaii.
"I'm looking forward to applying the experience I've gained to the purposes of the department and to contributing to the success of Hawaii's 21st Century workplace within the balanced parameters set out by the Legislature," Hoshijo said.
