Gov. David Ige today signed into law four energy bills, including one that strengthens Hawaii's commitment to clean energy by directing the state's utilities to generate 100 percent of their electricity sales from renewable energy resources by 2045.
The bold step taken by the Hawai"i State Legislature in passing the landmark legislation (HB623) fulfills one of Ige's policy objectives by making Hawai"i the first state in the nation to set a 100 percent renewable portfolio standard (RPS) for the electricity sector.
"As the most oil dependent state in the nation, Hawai"i spends roughly $5 billion a year on foreign oil to meet its energy needs. Making the transition to renewable, indigenous resources for power generation will allow us to keep more of that money at home, thereby improving our economy, environment and energy security," Ige said. "I'd like to thank the senate and house energy committee chairs for championing HB623 and ensuring that Hawai"i remains a national leader in clean energy."
"Setting a 100 percent renewable portfolio standard will help drive investment in Hawai"i's growing clean energy sector," said Luis Salaveria, director of the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism. "Our commitment to clean energy has already attracted entrepreneurs and businesses from around the world, looking to develop, test and prove emerging technologies and strategies right here in Hawai"i."
"Raising the bar for renewable energy in Hawai"i will also push the state to stay out in front on innovation," said Mark Glick, administrator, State Energy Office. "We are finding ways to be innovative both with technical solutions and financing structures that will help us meet our ambitious renewable energy goals."
