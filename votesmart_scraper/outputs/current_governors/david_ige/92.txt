Gov. Ige and members of his cabinet held the first in a series of community forums to be scheduled across the state at Windward Community College in KƒÅne"ohe tonight.
"When I became governor on December 1, the courts had already made a decision to approve the TMT project. As governor, I must support that decision. On a personal note, I support the Thirty Meter Telescope as it is an opportunity for Hawai"i to become a leader in astronomy, but the state must do a better job of managing Mauna Kea," said Gov. Ige.
