"I respect those whose faiths revere the sanctity of life above all. I also respect every woman's right to make informed decisions about family planning and reproductive health. Contraception is the best method of preventing pregnancies and reducing the spread of sexually transmitted infections. In those cases where unintended pregnancies occur, I believe that a woman should be able to make the decision -- in consultation with her physician or nurse practitioner -- on whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."
