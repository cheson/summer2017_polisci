THIRD SUPPLEMENTARY PROCLAMATION
By the authority vested in me as Governor by the Constitution and laws of the
State of Hawaii, in order to provide relief for disaster damages, losses, and suffering,
and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people, I, DAVID Y. IGE, Governor of the State of Hawaii, hereby determine, designate and proclaim as follows:
WHEREAS, pursuant to chapter 127A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, emergency
powers are conferred on the Governor of the State of Hawaii to deal with disasters or
emergencies, to maintain the strength, resources, and economic life of the community, and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare; and
WHEREAS. it has become necessary to supplement the Proclamation of
September 5, 2014, the Supplementary Proclamation of September 22, 2014, and the Second Supplementary Proclamation of October 17, 2014, relating to the advancing lava flow which continues to advance thereby endangering communities in the Puna District of the county of Hawaii, State of Hawaii, in order to provide additional assistance; and
WHEREAS, based upon information from the Hawaii Volcano Observatory,
United States Geological Survey, that the distal tip of the lava flow is roughly 550 yards from Highway 130 with many breakouts upslope, and that the advancing lava flow is anticipated to cross Highway 1 30 and continues to be expected to pass through Pahoa as it continues advancing to the ocean; and
WHEREAS, the path of the lava flow is expected to isolate a significant segment
of the community from vital first-responder services thereby creating a specific need to establish alternative police, fire, emergency management, or other government facilities or sites in order to provide vital services to the public in the impacted area within the Puna District; and
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DAVID Y. IGE, Governor of the State of Hawaii, hereby
further determine that an emergency or disaster contemplated by sections 14 and 16 in chapter 1 27A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, continues to threaten the Puna District of the county of Hawaii, State of Hawaii, and hereby declare that all the provisions of the Proclamation of September 5, 2014, the Supplementary Proclamation of September 22, 2014, and the Second Supplementary Proclamation of October 17, 2014, shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby included in the provisions of this Second Supplementary Proclamation and the disaster emergency relief period shall continue through December 31, 2015, except for any projects initiated under this emergency in which case the provisions shall continue until project acceptance and any final accounting or payment obligations, whichever is later.
