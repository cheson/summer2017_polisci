Governor's Office News Release: Governor David Ige Extends Emergency Proclamation on Homelessness Through June
Statement
By: David Ige
Date: April 22, 2016
Location: Honolulu, HI

Gov. David Y. Ige today signed a fourth supplemental proclamation on homelessness, which will remain in effect until late June of this year. The supplemental proclamation allows the state to continue its coordinated efforts with the counties to create short- and long-term housing projects statewide.
Under the most recent extension, the proclamation cut the development time by up to a year for units specifically dedicated to homeless persons. There are three such housing projects currently underway.
"Extending the proclamation will continue the momentum," said the Governor's Coordinator on Homelessness Scott Morishige. "It's the right thing to do. When we consider the number of homeless individuals in our state, we must employ every tool at our disposal to connect these people to homes as quickly as possible. This is a statewide issue which affects nearly everyone."
