Renewable energy can be as significant for Hawaiʻi's economy as tourism. We are blessed with abundant renewable energy resources--solar, wind, ocean, geothermal-- that can be the foundation for a robust alternate energy industry. We can also reduce Hawaiʻi's $6 billion a year dependence on imported oil and instead, keep funds here while creating new jobs in the process.
We must provide more options for customers to manage their electricity bills and to reduce cost by ensuring that all electricity customers have the opportunity to benefit from clean energy policies. I believe we can be a model of clean energy for the nation --and even the world-- but we need the right kind of leadership. Unfortunately, the current approach to energy planning and implementation has been fragmented and short-sighted. The current State administration has adopted goals and targets, but it does not have a comprehensive plan to bring citizens, government agencies, utilities, and community agencies together.
Energy Action Plan:
* Direct, and adequately staff the Hawaiʻi State Energy Office to work with all relevant parties to plan and execute policies and programs to develop a clean energy industry in Hawaiʻi, including training and hiring a strong local workforce
* Work with key stakeholders to address and overcome the challenges in meeting more aggressively our Hawaiʻi Clean Energy Initiative goals and targets by modernizing the electrical grid, determining the proper mix of fuels at affordable cost, and working with the counties to reduce fossil fuel use in ground transportation.
* Ensure adequacy of staff and independence of the Public Utilities Commission to make timely and sound decisions that will afford reliable and affordable electricity to benefit ratepayers.
* Support state-of-the-art technology that increases the allowable amount of distributed generation and power sharing between consumers, and enabling installation of rooftop solar systems
* Create programs and incentives to increase clean energy production in Hawaiʻi.
My track record: My understanding of Hawaiʻi's energy issues has been informed by my training and experience as an engineer. Based on this understanding, I have:
* Supported regulatory policies to accelerate the implementation of clean energy goals.
* Helped provide funding for research and development of renewable energy resources
* Led the establishment of an energy and food security and self-sufficiency fund, funded from the fuel tax, for energy security, environmental response, energy systems development, and agricultural development and food security
* Supported the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) through staffing, funding, and restructuring, giving it more independence and flexibility to enable it to better address Hawaiʻi's energy issues and to ensure that the public interest is served.
