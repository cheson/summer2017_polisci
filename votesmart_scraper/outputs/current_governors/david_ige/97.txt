Gov. David Ige and First Lady Dawn Amano-Ige returned from a successful and productive trip to Japan and China on Oct. 14. The governor and Mrs. Ige traveled with a delegation from the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT) to promote economic development, renewable energy cooperation and international student exchange.
While there, the governor and Mrs. Ige participated in mile-stone celebrations of the 30th anniversary of sister-relations with Okinawa Prefecture, Japan and Guangdong Province, China and expressed Hawai"i's commitment to further strengthen these relationships through educational, cultural and economic exchanges in the years ahead.
"Hawai"i and Okinawa share many similar characteristics, and I was able to observe how Okinawa's energy companies and educational institutions are developing programs and initiatives that have global impact," said Gov. Ige. "The Prefectural Government is also committed to developing a workforce skilled in international relations. Our similarities will continue to unite us as we strive to achieve new models of economic development priorities."
