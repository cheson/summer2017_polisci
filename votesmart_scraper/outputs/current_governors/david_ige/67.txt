Governor's Office News Release: New Federal Education Law Prompts Governor to Form Team to Develop Blueprint for Hawai"i's Education
Statement

Location: Honolulu, HI

Gov. David Ige today announced the formation of the Governor's Team on the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The new law calls for the most significant reduction in federal authority over public education in decades. The law returns authority to the 50 states to set the direction for their own public schools.
The governor's team will work to develop a blue print for Hawai"i's public schools that is consistent with ESSA and will maximize opportunities and possibilities for Hawai"i to transform education.
Gov. Ige has appointed Darrel Galera as chairman of the Governor's ESSA team and is in the process of appointing 16 additional members representing all stakeholders in public education.
Under the new education law, Gov. Ige will be involved in the development of the new state education plan and will have final approval over the plan.
"This is a major opportunity to change the face of public education in Hawai"i for the better. Our innovation economy depends on a well-educated workforce to meet the state's goals in renewable energy, locally grown food production, environmental stewardship and more. It is my hope that the public will participate in this process to help our education system prepare students for high-skill careers in the 21st century," said Gov. Ige.
The ESSA team will ultimately be responsible for assessing the current public school system and identifying areas of need.
