Location: Honolulu, HI

Governor David Ige released the following statement in response to the Army's force structure realignment announcement:
"The Army is an integral part of our community, and I am pleased that the announced reductions are not as severe as they might have been. I believe this is a recognition that the Army's Pacific Pathways plan to strengthen capabilities and assets in the Pacific region is an essential part of the nation's defense strategy. It's also a recognition that the Hawai"i community appreciates our military members who stand shoulder to shoulder with us. Together, we are a family.
"We continue to monitor the potential loss of some of our civilian workforce and an additional round of planned reductions in 2017. My administration will make the retention of our current force levels a priority," said Gov. David Ige.
