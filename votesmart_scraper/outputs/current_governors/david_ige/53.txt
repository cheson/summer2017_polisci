The governor also signed HB 2605 which appropriates $850,000 to establish, administer and support job training and preparation activities for new jobs. The training includes basic computer literacy, job search assistance, skill assessments, vocational counseling, remedial math and English, English as a second-language, vocational training, work experience and on the job training. Support services include assistance with work tools, safety shoes and job certification fees.
"We support our hard working and dedicated residents in Maui County and hope to help prepare and train them for the future and the next chapter in their lives," Gov. Ige said.
