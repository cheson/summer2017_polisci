Location: Honolulu, HI

Gov. David Ige today announced the formation of the Governor's Leadership Team on Homelessness, which will be tasked with finding short-term and long-term solutions as the state, city and federal governments work together to address homelessness in Hawai"i.
The leadership team includes Gov. Ige, Sen. Jill Tokuda, Rep. Sylvia Luke, Director of Human Services Rachael Wong, Mayor Kirk Caldwell, Honolulu City Council Chairman Ernie Martin, U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz's designee and U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono's designee.
"The underlying issues that lead to homelessness, such as lack of affordable housing, cannot be resolved quickly," said Gov. Ige. "Meanwhile, we cannot wait for a comprehensive, long-term solution. There are measures we can take and will take, immediately."
The Governor's Leadership Team on Homelessness will identify and assign parcels of land to be used for the creation of temporary shelters in one or two communities; implement measures to transfer residents of homeless encampments to shelters; work with service providers to establish protocols to assess shelter residents for financial, physical, mental health and other needs; and determine costs and obtain funding to meet these objectives.
The leadership team will consult with law enforcement leaders, non-profit organizations and other interested parties to assist with implementing short-term objectives.
In addition, as a result of the team's discussions and findings, legislation may be introduced in January 2016 to fulfill unmet or unfunded needs and services.
