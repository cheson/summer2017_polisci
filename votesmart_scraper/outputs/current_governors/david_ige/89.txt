Governor David Ige's Statement on Syrian refugees
Statement
By: David Ige
Date: Nov. 16, 2015
Location: Honolulu, HI

Our first priority is the safety of the American people, including the people of the State of Hawai"i.
The U.S. accepts refugees, including Syrians, only after they are subjected to the most vigorous and highest level of screening and security vetting.
As President Obama has said -- slamming the door in their face would be a betrayal of our values. Hawai"i and our nation have a long history of welcoming refugees impacted by war and oppression. Hawai"i is the Aloha State, known for its tradition of welcoming all people with tolerance and mutual respect. I am confident that our state will work closely with the federal government to ensure that appropriate resources and support are available before any refugees arrive in Hawai"i.
