News Release: State Releases Testimony Opposing Proposed HEI, NextEra Merger
Press Release
By: David Ige
Date: July 21, 2015
Location: Honolulu, HI

Gov. David Ige today outlined the reasons why the state submitted testimony opposing Hawaiian Electric Industries' proposed merger with NextEra Energy Inc. as it currently stands.
"Although I welcome capital investment in Hawai"i with respect to energy, any merger or investment must align with the state's 100 percent renewable energy goal," Ige said. "The state respectfully opposes the merger in its current form because it fails to align with the state's renewable energy goals."
In the testimony, the state expressed strong reservations about the transaction as proposed and said it should not be approved.
"We are committed to a 100 percent renewable future, standing alone among fifty states in the nation in that action. We need an electric company that sees Hawai"i as the center of its work and the opportunity we represent as one of the greatest moments in history for any utility. We have not seen that in this proposal," Ige added.
The two filings were made on behalf of the Hawai"i State Energy Office and the Hawai"i State Office of Planning.
