Press Release

Date: May 11, 2016
Location: Honolulu, HI

Gov. David Ige has signed into law HB1581 (ACT 48) which aims to expedite the resolution of disputes on actions by state agencies.
The new law allows contested case hearings before the commissions on Water Resource Management, Land Use, Public Utilities, the Hawai"i Community Development Authority and cases involving conservation districts, to be directly appealed to the Hawai"i Supreme Court. The law also requires the Supreme Court to give priority to contested case appeals of significant statewide importance.
This law will expedite the review process and decisions in important cases involving constitutional matters.
"The ability to directly appeal a contested case decision to the Hawai"i Supreme Court will be very efficient, saving both time and money for all parties involved," said House Majority Leader Scott Saiki, (McCully, Kaheka, Kaka"ako, Downtown) who introduced the measure. "A Supreme Court decision will provide finality for a contested case much sooner than if appeals must be taken at various court levels," he added.
The new law takes effect on August 1, 2016.
