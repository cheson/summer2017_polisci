Press Release

Location: Honolulu, HI

Gov. David Y. Ige today announced that the State of Hawai"i has negotiated an agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to offer a special enrollment period for eligible Hawaii residents from the Compact of Free Association (COFA) nations who are seeking health care coverage through healthcare.gov. The enrollment will be effective for up to 60 days from Dec. 18, and participating Hawai"i health insurance plans have agreed to make coverage retroactive to January 1, 2016 to avoid any gaps during the special enrollment period.
"When people have access to affordable health care coverage, their health outcomes are more positive, and our four decades of experience with Hawai"i's Prepaid Health Care Act of 1974 have shown us that. We appreciate the federal government's understanding of the special circumstances our residents from Compact nations face when seeking health care services in Hawai"i," said Gov. Ige.
