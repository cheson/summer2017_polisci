Homelessness has reached a near-crisis level in our Islands. The homeless issue and its solutions are complex because the homeless population is diverse. It includes families with children, the elderly, victims of domestic abuse, the disabled, veterans, unemployed or underemployed workers, and individuals with mental illness or victims of substance abuse. Each group has different needs.
Homelessness strains the resources of our communities. It hurts when we cannot use sidewalks, public parks and recreation areas because the homeless population is living in these public spaces. It hurts tourism and other businesses. Furthermore, we must recognize that many families across the state are only a few missed paychecks away from homelessness. We can do better as a modern civilized society to help the least fortunate among us so they can be guided back to economic self-sufficiency and have their dignity restored.
To aid working families who cannot afford to own a home and struggle to pay rent, a significant expansion of affordable rental housing is needed in both urban and rural areas across the state. I support the decision of the 2014 Legislature to increase funding for the Rental Housing Trust Fund, which partners with private builders to build subsidized housing.
Affordable Housing Action Plan:
* Leverage additional State funding to attract more private investment to construct more affordable housing.
* Identify and develop vacant and underutilized State lands for affordable housing near Oahu rail stations, public transportation and employment centers, and, whenever possible, include daycare, senior centers, and community facilities as part of new affordable housing sites
* Work with the counties to expedite planning and construction approvals so that affordable rental housing can be built in a shorter time and at lower cost.
* Build more affordable housing units in Kaka'ako, which is fully under State control. It provides a unique opportunity to generate new affordable housing. More than 5,000 housing units have been approved in Kaka'ako recently, but less than seven percent are affordable to the lower half of our population. I will reverse this trend and generate housing in Kaka'ako affordable to families earning below the median wage.
* Upgrade and increase public housing. Our State public housing needs to be managed and operated by qualified non-profit and private companies so tenant issues are immediately addressed, facilities are properly maintained, and units added that are targeted for low income seniors and those with special needs.
Homelessness Action Plan:
* Collaborate with and support the counties' efforts to address homelessness. I support the Housing First initiative, which provides transitional and permanent supportive emergency housing. It also offers referral services for mental illness, addiction, job training and other social services.
* Continue to support homeless shelters that provide immediate physical and mental health relief for homeless individuals and families. Shelters provide the first step toward permanent rental housing and job market re-entry.
* Help our homeless military veteran population with affordable housing and support services and improve coordination with the VeteransAdministration. Support the judiciary's Hawaii Veterans Treatment Court, which began last year, to help veterans arrested for non-violent crimes and who may be suffering from PTSD, mental health problems or substance abuse with resources and treatment needed to get healthy, employed and acclimated back into society.
* Support paying return travel costs for persons who moved here from the mainland under the mistaken belief that they could afford to live here, then exhausted their resources, and now wish to return home
