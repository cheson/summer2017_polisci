Our counties have provided leadership on a number of fronts, such as homelessness, transportation, clean energy, and affordable housing. I believe the State must support their efforts. I will work with counties to evaluate their roles and responsibilities to eliminate duplication of effort, and consider the increased sharing of State resources with them. For example, the counties have begun multi-modal transportation efforts but funding for implementation remains limited. I will help secure additional resources for these county initiatives.
Improved communication between State and counties can reduce public inconvenience, such as when the State Department of Transportation recently failed to coordinate its H-1 freeway closures with the City and County of Honolulu, so many routes were simultaneously closed for construction and repair work. As a result, people spent many extra hours unnecessarily stuck in traffic.
