Coding. Robotics. Digital media. International education exchanges. These programs weren't offered when I attended public schools in Pearl City, and we can only imagine what fascinating opportunities await students in the world of tomorrow.
What I can tell you is this: The future of our state depends on a public education system that includes the basics and adds new skills that prepare all of our people to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
We must remodel our schoolhouse to enable our society to thrive in the future.
When you remodel a house, you make substantial changes. You think about your family's needs today and for the future. You manage the cost of remodeling today with the hopes and dreams for the future. And after the dust settles, the new design helps you meet the challenges to come.
That's what I see as the promise of a "remodeled" school system for Hawaii -- for future generations and the future of our state.
The good news is that we won't have to start remodeling our schoolhouse from scratch.
In 2010 voters made it clear that they wanted the governor to take ultimate responsibility for public education in this state. I accept that responsibility. That's why I appointed people to the Board of Education who I know will make decisions that are always in the best interest of our students.
