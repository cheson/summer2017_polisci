Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter signed House Bill 521 today, laying the foundation for developing and implementing strategic plans to improve student performance in Idaho's public schools. It is one the first of the recommendations from the Governor's Task Force for Improving Education to become law.
House Bill 521 was sponsored by Representative Wendy Horman, a former school board member, and was overwhelmingly approved by both chambers of the Idaho Legislature. "This bill and others related to Task Force recommendations demonstrate the Governor's and the Legislature's commitment to education," she said.
"As I said in my State of the State address, this is among the recommendations from my Task Force that speaks directly to the importance of meeting local needs while aligning with our statewide objectives, and to the importance of accountability as we responsibly invest in Idaho's future," Governor Otter said.
Among the bill's requirements:
* School districts and public charter schools will develop and maintain strategic plans that focus on improving student performance, in collaboration with stakeholders including students, parents, educators and the community as appropriate.
* Strategic plans will be data-driven by student outcomes, include clear and measureable targets for improving those outcomes, have a clear vision and mission, and include indicators for monitoring performance.
* Strategic plans for the 2014-15 school year will be adopted by September 1, and will be reviewed and updated each year thereafter by August 1.
