Threatened And Endangered Species Recovery Act

Endangered Species Act Must Work for All. House-Passed Reforms Address Law's Effectiveness, Private Property Conflicts.
One of America's great challenges, as it has been since our republic was formed, is determining what government may do, what it should do, and what it must do. The Constitution is our surest guide in answering those questions.
Congress now is engaged in precisely such a debate regarding the Endangered Species Act. The question is how recovering plant and animal species to healthy and sustainable populations - which we all agree government should do - corresponds with protecting the private property rights of our citizens - which the Constitution says the government must do.
After years of discussion and negotiation, House Resources Committee Chairman Richard Pombo recently advanced the Threatened and Endangered Species Recovery Act to address that question. With my cosponsorship, the House approved the measure and forwarded it to the Senate.
Even most critics of the bill acknowledge conflicts between the broad manner in which the existing law has been interpreted by activists and courts and the property rights of those who find the use of their land restricted by arbitrary "critical habitat" designations for protected species. Yet those same critics cling to a law that even the agencies overseeing it agree has helped in the recovery of only about 1 percent of some 1,300 species listed over the past three decades.
Most TESRA critics focus on its incentives for property owners to cooperate and participate in species recovery efforts. They consider it a sellout that puts property rights before species protection. That kind of zero-sum thinking is why the ESA has become such a boon to lawyers and the fund-raising campaigns of environmental extremists, the bane of individuals and communities in the West, and essentially useless to the species it is supposed to be protecting.
The Constitution's Fifth Amendment phrase, "nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation," is not a suggestion. It is a clear and - at least until the U.S. Supreme Court's abhorrent decision in the Kelo case - unequivocal statement of what the government must do. Protecting species, on the other hand, while desirable, important, and a statutory priority, is not a constitutional mandate.
Those of us convinced that the ESA must be fixed to comply with the Fifth Amendment reject the idea that such reform would necessarily reduce the law's effectiveness. On the contrary, it would be nearly impossible to reduce the effectiveness of a law with a 1-percent success rate. However well-intended it was in the 1970s, the ESA in the 21st century has become far more about process than species recovery, and far more about litigation and conflict than cooperation and results.
The Heritage Foundation summed up the dilemma this way; "The current ESA pits landowners, fearful of losing use of their property, against the very species ESA is designed to protect. Because discovery of a snail, migratory bird, or other protected species on one's property can lead to a government taking of that property (or much of its use value), ESA gives landowners a perverse incentive to destroy evidence and habitats, rather than participate in conservation."
When you realize that nearly 80 percent of all species listed as endangered or threatened have habitat on private lands, it becomes clear that engaging those property owners is critical to ensuring species recovery. The debate cannot be allowed to remain about species versus private property. The two are inextricably linked. Ignoring that connection puts both at risk.
Besides enlisting landowners in species recovery, Chairman Pombo's bill improves the ESA by strengthening scientific standards, increasing openness and accountability, and providing a bigger role for the cooperative efforts of state and local governments that have the most at stake.
Opponents of ESA reform contend that our efforts stem from some innate hostility to government regulation. My objections are to regulation for regulation's sake that winds up being counterproductive to its stated goals. The ESA entails just such misguided regulation. The Constitution is my guide in setting it right.
