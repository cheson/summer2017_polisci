Governor Reacts to Court Ruling on Historical Horse Racing Bill
Statement

Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to the Idaho Supreme Court decision granting the plaintiff's petition in Coeur d'Alene Tribe vs. Denney to declare null and void the Governor's veto of the historical racing legislation, SB 1011, and to certify the bill as law.
"I am disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision. I vetoed the bill within the time allowed under the Constitution. As for the time of its return, I gave Senate President Pro Tem Brent Hill my word that he could be the first to inform his colleagues of my veto, instead of having them learn of it through press reports. Unfortunately the Senate already was adjourned for the long Easter weekend. I stand by my word as well as my earlier decision to veto this legislation. It is clear the Senate took up my veto and voted to uphold it. While I disagree with today's ruling, I will continue working toward a solution that ensures a viable live horse racing industry in Idaho."
