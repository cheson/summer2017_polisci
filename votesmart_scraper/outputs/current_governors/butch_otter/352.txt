Location: Boise, ID

Governor Otter fought the misguided efforts of D.C. bureaucrats to usurp state management of species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Idahoans are proud stewards of their land and wildlife. We have shown with sage grouse, slick spot peppergrass and wolves that responsible state management in cooperation with those who use and work the land can protect or recover species better than the ESA. Unfortunately, Washington D.C. believes it knows better. Too often, that means listing species to languish on a list with little chance of recovery and miles of federal red tape for private landowners and businesses. There needs to be more cooperation from federal agencies, opportunities and certainty for states and individuals that proactively conserve species before they are listed under the ESA. Governor Otter will continue to promote common sense, on-the-ground solutions to keep species off the endangered and threatened list. He will fight the federal government in court to preserve our home-grown solutions and sovereign right to responsibly manage species within our borders.
