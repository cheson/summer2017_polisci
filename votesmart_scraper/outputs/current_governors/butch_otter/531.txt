GOVERNOR COMMENTS ON RESPONSE TO OFFER ON FIELD BURNING TALKS
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement late Friday after receiving responses from all the parties invited to participate in negotiations toward a settlement of issues regarding crop-residue burning on Idaho fields.
"I appreciate the positive responses I received, but I was disappointed that SAFE refused to stay its pending litigation. It remains my hope to find a mutually acceptable solution for all Idahoans."
