OTTER WELCOMES COURT'S WATER RULING
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in response to the Idaho Supreme Court's unanimous ruling on the state's joint management of surface and ground water rights.
"The court made it clear that we must be guided by the Â‘prior appropriation' doctrine in the Idaho Constitution and conjunctive management rules developed to preserve and protect our precious water. In the near future I will announce plans for a water summit that will put that guidance to work in charting our course forward."
