OPINION: IDAHO IS READY FOR WOLF DELISTING
By Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials are gathering public comments on delisting wolves under the Endangered Species Act. Jim Caswell, director of the state Office of Species Conservation, is delivering Idaho's official position to the agency, but I want to share it with all of you as well.
Whether the standard is biological, social or political, it is time to remove the gray wolf from federal protection in the Northern Rocky Mountains.
The federal government has stated repeatedly over the past decade that 300 wolves in the region would be a recovered, viable population. Today we have a wolf population more than four times that size. There is no reason to delay delisting. The government should declare victory and move on.
Idahoans are proud stewards of the land and species of our state. Idaho is going to manage wolves as we do black bears and mountain lions. With estimated black bear and cougar populations of 20,000 and 3,000 respectively, Idaho has a proven record of responsible large carnivore management. We will continue this great record with wolves.
We will be guided by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game's implementation of our state management plan, which was approved by the Fish and Wildlife Service and its handpicked wolf experts.
