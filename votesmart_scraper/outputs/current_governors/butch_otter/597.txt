Land Sales Bill

'I was wrong' about Land Sale Bill and am dropping my support for H.R.3855
I was wrong.
It wasn't the first time, and it won't be the last.
I'll take my lumps as they come - no one in public life should consider themselves above error. My political mentor, former Governor Phil Batt, lived by the principle that everyone whom the public holds in trust should be prepared to own up to their mistakes.
I always have, and I always will.
For now, that means withdrawing my co-sponsorship and support for H.R. 3855, a bill before the House Resources Committee that Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo introduced as a way of sending a message to our absentee federal landlords in the West.
I joined Congressman Tancredo as an original co-sponsor of the bill, in part, because I was frustrated that Congress had identified no revenue source to cover the cost of the billions of dollars already appropriated for Hurricane Katrina relief. At the same time, the measure provided the chance for another in a series of "shots across the bow" on the issue of federal land management that I have supported during my time in Congress.
