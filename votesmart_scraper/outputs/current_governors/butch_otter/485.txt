STATE, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGREE ON INL BURIED WASTE CLEANUP PLAN
SETTLEMENT PROVIDES LONG-TERM PROTECTION FOR SNAKE RIVER PLAIN AQUIFER
The State of Idaho and the federal government today announced their agreement to a cleanup plan for buried waste at the Idaho National Laboratory that provides for the long-term protection of the Snake River Plain Aquifer.
The agreement implements a 2006 federal court order in coordination with ongoing Superfund cleanup of the area. It marks the end of six years of litigation between the U.S. Department of Energy and the State of Idaho, and it will satisfy DOE's commitment to Idaho to remove transuranic (plutonium-contaminated) waste buried at INL decades ago.
"This agreement reflects years of effort, scientific advancement, diligent follow-up, and most of all building trust," Governor Otter said. "We enter into this agreement confident that it is in the best interest of the aquifer, the Idaho National Laboratory, and all Idahoans. With the support of my predecessors in this office, it represents our best effort - and our highest aspirations - for securing a safe and productive future."
"Today's plan satisfies the requirements of Judge Lodge's 2006 decision by requiring the removal of transuranic waste from Idaho, consistent with the court's direction to protect worker safety," Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden said. "Although our litigation was lengthy, it concluded in a sensible agreement to fulfill DOE's commitment to Idaho."
