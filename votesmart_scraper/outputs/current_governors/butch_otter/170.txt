"Idaho taxpayers have made a multibillion-dollar investment in safe, efficient roads and bridges. Maintaining and improving our transportation system to meet our people's needs today and tomorrow is a legitimate government responsibility. Our job is to make sure that's done efficiently and effectively."
Governor Otter knows that building and maintaining safe, efficient corridors of commerce is a proper role of government. After all, they are the routes our families take every day to work, school and to stay connected. As Idaho's population grows, our roads and bridges are aging and, in some cases, deteriorating. From narrow, winding and hazardous stretches of road through Idaho's mountains to congestion and polluting traffic in our cities, Governor Otter is working with the Legislature and stakeholders throughout Idaho to develop long-term, sustainable and equitable solutions to Idaho's transportation funding dilemma. Meanwhile, he is working to identify waste and inefficiency so that every dollar of Idahoans' taxes and user fees is put to work cost-effectively in addressing the backlog of improvements to our highway system.
