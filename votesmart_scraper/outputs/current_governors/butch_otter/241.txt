Press Release

Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced today that physicians, hospitals, community clinics and health insurers have pledged their support for his Medical Home Collaborative two-year primary care pilot project beginning this winter.
"Thousands of Idahoans will benefit from coordinated health care delivery through this initiative," Governor Otter said. "Working with Idaho Medicaid's Home Health Project, this collaborative is exactly the kind of grassroots, Idaho-driven approach that can help responsibly address costs, which are the primary barrier to health care access for too many citizens. And we're doing this on our own -- without federal mandates."
The patient-centered medical home model of care moves primary care from acute-focused, episodic care to a model of pro-actively coordinated preventive care based on the physician-patient relationship. The Governor Otter and Idaho Medical Home Collaborative officials are grateful to the following organizations for their generous grants, donations and support in developing this endeavor:
* Cambia Health Foundation (previously The Regence Foundation) - $10,000
* Idaho Academy of Family Physicians - $5,000
* Idaho Medical Association - $5,000
* American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation - $2,500
* Family Medicine Residency of Idaho - $1,000
* Idaho Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics - $500
* St. Luke's Health System- $5,000
* Primary Health Medical Group-$5,000
* Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center-$5,000
"Research has shown that patients tend to get better care in medical homes," said Angela Hult, Cambia Health Foundation executive director, "because fewer gaps in care mean fewer emergencies. We are pleased to support this pilot aimed at better quality of life for patients and lower health care costs."
