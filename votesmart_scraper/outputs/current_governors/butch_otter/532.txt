SILICON VALLEY VETERAN NAMED TO LEAD INDEPENDENT IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced today that James M. Ellick, a veteran of Silicon Valley's phenomenal growth and sustained high-tech success, has agreed to become director of the reconstituted, independent Idaho Department of Commerce.
Ellick, who now lives in Hansville, Washington, has a long history of senior management in high-tech manufacturing, marketing, sales and development.
The University of Santa Clara graduate and former U.S. Navy officer served during his career as vice president and general manager both of Fairchild Semiconductor and Applied Materials. Ellick also has been CEO of four different venture capital-backed companies, and in 1995 - leading a dynamic executive team - he took Photon Dynamics, Inc. public on the NASDAQ (PHTN).
Ellick has been involved in private investing and consulting since 2000, after serving as president, CEO and co-chairman of Mitsubishi Silicon America.
"Jim is the kind of energetic leader who knows not only how to get things done but to successfully enlist the most talented people in achieving their shared goals," Governor Otter said. "His experience and connections with technology businesses and the brightest cutting-edge minds on several continents will make him a great Commerce director. I'm proud that Jim's coming aboard, and look forward to big things in our future with his help."
Ellick will officially begin his new job July 1, when a law recommended by Governor Otter and approved by the Legislature separating the Department of Labor and Commerce into two agencies becomes effective. Roger Madsen, now director of the combined agencies, will remain director of the Department of Labor.
