Governor Otter has worked to EMPOWER IDAHOANS by:
* Bringing broadband Internet access to schools throughout Idaho.
* Creating more community college and career-training opportunities throughout Idaho.
* Ensuring money doesn't keep Idaho students out of college or career training by creating the Opportunity Scholarship Trust Fund -- now $20 million strong -- and by growing the Governor's Cup Scholarship program.
* Enabling more parents to connect with their children at "Read to Me" community library programs throughout Idaho.
