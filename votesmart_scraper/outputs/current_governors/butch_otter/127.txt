Date: Sept. 4, 2014
Location: Boise, ID

At a ceremony on Thursday, September 11th at the Idaho Fallen Soldier Memorial in Boise, Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter and Lieutenant Governor Brad Little will read the names of the 67 Idaho military personnel who have lost their lives since September 11, 2001.
"It's important that we take the time to remember the fallen, to express our gratitude, and to recommit ourselves to the cause of freedom for which these brave Idahoans gave their lives," Governor Otter said. "We all owe a debt to those who go into harm's way on our behalf."
The event is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. at the memorial in front of the old Ada County courthouse at 6th and Jefferson streets in downtown Boise.
The Governor and Lieutenant Governor will memorialize the Idaho soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen whose names are inscribed on the memorial, with special recognition and a presentation to the family of Air Force Captain David I. Lyon of Sandpoint, who was killed last December in Kabul, Afghanistan when a car bomb exploded near his convoy.
Many family members of the fallen will be on hand for the ceremony, as well as civilian and military dignitaries including Admiral Michelle Howard, Vice Chief of Naval Operations and the first African American woman to command a ship in the U.S. Navy.
