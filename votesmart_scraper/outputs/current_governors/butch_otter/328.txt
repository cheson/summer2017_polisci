Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter said today that U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson's order allowing Idaho and 19 other states to proceed with their legal challenge to Obamacare is a victory for states' rights and individual citizens.
But Governor Otter -- the nation's first governor to sign a state law officially refusing to comply with Obamacare's health insurance mandate -- said the fight is not yet over. The next step is a December 16th summary judgment hearing before Judge Vinson.
"I'm pleased that the judge saw the importance of considering the merits of our case. Idahoans deserve a chance to challenge Obamacare's unconstitutional abuse of power, and to assert our rights as citizens of a sovereign state. I have a responsibility as Governor to protect our self-determination, as a state and as individuals, against an aggressively overreaching national government.
"It's important to remember that this legal challenge isn't our only path forward. We also are working with our Idaho congressional delegation toward a legislative repeal of this onerous, unprecedented and irresponsible mandate.
"We look forward to getting our day in court, and to this case advancing toward what I believe ultimately will be a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in support of states' rights, individual freedom and a constitutionally limited national government."
