Press Release
By: Butch Otter
Date: June 10, 2015
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced the appointment today of Laura Baker -- clerk, treasurer and business manager for the Horseshoe Bend School District -- to fill the Boise County Commission vacancy left by last month's resignation of Commissioner Vicki Wilkins.
Baker will complete Wilkins' term in office, which expires in January 2017. She was selected from among three nominees submitted to Governor Otter by the Boise County Republican Central Committee after Wilkins resigned from the three-member commission.
"I appreciate the willingness of all those who devote so much of their energy, experience and civic virtue to serving their neighbors. Mrs. Baker has proven herself through community service in Horseshoe Bend and earlier when she lived in Fairfield," Governor Otter said. "Geography and history can make Boise County a challenging place to be a local leader, but I am confident in Laura's ability and her commitment to public service. I wish her well with her new responsibilities."
Mrs. Baker said in applying for the position that maintaining our Idaho way of life "takes work and a fair contribution by all who are a part of it. I have two children who serve in the military, a husband who serves in law enforcement, and I feel this would be my contribution towards the freedoms that I have today."
