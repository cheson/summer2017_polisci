Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter is partnering with America's pharmaceutical research companies to help parents keep their children safe by properly disposing of unused prescription medicines.
In public service announcements released this week, Governor Otter reminds parents now is a good time to clean out their medicine cabinets.
"For many kids it's easier to take prescription medicines than to buy illegal drugs or even alcohol, and the family medicine cabinet is the easiest place to find them," the Governor said. "If you have unused prescription medicines, make sure you dispose of them quickly and properly."
The PSAs offer advice to parents for the best way to quickly and safely dispose of medicines. Dispose of medicines by following guidelines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service:
* Don't flush the medicines!
* Mix medicines in a sealable plastic bag with coffee grounds, cat litter or sawdust, and water.
* Seal it in a bag.
* Throw it in your garbage.
* Destroy you prescription information.
