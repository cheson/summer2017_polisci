OVERNOR OTTER REACTS TO SUPREME COURT RULING ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE
(BOISE) -- Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today regarding the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states:
"Today's decision is truly disappointing for states, including Idaho, where the people chose to define marriage for themselves as between one man and one woman. I have maintained from the very beginning that it should be the prerogative of the states -- not the courts -- to determine whether same-sex marriage is consistent with the values, character, and moral fabric of that particular state. That is why it was especially troubling that the Court treated the 10th Amendment as a footnote, instead of the guiding principle our founding fathers intended."
