Personal Responsibility In Food Consumption Act

House Bill promotes personal responsibility. Idaho lawmakers support measure to limit frivolous food consumption lawsuits.
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Idaho Congressmen C.L. "Butch" Otter and Mike Simpson voted with the 306-120 House majority Wednesday for legislation to keep trial lawyers from using individuals' food consumption choices to threaten jobs and reduce personal freedom.
The Idaho representatives both are cosponsors of the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act, H.R. 554, to keep a few predatory attorneys and their clients from profiting at the expense of all other consumers. With some specific exceptions for extraordinary circumstances, the bill would prohibit obesity or weight gain-related liability claims against the food industry.
The food industry is America's largest private-sector employer, putting more than 12 million people to work. Many of those jobs are in small local businesses providing an important service and an economic foundation for their communities. Yet there are those willing to put them at risk because a few blame others for food consumption choices that lead to obesity or health problems.
Of course, H.R. 554 still would allow claims for improperly prepared or tainted food. Obesity-related claims also could go forward in such cases as when a person gains weight as the result of the violation of a state or federal law. Such cases might include false labeling of food products as "low fat" or "zero calories."
"While it's a fact that too many Americans are fat, most folks are willing to take responsibility for the choices that got them there. The problem is a few unscrupulous lawyers who look at people with obesity or health issues and see dollars signs," Congressman Otter said. "Those predators are largely responsible for increases in insurance rates, higher costs of doing business, and the idea that everything is somebody else's problem. It's high time we stopped these ridiculous claims."
"Along with many of my colleagues in Congress, I am very worried about the rejection of personal responsibility that's becoming all too prevalent in our society," Congressman Simpson said. "At some point our nation's citizens are going to have to take responsibility for their own actions in a way generations of Americans did prior to the late 20th century. I'm proud to be a part of this effort to reduce frivolous lawsuits and protect honest businesses from the unwarranted harassment of overzealous trial lawyers."
