CONGRATULATING TOBY GASS -- (Extensions of Remarks - October 11, 2004)
SPEECH OF
HON. C. L. "BUTCH" OTTER
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2004
Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the academic achievement and great promise of graduate student Toby Gass, who is studying Forest Resources at the University of Idaho.
Toby is being honored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as recipient of a prestigious Science To Achieve Results, or STAR fellowship, through the EPA's Greater Research Opportunities program.
She is only the second Idaho student ever to win such an award, and the first since 1999. Only 22 graduate students nationwide are receiving STAR-GRO fellowships for 2004, and I am extremely proud that one of them is from Idaho's 1st District.
The EPA's STAR graduate fellowship program is the only federal program exclusively for students pursuing advanced degrees in environmental sciences. It is highly competitive, with only 7 percent of applicants being awarded fellowships.
Toby and the other STAR fellowship recipients clearly are the best and brightest of America's future environmental scientists. These brilliant men and women will lead the way to unimaginable advances in more efficiently managing our natural resources and protecting human health and safety.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Toby Gass and all the STAR-GRO fellowship winners for their achievement, and thank them for their groundbreaking work, from which we all will benefit.
