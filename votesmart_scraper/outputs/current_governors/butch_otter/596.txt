Prison Overcrowding
by C.L. "Butch" Otter Â— last modified 2006-01-11 02:06 PM
The chronic problem of prison overcrowding is among state government's greatest challenges.
Keeping our citizens safe is among the most important responsibilities that the Constitution and common sense dictate the government must fulfill. While that responsibility must be carefully balanced against the cost to taxpayers, this is one area where we must err on the side of caution.
There can be no balancing the issue of costs against the pain and fear caused by the violent, high-profile crimes against Idahoans that make headlines every day.
Drug and alcohol addiction is a contributing factor in over 80 percent of our inmate population. Idaho has been proactive in establishing juvenile and adult offender drug courts and mental health courts that require offenders to shoulder part of the cost. Statistics bear out that such measures reduce recidivism. However, we lack the capacity right now for all the eligible offenders to participate. Expanding those specialized courts will help return productive citizens to society while saving the state money on incarceration.
We also need to develop innovative ways of evaluating offenders, improving treatment effectiveness and reducing costs both in the public and private arenas. That's where states like Idaho truly can be laboratories of democracy and act boldly to put new ideas to work. Many good ideas already are on the table.
However, there is a segment of our population that belongs behind bars. We cannot ignore that costly reality. Nobody wants to spend our hard-earned money building more prisons. But I'll do it if it means keeping dangerous criminals off our streets and away from our children. Their safety is far too dear, and the alternative is far more costly than any of us is willing to bear.
We can and will be more efficient and effective in fulfilling that proper role of government.
As always - Idaho, "Esto Perpetua"
