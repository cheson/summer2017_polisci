Significant Economic News For Idaho Thanks To Governor Otter's Leadership
Press Release

Location: Boise, ID

Today marks the end of a very successful week for the state of Idaho, its economy and job growth. Just this week, one company announced its plans for expanding into Idaho, while another existing Idaho company announced plans to expand within the state.
Amy's Kitchen, the nation's leading maker of organic convenience food, announced an expansion to the Pocatello area, which will create over 1,000 new jobs. One day after that announcement, Kochava, a worldwide leader in mobile attribution analytics and optimization, revealed plans to expand operations in Sandpoint which will result in 50 new jobs that will pay over $62,000 annually.
"My democrat opponent's campaign is only based around empty ideas with no substance so he's doing everything he can to divert attention from all of the good news across the state as a result of my administration's hard work," said Governor Otter. "The Tax Reimbursement Incentive that went into effect this summer has already produced a huge pipeline for the state of Idaho. I am excited for the momentum we've created to keep Idaho's economy1 and job growth2 ahead of other states."
The Governor's new Tax Reimbursement Incentive has generated a pipeline of dozens of companies looking to expand or relocate to the tune of 4,900 jobs and over $3.0 billion in capital investment. SkyWest was the first company to take advantage of the incentive that went in to effect in July 2014. The company is building a $20 million maintenance facility in Boise, which will create 50 to 100 high wage job opportunities.
