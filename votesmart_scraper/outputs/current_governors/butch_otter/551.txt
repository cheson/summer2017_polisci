EXTENDING DEADLINE FOR COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION OF CERTAIN HYDROELECTRIC PROJECTS IN CONNECTICUT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. OTTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 971, a bill to provide license extensions of time to begin construction of three hydroelectric projects in Connecticut: the 440 kilowatt Hale project, the 373 kilowatt Collinsville Upper and the 1.1 megawatt Collinsville Lower projects. The bill extends the start time period for construction until May 30, 2007, for all three projects, and also authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the time and the start date by two additional 2-year periods.
These renewable hydroelectric projects will provide a boost to the local economy, remove river debris and enhance fishery resources by constructing fish ladders. They also provide a valuable new resource of hydroelectric energy in the New England area.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
