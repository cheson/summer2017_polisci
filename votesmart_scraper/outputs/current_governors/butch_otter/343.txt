Governor Otter Says Proposal Lacks Leadership and Credibility
Statement

Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in response to a proposal to raise fees on trucks traveling on Idaho highways.
"I can understand wanting to have the perfect solution in a campaign cycle, but the bottom line is the task force has not completed its work, we need to respect its bi-partisan process. Leadership requires we deal with reality rather than theory. There are many factors to consider, but once again my Democrat opponent chooses to posture and ignore reality--his plan simply shows a lack of leadership and credibility."
Lt. Governor Brad Little, as Chairman of the Governor's Transportation Task Force, added:
"Talking about a tax cut when what he's really proposing is hiding a tax increase from consumers might be good politics, but it's very bad public policy. This idea shows that Mr. Allred is not credible, out of touch with the marketplace and the realities of Idaho's transportation needs -- even our immediate needs and realistic options, much less addressing a long-term solution."
