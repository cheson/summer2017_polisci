Governor Otter has worked to EMPOWER IDAHOANS by:
*Bringing broadband Internet access to schools throughout Idaho.
*Creating more community college and career-training opportunities throughout Idaho.
*Ensuring money doesn't keep Idaho students out of college or career training by creating the Opportunity Scholarship Trust Fund -- now almost $20 million strong -- and by growing the Governor's Cup Scholarship program.
*Fighting Obamacare while also creating an Idaho-based health insurance exchange to ensure Idaho's voices and values are maintained in that process.
