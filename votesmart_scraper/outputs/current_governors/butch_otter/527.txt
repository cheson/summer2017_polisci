NEW VALLEY COUNTY COMMISSIONER NAMED GOVERNOR APPOINTS GORDON CRUICKSHANK TO FILL VACANCY
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter today appointed Gordon L. Cruickshank, a veteran road department employee, to fill the Valley County Commission vacancy left by the May 1 resignation of Commissioner Tom Kerr.
"My desire is to represent the interest of the Valley County citizens, use common sense when making decisions, listen to people's concerns, work cooperatively with other agencies, and provide an enjoyable place for us to work and play," Cruickshank wrote in applying for the post.
Cruickshank is a 1973 McCall-Donnelly High School graduate. He has worked for the Valley County Road Department for 16 years, the last 10 years as a superintendent. His job has included supervision of the Valley County Road and Bridge Department. Cruickshank previously was employed by Alan Hess Construction. He and his wife, Alyce, live just northwest of Lake Fork.
"Gordon has deep roots in Valley County. He's a husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather who is committed to his family, his community and our state," Governor Otter said. "I have no doubt he will make a great county commissioner, and I'm proud to be able to appoint him."
