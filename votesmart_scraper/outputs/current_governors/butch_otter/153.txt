Appellate Court Stays Federal Magistrate's Same-Sex Marriage Decision
Statement

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement about today's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' temporary stay on U.S. Magistrate Candy Dale's ruling that the Idaho Constitution's definition of marriage is unconstitutional. The appellate decision voids Dale's 9 a.m. Friday enforcement order.
"I appreciate the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stepping in to ensure Idaho will not have to endure the same kind of chaos and confusion that Utah faced after a similar lower-court decision. Today's ruling stays the federal magistrate's order and maintains the status of marriage as defined by the Idaho Constitution -- between one man and one woman. Meanwhile, I am proceeding with an aggressive challenge in the appellate court. I'm hopeful for a better outcome, but in any event I am committed to defending our Constitution and the will of Idaho voters."
