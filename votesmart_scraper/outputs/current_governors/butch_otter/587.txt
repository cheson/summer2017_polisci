Alternative Forms Of Energy

Protecting our air and water, and the health of our families, has to be the foremost consideration.
Any proposal for a power plant - whether it's coal-fired, gas-fired, biomass, hydro, solar or wind - should be subject to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and every other pertinent environmental regulation. The state also must review requests from power plant applicants before allowing a change in how their water right is used.
In each and every case, the state should rigorously review proposals with a keen eye for safety and environmental compliance before granting a permit to proceed.
Any discussion of the siting process for power plants must include assurances that the public will be involved every step of the way. Even so, advocates of stripping county commissioners of authority to decide whether a plant should be located in their county must remember: They run the risk of allowing unelected, unaccountable state bureaucrats to ultimately approve building a power plant in a county that doesn't want it.
All these points should be considered in the context of Idaho's future energy needs. For many years now we have had the benefit of relatively inexpensive hydroelectric power to meet most of our energy needs. However, Idaho now is a net importer of electricity, and the demand will outstrip the supply more and more as our population and economy continue to grow.
Electricity costs across much of Idaho have increased almost 25 percent in the past 10 years. Like it or not, meeting energy needs will be a key to our future development, and to the opportunities and competitive advantage we pass on to our children and grandchildren.
