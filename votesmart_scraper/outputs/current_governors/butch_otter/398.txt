Press Release

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter provided members of the Idaho Legislature today with a breakdown of the input he received from Idaho citizens who went online to offer their advice on how to make State government more efficient and effective.

Of 493 total submissions registered on the http://efficiency.idaho.gov Web site, Governor Otter said 78 already are implemented or are being implemented, and nearly 300 are being referred to State agencies for further review.
The most common suggestions were related to increasing energy efficiency in State building, including the newly renovated Capitol. "I'm pleased to report that hundreds of State-owned buildings throughout Idaho are outfitted with such improvements as better insulation, high-efficiency light bulbs, and motion sensors that turn out the lights and turn down the heat when rooms are unoccupied," the Governor wrote in a letter to legislators.
Other suggestions included consolidating agencies to eliminate duplication of services, initiating a zero-base budget review, promoting green industries, consolidating State agency fleets, and allowing State employees to telecommute -- all of which have been implemented or are before the Legislature for approval.
"I will continue searching for innovative ways to meet the needs of the people of Idaho while ensuring accountability, efficiency and fiscal responsibility," Governor Otter wrote to legislators. "I also encourage you to share your expertise and innovative ideas using the Web site's public forum."
