"The days are gone when we could simply depend on year-to-year snowfall or even our reservoir system to maintain our water supply. We must more actively manage our water resources to ensure long-term sustainability for our communities, our commerce and our citizens."
Starting with his first-of-its-kind Water Summit in the spring of 2007, Governor Otter has been at the forefront of advocating for active management of Idaho's precious water resources. His close personal attention to the issue resulted in development of the Comprehensive Aquifer Management Plan for the sole-source Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer. It broke new ground by taking innovative approaches to aquifer recharge. It reaffirmed the "first in time, first in right" foundation of Idaho water rights, and it brought groundwater users, pump irrigators, municipalities, industry and other stakeholders to the table for continuing dynamic discussions of how best to use, maintain and improve conditions for water users throughout Idaho. Just as importantly, Governor Otter heeded the warnings of experts and supported what now are considered national best practices in protecting Idaho waters from such destructive and costly invasive species as zebra mussels and quagga mussels.
