OPINION: OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP FUND IS AN INVESTMENT IN IDAHO'S FUTURE
Years from now, when my time as your governor and the terms of all today's legislators have passed, one of the accomplishments of which we should be most proud is that thousands of students who had little hope of doing so will pursue higher education right here in Idaho.
More than any buildings, highways, court appointments or collaborative agreements, those students are a legacy for this generation of state leaders.
They are Idaho's hope, and Idaho's future.
But that future can only be assured with your help.
Last year the Idaho Legislature approved $10 million of the $30 million I requested to create an Opportunity Scholarship Trust Fund - a needs-based program to ensure that deserving Idaho students have the means to pursue higher academic or professional-technical education. Legislators also approved $2 million for the first round of scholarships.
It was a good start. As someone who needed some help of my own as a young student, I commend them.
Now post-secondary education is a reality for more than 600 students from communities throughout Idaho who might otherwise have been unable to achieve their educational or career goals.
