Idaho Teachers Receive High Marks -- The State's Return on Investment in Education Ranks Third
Press Release

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter has always said: "it's not only how much money you spend, but how you spend the money that counts." According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's State-by-State Report Card, Governor Otter is right. The report card shows Idaho is ranked third in the nation for the Best Return on Investment in K-12 Education.
This ranking comes on the heels of a report from the National Center for Education Statistics which shows that Idaho eighth graders are tied for 8th in the nation in reading and tied for 15th in math. And according to Idaho's own assessments, 90% of Idaho students met the state reading standards and 82% met math standards.
Idaho's high marks in education are due in large part to the hard work and dedication of Idaho teachers.
"My Democrat opponent's continued criticism of our education system is a disservice to Idaho's teachers and students who are working hard each day and who are actually outperforming most across the country," said Otter. "Do we have more work to do? Of course we do. That's why I assembled a bi-partisan task force that included stakeholders from all facets of education to come up with a plan for the future of education in Idaho. That plan includes 20 recommendations that I intend to fully implement in a five-year timeframe."
