"We need the best and brightest of our Idaho young people to get their educations here and stay here for productive and fulfilling careers. Providing world-class educational opportunities for our citizens isn't just the smart thing to do; it's the right thing to do."
For Governor Otter, education is the key to economic and social well-being and Idaho's future prosperity. It is a fundamental and proper role of state government. Governor Otter is committed to rewarding innovation, creativity and what works for Idaho students -- K-through-Career! He is committed to raising achievement standards in Idaho classrooms and to creating opportunities in rural Idaho communities on a par with any in the world. The Idaho Education Network is opening doors and expanding horizons for students all over Idaho with state-of-the-art technology and connectivity. The College of Western Idaho is enabling thousands of new students and mid-career workers to get the more affordable education and training they need. And the Opportunity Scholarship Fund is providing help and hope so financial need won't keep Idaho's best students from living up to their own greatest potential.
