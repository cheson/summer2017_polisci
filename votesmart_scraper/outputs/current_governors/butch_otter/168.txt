"My goal is to make Idaho a place where individuals and communities are empowered to succeed, where the entrepreneurial spirit is celebrated, and where today's good ideas can become tomorrow's new careers and industries."
Governor Otter is leaving no stone unturned in enabling creation of more and better career opportunities for Idahoans. Just ask the folks at Chobani, Clif Bar, Monsanto, Glanbia, McCain Foods, Frulact, Plexus, Involta and many others. He launched "Project 60" to grow our economy by harnessing Idaho's resources, talents and entrepreneurial spirit and leveraging them with public-private partnerships that work in the marketplace and our communities. From seeking out the wisdom and celebrating the success of the innovative people creating economic opportunity to expanding broadband capabilities throughout rural Idaho, and from aggressively recruiting businesses to move here from states where taxes and the regulatory environment are less stable and predictable to enabling seamless growth and responsive government for businesses already here, Governor Otter is spreading the word that we're better prepared than ever to "Accelerate Idaho!"
