Press Release
By: Butch Otter
Date: Dec. 28, 2009
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter will hear from representatives of the finance community on Tuesday, January 5th, at the Governor's Finance Summit, focusing on how to make working capital more available for Idaho businesses.
Governor Otter, Lieutenant Governor Brad Little, Department of Commerce Director Don Dietrich and Department of Finance Director Gavin Gee will hear testimony from four panels comprised of 19 members of Idaho's finance community.
The Finance Summit will take place from 1-5 p.m. at the Washington Group Plaza Theater Complex, 720 E. Park Blvd., in Boise.
Panelists who have been invited to speak are from banks, investment groups, and from federal and state organizations that provide loans and grants to private businesses. They will offer suggestions on what State government can do to spur Idaho's economic growth by helping to make capital more accessible.
"I heard from industry leaders at my Business Summit and again at my Innovation Summit last fall that getting the financing they need to grow, relocate or get started is a big hurdle to our economic recovery," Governor Otter said. "We want to hear from the people who know best how we can help get the money moving to create more career-path jobs and renewed prosperity for all of us."
The format of the panel sessions will involve brief presentations by industry panelists followed by a roundtable discussion. A report, including recommendations for addressing Idaho's capital needs, will subsequently be delivered to the Governor.
The Finance Summit is part of Governor Otter's Project 60 initiative to grow job opportunities in the state and increase Idaho's gross domestic product to $60 billion.
