While some unanticipated challenges left it with a grade of "Incomplete," Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter said today that the 2015 session of the Idaho Legislature should be remembered for achieving historic improvements for Idaho schools and starting to address Idaho's transportation needs.
"We continued making sustainable, responsible investments in our public schools and in the educators on whom our children rely. We broke through years of inertia and created a framework for meeting our long-term transportation revenue requirements. And we passed a balanced budget that reflects our commitment to keeping government's growth below the growth of our economy," Governor Otter said. "Yes, there's some unfinished business and a little disappointment, but mostly what I see is a lot of real, tangible and lasting progress for the citizens of Idaho."
