Press Release

Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter today applauded a decision by the U.S. Department of Energy approving a loan guarantee for the construction of the Eagle Rock Uranium Enrichment Plant near Idaho Falls. The French based AREVA company expects the plant to create 400 permanent jobs and as many as 1,000 construction jobs in eastern Idaho.
Governor Otter who has championed Idaho's efforts to promote green and renewable energy alternatives hailed today's announcement. "DOE's decision is great news for AREVA and Idaho," said Governor Otter. "The loan guarantee confirms that Idaho continues to lead the nuclear renaissance in America. The decision also paves the way for new careers and economic recovery across the state."
Last month Governor Otter sent Secretary of Energy Steven Chu a letter urging approval of the AREVA loan guarantee. "Having the loan guarantee for the AREVA enrichment facility authorized quickly is of great interest and concern to me," the Governor wrote. "The potential economic benefit to the people of my state also is substantial." Idaho's Congressional Delegation has also played an important role in helping secure this loan guarantee.
Through Governor Otter's efforts Idaho beat four other states under consideration for the AREVA plant including Washington, Ohio, Texas and New Mexico. AREVA selected Idaho Falls, Idaho in May of 2008.
