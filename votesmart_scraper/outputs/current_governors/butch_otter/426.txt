Press Release
By: Butch Otter
Date: Oct. 5, 2009
Location: Boise, ID

What Idaho citizens need from their roads and bridges will be the focus of the second meeting of the Governor's Task Force on Modernizing Transportation Funding, set for 9 a.m. Thursday, October 8, in Boise's Joe R. Williams Building.
The Governor's task force will examine and recommend traditional and non-traditional ways Idaho can fund the maintenance and preservation of highways and bridges now and in the future. The Idaho Legislature passed a concurrent resolution earlier this year supporting a task force, and Governor Otter created it in June through Executive Order 2009-11.
The task force will meet over 18 months and make recommendations throughout the process to the Governor, with a final report due no later than December 1, 2010. The Governor said he would welcome the task force's findings and recommendations as soon as they are ready.
"The individuals, families and businesses using our highways also are financing them. They deserve real assurance that they are getting what they pay for from our vital transportation corridors," Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter said. "The task force will put some reality behind the rhetoric about maintaining and improving our roads and bridges, and about what it will take to keep our people safe and economically competitive."
The task force is led by Lieutenant Governor Brad Little. It includes five members each from the Idaho House and Senate, four citizens and two members of the Idaho Transportation Board.
