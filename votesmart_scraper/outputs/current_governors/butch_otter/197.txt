Governor Otter Asks Health Insurance Carriers to Consider Reinstating Coverage

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter asked Idaho health insurance carriers today to consider reinstating coverage for individuals and small businesses whose policies were terminated as a result of Obamacare requirements that take effect January 1.
"We're not going to tell them how to run their business. I proposed and the Legislature enacted a state-based healthcare insurance exchange law that was designed to maximize flexibility for consumers and carriers under Obamacare," the Governor said. "If they can see their way clear, I hope they'll consider reinstating those policies. But I'm not going to add another layer of government restrictions on the marketplace."
It became clear soon after the launch of the federal Health Insurance Marketplaces that the rules of Obamacare were inconsistent with the President's repeated promise that enrollees could opt to keep their existing coverage and provider networks. In response to public outcries, the Obama administration gave individual states the option of allowing carriers to temporarily reinstate policies that were cancelled for failure to meet "essential health benefits package standards."
Governor Otter said he talked with carriers about their options, studied the approaches being taken in other states and opted today to ask insurance companies to continue coverage. "I'm confident they'll act in the best interest of their customers."
Any Idaho residents whose existing policies have been terminated or are scheduled to be terminated as a result of Obamacare coverage requirements should contact their chosen carrier or the Idaho Department of Insurance for more information.
