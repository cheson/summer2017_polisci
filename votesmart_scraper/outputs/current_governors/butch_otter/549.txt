SWIFT CREEK HYDROELECTRIC LICENSE EXTENSION BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. OTTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 244, the Swift Creek Hydroelectric License Extension Bill, authorizing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the time specified in the project license to begin construction of the Swift Creek Hydroelectric Project for three 2-year periods, a total of 6 years.
The Swift Creek Project is a 1.5 megawatt project in Wyoming. This bill has passed the Senate with unanimous consent, and passage of the bill today will send this bill directly to the President's desk and allow the further development of clean renewable hydroelectric power. I urge my colleagues to support S. 244.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
