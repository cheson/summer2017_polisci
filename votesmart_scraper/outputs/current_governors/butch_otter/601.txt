House Votes To Protect Private Property Rights

Idaho Lawmakers join effort to limit Eminent Domain Powers.
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressmen C.L. "Butch" Otter and Mike Simpson voted with the 376-38 House majority Thursday for legislation to counter the U.S. Supreme Court's outrageous decision potentially giving government virtually unlimited power over private property.
Otter and Simpson both are cosponsors of the bipartisan Private Property Rights Protection Act, H.R. 4128. It marks an important step toward restoring the intent of the Constitution's clear 12-word directive in the Fifth Amendment: "nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation."
The Supreme Court turned more than two centuries of constitutional interpretation and legal precedent on its head in June with a 5-4 decision in Kelo v. City of New London. The high court's action exposed our homes, places of business and all private property to the threat of forced sale by the government when it sees the potential for greater economic benefit.
In the Kelo case that simply meant more tax revenue could be generated by a commercial project than by the private homes condemned by a Connecticut city under its power of eminent domain. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in dissent that the Supreme Court's action ensured
"the specter of condemnation hangs over all property; nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory."
To begin setting things right, the Private Property Rights Protection Act bans states and cities that have received federal development grants during the previous year from using their eminent domain power for economic development. That is defined as a "commercial enterprise carried on for profit or to increase tax revenues, tax base, employment or general economic health."
The bill also imposes a two-year ban on any federal funds going to communities that use their eminent domain power for economic development. It specifically excludes from such restrictions any use of eminent domain authority for public utilities, railroads or rights-of-way for such things as pipelines.
"Most of the heavy lifting to fix this mess will have to come at the state and local levels. But it's up to Congress to check overreaching by other branches of government, and to ensure that the unconstitutional taking of private property is not rewarded, encouraged or condoned," Congressman Otter said. "Eminent domain is a powerful tool. But like any tool, it can be dangerous if used inappropriately. This bill sends a clear message about what is and is not appropriate."
"We cannot allow the government to take land from one person in order to enrich another," Congressman Simpson said. "The 'Takings Clause' in the Fifth Amendment to our Constitution was designed to protect private property." Unfortunately, the recent Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. City of New London did just the opposite. That's why I'm proud to join my colleagues in supporting the Private Property Rights Protection Act and protecting the Constitutional rights of all Americans."
