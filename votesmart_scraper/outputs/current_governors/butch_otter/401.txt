Members of the Governor's Task Force on Modernizing Transportation Funding will continue discussing Idaho's transportation needs during their fourth meeting, scheduled for 1 p.m. Thursday, February 18th, in the Capitol Building's Garden Level West Wing, Room 2.
The Task Force also will hear from the chairman of a new seven-member subcommittee that will consider Idaho's long-term public transportation needs and funding options.
David Bennion of Boise, a retired engineering firm executive, will serve as chairman of the subcommittee. Bennion has almost 40 years of infrastructure development experience, and led a gubernatorial and regional task force. He held leadership positions with the Public Works Licensing Board, Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce, Boise Economic Development Council and various civic organizations.
The other subcommittee members include State Senators Shawn Keough and Chuck Winder, State Representatives Marv Hagedorn, Leon Smith and Bill Killen, and Valley County Commissioner Gordon Cruickshank.
"We're looking for better ways to leverage State, federal, local and private funding to provide more effective public transportation for Idaho," Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter said. "Better coordination will lead to improved service, less congestion and cleaner air. It's up to this subcommittee to explore how to get all that done in a sustainable way and within the people's means."
The Governor's Task Force will examine and recommend traditional and non-traditional ways Idaho can fund its transportation system needs now and in the future.
