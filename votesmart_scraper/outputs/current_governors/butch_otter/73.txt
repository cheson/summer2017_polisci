Boise City Council President Maryanne Jordan Appointed to Idaho Senate
Press Release
By: Butch Otter
Date: March 6, 2015
Location: Boise

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced the appointment today of Maryanne Jordan of Boise to fill the District 17 Senate vacancy left by the resignation of former Democratic Boise Senator Elliot Werk.
Jordan was among three nominees submitted to the Governor by the District 17 Democratic Legislative Committee and is the current President of the Boise City Council, having served on that body since 2003. She will serve out the remainder of Werk's term in the Idaho Senate.
"I believe Maryanne has proven herself to be a dedicated public servant with a long track record of notable achievement and civic leadership," said Governor Otter. "I have every confidence that she will continue that laudable legacy as the newest member of the Idaho Legislature."
The vacancy was created when Governor Otter appointed Werk to the Idaho Tax Commission last month. The other nominees were Nicholas A. Warden and Larraine Evans Clayton.
"I would like to thank Governor Otter for this appointment," said Jordan. "Thanks also to former Senator Werk for his long and distinguished service. I am honored and humbled to serve district 17 in the senate. Jumping in mid-session will be a steep learning curve, but I am confident that I am up to the challenge."
Jordan has a Bachelor's degree in Political Science for San Jose State University and is also a graduate of the Citizen's Police Academy and Citizen's Law Academy. She and her husband Rocky have lived in Boise since 1994. Jordan has two stepchildren and five grandchildren.
