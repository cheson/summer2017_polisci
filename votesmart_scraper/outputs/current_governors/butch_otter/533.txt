GOVERNOR PRESENTS TEACHERS WITH Â‘GIANTS' HONORS
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter today honored three Idaho science teachers with the GIANTS Award at a ceremony at the Discovery Center of Idaho.
Lewiston High School teacher Gregory Thompson, Clair E. Gale Junior High School (Idaho Falls) teacher JoAnn Bodell, and Bellevue Elementary School teacher Krista Jones each received $2,000 as recipients of the Governor's Industry Award for Notable Teaching in Science (GIANTS).
"Greg, JoAnn and Krista exemplify the dedication, innovation and initiative necessary to advance science and technology instruction for Idaho students," Governor Otter said. "They are providing educational opportunities that connect their students with real-world applications to help prepare them to become the scientists, engineers, inventors and entrepreneurs of the future. Our students, industry and state are very fortunate to have educators with the enthusiasm, creativity and commitment of these three individuals."
The GIANTS program was initiated by the Office of the Governor and sponsored by the Science and Technology Roundtable, a group of industry leaders including the Micron Foundation, Idaho National Laboratory, Washington Group International and Hewlett-Packard. With support from the Idaho Department of Commerce and Labor's Office of Science and Technology, the State Department of Education and Office of the State Board of Education, as well as the Discovery Center of Idaho, GIANTS recognizes teachers for their efforts to link industry and the economic future of Idaho to the classroom through the enhancement of science and technology education.
Honorable Mention awards of $500 each were presented to three additional teachers: Tammy Sewell from West Park Elementary School in Moscow, Norma Johnson from Jerome Middle School and Judy Wages from Bonners Ferry High School.
All the participating teachers were nominated by the student council and/or parent groups at their school for the impact they have made on students by bringing science to life. A cash prize of $500 goes to each school/student council that nominated the GIANTS award recipients, with a cash prize of $100 going to each school/student council that nominated the Honorable Mention award recipients.
All the GIANTS partners are firmly committed to enhancing science and technology education and consider it the backbone of Idaho's future economic success. The Governor and the industry partners are pleased to recognize the achievements and significant contributions of these educators.
