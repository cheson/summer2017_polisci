BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. OTTER. Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman knows, the State of Idaho has an agreement with the United States Department of Energy, enforceable by the courts, that prohibits commercial spent nuclear fuel from coming into the Idaho National Laboratory for storage.
Would the language contained within the report in any way change the existing law or alter the provisions of the State of Idaho's agreement with the Department of Energy?
Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, no, it would not.
Mr. OTTER. I thank the gentleman very much for that clarification.
