Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter today announced the appointment of John Tippets of Bennington to fill the Idaho Senate vacancy for District 31 left by the resignation of Senator Bob Geddes, who was appointed chairman of the State Tax Commission last month.
Tippets, 59, will fill Geddes' unexpired term, which runs through 2012. He previously served in the Idaho House of Representatives from 1989 through 2000, rising to the offices of Majority Caucus chairman and chairman of the House State Affairs Committee.
"I would like to thank the central committee of Legislative District 31 and Governor Otter for the confidence they have shown in me by nominating and appointing me to the State Senate. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to represent the people of District 31," Tippets said. "I will work hard to represent their interests and the interests of the entire state. I recognize we are facing some serious challenges as a state, but I am confident we will be able to find viable solutions."
"John has never stopped being involved in developing good public policy and standing up for his neighbors and all of Idaho. He's a very able legislator who will bring another responsible voice to the Idaho Senate," Governor Otter said. "The Republican Party has a deep bench in District 31, and John Tippets will admirably fill the void left by Bob Geddes' move to the Tax Commission."
Tippets is human resources manager for Agrium Inc. in southeastern Idaho. He has a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University and a master's degree in human resources management from Utah State University. He and his wife, Nancy, have nine children and 22 grandchildren.
