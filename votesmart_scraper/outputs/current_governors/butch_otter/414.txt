Governor Blasts Latest Senate Maneuver On Health Care
Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: Dec. 22, 2009
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to this week's Senate vote clearing the way for further action on the Administration's health care plan.
"The deal making; the arm twisting; the ends-justify-the-means attitude that we saw with the Senate's most recent vote on so-called health care "reform' is exactly what got us into this trouble to begin with. I'm in agreement with the Idaho congressional delegation's conclusion that this does nothing to solve the escalating cost of health care. I'll keep working with our delegation and my fellow governors to stop this latest example of the feds ramming through a "solution' that satisfies the Administration's base at the expense of our children and grandchildren."
