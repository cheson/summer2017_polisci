Idaho Welcomes New Budget Year With Financial House in Order
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter said today that the State of Idaho ended the fiscal year through June 30 with a balanced budget - as required by the Idaho Constitution - and with its financial house in order.
The Governor thanked the Legislature, his fellow constitutional officers, and the people of Idaho for their support of the public servants who are carefully and responsibly managing the tax dollars with which they are entrusted.
As State Treasurer Ron Crane put it in a recent statement, "our frugal, essentially conservative manner of fiscal government allows our citizens to benefit, sometimes in unseen ways, from the stability this style of leadership provides. We pay our bills, on time and as promised."
"Our system of safeguards, checks and balances works. But it only works as well as the people who operate it. And that, in turn, is a direct reflection on the citizens whose values and civic virtue are carried forward by their public servants," Governor Otter said. "As we begin what figures to be another difficult budget cycle, we remain committed to ensuring that the precious resources of our people are protected and used as efficiently and effectively as possible."
Idaho has gained a national reputation for responsible financial management. The State consistently gets top marks from nationwide financial rating services. That is a direct result of a safe, sound and cautious approach to management that keeps Idaho ahead of the economic curve.
