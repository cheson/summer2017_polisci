Today, Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the Hobby Lobby case and his Democrat opponent's support of President Obama's liberal policies.
"Like his support for same-sex marriage, the Hobby Lobby case provides a vivid example of how my Democrat opponent's support for Obamacare and President Obama would undermine Idaho values. As governor, this Boise Democrat would not only support Obamacare, he would happily go along with Obama's attempts to repress religious freedom and individual rights," said Governor Otter.
