National Rifle Association Endorses Otter
Statement

Location: Boise, ID

The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund has endorsed Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter, on behalf of the five million members across the country, calling Governor Otter, "a champion of Second Amendment rights."
"I greatly appreciate the NRA's confidence in my work and the association's support. This endorsement is very important to me because I strongly believe in the protection of the Second Amendment for Idahoans. I've heard the arguments about the Second Amendment being a relic of a bygone era and that our public policies must evolve with our society and priorities. But I believe individual liberty as expressed in the Bill of Rights is the linchpin of our form of government and our viability as a free people."
Governor Otter's Democrat opponent supports gun regulations and also refused to complete the NRA's questionnaire.
