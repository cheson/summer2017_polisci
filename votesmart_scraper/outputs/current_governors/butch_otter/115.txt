Press Release

Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against the State of Idaho's constitutional prohibition on same-sex marriage. The ruling came a day after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider appeals from similar decisions in other federal jurisdictions.
"Today's decision by the 9th Circuit is disappointing, but not unexpected. I will carefully evaluate the opinion, along with yesterday's surprising decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, and talk with legislative leaders and the Attorney General before determining our path forward. The stay on same-sex marriage in Idaho remains in effect until we are directed otherwise by the 9th Circuit."
