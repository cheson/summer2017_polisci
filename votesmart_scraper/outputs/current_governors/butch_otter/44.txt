Governor Otter Reacts to Interior Decision on Greater Sage-Grouse Measures
Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: Sept. 15, 2015
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in response to Interior Secretary Jewell's announcement that an Endangered Species Act protective designation for the greater sage-grouse is "not warranted."
"While I appreciate Secretary Jewell's public recognition of local and state efforts to preserve the species and its habitat, the question behind a "not warranted' determination is: "At what cost'? For months now, the federal government's initially transparent and collaborative process has been replaced by closed-door meetings and internal memoranda. That's resulted in a land management scheme for sage-grouse habitat that remains a mystery to property owners and state and local wildlife advocates alike. The feds are asking us to trust them. It's not that simple and unfortunately this is far from over. I remain committed to doing what's best for the species and the people of Idaho."
