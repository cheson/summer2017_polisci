Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter lauded the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision on Tuesday to withdraw its proposal to list the North American wolverine as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). "This is an important decision and one we welcome," said Governor Otter. "This determination by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is a victory for common sense and science," he said.
The Governor opposed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's original proposal, which claimed wolverines qualified as threatened because of the future threat from climate change, despite the fact that the species' population has been steadily increasing over the last several decades. In fact, Idaho supports one of the strongest wolverine populations in the west and is home to some of the best habitat.
Comments submitted by the Governor's Office of Species Conservation (OSC) and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) were instrumental in pointing out the flaws within the proposal. "I want to commend both OSC and IDFG for providing the necessary data which played an important role during the determination process," said Governor Otter.
Specifically, the State criticized the Service for attempting to list a species based on highly uncertain climate predictions when current data shows that wolverine populations are expanding and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future.
