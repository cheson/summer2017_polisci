"I don't care if it's foreign extremists or my own government, I won't surrender my God-given freedom to anyone in the name of security. And I will fight any attempt to dilute, erode or simply ignore the protections that our Constitution affords to every American citizen."
After six years in Congress, Governor Otter returned home convinced that states -- the laboratories of the republic -- are where real change must start if we are to restore our union to what the Founders intended. That means a focus on leadership and innovative solutions developed at the local and state levels rather than constitutionally questionable unfunded mandates, wealth redistribution schemes and top-down solutions imposed on states and citizens from Washington, D.C. Continuing the tone he set in Congress by standing virtually alone to protect our constitutional rights against USA PATRIOT Act intrusions, Governor Otter has become a national leader not just in opposing federal violations of 10th Amendment protections and asserting legitimate state sovereignty, but in pursuing local solutions and greater self-determination -- like his support for keeping the federal government out of Idahoans' 2nd Amendment gun rights within our own state. He is fighting Endangered Species Act efforts to undermine Idaho's own grassroots conservation efforts, and he is working to overcome endless delays by the federal bureaucracy on the responsible use of Idaho's public lands. Finally, his Capital for a Day program brings state government to the people of small, rural communities throughout Idaho, empowering citizens to actively engage in determining their own future.
