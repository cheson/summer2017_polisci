Governor Otter believes that the proper role of government has allowed the following during his administration:
*Creating the College of Western Idaho through a vote of citizens in Ada and Canyon counties -- and subsequently watching CWI become the fastest-growing community college in U.S. history.
*Using his Project 60 economic development effort -- the Department of Commerce and other state agencies working together "at the speed of business" to enable the "Magic Valley Miracle" of employers growing in and moving to south-central Idaho.
*Leveling the playing field for non-Indian fuel retailers across Idaho by negotiating agreements with the Coeur d'Alene, Nez Perce, Shoshone-Bannock and Kootenai tribes.
*Reducing grass-field residue burning in northern Idaho without putting growers out of business.
*Protecting the drinking water for hundreds of thousands of Idahoans with waste cleanup agreements at the Idaho National Laboratory.
*Putting Idaho in charge of managing wolves imposed on us by the federal government's Endangered Species Act.
*Actively managing the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer and other water sources for the long-term good of all Idahoans.
