Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter welcomed today's report from the Idaho Department of Labor that Idaho's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent in May and total employment set a record for the ninth month in a row.

"That's a real credit to the confidence that employers are showing in Idaho's economy, but my focus remains on improving the quality of jobs available in Idaho, and ensuring that our workforce is prepared to take them on," Governor Otter said. "This report is great news and very encouraging, but I'm also well aware that we continue to struggle with chronic "underemployment' in Idaho, and my administration is committed to attracting and retaining higher-paying jobs for Idaho citizens."
That effort is the focus of both the Department of Commerce's "Accelerate Idaho" initiative and the Governor's K-through-Career approach to ratcheting up workforce development efforts. That includes implementing the Governor's Education Task Force recommendations for improving public schools, as well as achieving the State Board of Education's goal of at least 60 percent of Idaho citizens ages 25-34 having a post-secondary degree or professional certification by 2020.
"We are crafting more performance-based standards for workforce training. We're investing in more and better professional-technical education programs at our universities and community colleges. And we're connecting the dots with public-private partnerships that will help make our education system more responsive than ever to the workforce needs of industry," Governor Otter said.
