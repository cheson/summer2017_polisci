Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right
by C.L. "Butch" Otter Â— last modified 2006-05-08 10:39 AM Republished from the Coeur d'Alene Press
Illegal immigration hurts America, but so does racism, hatred, and violence.
My views about illegal immigration are clear. I oppose it, and I oppose amnesty for those who come here illegally. I have spoken out repeatedly about the need to secure our borders and stop those who are shoplifting citizenship. I voted for and continue to support the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005, which was passed by the House in December.
The ends of financial security and economic opportunity do not justify the means of breaking our laws to obtain it. It is not too much to expect all those who come to our shores to respect our laws, and accept the consequences when those laws are broken.
Situational ethics and eagerness to address immediate labor needs here in America certainly contribute to the problem. However, while poverty and lack of opportunity in Mexico or elsewhere may be good reasons for domestic change in their country, they are not excuses for breaking the laws of our country.
I will continue pressing my colleagues in Congress to secure our borders and preserve the value of American citizenship. Forget world opinion: There are real public policy issues of consequence involved, right here at home - issues of sovereignty and security and how we see ourselves.
However, while Congress and the public continue debating the important issues of border security and immigration reform, I have been disheartened to read headline after headline about one of the most unwelcome impacts of that debate on Hispanics in America.
One recent example in particular summed up the problem: "Extremists Declare 'Open Season' on Immigrants: Hispanics Target of Incitement and Violence."
This is no recitation of liberal dogma or media hype. This is real and disturbing, and unacceptable to the character of our country. A growing number of incidents are being reported in which racists and other hate-mongers are using public concern about immigration as an excuse for acting out against people of Hispanic descent.
Instances of such mindless hatred have been very rare in Idaho, where Hispanics are a vital and constructive part of our fast-growing population and economic tapestry. My message to fellow Idahoans is simple and straightforward: There is no excuse.
We must oppose criminal behavior. Those who enter our country illegally are, by definition, engaging in criminal behavior and must be held accountable. However, there is no excuse for hurting anyone with words or deeds, and there is no excuse for inciting others to hatred or violence against anyone.
To honor what it means to be an American, to have the freedom of expression and the protection of our Constitution and laws, means recognizing and nurturing what unites us rather than what divides us. It means that citizenship is your birthright, but that being worthy of those who earned it with their own sacrifice must be a lifelong pursuit.
I will not stand idly by while a few disaffected Americans cheapen citizenship and discredit us all by appealing to the worst in human nature. It is up to those of us in positions of public trust to lift the veil of shame that hides the ugliest of truths.
More importantly, it's up to all of us - everyone - to reject the kind of blind prejudice and xenophobic nonsense that creates decades and generations and centuries of separation and hostility and retribution. Letting a discussion become a cause risks creating the kind of fractured, embittered nation with which we now find ourselves at war in Afghanistan and Iraq, a nation where we are defined more by our ancestry than our ambition, and more by what we despise than what we value.
That is not my Idaho, and I trust it is not yours.
The vast majority of Idahoans are working with me and other government, community and business leaders toward constructive, reasonable solutions. Yet all it takes for evil to succeed is a few people who would rather blame others for their own misfortunes than redouble their efforts to succeed or seek out new opportunities.
Please don't let those few find a home or hospitality here in Idaho. Please don't answer one crime with another. Please join me in rejecting hatred and embracing "one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all."
As always - Idaho, "Esto Perpetua"
