Governor Otter's Democrat Opponent Out of Touch on Immigration Issue
Press Release

Location: Boise, ID

Despite federal efforts, Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter is making it clear that Idaho is off-limits to the relocation of unaccompanied and illegal immigrants who have entered the United States along the U.S.-Mexico border.
His Democrat opponent says the Governor's position, stated in a letter this week to federal authorities, was written only to score political points.
"That just proves his inexperience. We know now that federal officials have contacted the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, inquiring about placing these immigrants in Idaho. And it appears the feds already have done an end-run around the proper channels to find private housing for eight illegal immigrants here in Idaho. Yet my opponent continues to align himself with the Obama administration, regardless of how it affects Idahoans. He is endorsing the flawed policies and backhanded tactics of the Obama administration that is only making this issue more difficult."
Governor Otter wrote the letter as a preemptive step to protect our state's resources and taxpayers.
"The Obama administration created this humanitarian crisis and now federal officials are looking to states to clean up the mess. Idaho will not open itself to the unwelcome challenges with which other states have struggled at the federal government's hands."
In his letter, Governor Otter also urged Congress to take action to correct loopholes and enforce immigration policy.
