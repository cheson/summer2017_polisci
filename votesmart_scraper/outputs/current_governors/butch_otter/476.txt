Joint Statement Regarding the Ongoing Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
Statement
By: Bill Ritter, Jr. Dave Freudenthal Butch Otter Ted Kulongoski Jon Huntsman, Jr.
Date: Jan. 2, 2009
Location: Unknown

The recent increase in hostilities between Israel and Hamas is evidence that
lasting peace in the region is an elusive goal. The deaths of innocent
civilians on both sides of the border as a result of the hostilities are proof
that we must continue to work toward peace, rather than resolving our
disputes through aggression.
We support the right of Israel to defend itself from aggressors and to
ensure the peace and prosperity of its citizens.
We therefore, are calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities between
Israel and Hamas and the establishment of a lasting and meaningful ceasefire.
For this process to begin, Hamas must end its series of rocket attacks
into Israeli sovereign land. The two sides must then work together in good
faith to work toward peace in the region.
Sincerely,
Jon M. Huntsman, Jr. Dave Freudenthal
Governor of Utah Governor of Wyoming
Ted Kulongoski C.L. "Butch" Otter
Governor of Oregon Governor of Idaho
Bill Ritter
Governor of Colorado
