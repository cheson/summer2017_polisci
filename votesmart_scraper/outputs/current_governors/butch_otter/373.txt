Governor Otter believes that the proper role of government has allowed the following over the last four years:
* Saving taxpayer money by reaching a Snake River water rights settlement with Idaho Power.
* Leveling the playing field for non-Indian fuel retailers across Idaho by negotiating agreements with the Coeur d'Alene, Nez Perce, Shoshone-Bannock and Kootenai tribes.
* Reducing grass-field residue burning in northern Idaho without putting growers out of business.
* Protecting the drinking water for hundreds of thousands of Idahoans with waste cleanup agreements at the Idaho National Laboratory.
* Putting Idaho in charge of managing -- and hunting -- wolves imposed on us by the Feds.
* Managing the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer for the long-term good of all Idahoans.
