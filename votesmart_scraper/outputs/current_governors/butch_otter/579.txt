Turnabout: Reform, Deficit Reduction Helps Everyone

Most people agree that reducing the federal budget deficit must be a priority. It has been among our foremost goals in Congress to reduce growth in discretionary spending and instill a sense of fiscal discipline and responsibility into the way taxpayers' money is spent.
Unfortunately, reining in discretionary spending has little impact on government growth. Mandatory "entitlement" programs - which are not part of the annual budget and make up almost two-thirds of federal outlays - continue growing at an astounding rate.
The House recently passed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, H.R. 4241. It includes no cuts in mandatory spending programs; it only slows their growth rate slightly. However, it does offer the first opportunity in almost 10 years to reevaluate, streamline and reform programs like Medicaid to make them more effective and efficient.
Many of these programs have not been evaluated for decades, and as a result they are hamstrung by useless bureaucracy, duplication, and waste. We now have an opportunity to make these programs - and thus each taxpayer dollar - work better for all Americans.
Still, rumors about entitlement program reforms are running rampant. Many constituents have contacted us with concerns about cutting social welfare spending. We appreciate and respect their apprehension. Unfortunately, Jim Fisher chose to mischaracterize the facts and misinform his readers in a February 3 editorial on the issue.
Jim should put aside his cynicism and consider that even those of us who hold public office are people too. We have families, and loved ones, and friends, many of whom are not as fortunate as we have been. None of us wants the sick, the disabled, the elderly or the poor to suffer.
No one has a corner on humanity. Jim's implication that anyone wants to "throw children off the Medicaid rolls" is the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that debases the public policy debate in America and inhibits constructive solutions.
In reality, the Deficit Reduction Act benefits all Americans by ensuring that public assistance is not diverted to those who do not need it, and by correcting problems of waste and abuse. It makes important changes so that the neediest among us have access to proper healthcare.
Much of the Medicaid savings will come from not overpaying for prescription drugs. Payments for medicine exceeded the true costs by $1.5 billion in 2002 alone. Savings come from changing the payment rate for medicines so that they are based more on the average actual sales price of prescription drugs - not by taking money or benefits away from the poor.
In fact, H.R. 4241 does not cut mandatory spending; it only reduces the rate of growth in these programs by one-tenth of 1 percent over five years.
Reform is the best path to savings. Our social programs benefit neither taxpayers nor those who need them if they are ineffective and inefficient. H.R. 4241 enables us to bring programs like Medicaid into the 21st century, using our taxpayer dollars to their best advantage while enabling the programs to succeed far into the future.
Without reforms, many states will continue being forced to reduce eligibility or even cut hundreds of thousands of truly needy people from the Medicaid program. Failing to act would destroy Medicaid, and that would do no one any good.
As usual, Jim considers it a "cut" whenever government spends less than he prefers. His view typifies a pervasive, self-defeating culture of dependence nurtured by people like Jim who believe the only solution to any problem is more and bigger government - despite the inevitable intrusiveness and loss of privacy and freedom that government involvement brings.
Simply put, this is NOT the government's money to redistribute. It belongs to the millions of individual men and women who earn it by working to support their families. They elect us to ensure government remembers its limits, and whose money it is. That includes deciding how to most effectively and efficiently do the most good with limited resources.
The Deficit Reduction Act takes small but important steps toward responsible federal spending and ensuring that our taxpayers' dollars are used wisely. Every dollar wasted or misdirected to those who should not benefit from Medicaid is a dollar less going to treat the neediest patients. Despite his cynicism, even Jim should support that goal.
As always - Idaho, "Esto Perpetua"
