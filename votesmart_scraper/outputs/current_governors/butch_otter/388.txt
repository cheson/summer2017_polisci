Governor Reacts to House Approval of Healthcare "Reform" Legislation
Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: March 21, 2010
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement tonight in reaction to congressional approval of sweeping healthcare legislation.
"States like Idaho are working hard to create public-private healthcare partnerships and facilitate local solutions. Big federal programs aren't the answer. It's even more important now for patients and practitioners, hospitals and health insurers, employers and employees to work together, because Congress and the White House got it wrong. All this will do is keep states and the marketplace from making healthcare more affordable and accessible while imposing a legacy of untold debt on our children and grandchildren."
