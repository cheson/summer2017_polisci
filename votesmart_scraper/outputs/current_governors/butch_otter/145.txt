Governor Condemns Racist Graffiti On Tribal Lands
Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: July 14, 2014
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement regarding the racist graffiti discovered today on a state historical marker located on Highway 95 inside the Coeur d'Alene Tribal Reservation:
"This kind of hate-filled sentiment has no place in Idaho. Defiling and defacing a historic marker on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation was inappropriate, unacceptable and an attack on our values. Tribal members are our neighbors, friends and fellow Idahoans. This act of bigotry speaks not to the feelings of a majority of Idahoans, but to someone who fundamentally disregards cultural heritage, social order and the freedoms that generations of Americans have sacrificed greatly to protect."
