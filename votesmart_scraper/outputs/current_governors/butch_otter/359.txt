I've been told there are easier ways to jumpstart an economy: Raise taxes and throw "government" money (i.e. your money) from the rooftops. If the problem is that we don't have enough money, then the solution surely is that we must spend more, right?
Does that make any sense? Of course it doesn't. It's a recipe for disaster.
I'm proud that the Idaho Legislature didn't fall into the trap that other states now are in -- raising taxes and trying to spend their way out of deficits. Even now, California is considering another round of tax hikes to reduce their staggering budget deficit. Instead, your legislators and I worked together to make better, more efficient use of your money, and asking everyone to look at the bigger picture and a little further down the road. As a result, Idahoans can rest assured that they won't be taxed or regulated out of their businesses.
As America's and Idaho's economies turn around, opting for stability and predictability is proving to be the right path. Meanwhile, businesses in Oregon, Washington and California will not be as able to enjoy the rewards of a stronger economy as Idaho businesses. Our companies will have a clearer path toward success as they pay less in overall taxes and keep enjoying our one-of-a-kind quality of life.
Take the example of Comtech AHA in Moscow, which made the shift across the Washington border five years ago. The company moved just nine miles -- from Pullman, Wash. to Moscow, Idaho -- and saw immediate savings. Bill Thomson, Comtech's CEO, says the company saved in health insurance costs and workman's compensation insurance. In addition, the company pays less for Idaho's corporate income tax versus Washington's Business and Occupation tax.
