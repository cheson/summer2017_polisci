Press Release

Location: Boise, ID

In the short time since it went into effect on July 1, 2014, Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter's new Tax Reimbursement Incentive is already having a significant impact in encouraging business growth and expansion throughout the state. With a pipeline of 24 projects equating to $2.9 billion in capital investment and 3,800 jobs paying above the average county wage, Idaho has positioned itself to create jobs to take advantage of the pent up demand by industry to grow and expand to meet market demands. Over one-third of the projects being negotiated involve existing Idaho companies leveraging the Tax Reimbursement Incentive to accelerate their plans for growth.
Combined with Governor Otter's K-through-Career plans for workforce development along with Choose Idaho, a recently announced initiative to help business retain, return and recruit employees to help meet the demand for skilled workers, Otter is making Idaho workers a priority. In order to ensure Idaho's workforce is prepared to meet the demands of both new and existing employers, Otter believes we must make it easier for Idaho's workforce to get the education they need to be successful.
"There are also a lot of folks that have certain kinds of jobs that require additional training or continuing education in order to climb the career ladder and we need to make sure they have access to that education. That's why I worked so hard to create the College of Western Idaho, one of the fastest growing community colleges in the United States. By bringing together our colleges and universities, our vocational-technical training centers, our community leaders and industry, we will ensure our citizens are prepared for the careers of today and tomorrow."
