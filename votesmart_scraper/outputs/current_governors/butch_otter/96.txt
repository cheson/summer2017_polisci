Location: Boise, ID

The Otter for Idaho campaign released its fifth campaign advertisement in the general election, featuring Governor Mitt Romney outlining his overwhelming support and endorsement of Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter.
"You've seen a Governor over these last several years that's balanced the budget, that's made this state more and more attractive to start small businesses because this conservative Governor has done the things to help get jobs here," said Romney. "This Governor needs to continue to lead this state and it needs to continue to be an example to the nation."
In the ad, Romney urges voters to head to the polls on Election Day and vote for Governor Otter in order to continue this forward momentum.
"Idahoans overwhelmingly supported Governor Romney during the 2012 presidential election with over 64 percent of the vote, so his willingness to stand up and endorse my campaign is incredibly meaningful," said Otter. "Governor Romney and I are aligned in our conservative values, and I hope that those who supported Governor Romney in 2012 will recognize an ally in my campaign for re-election as Idaho's governor."
