Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter and First Lady Lori Otter announced the recipients today of the Governor's Innovative Grants, recognizing creative and unique teaching methods to inspire children and create lifelong learners.
A total of 75 grants ranging from $200 to $2,000 were awarded to teachers in 40 school districts and charter schools throughout Idaho. The recipients were chosen by an eight-member panel from among 312 applications. The Idaho Legislature appropriated funding for the grants, which are administered by the State Board of Education.
A full list of the recipients is available on the Governor's website at: http://gov.idaho.gov/Innovative%20Grants%20Recipients%20List%202007.pdf

Each grantee will be required to submit a synopsis of their project, which will be posted on the State Board of Education website and the First Lady's website later in the 2007-2008 school year.

"As I said in inviting applications for these grants, I'm forever grateful to the many teachers I have had in my life. Lori's experience as an educator attests to the rewards that come from teaching, and has helped increase my own understanding of how important it is to think Â‘outside the box' when it comes to helping our children learn," Governor Otter said. "These grant recipients are great examples of teachers becoming truly innovative and creating learning opportunities for all students. I hope this recognition helps them continue their important work while encouraging others to invest their time, talent and energy in opening our classrooms to new possibilities."
