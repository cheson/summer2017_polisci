Secret Programs Raise Questions about Government's Relationship with Citizens

It's been almost 12 years since I first debated against, voted against and warned against the potential dangers of the USA PATRIOT Act. Back then, some Democrats cited the potential for abuse they saw in a sweeping new anti-terrorist law administered by a Republican president. Most Republicans -- including the one
then in the White House -- rejected concerns from civil libertarians about government invasions of privacy.
Today it's mostly Republicans who are questioning the federal government's secret surveillance and data-gathering programs, with their enormous, seemingly pervasive scope. And it's mostly Democrats who are defending the Obama administration's handling of the unprecedented power ceded to government by Congress.
It's interesting how time, technology and politics change people's perspectives.
As I wrote in February 2004, early in my fourth year in Congress, "I ascribe the purest of motives to those currently using the PATRIOT Act in the war on foreign terrorists. Â… My concerns are more prospective in nature: Can I trust the law will be used as judiciously, with as much care to protecting civil liberties, once the
public's attention has turned to other matters."

Matters like wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Great Recession, natural disasters, Europe's economic meltdown, the Arab Spring, the killing of Bin Laden, and of course the merry-go-round of national politics.
But this is not a Bush administration or an Obama administration problem. Congress passed the law and has repeatedly reauthorized it. Some members of Congress -- in both the Republican-controlled House and the Democrat-controlled Senate -- have been regularly briefed on what the National Security Agency (NSA) and more than a dozen other intelligence operations have been doing.
