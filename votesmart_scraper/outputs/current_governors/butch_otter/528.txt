KOOSKIA WILL BE MAY CAPITAL FOR A DAY
GOVERNOR BRINGING MONTHLY EVENT TO IDAHO COUNTY
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced today that his next monthly "Capital for a Day" will be Friday, May 18th, in the north-central Idaho community of Kooskia.
The first-come, first-served opportunity for residents to meet with the Governor, selected members of his cabinet and other senior state officials is scheduled from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Kooskia City Hall, 26 S. Main Street. A no-host lunch for invited local and state officials is scheduled from 12 p.m. to 1:30 p.m., followed by resumption of the open public session at City Hall.
Among state agency officials joining Governor Otter will be Department of Commerce and Labor Director Roger Madsen; Brian Oakey, deputy director of the Idaho State Department of Agriculture; Dave Cadwallader, Clearwater Region supervisor for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game; Curt Fransen, acting deputy director of the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality; and Garry Lough, director of government affairs for the State Department of Education.
"Like too many Idaho communities, Kooskia is being squeezed by federal policies that restrict access to natural resources and limit possibilities for the jobs and future that economic development can bring," Governor Otter said. "I look forward to hearing local folks' perspectives about the challenges they're facing, and what we can do to help turn those challenges into opportunities."
