Governor Reacts to Biological Opinions
"No Jeopardy" Findings Welcomed
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter, traveling with an Idaho trade delegation in China, issued the following statement regarding the biological opinions on salmon recovery issued today by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA-Fisheries):
"The biological opinions issued today contain hundreds of pages of data and recommendations. It will take some time to thoroughly analyze the documents in detail. However, I am pleased that both BiOps contain Â‘no jeopardy' determinations if those actions found to be reasonable and prudent are implemented. I also support the Nez Perce Water Settlement Agreement provisions being retained in the Upper Snake River BiOp. My administration's task now is to digest this information and provide an appropriate response to NOAA-Fisheries reflecting the best interest of the species and our state."
