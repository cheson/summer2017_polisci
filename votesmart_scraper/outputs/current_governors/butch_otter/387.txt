With Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter in Utah at a Republican Governors Association meeting, Lieutenant Governor Brad Little signed a bill into law today creating a special State fund to help buffer Idaho's colleges and universities from future economic downturns.
"The Higher Education Stabilization Fund will help Idaho students and families by providing a financial safety net for our colleges and universities. We want to do what we can to prevent steep fee increases just when the people who need continuing education most can least afford it," Lieutenant Governor Little said. "It also will help our economic competitiveness as a state by enabling us to keep pursuing innovative research, training highly qualified employees, and attracting and retaining employers to create career-path jobs."
House Bill 544 redirects interest on revenue from tuition and fees at Idaho's State colleges and universities to a new "strategic interest account" within the broader Higher Education Stabilization Fund created by the measure. That would include about $114,000 in interest earnings now available. The Legislature also now can appropriate money directly to the fund, when there is a surplus of revenue, and it would disburse money from the fund to the institutions -- including community colleges -- based on allocation practices used by the State Board of Education.
The legislation was sponsored by Governor Otter, House Assistant Majority Leader Scott Bedke of Oakley and Senate Assistant Majority Leader Joe Stegner of Lewiston.
"It's important for us to step up to the challenge of being more prepared the next time the economy hits the skids," Representative Bedke said. "We are committed to protecting Idaho's future, and that commitment doesn't stop at high school graduation."
