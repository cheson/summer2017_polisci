Idaho Lawmakers Support Protecting Americans From Bankruptcy Abuse 4/14/2005

Washington, DC - Congressmen Mike Simpson and C.L. "Butch" Otter joined the 302-126 majority today as the U.S. House of Representatives passed S. 256, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The legislation eliminates opportunities for abuse that exist under the current system while maintaining a safety net for those who find themselves in dire financial straits at no fault of their own.
"Reform sends a message that people cannot use bankruptcy as an easy way out of avoiding their debts," Simpson said. "Our bankruptcy system needs to be made less vulnerable to abusive consumers and more focused on helping those with real needs. This bill accomplishes these goals."
"It's the responsibility of Congress to ensure our laws are fair and serve the legitimate needs of America and individual citizens. Our existing bankruptcy laws fail that test, and expose us all to unwarranted costs," Otter said. "Through a process of attrition and the evolution of our economy, the system has become far too lax. It's time for a tune-up, and this legislation will help restore the premium that our government and we as individuals should place on frugality and fiscal responsibility."
All Americans end up paying for the unscrupulous who abuse the system. In fact, it has been estimated that every American family pays as much as $550 a year in a hidden tax as a result of the actions from these abuses. This bankruptcy reform legislation will help eliminate this hidden tax by implementing a means test to make people who can repay their debts actually honor them.
