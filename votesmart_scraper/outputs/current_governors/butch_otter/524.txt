GOVERNOR APPLAUDS RESULT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT VOTE
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today regarding Tuesday's approval by voters in Ada and Canyon counties of creating a community college district for southwestern Idaho.
"I couldn't be prouder of the Treasure Valley folks who accepted the challenge of becoming the architects of their own destiny. The community college campaign, and the degree to which voters embraced it, speaks volumes about our state and community commitment to creating opportunities right here at home. This victory will make available more affordable education and training, more and better jobs, an even stronger economy and most of all a new and better chance at success for thousands of people. I'm grateful to everyone who stepped up to make this promise a reality for the Treasure Valley and Idaho. Now we must prove the value of this vision while engaging all those with concerns about it in the important work of accountability."
