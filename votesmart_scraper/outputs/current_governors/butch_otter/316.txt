Governor Otter Reacts to Federal Judge's Ruling on Obamacare
Statement

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson's ruling in Virginia that the "individual mandate" requirement in the sweeping health care reform legislation signed into law by President Obama last winter is unconstitutional.
"While we have a long way to go, Judge Hudson's ruling today sets a great and appropriate precedent as our case in Florida goes forward. It's encouraging that the Virginia court agreed with our argument that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. And I'm hopeful that this will both help inform Judge Vinson's considerations and embolden the next Congress to roll back Obamacare."
