Governor: Jeremy Hill Decision Welcome, but Endangered Species Act Must be Fixed
Statement

Date: Sept. 8, 2011
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C. L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to the decision to drop federal criminal charges against a northern Idaho man who shot a protected grizzly bear on his property in May.
"I'm gratified that Mr. Hill and his family weren't hurt, that he's been cleared of criminal charges, and that they will avoid the ordeal of a federal trial. But the fact remains that this is another unfortunate and unnecessary example of how badly the Endangered Species Act is flawed and needs to be fixed. The people of Idaho and our own congressional delegation members get that. It's time for Congress to join us in recognizing that protecting property as well as lives needs to be a much bigger part of the equation if efforts to recover species are going to work in the West."
