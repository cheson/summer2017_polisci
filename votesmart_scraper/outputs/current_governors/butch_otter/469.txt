GOVERNOR PLEDGES STATE ASSISTANCE IN RESPONSE TO NEW LAYOFFS
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to layoffs announced by Micron Technology Inc. at its Boise operations.
"All of state government stands ready to assist people facing the challenges of unemployment, job training and placement needs. I am directing Roger Madsen and his crew at the Idaho Department of Labor to extend their hours at Treasure Valley employment offices, and I want to assure everyone that our state employees and resources are focused on serving Idaho citizens at this difficult time. That's as true when economic conditions cost our communities a single job as it is when hundreds of jobs are lost.
"We will keep working hard - every one of us - to further diversify our economy, use our strengths and leverage our competitive advantages to keep the jobs we have, get back the jobs we're losing right now and produce new ones for our future. Don Dietrich at the Department of Commerce is working with the Department of Labor and with employers and prospective employers to maximize our economic opportunities."
