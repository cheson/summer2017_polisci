Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced the appointment today of Rupert city official, Kelly Anthon to the Idaho State Senate.
Anthon, a 7th generation Idahoan, will fill the vacancy that was created when former Senator Dean Cameron of Rupert was chosen to become the Director of the Idaho Department of Insurance. Anthon was selected from a group of nominees submitted by the District 27 Republican Legislative Committee. Anthon will serve out the remainder of Senator Cameron's term. The other nominees were Doug Pickett and Wayne Hurst.
"Kelly's extensive experience in economic development, the legal profession and agriculture uniquely qualify him to represent the people of the Mini-Cassia area," said Governor Otter. "I am confident he will ably serve the constituents of District 27."
Anthon is the administrator for the city of Rupert. He is also a past president of the Burley Rotary Club, worked as a board member for two economic development organizations and served on the boards for two local hospitals.
"It is an honor to be appointed by Governor Otter to serve the community I love," said Anthon. "My family and I feel humbled at this opportunity and I will do all I can to serve the people in the Mini-Cassia area and to represent our community values."
Anthon and his wife Joelle live on their family farm near Declo and have five children.
