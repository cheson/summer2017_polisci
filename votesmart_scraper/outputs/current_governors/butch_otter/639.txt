Oregon Jugde's Decision Highlights Serious Problems With The Law 2/2/2005

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Idaho Congressmen Mike Simpson and C.L. "Butch" Otter said today that this week's ruling from a federal judge in Oregon on the protected status of gray wolves once again points out the dire need for fundamental changes to the Endangered Species Act.
The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon vacated a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule on gray wolves that established three "Distinct Population Segments" under the ESA and changed the protected status of the eastern and western populations of the wolves from "endangered" to "threatened."
The Fish and Wildlife Service said the ruling should have no impact on plans for managing wolves in most areas of Idaho where special rules apply to that experimental, non-essential population. However, private landowners and government officials in northernmost Idaho - north of Interstate 90, outside of those experimental, non-essential population areas - once again will be restricted from harming, harassing or killing wolves attacking livestock.
Simpson and Otter said the decision highlights why Congress must make Endangered Species Act reforms a high priority this year.
"No person, animal, or plant is well served by a process that allows the courts to manage our nation's natural resources," Congressman Simpson said. "This decision provides yet another glaring example of why we must work harder than ever to reform the Endangered Species Act. The proper influence of sound science, commonsense, and fairness needs to be restored to its proper role in our nation's public lands and resource management laws."
