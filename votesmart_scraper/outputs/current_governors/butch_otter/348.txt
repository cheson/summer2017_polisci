Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: July 28, 2010
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today about the controversy surrounding continuation of the football series between the University of Idaho and Boise State University after the 2010 season.
"As a football fan and an Idahoan, I'd like to see the series continue. As Governor, I have no authority, no role and no interest in micromanaging our universities' football programs. That's why we hire university presidents, athletic directors and coaches. I have every confidence that they'll work things out."
