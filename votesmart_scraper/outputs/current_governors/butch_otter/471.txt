GOVERNOR SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR STATE HANDLING OF FEDERAL STIMULUS ACT
After thoroughly studying the newly signed bill and consulting with legislative leaders, Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued an executive order today detailing a process for evaluating needs and implementing the American Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
Executive Order 2009-06 (attached) creates a "stimulus executive committee" that will be appointed by the Governor to review state agency information and make recommendations within 30 days on how to best use the federal money designated for Idaho in the federal law. Those recommendations will be due by the close of business on March 19.
"I'm grateful to the legislators who sat down with me and my staff to work through this enormous piece of legislation and agree on a process for ensuring we make good, sound and responsible decisions for the people of Idaho," Governor Otter said. "There remain a lot of unknowns here. It will take a lot of work to get our arms around all the implications of this law. We need to make sure safeguards are in place and that every "i' is dotted and "t' is crossed. This is taxpayer money, and all of us are committed to seeing it used in the most effective and efficient way possible.
