Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter thanked members of the Legislature today for advancing his priorities for improving public education and workforce development, stimulating job creation, reforming the State's criminal justice system and protecting Idaho's natural resources.
"And they did it all while showing the kind of fiscal responsibility and attention to the proper role of government that has been consistently lacking in our national government," Governor Otter said. "The Legislature made significant progress on the most important issues facing Idaho, especially when it comes to addressing the recommendations of my Education Task Force and our shared K-through-Career goals."
