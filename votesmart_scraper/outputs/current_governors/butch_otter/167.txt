"There are few things more important to our long-term economic well-being than becoming more energy independent. A more secure and prosperous future requires protecting and empowering the generation and transmission of low-cost, reliable energy for sustainable growth and development -- and more career opportunities for the people we serve."
Governor Otter showed his keen understanding of the role of renewable and alternative energy resources -- as well as the critical importance of improving Idaho's energy transmission capabilities -- when he created the Office of Energy Resources in 2007. It took the lead during the Great Recession in upgrading Idaho's public schools to make them more energy efficient, and along with the Idaho Strategic Energy Alliance it has led the Governor's charge for more industrial energy efficiency and development of public-private partnerships that encourage research and innovation. Governor Otter's support for the Center for Advanced Enenerg Studies (CAES), a collaborative partnership between Idaho's universities and the Idaho National Laboratory, is paying great dividends in developing new technologies and serving as a seed bed for new economic opportunities throughout Idaho.
