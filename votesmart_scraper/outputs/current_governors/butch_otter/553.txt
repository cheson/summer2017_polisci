TYGART DAM PROJECT HYDROELECTRIC LICENSE EXTENSION BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. OTTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 4417, the Tygart Dam Project Hydroelectric License Extension Bill, extends the time in the hydroelectric license to start construction on the project until December 31, 2007. This is another project that has experienced delays. In this case, unfavorable market conditions delayed the start of the project. Today, those conditions have been resolved and the project is ready to begin. The project will be built at an existing dam, thus minimizing impacts. It is anticipated that the project will provide a substantial economic boost to the city of Grafton, West Virginia, as well as valuable hydroelectric power, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
