Survey after survey and election after election, Idahoans tell us loud and clear that education is their top priority and a proper, even essential role of our State government. That's reflected in my budget requests to the Idaho Legislature for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Idaho's future prosperity depends on the responsible, targeted, data-driven and sustainable investments we make today in kindergarten through high school, in professional-technical training programs, and in our college and university system.
My K-through-Career budget recommendations for fiscal 2017 and new initiatives for implementing the recommendations of my Task Force for Improving Education represent comprehensive, strategic, long-term investments in the people of Idaho. The people's mandate is clear -- build a transparent and accountable public education system that produces talented and motivated citizens prepared to take on our 21st century challenges.
My budget recommendation for K-12 schools focuses on continued implementation of the 20 Task Force recommendations. That includes funding for the second year of the career ladder for Idaho teachers and $10.7 million in new funding to help kids struggling to read in kindergarten through third grade. Early intervention is essential to help students gain reading proficiency by the end of third grade because from then on, the focus of their education is on reading to learn.
We must ensure that those students who struggle with reading early on are not left behind for the rest of their educational journey. And since that journey should be a lifelong endeavor, I am asking legislators for $5 million so our schools can provide better college and career counseling to help students and parents explore opportunities beyond high school.
