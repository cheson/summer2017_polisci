Press Release

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter got word today that the U.S. Air Force has put two Idaho Air Force units on the list of potential sites for future stationing of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.
More than 200 sites were considered in compiling the "short list" of 11 Air Force candidate installations in the running to receive the state-of-the-art combat aircraft for training and operations.
"While the announcement of potential Air Force installations doesn't necessarily mean Idaho will get these aircraft, I am very pleased that two Idaho Air Force installations are in the running -- the 366th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base and the Idaho Air National Guard's 124th Fighter Wing.
"There are a number of steps yet to go before the Air Force makes its final decisions. But the hard work, community support and close collaboration of everyone involved -- from the people of Mountain Home and Elmore County to our Idaho-based Air Force officials, our Idaho National Guard leadership and our economic development folks -- made all the difference in getting us on the short list. It's encouraging that the Air Force thinks so much of our track record, our outstanding facilities, and most of all the people who make it all go."
