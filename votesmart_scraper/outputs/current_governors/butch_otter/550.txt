REYNOLDS CREEK HYDROELECTRIC LICENSE EXTENSION BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. OTTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 176, the Reynolds Creek Hydroelectric Licensing Extension Act, which authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the time specified in the project license to begin construction of the Reynolds Creek hydroelectric project for three 2-year periods, a total of 6 years. The Reynolds Creek project is a five megawatt project on Prince of Wales Island in Alaska.
This bill has passed the Senate by unanimous consent. Passage of this bill today will send it to the President's desk and allow further development of clean, renewable hydroelectric power.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
