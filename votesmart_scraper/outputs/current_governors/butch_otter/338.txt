The quiet communities of Bliss, Hagerman and Burley will be a flurry of activity in coming months as construction begins on Idaho's largest wind farm -- a $500 million project backed by global giant GE Energy Financial Services.
Freight trucks have already started hauling 122 turbine housings the size of small buildings and 366 turbine blades, which are taller than a 10-story structure. But the pace will quicken as the Boise-based Exergy Development Group hurries to complete the project before the end of 2010.
The wind farms, which will create up to 175 jobs and power about 39,700 homes, are being dubbed the Oregon Trail Wind Farm project.
The project -- actually 11 separate wind-farm developments that Exergy is building at the same time -- was inaugurated Tuesday by Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter, GE Energy Financial Services CEO Alex Urquhart, and representatives of Exergy and Reunion Power, an asset management company based in Manchester Center, Vt.
All four represented parties that played a critical role in bringing the sprawling wind farm to south-central Idaho.
The fact that renewable energy leaders like GE and Reunion Power were backing the project is testament to Idaho's bright future in renewable energy production, Otter said.
