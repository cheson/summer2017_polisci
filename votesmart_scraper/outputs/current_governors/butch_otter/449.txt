Governor Tells Feds Idaho Won't Take Mercury
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter said he would do everything within his power to keep the U.S. Department of Energy from storing the nation's highly toxic elemental mercury at the Idaho National Laboratory.
The INL is one of seven sites being considered for storage of up to 17,000 tons of mercury. Mercury exports will be banned in 2013, and DOE is required by law to have facilities ready to manage and store mercury by then. Governor Otter said he would not let the federal government make Idaho its mercury dump.
"If they want to put it in a desolate and useless place, they should put it on the Capitol grounds," the Governor said.
Exposure to mercury, a liquid metal, can damage the central nervous system, endocrine system, kidneys and other organs, as well as the mouth, gums and teeth. Prolonged exposure can cause brain damage and death. Mercury and its compounds are particularly toxic to babies, and women exposed to mercury while pregnant have given birth to children with serious birth defects.
DOE has scheduled an August 11 hearing in Idaho Falls to hear public comments on its storage proposal. Other states being considered are Colorado, Missouri, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas and Washington.
