Governor Otter's Conservative Leadership Is Paying off for Idaho
Press Release

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter's conservative values and focus on growing Idaho's economy are keys to Idaho's latest fiscal report, as the state closes out another year in the black. Idaho's total tax revenue for fiscal year 2014 came in $7.2 million ahead of projection.
"This good news on the economic front will enable us to continue our efforts to reinvest in education. The economy and education are top priorities, but there is still work to be done. The best way to meet our goals is to remain prudent, cautious and responsible in how we allocate every one of the taxpayers' dollars," said Governor Otter.
From a national standpoint, Idaho's economy is rebounding faster than most states, as evidenced by the national recognition our state received in multiple publications recently:
*Kiplinger Magazine -- Idaho one of "10 States with the Fastest Job Growth"
*USA Today -- Idaho one of "10 States with the Fastest Growing Economies"
*Thumbtack.com -- Survey of small business owners ranks Idaho "second friendliest state in the U.S. for small business and the easiest place to start a business"
Governor Otter says this proves the validity of conservative philosophy, which includes a jobs-friendly tax climate for small companies expanding in or relocating to Idaho.
It remains to be seen what his Democratic opponent's plans are for the future of our state's economy, other than to raise taxes.
