Press Release

Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to U.S. Magistrate Candy Dale's ruling that the Idaho Constitution's same-sex marriage prohibition is unconstitutional.
"In 2006, the people of Idaho exercised their fundamental right, reaffirming that marriage is the union of a man and a woman. Today's decision, while disappointing, is a small setback in a long-term battle that will end at the U.S. Supreme Court. I am firmly committed to upholding the will of the people and defending our Constitution."
