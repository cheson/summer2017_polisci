Letter to James Risch, President of the Senate, Idaho Legislature
The Honorable James E. Risch
President of the Senate
Idaho Legislature
Legislative Annex
Boise, ID 83720
VIA HAND DELIVERY
Dear Mr. President,
I hereby advise you that I am returning to you, without my approval, disapproved and vetoed, the following Senate Bill, to wit:
S1385
within the time limited by law, the same having arrived in the Office of the Governor at the hour of 12:05 p.m. on March 17, 2008.
A legitimate question can be raised about who wins with this compromise bill. I'm concerned that enacting it would be at the cost of property rights and taxpayer dollars.
Counties should not be required to shoulder additional unnecessary requirements on the distribution of tax deed sale proceeds, and property owners delinquent on their tax payments should not on one hand be given one less year to get their affairs in order and on the other hand be given preferential treatment on receipt of surplus sale proceeds.
The fact is that some of the houses in question are abandoned or "meth" houses that require extensive county and taxpayer resources to return to the market and the tax rolls. There appears to be good reason why the Legislature rejected similar bills in the past. I see no good reason to approve this year's proposal.
As Always - Idaho, "Esto Perpetua"
C.L. "Butch" Otter
Governor of Idaho
