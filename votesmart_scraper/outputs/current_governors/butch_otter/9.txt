Legislation working its way through the Capitol in the 2017 session's waning days would provide Idaho, as a relatively new producer of oil and gas, with the protections and expertise it needs to safely and responsibly nurture and regulate this emerging industry.
House Bill 301, also called the Landowner Bill of Rights, brings Idaho's oil and gas laws up to industry standards used in such petroleum-producing states as Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah. Separately, Senate Bill 1099 addresses Idaho's lack of technical and legal expertise in developing up-to-date regulations for the industry while protecting Idaho property owners. It creates the position of oil and gas administrator within the Idaho Department of Lands and requires the new administrator to have at least 10 years of industry experience.
Discovery of oil and gas deposits in southwestern Idaho brings the potential for renewed prosperity for local citizens and a shot in the arm for the area's economy. It will come in the form of direct leasing and royalty payments to individuals and new business ventures providing good-paying jobs that will bring new revenue to support city and county services. That gives us plenty of reason to support oil and gas development in Idaho.
As with any new and unfamiliar industry, getting it right involves a sharp learning curve. It's as if Idaho is trying to get its arms around simple arithmetic while the industry elsewhere is working on calculus.
The good news is that Idaho is finally catching up by seeking assistance from experts in other states and the State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange, a partnership of the Interstate Oil and Gas Commission and the Groundwater Protection Council. SOGRE's recommendations are included in House Bill 301.
