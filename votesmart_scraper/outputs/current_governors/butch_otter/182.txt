"The folks who create careers and economic opportunities need stability and predictability in their tax structure. They need to be confident that government isn't going to rob them of a competitive edge by changing the rules in the middle of the game."
Governor Otter is committed to ensuring that state government lives within the people's means. He responded to the economic downturn and declining state revenues not by seeking to impose new and increased taxes on already struggling Idaho citizens and businesses, but by finding efficiencies and new and better ways of fulfilling state government's important but properly limited role in people's lives. Most importantly, Governor Otter insisted that state government programs and services be built on a foundation of fiscal responsibility and discipline -- not only because the Idaho Constitution wisely requires a balanced state budget, but because he trusts that individual Idahoans know how to use their own money more efficiently and effectively than any government ever can. After a career in Idaho and international business, he is absolutely committed to providing the stability and predictability in Idaho's tax base that employers need to invest with confidence in Idaho's future.
