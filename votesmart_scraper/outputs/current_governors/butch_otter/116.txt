This afternoon, four candidates for Idaho Governor faced off in a debate at the Coeur d'Alene Public Library to discuss issues important to the citizens of Idaho. Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter explained his commitment to Idaho and laid out his plans for continuing to build a brighter future for Idahoans.
As expected, education and the economy dominated the discussion. But unlike Governor Otter, his three opponents failed to provide specific plans or funding strategies to support their positions.
"We are empowering citizens to meet the challenges ahead by living up to their own best potential. That means implementing my Education Task Force recommendations. And it means advancing my K-through-Career approach to making Idaho's workforce more competitive," Governor Otter said. "It means pursuing my Accelerate Idaho initiative to leverage our education, workforce and infrastructure improvement efforts for a more prosperous future. And it means working collaboratively and effectively with the Legislature and local governments to ensure we're doing all that we can to keep Idaho moving."
Governor Otter's vision is aimed at protecting Idaho values by providing conservative, fiscally responsible, transparent and accountable leadership.
