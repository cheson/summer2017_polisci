"Idaho taxpayers have made a multibillion-dollar investment in safe, efficient roads and bridges. Maintaining and improving it to meet our people's needs today and tomorrow is a legitimate government responsibility. Our job is to make sure that's done efficiently and equitably."
Governor Otter knows that building and maintaining safe, efficient corridors of commerce is a proper role of government. After all, they are the routes our families take every day to work, school and to stay connected. As Idaho's population has grown, state government has allowed our multibillion-dollar taxpayer investment in roads and bridges to deteriorate. From narrow, winding and hazardous stretches of road through Idaho's mountains to twice-a-day parking lots backed up with polluting traffic in the Boise area, Governor Otter is working with the Legislature and stakeholders throughout Idaho to develop long-term, sustainable and equitable solutions to Idaho's transportation funding dilemma. Meanwhile, he is working to identify waste and inefficiency so that every dollar of Idahoans' taxes and user fees is put to work cost effectively in addressing the backlog of improvements to our aging and in some cases crumbling highway system.
