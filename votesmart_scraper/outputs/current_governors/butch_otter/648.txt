IN HONOR OF MISS IDAHO 2004 -- (Extensions of Remarks - September 15, 2004)
SPEECH OF HON. C.L. "BUTCH" OTTER
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2004
Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 2004 Miss Idaho, Elizabeth Margaret Barchas of Boise. Elizabeth will be proudly representing the Gem State in this weekend's Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, NJ.
Elizabeth received her bachelor's degree from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. She then studied abroad and received her master's degree from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and was a Fulbright Scholar. She has been accepted to Harvard Law school; however, she has deferred her matriculation for one year to pursue her duties as Miss Idaho. Elizabeth's platform is understanding individuals with disabilities, and I am very proud of her continued
commitment of community service for Idaho and across the globe.
I am confident that Elizabeth will do an outstanding job in representing Idaho, as I am pulling for her to be crowned the next Miss America. I wish Elizabeth, and the entire Barchas family all the best for this weekend's pageant.
END
