CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR TO CALL ROUNDTABLE OF IDAHO FIRST RESPONDERS
BOISE, Idaho - Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter, the Republican candidate for Governor of Idaho, joined emergency personnel from throughout the state Monday to announce plans for a "First Responders Roundtable."
Gathering on the Statehouse steps to mark the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congressman Otter honored the police, firemen, EMTs and others who died by the hundreds while trying to save the lives of others.
"The best monument to those fallen heroes is not a speech or even a statue. It's learning and applying the lessons that their deaths taught us," he said. "So today I'm announcing that, as governor, I will bring first responders and emergency personnel together from throughout Idaho for a roundtable meeting on what they need to protect us, and how we as a state can provide it."
Congressman Otter said that might mean clarifying roles and missions for overlapping jurisdictions, integrating communications systems, eliminating duplication or taking advantage of economies of scale.
"I want to hear from them the status of their efforts to keep our people safe - not just from terrorism but from the scourge of methamphetamines, gang violence and other crimes - and how to help victims recover when our best efforts fail," he said. "I then will use the office of governor to expedite and coordinate the needed improvements so that Idaho will be a model of government responsiveness and efficiency.
"We have some of the best trained, most qualified and motivated first responders in the country right here in Idaho," he said. "They know their communities, their people and their challenges. My job is to make sure they have the tools they need to do theirs."
