"Big federal programs aren't the answer. All this will do is keep states and the marketplace from making healthcare more affordable and accessible while imposing a legacy of untold debt on our children and grandchildren."
Governor Otter spoke out early and often against the colossal expense and unprecedented extension of federal authority in the healthcare "reform" legislation pushed through by the Democrat-controlled Congress and President Obama. And as soon as the bill became law -- mandating coverage without tackling the issue of quality or cost -- Governor Otter led Idaho Republicans in keeping their promise to sue the federal government over unconstitutional requirements for citizens to purchase health insurance. He will continue working with our congressional delegation to protect Idaho taxpayers and small businesses from the unconscionable economic burden being imposed by the federal government. At the same time, Governor Otter is more committed than ever to building partnerships with healthcare providers and insurers that foster Idaho solutions for making healthcare more accessible and affordable.
