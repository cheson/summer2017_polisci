CONGRESS REAPS WHAT IT SOWS -- (Extensions of Remarks - May 26, 2006)
* Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, there has been an awful lot of talk the last few days about the FBI's Saturday night raid on the office of a Democrat U.S. Congressman. It's tough for me to get too excited about the howls of protest from members of Congress. I understand their concerns about protecting the independence of the legislative branch and possible abuse of executive powers. But it makes me wonder: Where were these voices of outrage and righteous indignation when we learned the executive branch was monitoring the telephone conversations of ordinary Americans? Where were they when the executive branch sought, and the USA PATRIOT ACT granted, more power to search the homes and businesses of ordinary Americans without notification? At least we know there was a legitimate warrant issued by a judge for the search of the Congressman's office. Are my honorable colleagues suggesting that members of Congress or the institution itself should be treated differently in the eyes of the law than those who hold the most important position in America--that of ``citizen''? I hope not.
