Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter encouraged interested Idahoans today to apply for the vacancy on the Idaho State Board of Education created by the departure of Ken Edmunds, who resigned to become director of the Idaho Department of Labor.
The Governor set a deadline of the close of business on Monday, December 9, for applications to the Board of Education, which has seven appointed members plus the elected Superintendent of Public Instruction. The new appointee, subject to Idaho Senate confirmation, will serve the balance of Edmunds' unexpired term on the Board, until March 1, 2018.
The Board is the policy-making body for all public education in Idaho. It provides general oversight and governance for public K-20 education, and serves as the Board of Trustees for state-sponsored public four-year colleges and universities and the Board of Regents for the University of Idaho.
"The goal in all my appointments to the Board is to find members who can view Idaho's education system holistically, putting aside parochial connections to any single institution and instead focusing on our statewide needs and opportunities for improvement," Governor Otter said. "Our colleges and universities have the responsibility to help prepare Idaho's workforce for the future. The Board of Education is charged with ensuring those institutions have the tools and the oversight they need to work collaboratively toward our statewide goals."
According to Idaho Code, "Appointment to the board shall be made solely upon consideration of the ability of such appointees efficiently to serve the interests of the people, and education, without reference to locality, occupation, party affiliation or religion."
