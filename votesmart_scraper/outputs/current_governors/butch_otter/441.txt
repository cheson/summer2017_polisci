Jobs, Careers Are The Core Of Our Recovery
By Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter
A jobless recovery doesn't do much good for people who need to pay the mortgage and buy groceries. That's why I focus on jobs in this monthly column. While growing Idaho's gross state product to $60 billion is a great goal for economists and policy makers, creating jobs that become career opportunities is the foundation of real recovery for Idahoans. And it is at the heart of my Project 60 initiative.
There are businesses around Idaho that are growing and hiring, and the value of Idaho products being sold to other countries went up 11 percent in the most recent quarter. Rising export values mean Idaho companies are seeing an upswing in business, and that directly impacts employment.
I'll continue sharing with you the good news on the employment front:
* Nunhems has a $28 million, 10-year expansion underway at its USA headquarters in Parma. This global seed company will hire 40 to 50 full-time employees here over the next five years.
* Bingham Memorial Hospital in Blackfoot has two major expansion and construction projects underway, valued at $11 million, and has increased employment from 226 in 2005 to 634 this year.
* AMX International in Rexburg will hire another 8-10 workers this year and up to 30 more next year.
* Qwest Communications' Idaho Falls call center is hiring another 100 employees.
* Several federal stimulus transportation infrastructure projects broke ground this summer - including the Ten Mile Interchange in Meridian, Dover Bridge in northern Idaho, the Vista interchange in Boise, and major eastern Idaho routes in Chubbuck and Rigby. This not only means the retention but growth of construction jobs - a total of more than 1,500 for the five projects. Improving these important transportation corridors also will improve the economic development potential for these communities.
* Portneuf Medical Center is building a new $150 million-plus facility in Pocatello, which will provide stable good-paying construction jobs through its completion in 2011.
* Finally, I'm happy to announce that Darigold is expanding production at its Boise processing facility. The company is spending $20 million to increase production capacity for sour cream and cottage cheese. The expansion, which will be completed next spring, will add another 30 jobs to the facility and will enhance the stability of its current workforce.
I also am looking to the future. Earlier this summer, I announced $500,000 in Gem Grant awards, which provide funding to communities to develop job-creating infrastructure. One example of how this works is the award to Moscow. It will go toward developing an industrial park master plan, helping the city establish a new 65-acre light industrial park. This new park could be the home for an estimated 780 new jobs.
On Monday, August 31, I will hold the Governor's Business Summit in Boise, where Idaho industry members will let me know the current direction of their industries, the challenges and obstacles they face in Idaho, and what state government can do to help create a climate in which they can succeed. The goal is to collect practical suggestions about what my administration can do to facilitate growth and prosperity for all Idahoans, then put those ideas to work.
The bottom line is that people need career opportunities now. That's why we have trained staff in 25 Department of Labor offices around the state matching worker skills and talents with employer needs. We also are fortunate to have the Workforce Development Training Fund, which reimburses qualifying businesses with up to $3,000 per employee for the cost of training workers.
It appears the nation is bumping along the bottom of this economic recession, and we're likely to be traveling this bumpy road a little while longer. It's important to remember, however, that there are good things happening throughout Idaho, and there is much more to come.
