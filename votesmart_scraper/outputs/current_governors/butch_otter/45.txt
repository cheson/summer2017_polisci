Date: Sept. 15, 2015
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced today that the Cassia County community of Albion will host the next Capital for a Day on Tuesday, September 22nd.
Governor Otter brings State government to Idahoans living outside Boise each month by making a different town in Idaho the state's "Capital for a Day." The meetings provide local residents an opportunity to have open discussions about government issues and public policy with Governor Otter, members of his Cabinet and other senior State officials.
The Capital for a Day on September 22nd is scheduled from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Albion Civic Center. The Governor also will attend a luncheon with local leaders.
State officials joining Governor Otter at Capital for a Day will include Lieutenant Governor Brad Little, Idaho Department of Water Resources Director Gary Spackman, Idaho State Tax Commissioner Ken Roberts, Idaho State Department of Agriculture Director Celia Gould, Idaho Department of Insurance Director Dean Cameron, State Board of Education member Debbie Critchfield, Office of Energy Resources Administrator John Chatburn, and Office of Species Conservation Administrator Dustin Miller. Also on hand to answer questions will be representatives from the Idaho Transportation Department and the Idaho Department of Commerce.
"The people of Albion and Cassia County are dealing every day with the kind of challenges that define the Idaho way of life -- from water rights and energy transmission to the impacts of federal restrictions on the use of our public lands," Governor Otter said. "It's the kind of place that my Capital for a Day program is meant for. I encourage everyone in Cassia County who can to come on out and let us know where you stand."
