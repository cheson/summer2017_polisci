Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter welcomed a federal judge's decision today that the Coeur d'Alene Tribe must stop offering poker in its northern Idaho casino.
"I appreciate the initial determination that the Coeur d'Alenes' decision to conduct Texas Hold 'em games violates State law and the Idaho Constitution," Governor Otter said after U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill's decision to grant the State of Idaho's request to stop the gaming, which began in May.
"The Legislature and the people of Idaho have made it clear what kind of gambling they will accept. That does not include poker," Governor Otter said. "And no matter how much the Tribe insists otherwise, Texas Hold 'em is poker."
Judge Winmill also said in his 24-page decision that as the case proceeds, "the State has shown that it will almost certainly succeed on the merits of its claims."
The Coeur d'Alene Tribe has argued that Texas Hold 'em is a "bona fide contest of skill" and therefore exempt from terms of the Tribe's compact with the State under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. But Judge Winmill concluded that Texas Hold 'em clearly contains an element of chance.
"After all," he wrote, "when a poker player is dealt a hand, chance determines how good or bad that hand will be. There is no skill involved in that part of the game -- ever."
