Moving Idaho's State-Based Health Insurance Exchange Past Challenges
Statement

Of all the challenges we're facing with Idaho's state-based health insurance exchange, none have been more disappointing than the chorus of those who attribute each setback to cronyism or conspiracy, and those whose most constructive criticism is "I told you so."
When we run into a problem, Idahoans fix it. When we encounter difficulties, Idahoans overcome them. We always have, and we're working hard to do the same in this case.
There are no excuses for what's happened, but there are reasons. The fix is not easy, but it is straightforward. It involves doing the right thing and having checks and balances in place when the outcomes fall short or are off target. It's not perfect -- government seldom is -- and public-private partnerships can be clunky and even ugly early on. But they are essential in bringing Idaho's values and voices to bear.
First things first: The technology consulting contract awarded to a former Exchange board member was expeditiously and correctly voided last week. Yes, it should never have happened to begin with, but when it did the process worked.
Next, the admittedly delayed decision to form our own exchange left us with no real choice but to temporarily piggyback on what we were told was a working federal technology platform. It wasn't, and nobody can tell us with any level of authority or credibility when it will be working properly.
That's why I wrote U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius seeking at least a one-year delay in imposing the individual mandate for compliance with health insurance coverage requirements in the Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare.
