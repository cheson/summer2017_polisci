Governor Applauds Judge's Wolf Decision
Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: Sept. 9, 2009
Location: Lewiston, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy's denial of a preliminary injunction against Idaho's wolf hunt -- part of the state's management plan for the delisted species.
"Judge Molloy did the right thing. Idaho has met and exceeded the criteria agreed upon by all parties for recovery. We have a plan in place for managing wolves, based on the best science available, and we intend to keep our promises outlined in that plan. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game and Idaho Fish and Game Commission have done a great job of setting hunting numbers to ensure a sustainable wolf population and genetic connectivity. We are and will continue to be responsible stewards of the species."
