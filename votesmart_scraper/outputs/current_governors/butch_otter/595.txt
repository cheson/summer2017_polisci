Congressman Reacts To President's Speech 1/31/2006

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement in response to President Bush's remarks in his annual State of the Union address Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress.
"I'm grateful that the President chose to focus some attention on health care and energy. These are issues that touch every one of the people I represent and have been at the forefront of my work on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. I appreciate the President's commitment to finding reasonable, sustainable, market-based solutions, and to increasing the use of technology to make both health care and energy more affordable.
"There also is no doubt that the President has the right approach to the war on terrorism. We must be aggressive and proactive to keep Americans safe. And I share his determination to faithfully support our troops, their families and the veterans who sacrifice so much for us. "But while I agree with the President that fortune favors the bold, I don't believe that promoting freedom around the world justifies limiting or eroding it here at home.
"While I agree with the President that we must be the architects of our own destiny, I don't believe that asserting leadership necessarily means imposing our values where they are unwelcome or misunderstood.
"And while I agree with the President that talent and creativity are the keys to competitiveness, and that education must be among our highest priorities, I don't believe that all the wisdom on how to achieve educational excellence resides in Washington, D.C."
