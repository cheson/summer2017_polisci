Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced the appointment today of Magistrate Scott Wayman of Coeur d'Alene to the First District judgeship left vacant by the recent retirement of Judge Fred Gibler.
Wayman has been a magistrate judge in the First Judicial District since 2000. He will have chambers in Shoshone County in his new position and will hear cases in Shoshone and Benewah counties, as well as in other First Judicial District counties as assigned.
Judge Wayman received his bachelor's degree from Southern Illinois University and his law degree from the University of Idaho. The Chicago native previously was chief civil deputy in Kootenai County's Legal Services Department, a deputy prosecutor for Kootenai County, and in a private law practice in Orofino.
"It is an honor to be selected to serve as a district judge. I hope to continue the excellent work that Judge Gibler has provided to the citizens of Idaho throughout his judicial career," said Wayman, who enjoyed strong support for his appointment from northern Idaho's legal community.
"I received consistently glowing reports on Judge Wayman's judicial temperament, fairness, work ethic, experience, professionalism and knowledge of the law," Governor Otter said. "It really is a great privilege to appoint such an exemplary jurist to the First District bench -- one with such a sterling reputation among his peers and those who have appeared before him."
Wayman and his wife Jennifer have two children.
