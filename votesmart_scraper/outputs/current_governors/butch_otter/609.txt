Congressman Otter Comments On Relief Vote 9/8/2005

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement late Thursday regarding his vote against the $51.8 billion supplemental funding bill approved by the House on a vote of 410-11 in response to Hurricane Katrina.
"I saw firsthand how the people of North Idaho weathered the disastrous floods of the mid-1990s when I was lieutenant governor in Phil Batt's administration. Just as I was committed to Idahoans' recovery then, I'm committed now to ensuring the victims of Hurricane Katrina get all the help they need, for as long as it takes. However, throwing money at a tragedy before understanding how to address it most effectively for the benefit of the people most in need is simply irresponsible. By approving this bill, Congress once again was rushing to act without seriously considering the consequences or alternatives. Â‘Do something now, even if it's wrong,' is as bad a policy for government as it is for individuals. Millions of Americans are making personal sacrifices to help the victims of this disaster through private and community relief efforts. Each of them is counting on their money going where it will do the most good. There needs to be just as much accountability attached to how government spends the people's money."
