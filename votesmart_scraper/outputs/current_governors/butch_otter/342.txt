Idaho Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued this statement on the judge's decision to return gray wolves in Idaho to the Endangered Species list.
"I am thoroughly disappointed and frustrated with the court's decision today returning wolves to federal protection. Idaho has done everything asked of us by the federal government in order to delist wolves in our state and restore state management. The State of Idaho, through the Office of Species Conservation and Department of Fish and Game, proved to be an effective and responsible steward of the species under a plan praised by this very court. This judge has inexplicably dismissed a practical, common-sense solution and proven the Endangered Species Act is irreparably broken. The number of wolves in Idaho today is almost triple the population necessary for delisting throughout all three states. I don't know why any state would ever allow another reintroduction of a species because the federal government and radical environmentalists simply cannot live up to their word and allow state management.
"Rest assured we will exhaust all of our options to legally reverse this ill-advised decision. Today's decision should stand as an indictment of both the ESA and federal government."
