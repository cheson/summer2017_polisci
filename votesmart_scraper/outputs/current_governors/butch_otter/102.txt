Governor Mitt Romney took time out of his scheduled stop in Boise today for the Governor's Trade & Business Conference to show his support for Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter's re-election campaign. Romney, Otter and hundreds of supporters and volunteers gathered at Five Guys Burgers and Fries in Boise to energize voters prior to the November 4th election.
Romney told those in attendance that Governor Otter is the right man for the next four years and touted his strong, conservative leadership. He encouraged supporters to get out the vote, stressing that every vote will be important.
"I am truly honored by Governor Romney's vote of confidence in my proven conservative leadership and desire to serve another term as Idaho's Governor," said Otter. "With the 5th fastest growing economy and the highest personal income growth in the nation, Idaho is poised for exciting opportunities. I couldn't be more humbled by today's display of support from everyone involved."
Romney and Otter were joined by U.S. Senator Jim Risch who also expressed his support for the Governor's re-election campaign.
