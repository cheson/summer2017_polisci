Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter will kick off of the State's new Health Promotion Program by announcing the name of the program and unveiling its new logo at noon on Tuesday, October 1, on the Jefferson Street steps of the Capitol.
Governor Otter has worked with members of his Cabinet and the State's Office of Group Insurance for two years to develop a program aimed at increasing wellness in the workplace and rewarding employees for being healthy.
The program's mission is "to promote a healthy Idaho by engaging and empowering employees to take responsibility for their health. The program will achieve this by fostering a healthy workplace and providing opportunities to identify and reduce health risks, encouraging healthy choices and enhancing quality of life."
"Health care isn't all about doctors and medicine. What we do for ourselves matters. Our lifestyles matter, and investing in our own health matters," the Governor said. "I am personally committed to securing a healthier future for all Idahoans, including our own workforce. This program is an important step in that direction, and I'm excited to get it started."
