Public Statements
State Job Openings to be Tweeted
Press Release
By: Butch Otter
Date: July 15, 2010
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced today that the State Division of Human Resources has started posting State government job openings on the social networking site Twitter.
Using Twitter not only will enable the State to more quickly communicate new job opportunities as they become available, it will also enable followers to quickly alert their friends and family about those openings.
"When job opportunities come along in State government, we need to get the word out to more of those qualified folks who need the work -- where they are most likely to find it," Governor Otter said. "The immediacy and interactive nature of Twitter should be a real asset for the State and for targeting Idahoans who are unemployed or underemployed."
Anyone interested in receiving tweets on job opportunities with the State of Idaho can become a follower on Twitter at http://twitter.com/idahostatejobs.
