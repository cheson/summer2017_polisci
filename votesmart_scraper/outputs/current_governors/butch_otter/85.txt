Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter is asking Idahoans to take a few minutes on Wednesday to remember the victims, their families and friends, and the community of Moscow after a series of shootings last Saturday by a lone gunman.
"It is important that everyone in Idaho take time in the wake of this horrendous act to remember those who have lost their lives and offer our support to the families, friends, and Moscow community as they mourn this tragedy," Governor Otter said. "I ask that all Idahoans observe a moment of silence on Wednesday, January 14, at 1:00 p.m., Mountain Time to let our friends and families in Moscow know they are in our thoughts and prayers, and that they are not alone in their grief."
