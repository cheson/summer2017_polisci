Governor Otter Names Idaho Education Network Working Group
Press Release
By: Butch Otter
Date: Feb. 5, 2015
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced today that former State Senator John Goedde will lead a 20-member working group to chart a path forward for the Idaho Education Network (IEN).
Specifically, the working group will review long- and short-term contract and funding options for ensuring uninterrupted statewide network services -- including high-speed bandwidth -- to public schools throughout Idaho.
The effort was prompted by a November 2014 court ruling against the State's IEN contracts. Governor Otter now has assembled a working group of people with the right expertise, perspectives and authority to ensure uninterrupted statewide network services -- including high-speed bandwidth -- to Idaho schools.
"There's a broad consensus within this group, the Legislature and the public at large that the IEN is a tool on which the future of our students, our schools, our communities and our economy depend," Governor Otter said. "These folks represent the technical, financial and political skills we need as well as a real commitment to technology's role in advancing the quality of every public school in Idaho. They all embrace the Idaho Constitution's commitment to providing public schools as a fundamentally proper role of government."
The IEN Working Group, including 11 legislators, will conduct its first meeting at 3 p.m. Thursday, February 5, in the Senate Majority Caucus Room on the Fourth Floor of the Idaho State Capitol.
