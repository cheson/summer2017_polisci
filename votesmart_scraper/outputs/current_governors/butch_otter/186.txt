Governor Otter has worked to limit government and provide unlimited opportunities for Idahoans by:
*Prudently and conservatively refusing to grow government as fast as our economy expands.
*Making state government more accountable for how it spends every taxpayer dollar by requiring greater fiscal transparency and a structurally sound and sustainable budget.
*Reducing the burden of debt hanging over Idaho taxpayers' heads for state retiree medical benefits by hundreds of millions of dollars.
*Building and maintaining responsible "rainy day" reserve funds to avoid the dysfunction of budget "holdbacks" during tough economic times.
*Reducing the marginal income tax rate for individuals and businesses, steadily reducing the sales tax on groceries, and reducing the personal property tax.
