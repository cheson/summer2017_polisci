Governor Reacts to Supreme Court Ruling in Northern Idaho Property Rights Case
Statement
By: Butch Otter

Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to the United States Supreme Court's unanimous decision for Mike and Chantell Sackett of Priest Lake, who challenged Environmental Protection Agency enforcement actions under the Clean Water Act.
"I applaud the Sacketts for their diligence and civic virtue in pursuing redress of their grievance against the Environmental Protection Agency all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is unfortunate it took this long, and that it required a decision from our highest court, to resolve what I consider to be a fairly simple issue -- American citizens are guaranteed certain rights and protections when dealing with the federal government, and that is never truer than when those dealings involve private property. This decision should serve as a clarion call to Congress, and I look forward to continue working with Idaho's delegation, to develop common-sense restrictions on how the EPA implements the Clean Water Act. We must use this ruling as a rallying point in a renewed commitment to reining in this runaway federal agency."
