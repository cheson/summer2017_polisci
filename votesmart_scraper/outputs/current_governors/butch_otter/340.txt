It's easy to get excited about the prospects for Idaho's economic future when you look at our healthcare businesses. They represent one of our fastest-growing industries, creating lots of career opportunities for our citizens in every corner of the state and enthusiastically participating in my Project 60 effort to grow Idaho's economy.
Healthcare jobs are expected to grow by 14 percent nationally and 21 percent in Idaho over the next decade, with an average wage of more than $40,000 a year.
Idaho's largest private employer -- with 8,289 employees -- is Boise-based St. Luke's Health Systems, which has facilities in four Idaho cities. St. Alphonsus Regional Medical Center, also based in Boise, also is among Idaho's top 10 employers, with 3,390 workers.
An area of healthcare even larger than hospitals, in terms of employment and wages, is the sector that includes clinics, specialists and private medical offices. This sector added 11,100 jobs over the past decade and is expected to grow by another 25 percent in the next decade. Then there are nursing facilities, residential care facilities, insurance carriers and social assistance -- all areas projected to grow by double digits.
Those impressive numbers are driven, in part, by the nearly $1.5 billion that Medicaid contributes to Idaho's economy through more than 11,000 healthcare providers throughout the state -- all the more reason to quickly and completely iron out complications with our new benefits contractor to ensure those payments are made promptly and efficiently.
In recent years, healthcare facilities also have been heavy investors in Idaho. As a group, Idaho's hospitals have invested more than $400 million here in the past few years. And the industry expects to invest three times that much or more in Idaho over the next decade.
Take a look at what's happening all over Idaho:
* St Luke's, already the state's largest private employer, is still hiring, with 350 open positions right now. It already has grown by 1,600 employees in the past year. St. Luke's now has Idaho's largest commercial construction project -- a $220 million, 700,000-square-foot facility being built in Twin Falls. St. Luke's Magic Valley Medical Center employs an average of 350 construction workers at the site each day, and the new hospital is scheduled to open next spring
* Last fall, St. Luke's purchased two vacant Micron Technology buildings in Boise, investing nearly $20 million to transform them into a new central laboratory and central laundry facility. It also invested several million dollars in expansions of its Cardiac Cath Labs in Meridian and development of a Cardiac Rehabilitation Center. Over the next decade, St. Luke's alone plans to invest $1 billion in new facilities and equipment in Idaho.
* The new $220 million Portneuf Medical Center being built in Pocatello will open next year. The medical center has 1,300 employees -- with an additional 400 jobs during the construction -- and is the largest taxpayer in Bannock County.
* St. Alphonsus spent $10.5 million in the past year to improve patient access to healthcare and maintain its quality of care. Improvements included a $2.9 million expansion of its physician network, a $2.1 million electronic medical record system, $4.6 million in improvements to equipment and facilities, and nearly $1 million in laboratory automation technologies. The hospital also spent more than twice that much in community and charitable services. Meanwhile, St. Al's has increased its employee count by nearly 100 over the past year.
* Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls broke ground in July on a $20 million expansion and renovation of its Women & Infants Center. The project creates 140 construction-related jobs, and another 20 permanent jobs will be created when construction is completed. EIRMC is the third-largest employer in Bonneville County, with 1,374 employees earning an average of $26.51 per hour.
* Mountain View Hospital in Idaho Falls spent $11 million to expand its facility last year, doubling the number of in-patient rooms and expanding several other areas. The expansion led to a 14-percent increase in the hospital's employment, to 421 people, and an increase in payroll by 24 percent. This year, Mountain View is expanding again, building a transitional care facility with partner Ball Ventures. The $5 million facility opens this month and will create 50 new jobs once it is fully operational.
* Regence Blue Shield, with operations in four states, has made a significant commitment to Idaho. In Lewiston, it built a 57,000-square-foot building in 2006 and expanded it in 2008. The company cites its commitment to Lewiston and Idaho's solid workforce as reasons it stays here rather than putting those resources into other locations in Oregon, Utah and Washington. In recent years, Regence Blue Shield has opened new locations in Twin Falls and Coeur d'Alene, as well as keeping an office in Pocatello. Its employment in Idaho has grown from 484 in 2001 to 767 in 2010, and it plans to keep growing here.
* Bingham Memorial Hospital in Blackfoot is nearly finished with its multimillion-dollar construction and remodeling projects, including a sky bridge connecting the hospital to a new medical office plaza. Ninety-nine percent of the work on the office project was performed by Idaho workers, and the hospital itself has nearly tripled its employment to more than 600 since 2005.
Healthcare costs and availability are grabbing national headlines every day. But in Idaho, the growth of career and economic opportunities in healthcare fields is the real news. And there is much more to come.
