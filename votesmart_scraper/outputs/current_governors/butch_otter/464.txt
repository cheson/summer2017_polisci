GOVERNOR REACTS TO HOUSE VOTE ON FUEL TAX BILL
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to the Idaho House of Representatives' 43-27 vote against House Bill 246:
"I'm disappointed by today's outcome, but I appreciate the constructive debate and I am not giving up. My staff and I continue to talk with legislators, as do representatives of the many stakeholders from communities throughout Idaho who support taking action now on our transportation needs. I believe all the facts are in and the case has been made. Don't take my word for it; the Legislature's own audit confirms the need. There also is no doubt that one-time stimulus money is not the answer. I remain committed to finding a significant, stable and long-term solution to the funding requirements for protecting our $16 billion public investment in roads and bridges. In the meantime, it is important to note the steps the Legislature and my office are taking together to address the fundamental issue of confidence in the Idaho Transportation Department. I understand that confidence and trust are necessary, and that they go hand in hand with entrusting ITD with more taxpayer money. This process continues."
