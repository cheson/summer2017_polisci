ASIAN TRADE MISSION PROVIDES SHORT-TERM SALES AND LONG-TERM POTENTIAL
A mid-October trade mission led by Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter to Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam and Taiwan is expected to result in initial sales of more than $3.7 million in the coming year for Idaho businesses.
Additional sales also are expected from the October 11-22 trade mission, which the Governor led as part of his Project 60 effort to expand Idaho's economy. Several of the 16 Idaho companies and industry associations that participated have not yet quantified their results.
Industries represented included agriculture commodities, processed food, cold chain management solutions, mining and mining equipment, transportation equipment, forest products, and health and personal care products.
Hong Kong and Taiwan are among Idaho's top 10 export markets. Macau, which is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, has a rapidly growing gaming and tourism sector which provides unique opportunities for Idaho food producers. In 2007 Idaho exports to the five markets totaled more than $480 million.
"We did a lot of good work over there," Governor Otter said. "We pioneered new ground for Idaho in some markets and we built upon a strong foundation in others. As the first-ever Idaho Governor's Trade Mission to include stops in Hong Kong, Macau and Vietnam, I was pleased to see the growth potential. I'm looking forward to solid returns on our investment well into the future."
Attached are summaries of the mission's work at each of the four destinations, as well as a link to photos from the trip.
