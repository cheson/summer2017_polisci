Those of us entrusted with public service must fulfill our responsibility to make government as efficient as it can possibly be and to never forget that this is the people's money. We must ensure that our state government lives within the people's means.
Among the first things Governor Otter did when he took office was to impose a zero-base budgeting program. That means every agency and operation of state government must justify its spending and continuing existence every year; there are no "grandfather" rights when it comes to taxpayer dollars. Governor Otter is fighting the culture of entitlement that leads to runaway growth and "mission creep" in government by insisting that agencies stick to those jobs required of them by law or the Idaho Constitution. He knows most Idahoans -- independent by nature -- recognize and appreciate that government cannot and must not seek to be all things to all people, and that promising more than state government can or should even try to deliver is bad public policy. Governor Otter also knows that Idahoans deserve a state government that gives them good value for their hard-earned tax dollars, and he is determined to see that they get it.
