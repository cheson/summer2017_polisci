DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005 -- (House of Representatives - July 07, 2004)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. OTTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake) for his leadership and once again for bringing forth, I think, a very important doctrine relative to our policy here in the Western Hemisphere.
I rise today in support of this amendment, with great concern about the more than 40 years of failed American policy towards Cuba.
We talk a lot about bringing democracy to Cuba and other parts of the world, especially for those who have suffered under the cruel fist of Communist tyranny for decades. Yet for decades we have worked to shut off their access to their very best hope for freedom, and that is to experience it by conversing with people who are free, or at least were free up until June 30, when once again we adopted another tyrannical national policy toward Cuba.
Instead of bringing about positive change for the people of Cuba, this decrepit policy has hurt ordinary Cubans. It has hurt their families and has deprived ordinary Americans of the opportunity to become ambassadors of freedom. The new restrictions that were put into effect last month only cripple our ability to see change come to the Cuban people.
We say we are trying to help the Cuban people, but by imposing even stricter limits on how Cuban Americans can help their family members in Cuba, these changes hurt not only the Cuban Government but ordinary Cuban citizens who are struggling under that very dictatorship that we try now to depose.
