CHILD CREDIT PRESERVATION AND EXPANSION ACT OF 2004
Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, we are a Nation of families, and for good reason. The family unit is the foundation of society. And America's future depends on the success of our families. Our jobs as Members of Congress should be to nurture an environment in America where families can flourish and provide and support the opportunity of freedom and the sense of civic virtue that children need to become responsible citizens.
We did the right thing by increasing the child tax credit in 2001. We did the right thing by accelerating that process last year. And now, by making the child tax credit permanent, we ensure that families continue to retain more control over their own money and we enable them to plan for the future, and we give them the freedom to help their children accomplish their dreams.
There are almost a quarter of a million children in my State whose families will benefit if we pass H.R. 4359. But without this legislation, those families will feel the weight of a significantly increased burden next year. In fact, under current law, tax-paying families in Idaho will pay $757 million more in taxes than they did last year. That money should be staying in their pockets. They should continue to enjoy the fruits of their labors, planning for tomorrow's doctors and teachers and scientists and leaders.
This legislation is about creating an environment that enables those families to take care of their own. It is about time we let them take care of their own.
