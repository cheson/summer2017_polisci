Governor Otter Applauds U.S. Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby Decision
Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: June 30, 2014
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in the Hobby Lobby case, ruling that employers with religious objections can opt out of providing contraception coverage under Obamacare. Idaho was among 20 states joining in an Amicus brief in support of the arguments from defendants Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties.
"As Governor of one of the states weighing in on this case, I'm encouraged to see religious liberty trumping Obamacare's headlong rush to impose a contraceptive mandate on the American people. Today's ruling confirms once again that President Obama's policies -- when left unchecked -- are eroding our constitutional rights. I remain committed to challenging that misguided course at every opportunity, and I'm grateful to courageous individuals and employers willing to stand up and be counted."
