Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter welcomed recommendations today from a task force he appointed to study how best to fund Idaho's current and future road and bridge needs. Among its suggestions was delaying implementation of any user-fee increases until Idaho's economy improves.
"Our transportation needs are real and growing, and the safety of Idaho citizens remains one of our highest priorities. But too many people remain jobless, under-employed or on the ragged edge financially to impose higher costs on them right now," Governor Otter said. "I won't ask the Legislature to approve any funding increases in 2011, but the task force has provided us with a path forward while we keep doing all we can to get people back to work by growing our economy."
The Governor's 15-member Task Force on Modernizing Transportation Task Force concluded that:
* Idaho's future economic prosperity is directly tied to an efficient and modern transportation system.
* Without additional revenue, only critical safety and maintenance projects will be completed, leaving no funds for capacity improvements.
* Idaho is a geographically challenged state with a relatively small population -- with half as many residents per mile of road as most of our surrounding states.
* Idaho should not count on the federal government to satisfy the state's critical road and bridge needs, and Idaho is at risk of not qualifying for matching federal funds without additional state revenue.
* Delaying critical maintenance will result in higher costs in the future.
* Public transportation is a necessary component to transportation efficiency.
* Costs should be allocated in a fair and competitive manner to all classes of highway users.
* Idaho must continue seeking more modern methods of transportation funding since motor fuel tax collections do not keep up with inflation and do not account for newer vehicles that are either electric or more fuel efficient.
