"There are few things more important to our long-term economic well-being than becoming more energy independent. Hydro, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and nuclear power all are critical elements of building that independence and a more secure and prosperous future."
Governor Otter showed his keen understanding of the role of renewable and alternative energy resources -- as well as the critical importance of improving Idaho's energy transmission capabilities -- when he created the Office of Energy Resources in 2007. Administrator Paul Kjellander -- a former legislator and head of the Idaho Public Utilities Commission -- and his team of experts hit the ground running with an ambitious agenda aimed at putting Idaho ahead of the curve in energy development, transmission and innovation. Governor Otter's support for the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES), a collaborative partnership between Idaho's universities and the Idaho National Laboratory, already is paying dividends in developing new technologies and serving as a seed bed for new economic opportunities throughout Idaho. The Governor's "25 by '25" initiative to have 25 percent of Idaho's energy needs met by alternative sources by 2025 has become the Idaho Strategic Energy Alliance, leveraging public-private partnerships toward future energy independence.
