GOVERNOR STARTS Â‘MARCH AGAINST METH'
SHERIFFS JOIN OTTER IN ANTI-DRUG PROCLAMATION SIGNING
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter, joined by members of the Idaho Sheriffs Association, signed a proclamation on Friday designating the month of March a "March Against Meth," beginning the statewide campaign against methamphetamines and other illegal drugs.
The proclamation encourages "all Idahoans to reaffirm their commitment to a lifestyle free of illegal drugs, and to educating themselves about the resources that exist to combat Idaho's methamphetamine addiction problem."
Debbie Field, head of Governor Otter's Office of Drug Policy, is working with law enforcement, judicial and local government authorities, as well as a wide spectrum of private-sector partners, in developing a coordinated approach to combating meth in Idaho.
"It's great to see all the resources, all the talent and all the energy we have here in Idaho being brought into play to attack this problem," Governor Otter said. "My hope is that a concentrated focus during the month of March will set the stage for a continuing campaign to rid our state of this destructive, deadly scourge."
In his proclamation, the Governor called methamphetamine use "a serious problem that affects all Idahoans from all backgrounds and an effective approach to this issue will require a comprehensive and cooperative effort."
