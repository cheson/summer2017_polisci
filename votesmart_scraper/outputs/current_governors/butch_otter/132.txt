The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB/Idaho), comprised of over 4,500 small businesses throughout the state, has endorsed Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter in his re-election campaign for Governor.
In the organization's endorsement, NFIB/Idaho praised Governor Otter for his stewardship of the state through one of the toughest economic times in the nation's history. "True to his word, Governor Otter held the line on taxes and spending during the most difficult economy in many decades," said Suzanne Budge, Idaho state director of NFIB. "In the face of strong criticism, especially from the education establishments, he refused to raise taxes and forced government to live within its means. As a result of his steadfastness, Idaho is better positioned to reap a bigger harvest from an improving economy."
"Small business plays a tremendous role in creating jobs and strengthening our state's economy, and will continue to play a key role in propelling our state out of a recession that so many states are still trying to break free from. I appreciate the NFIB/Idaho's endorsement, and I"ll continue to ensure that government is not an impediment to economic growth," Governor Otter said.
89 percent of the NFIB/Idaho members support the re-election of Governor Otter.
