Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced today that he signed an Executive Order to aid in the ongoing recovery and rebuilding efforts in the wake of wildfires that devastated large parts of northern Idaho last summer.
The emergency order allows for the waiver of state electrical, plumbing, and HVAC permit/inspection fees to assist with reconstruction and repair efforts for commercial and residential buildings in Clearwater, Idaho and Lewis counties that suffered extensive damage.
"Now that residents and business owners have moved beyond the assessment phase and are into the rebuilding phase, I want to assure them the state is doing what it can to ease the financial burden," said Governor Otter. "By waiving these fees, residents impacted in these counties can begin putting their lives back together in the aftermath of an extremely destructive fire season."
