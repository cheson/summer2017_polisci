Issues Statement on Belgium Terror Attack
Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: March 22, 2016
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter took time today to formally acknowledge the role and self-sacrifice families of Idaho's servicemen and women make every day for the security of our state and nation. The Governor officially dedicated 2016 in the state as "The Year of Idaho's Military Families."
"In the aftermath of another horrible round of terrorist attacks, this time in Belgium, I want to encourage our citizens to take a moment to recognize the invaluable contributions made every day by the families of our men and women in uniform," said Governor Otter. "These families are routinely asked to shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden, under extremely adverse and demanding circumstances, all in an effort to keep our country safe. As a society, we should never forget that this hazardous duty takes a toll not just on the man or woman in uniform, but on their family as well. For their service and sacrifice, I wish to extend the humble thanks of a grateful state."
More than 500 Idaho National Guard men and women of the 124th Fighter Wing based at Gowen Field in Boise, will soon depart for the Middle East. They will be deployed this spring and summer in support of the U.S.-led combat operations in southwest Asia. The mission will include multiple aircraft, pilots, maintenance personnel, security forces, medical personnel and various other support staff. Deployments typically last up to 180 days.
Today's attacks in Belgium killed at least 32 people and left over a hundred injured. Among the injured were an unidentified American serviceman and his family. The Governor and First Lady ask all Idahoans to join them in keeping the victims of today's terror attacks in their thoughts and prayers.
