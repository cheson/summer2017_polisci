Balukoff Distorts the Truth to Deflect Attention from His Liberal Policies

Location: Boise, ID

The Otter for Idaho campaign launched new TV and radio advertisements to accurately describe the Governor's proactive response to concerns over the Corrections Corporation of America's (CCA) management of the Idaho State Correctional Center.
The ads document the Governor's response to CCA, outlining the Governor's call for an audit, his request for a criminal investigation, and his directive for the state to take control over ISCC.
While the Governor was not personally involved in the settlement agreement between the state of Idaho and CCA concerning understaffing, he is adamant that CCA will be held accountable for any criminal wrongdoing associated with the company's management of ISCC.
"In the final days of the election, my opponent is desperate to deflect attention away from his liberal policies. The reality is that his positions in support of higher taxes, Obamacare, and the re-introduction of wolves are contrary to the beliefs of many Idahoans and he is doing everything possible to distract voters and tilt at windmills by shouting "scandal' where it doesn't exist. The facts point to the truth and I stand behind my response to this situation to be a good fiduciary of the State while ensuring public safety and the wellbeing of the inmates. "
The new ads are running on cable, network television and radio networks statewide.
