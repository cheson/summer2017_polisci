Otter Reintroduces SAFE Act 4/6/2005
Congressman Joins Senate Colleague in Bid to Amend USA PATRIOT Act
WASHINGTON, D.C. - With the USA PATRIOT Act under review, Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter reintroduced legislation on Wednesday to help ensure an effective war on terrorism is fought without infringing on Americans' constitutional freedoms.
The House version of the Security and Freedom Ensured (SAFE) Act is a companion bill to a measure introduced by Idaho Senator Larry Craig on Wednesday. Both seek to provide law enforcement with all the tools it needs to stop terrorists while limiting the potential for violations of the constitutional rights to privacy and due process of law, and to strengthen checks and balances on new government authority.
"The issue is not whether we can trust the sincere and well-meaning people prosecuting the war on terrorism today I believe we can. The issue is our responsibility to be vigilant in protecting the individual liberties with which we are blessed for future generations," said Otter, who was joined by fellow Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson and eight others as original cosponsors of the SAFE Act in the House.
"The PATRIOT Act is a valuable and perhaps even essential weapon against the forces of hate and violence and extremism. However, Congress has a duty to carefully balance the power of such a weapon by safeguarding the heritage of a free and open society. This bill is about helping Americans feel safe, in every sense of the word."
The House Judiciary Committee began hearings Wednesday on reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act, some provisions of which expire at the end of 2005 unless Congress acts.
