OTTER SETS FIRST Â‘CAPITOL FOR A DAY'
BONNERS FERRY TO HOST FIRST OF EVENTS PLANNED THROUGHOUT IDAHO
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced today that the first stop on his statewide "Capitol for a Day" initiative will be Bonners Ferry, on Tuesday, January 30th.
The governor will be joined by representatives of state agencies serving the Bonners Ferry area and Boundary County for the daylong event at the Bonners Ferry City Hall, 7232 Main Street. They will meet on a first-come, first-served basis with citizens who have questions, concerns or problems that state government might address.
"Back in the early 1980s, Governor John Evans had a Capitol for a Day program that I always admired," Otter said. "It's about giving some of our smaller, off-the-beaten-path communities a chance to better connect with their state government and those of us who serve them. I plan to go to every corner of this great state during my administration. It will be good to renew this tradition, and spend some time in the real Idaho."
In Bonners Ferry, the Capitol for a Day will begin at 9 a.m. local time on January 30th. The governor and First Lady will join city, county and Kootenai Tribe officials for a luncheon at the Kootenai River Inn from noon until 1:30 p.m., when the governor once again will be available at City Hall until 3 p.m.
