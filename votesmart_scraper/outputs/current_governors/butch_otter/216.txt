Press Release
By: Butch Otter
Date: July 10, 2013
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter is featured in two new public service announcements (PSAs) on wildfire safety and prevention.
In the "Firewise" PSA, Governor Otter demonstrates how to prepare wildland homes to reduce the threat from wildfires. The PSA was shot at the Governor's own cabin in Pine, Idaho -- an area of threatened by the Trinity Ridge Fire last summer.
In the "Thin the Threat" PSA, Governor Otter emphasizes the need to support thinning and management projects in our national forests.
"Idaho's fire seasons are getting worse," he said. "The PSAs remind Idahoans this is the time to reduce the threat of wildfire by getting defensive about their properties and supporting thinning in dense, overcrowded national forests."
Governor Otter, the Idaho Department of Lands, the U.S. Forest Service and the Idaho Forest Products Commission ask that TV and radio stations across Idaho air the PSAs as much as possible during the 2013 fire season.
The 30-second Firewise PSA is available in AVI, MOV, and MPEG 4 files.
The 30-second Thin the Threat PSA is available in MP4, WMV, and MOV files.
