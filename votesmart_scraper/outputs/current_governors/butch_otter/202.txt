Governor Otter Reacts to Interior Department's Gateway West Announcement
Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: Nov. 13, 2013
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in response to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell's announcement late Tuesday about the proposed Gateway West power transmission project through Wyoming and Idaho.
"This federal process has gone on too long, and it continues to be fraught with uncertainty and confusion. This week's announcement raises at least as many questions as it answers. I've made no secret about my position -- we need Gateway West. I am committed to ensuring that Idaho voices are heard on this issue, including those of our counties and private property owners. As I expressed again to Secretary Jewell in Washington last month, my collaborative sage-grouse plan establishes a model for the kind of approach that's needed."
