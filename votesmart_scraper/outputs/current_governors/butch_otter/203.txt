Statement

Date: Nov. 10, 2013
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today regarding the recent vandalism of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints buildings in Chubbuck.
"Defiling or defacing houses of worship -- of any faith or denomination -- is an attack not just on religious beliefs or even our law, but also on our culture and our values. It disturbs the sanctuaries of our spiritual well-being. These are not merely the acts of misguided individuals. They speak to a more fundamental disregard for sacred places, social order and the freedoms that generations of Americans have sacrificed to protect."
