Otter Discourages Underground Wings
CANDIDATE OPPOSES EXPENSIVE STATEHOUSE EXPANSION PLAN
MOUNTAIN HOME, Idaho - Republican Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter told the Mountain Home News that, as governor, he will discourage costly plans to add underground wings to the State Capitol in Boise.
Otter, campaigning for governor Saturday during Air Force Appreciation Day festivities in Mountain Home, was responding to a question from the newspaper about recent reports that cost estimates for expansion and renovation plans at the Capitol had skyrocketed.
"We have a lot of legitimate and even pressing needs in Idaho right now. While I value the work and contribution of our state employees and legislators, we can't justify spending that kind of money on their accommodations while our children need better schools and community colleges," Otter said.
He said the Capitol - the people's house - clearly must be renovated to address health, safety and other issues. However, the state could meet its need for additional office space for lawmakers and state employees with relatively modest improvements to existing buildings it owns near the Capitol.
The Idaho Capitol Commission recently voted to ask the State Building Authority to issue $130 million in bonds to pay for the more elaborate work. The estimated cost of the project, including renovating the Capitol and adding two underground wings, jumped from $115 million when the Legislature approved it last winter, and construction costs are continuing to rise.
"I'm determined to meet the responsibilities of state government while keeping our financial house in order. That means eliminating unnecessary expenses. This is one of them," Otter said.
