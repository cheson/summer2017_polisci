Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today regarding the impact of legislative action on Senate Bill 1067 shortly before the Legislature adjourned its 2015 session:
"I am concerned that some members of the House Judiciary and Rules Committee put Idaho's child support system at serious risk by killing Senate Bill 1067 in the waning hours of the 2015 legislative session. We are analyzing the impacts of the committee's actions and what they mean for the 400,000 people who depend on Idaho's system."
