GOVERNOR ISSUES EXECUTIVE ORDER ON COMPLIANCE WITH ITD LEGISLATIVE AUDIT
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued an executive order late Wednesday detailing how the Idaho Transportation Department will comply over the next three years with the major findings of a recent audit of its operations by the Legislature's Office of Performance Evaluations.
Among other things, Executive Order 2009-08 requires ITD to publish an "Annual Accountability Report" by January 1 of each year, and to submit quarterly status updates on its progress toward implementing the OPE audit recommendations.
Governor Otter also delivered a letter to every member of the Legislature thanking them for their "leadership and continued help in restoring public confidence by making ITD as accountable, efficient and effective as possible."
"As you know, my efforts to establish greater institutional accountability and efficiency at ITD became more focused late last year when I directed the department to immediately cut its administrative costs by 10 percent and redirect the money to road funding," the Governor wrote to legislators. "Yet like you, I remain concerned about ITD's progress in finding and implementing efficiencies in its internal processes and its delivery of services. And like you, my commitment to our shared goals is even stronger as a result of that concern."
