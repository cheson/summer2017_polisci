Governors Give Industrial Energy Efficiency a Boost
Press Release

Location: Boise, ID

A two-day "Summit on Industrial Energy Efficiency" that
wrapped up on Thursday will result in the development of a number of
recommendations for Western governors to consider in an effort to save
energy and reduce costs.
Gov. C. L. "Butch" Otter (Idaho), Chairman of the Western Governors'
Association, addressed the summit attendees on Wednesday. He noted
that industry consumes approximately 28 percent of the West's total energy
use, which is why incremental improvements in efficiency can have a large
impact on reducing the region's overall energy consumption.
"Energy efficiency is the low hanging fruit in our energy orchard and we
need to aggressively pursue all reasonable cost-effective opportunities,"
Otter said. "By aggressively pursuing energy efficiency we free up capacity
on our transmission system and make more energy available to help
businesses expand."
Otter said many states have programs that already have assisted industry
in reducing energy use by 2 to 3 percent a year, resulting in a 10 to 15
percent savings over more than five years.
"We need to better understand which policies spur greater investments in
energy efficiency, as well as those that may hinder progress," he said.
Summit attendees participated in breakout sessions to develop
recommendations for the governors to consider when they meet this June
in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho for their Annual Meeting.
