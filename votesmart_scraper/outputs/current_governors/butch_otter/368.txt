"From 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina and from floods and fires to highway patrols and search and rescue, first responders and other emergency personnel are an essential lifeline for citizens -- especially in a state as big as Idaho. They deserve our appreciation, respect and support."
Governor Otter is extremely proud of the talent, commitment and integrity shown by Idaho's public safety professionals. The Idaho State Police, Department of Correction, Bureau of Homeland Security and Idaho National Guard are led by Colonel Jerry Russell, Director Brent Reinke, General Bill Shawver and General Gary Sayler, respectively. Together, they and the troopers, correctional officers, soldiers and airmen they command provide a first line of defense for the people of Idaho. As Commander in Chief, Governor Otter is inspired by the dedication to duty shown by all the uniformed services in Idaho, and strongly supports their missions of protecting and defending our communities and citizens. He has worked to improve our statewide emergency communication system and to integrate the public safety missions as much as possible with those of other state agencies in support of local first responders. Public safety comes first in the Otter administration, and the men and women who protect and defend us serve a truly proper role of government.
