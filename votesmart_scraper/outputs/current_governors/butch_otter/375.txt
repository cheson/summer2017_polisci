Location: Boise, ID

"My goal is to make Idaho a place where individuals and communities are empowered to succeed, where the entrepreneurial spirit is celebrated, and where today's good ideas can become tomorrow's new careers and industries."
Governor Otter is leaving no stone unturned in developing jobs for Idahoans. Just ask the folks at AREVA, Premier Technology, Synoptek, ATK, Ground Force Manufacturing and many others. He launched "Project 60" to grow our economy by harnessing Idaho's resources, talents and entrepreneurial spirit and leveraging them with public-private partnerships that work in the marketplace and our communities. From seeking out the wisdom and celebrating the success of the innovative people creating economic opportunity in our state to attracting foreign investment in our emerging renewable and alternative energy sector, and from expanding broadband capabilities throughout rural Idaho to aggressively recruiting businesses to move here from states where taxes and the regulatory environment are less stable and predictable, Governor Otter is spreading the word that Idaho is open for business!
