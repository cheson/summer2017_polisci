State's April Revenue Was Below Projection
Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: May 3, 2010
Location: Boise, ID

The Idaho Division of Financial Management issued preliminary, incomplete April tax revenue data today that shows the State took in $55.5 million less than projected during the past month. The numbers will be complete and "official" on May 15. Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter was briefed on the shortfall and issued the following statement:
"Sales tax receipts were up in April. So were receipts from individual income tax withholding. That means more people are earning money and feeling better about their prospects. That's good news, but it doesn't make up for other tax receipts remaining well below projections. I have no doubt that our economy is headed in the right direction. However, April's tax filings largely still reflect what was happening with the economy last year -- not over these past few months of marginally improving conditions. There is a lag between private economic activity and its public benefit. We must keep working to create career-path job opportunities for more Idahoans. If we do that, the revenue will come. But for now it's clearer than ever that we are doing the right thing by remaining prudent and cautious in our approach to using taxpayers' money. I'm grateful that legislators recognized that and gave me the tools to balance the budget in Fiscal 2010. The Legislature deserves a lot of credit for working with me to ensure Idaho's State government lives within the people's means."
