In tonight's final gubernatorial debate, Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter clearly demonstrated that he is the only candidate with a clear vision for Idaho values, a strong conservative record of results and specific plans to keep Idaho moving forward.
While Governor Otter's opponents were focused on mud-slinging to divert attention from their lofty ideas that are lacking concrete details or funding mechanisms, the Governor highlighted the accomplishments of his administration.
"Idaho's greatness is because of its people," said Otter in his closing remarks. "That is what has brought us out of the recession faster than anybody else. Folks have recognized that Idaho is a good place to do business; it's a good place to raise a family; it's a good place to grow your company. We didn't stray from our values and we didn't stray from our families -- the strength of our government is in the strength of the home."
While Governor Otter made it clear during tonight's debate that education and workforce development are his priorities moving forward, he reminded viewers that we have much to celebrate. Idaho is the envy of many other states due to our robust economy and job growth, top national rankings when it comes to K-12 spending and the return on investment, as well as student achievement scores.
Tonight's debate was sponsored by Idaho Public Television, the Idaho Press Club, and the League of Women Voters.
The general election is on Tuesday, November 4.
