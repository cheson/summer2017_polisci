Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter's conservative leadership continues to propel Idaho out of the recession, faster than most states across the country. The State Policy Report released its State Economic Momentum figures, ranking Idaho as the number one state for growth in personal income from the same period in 2013 to 2014.
"This is further proof that we took the steps necessary to continue building a brighter future for Idahoans. Was it easy? No. But we did the same thing families across Idaho had to do-- we tightened our belts and figured out how to live within our means. We defined the difference between nice and necessary. We balanced the budget without taking money from Idaho taxpayers. I will continue to run the state of Idaho this way with these conservative principles. And moving forward, we will maintain our focus on workforce development and enhance the earning capability of every Idahoan."
The State policy Report defines state personal income as the income received by all sources, including net earnings by place of residence, rental income, dividends, interest and transfer payments. Between the second quarter of 2013 and the same period in 2014, personal income across the nation grew by 4.05% and it grew by 6.22% in Idaho.
Idaho also tops the list for having one of the lowest unemployment rates, and for the state's overall economic momentum.
