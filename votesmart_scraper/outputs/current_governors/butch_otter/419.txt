Just click on the "Project 60 Video Journey" button in the center of the front page and you will hear straight from Governor Otter, Department of Commerce Director Don Dietrich and Idaho business leaders about the advantages of becoming a Project 60 Partner.
The videos introduce the Project 60 concept, then walk you step by step through the three-tiered plan for strengthening both rural and urban communities, creating quality jobs that lead to careers, recruiting new companies to Idaho, and selling Idaho's trade and investment opportunities to the world.
The videos also include Idaho business leaders who are Project 60 partners explaining why Idaho is such a great place to do business, and how their companies are teaming up with the state to help grow Idaho's economy.
The video journey encourages business and industry leaders to share networking opportunities with their vendors and customers in other states, and invites them to become a partner for Idaho's future.
"Project 60 belongs to all of us and we all need to be champions of this effort," Governor Otter said. "Our partners at Unity Media Group in Eagle worked with us to create this short journey, or jLog, because they know that growing Idaho's economy is good for all of us. It's our way of helping everyone participate in this process."
