Otter Weighs In On Search Of House Office 5/23/2006
CONGRESSMAN CONTENDS LAWMAKERS SHOULD BE HELD TO SAME STANDARD AS OTHERS
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement Tuesday in response to comments from congressional leaders regarding the FBI's Saturday night raid on the office of Democrat U.S. Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana.
"It's tough for me to get too excited about the howls of protest from leading members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. I understand their concerns about protecting the independence of the legislative branch and possible abuse of executive powers. But it makes me wonder: Where were these voices of outrage and righteous indignation when we learned the executive branch was monitoring the telephone conversations of ordinary Americans? Where were they when the executive branch sought more power to search the homes and businesses of ordinary Americans without notification? At least we know there was a legitimate warrant issued by a judge for the search of Congressman Jefferson's office. Are my honorable colleagues suggesting that members of Congress or the institution itself should be treated differently in the eyes of the law than those who hold the most important position in America - that of Â‘citizen?' I hope not."
