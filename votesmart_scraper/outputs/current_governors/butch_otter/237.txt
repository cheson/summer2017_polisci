Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter is asking Idahoans to take a few minutes on Friday to remember the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting who were murdered last Friday by a lone gunman in Newtown, Connecticut. The Governor acted upon a request he received from Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy.
"At this time when Idahoans celebrate the spirit of the season we should take a moment to remember that many families in Connecticut are dealing with unspeakable tragedy and the reality that their family and their community has been changed forever," Governor Otter said. "I ask that all Idahoans observe a moment of silence on Friday, December 21, at 9:30 a.m. Mountain Time to let our friends in Connecticut know they are in our thoughts and prayers, and that they are not alone in their grief."
