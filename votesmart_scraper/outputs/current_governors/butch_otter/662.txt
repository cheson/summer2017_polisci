RECOGNIZING THE VETERANS WHO SERVED DURING WORLD WAR II, THE AMERICANS WHO SUPPORTED THE WAR, AND CELEBRATING THE COMPLETION OF THE NATIONAL WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL
Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I missed the vote on H. Con. Res. 409 "Recognizing with humble gratitude the more than 16,000,000 veterans who served in the United States Armed forces during World War II and the Americans who supported the war effort on the home front and celebrating the completion of the National World War II Memorial on the National Mall in the District of Columbia". Had I been present I would have voted for this bill.
