Otter To Doe: Live Up To Your Commitments 2/8/2006
CONGRESSMAN OUTRAGED BY NEW EFFORT TO TARGET IDAHO WITH NUKE WASTE
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter vowed Wednesday to get to the bottom of reports that a new U.S. Department of Energy plan may include Idaho among several potential locations for interim storage of high-level nuclear waste.
Otter will use his membership on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to press the issue with Energy Department officials at an upcoming budget review hearing. He also will work with his colleagues in the Idaho delegation to ensure the DOE lives up to the provisions of the 1995 waste removal agreement it signed with Governor Phil Batt.
The agreement specified that no commercial spent nuclear fuel would be shipped to the Idaho National Laboratory for storage. In response to Congressman Otter's direct question on the House floor on May 24, 2005, House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development Chairman David Hobson of Ohio said the agreement had not been altered or contravened by federal law. (See attached).
"First Governor Batt and Governor Andrus - both of whom I served under as lieutenant governor - are forced into federal court this week to beat back an Energy Department challenge to the plain language of the 1995 agreement as it pertains to transuranic waste. Now DOE may be considering the INL as an interim storage site for high-level waste while it continues struggling to open Yucca Mountain," Otter said. "It's easy to understand why Idahoans are cynical about the Energy Department and why a court-enforced agreement was needed. Even early critics now can see just how important having those promises in writing really is."
The situation is aggravated by the efforts of Senate Democrat Leader Harry Reid, who was a recent visitor to Democrat faithful in Idaho. His continued pitched battle to prevent permanent storage of high-level spent reactor fuel from commercial nuclear plants at Nevada's Yucca Mountain makes the threat of Idaho becoming a waste dump much more real. Extended delays at the waste site in Reid's home state, despite billions of dollars in taxpayer money for construction work benefiting the economy there, reportedly are prompting the DOE to seek interim storage at its nuclear sites in other states.
According to the respected Environment & Energy Daily, "The potential interim storage sites, sources said, would be at federal installations, among them Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, the Idaho National Laboratory or even the Nevada Test Site, which is adjacent to Yucca Mountain."
"I was lieutenant governor when the 1995 agreement was signed. I know the degree of certainty that Governor Batt insisted upon and received from the DOE. Our word is our bond here in Idaho, and we expect the same from those with whom we have dealings," Otter said. "Idahoans won't stand for our state being turned into a nuclear waste dump, and the Energy Department knows as well as we do that its commitment to getting Â‘ALL' waste out meant just that."
