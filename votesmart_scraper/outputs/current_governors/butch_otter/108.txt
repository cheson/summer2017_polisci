The latest Otter for Idaho ad delivers a powerful message regarding the initiatives that Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter has put in place to keep moving Idaho forward.
The ad highlights how Governor Otter's accomplished leadership, his focus on job creation while growing the state's economy and his conservative values, have made Idaho one of the best places to start a small business.
On the education front, Governor Otter secured funding to get broadband Internet into every high school across the state. The ad also spotlights his significant investment of $35 million dollars in operating funds for Idaho's schools. This is the first step in implementing the 20 recommendations for improving K-12 education that were put together by the Governor's bipartisan Education Task Force.
"I have committed to replenish classroom dollars and we are poised to continue building on this year's $35 million investment. This money not only supports our teachers and administrators, but also will continue building more effective classroom and learning environments in a number of meaningful ways."
The ad begins airing statewide October 14th.
