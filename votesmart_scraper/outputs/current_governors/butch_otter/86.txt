Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Honorable Justices and Judges, my fellow constitutional officers, distinguished legislators and members of my Cabinet, honored guests, friends, my family and our First Lady Â… my fellow Idahoans.
Allow me first to comment briefly on two men who were with us here throughout the first eight years of my tenure in this office -- Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Luna and Secretary of State Ben Ysursa.

During my time in government I have seldom been privileged to work so closely with two individuals more devoted to the public interest or more motivated by the better angels of public service than Tom and Ben. Please join me now in an appreciation of their work, their legacy, and their friendship.

To our newly elected legislators and constitutional officers, congratulations and welcome. I applaud your willingness to serve. I respect and appreciate your civic virtue. And I encourage your attention, patience and commitment to the processes and purposes of our State government.
Like you, I am beginning a new term in office. It is an honor and a privilege to have once again garnered the support and confidence of the citizens of Idaho.
Like you, I take that responsibility very seriously. And I know that public confidence must be earned anew every day. So let us begin our work together unfettered by cynicism or mistrust, and with a sure understanding of our limitations as well as our potential.
With you, I look forward to advancing the interests of the people we serve.
With you, I am committed to continuing our efforts to make Idaho what America was meant to be.
