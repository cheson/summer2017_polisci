Governor Otter believes government can be more efficient and effective by:
*Making public policy more data-driven, citizen-centered and business friendly.
*Building inclusive public-private partnerships that leverage what government and business each does best.
*Working collaboratively with citizens, communities, counties and even the federal government toward achieving shared goals.
*Learning from the successes and challenges of other states -- Idaho's fellow "laboratories of the republic."
*Focusing on ensuring that public policies are sustainable and are fulfilling the limited and proper role of government.
