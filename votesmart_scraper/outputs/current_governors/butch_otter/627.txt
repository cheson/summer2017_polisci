WATER STORAGE -- (Extensions of Remarks - May 24, 2005)
SPEECH OF HON. C.L. ``BUTCH'' OTTER OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
TUESDAY, MAY 24, 2005
* Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, If there's one thing Idahoans understand, it's the importance of matching our limited water supplies to what seem to be unlimited demands on the water we have. Every year our water supplies face demands from irrigation, power generation, industrial and municipal users, as well as from environmental groups for fish recovery and other Endangered Species Act requirements.
* These demands are constantly growing, yet every spring we watch hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of water pass through our system that could and should be stored for beneficial uses. This is water that could be used for aquifer recharge, expanding municipal systems or even environmental mitigation.
* I have been told that the days of building new dams are over. However, I am not that easily convinced. Recently I convened a group of interested water users to look at additional storage opportunities in Idaho. The group is focusing on the Treasure Valley, but we are hopeful that the group can find some success and we can use a similar process in other regions of the state. We are not just talking about building dams; we also are looking at adding to existing structures, off-site storage, recharge and a host of other ideas.
* As part of this process, the Bureau of Reclamation in Idaho is undertaking the appraisal level study for the Boise and Payette river systems. The legislation I am introducing today is the next step in the process. It is a broad authorization for the Bureau to conduct feasibility studies on the Snake, Boise, and Payette River systems.
* Our communities, our economy and our families all depend on water to survive, grow and prosper. Deciding how to use such a rare commodity in a way that does the greatest good for the greatest number, while hewing to the principles of law and equity on which our society is based, is an enormous challenge. The task is further complicated, and brought into sharp focus, by the continuing drought plaguing Idaho and much of the arid West.
* Our energy, our economy and our environment all will depend on the ability to anticipate and prioritize future water needs. Our children, our grandchildren and generations to come all are depending on the choices we make today. Preserving water rights while providing for continued growth are a top priority of mine and I will continue to work to achieve that goal.
