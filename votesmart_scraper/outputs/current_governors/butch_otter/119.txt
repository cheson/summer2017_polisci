A new survey finds Idaho to be the 12th best state for teachers. WalletHub analyzed the 50 states and the District of Columbia utilizing 18 metrics including median starting salaries and annual salaries for teachers, job openings per capita and the number of elementary and secondary schools per capita.
"I appreciate the results of this survey because I want our teachers to know we value them. That being said, I want Idaho to be an even better state for teachers. That's why I put together the Task force for Improving Education with the goal of removing the politics and angst from the conversation in order to get to the heart of what is right for Idaho students, teachers and our communities. The task force developed a five-year, $350 million plan with 20 recommendations that I support."
Part of Task Force's plan includes enhancing teacher compensation and elevating starting teachers' annual base salaries from $31,000 to $40,000 within the next 5 years, providing ongoing professional growth opportunities and providing incentives for teachers to maintain or improve to levels of excellence.
