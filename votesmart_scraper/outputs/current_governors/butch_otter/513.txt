GOVERNOR UNVEILS SERIES OF WATER CONSERVATION PROJECTS
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter today announced a milestone water conservation project at Black Canyon Dam and five additional efforts aimed at improving the efficiency of water use in southern Idaho.
"These projects will not solve the conflict between groundwater and surface water users, but they will help make water use and conservation efforts more effective," Governor Otter said. "I hope they also will encourage others to develop and recommend similar projects for consideration as we continue seeking long-term solutions to our water challenges."
At Black Canyon Dam near Emmett, Governor Otter joined Idaho Department of Water Resources, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and other water officials in a ceremony launching the "Water 2025" project. It includes $300,000 from the federal agency, $100,000 from the state and $50,000 from the Black Canyon Irrigation District to replace eight miles of open canal with about 8,800 feet of pipeline. That will eliminate seepage and evaporation losses, eliminate the risk of canal failure and improve water delivery. The water saved then could be put to work to meet other needs.
Three of the additional projects involve collecting water already used for irrigation and fish habitat and pumping it back into Magic Valley springs so it can be reused in lieu of diverting additional spring water.
The Buckeye Ranch project includes three different pump-back systems. Some of the water saved will be added to Billingsley Creek to increase the flow and improve habitat there.
