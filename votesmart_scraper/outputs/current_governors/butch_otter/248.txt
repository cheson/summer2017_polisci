Governor Appoints Deputy Attorney General to Fourth District Court
Press Release
By: Butch Otter
Date: June 13, 2012
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C. L. "Butch" Otter today appointed Melissa Moody of Boise, lead deputy in Attorney General Lawrence Wasden's Special Prosecutions Unit, to fill a Fourth District Court vacancy left by the retirement of Judge Michael McLaughlin.
Moody, whose term on the bench begins June 30, is an Illinois native with degrees from the University of Illinois, Penn State University, and the Cornell University law school in central New York.
She was a law clerk for former Idaho Supreme Court Justice Gerald Schroeder, an Ada County deputy prosecutor, a deputy attorney general in the Criminal Appellate Division, a city prosecutor in Nampa, and a deputy attorney general in the Civil Litigation Division before becoming head of Special Prosecutions. Moody also worked for almost a year as a criminal law specialist for the American Bar Association in Tbilisi in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.
Among the cases she has handled was representing Attorney General Wasden in his lawsuit against the State Land Board -- of which both Wasden and Governor Otter are members -- over policies for leasing State endowment lands.
"Melissa's depth and breadth of experience, along with her high intelligence and exemplary work ethic, make her a great choice for the bench," Governor Otter said. "The Judicial Council sent me an outstanding slate of candidates, but Melissa stood out. She will be a fine judge and a credit to the Fourth Judicial District."
"I am honored and privileged to be selected for this position," Moody said. "I will do my best to serve the people of Idaho in my new role."
