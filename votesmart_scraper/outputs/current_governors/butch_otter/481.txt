GOVERNOR APPLAUDS NEW PLACEMENT OF HISTORICAL LINCOLN STATUE
Governor C. L. "Butch" Otter praised the announcement today that the West's oldest public monument to Abraham Lincoln is moving to Boise's downtown Capitol block.
A 1915 bronze sheet life-sized sculpture of Lincoln, now outside the State Veterans Home in Boise, is being moved to Steunenberg Park in front of the state Capitol building. The process begins October 16 - when the statue and its base are separated for cleaning, storage and transit. It will be completed in time for the statue to be rededicated next February 12 - the 200th anniversary of Lincoln's birth.
Governor Otter applauded the Idaho Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, chaired by David Leroy, Idaho's former attorney general and lieutenant governor. The commission worked with the Idaho Division of Veterans Services to arrange the move.
"With work progressing on our historic Capitol renovation, and with President Lincoln's key role in creating the Idaho Territory in 1863, it's fitting to place this great monument in such a visible and beautiful location," Governor Otter said. "It will be an excellent reminder for Idaho citizens and visitors alike of the impact that an individual can have on a nation and the lives of all its citizens."
The Idaho Historical Society will oversee the conservation and cleaning of the statue at its new spot. Additionally, Governor Otter commended Idaho schoolchildren for playing their part in raising money for costs associated with the move. Through a "Pennies for Lincoln" fund in classrooms statewide, Idaho students also will help with promoting the 2009 bicentennial celebration.
