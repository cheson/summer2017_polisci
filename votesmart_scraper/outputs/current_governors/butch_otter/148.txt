Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter released the following statement in response to his opponent's comments regarding the Hobby Lobby case ruling.
"It's clear where I stand when it comes to protecting Idaho's values, through fiscal responsibility, investing in our classrooms, creating opportunities for more and better jobs, improving Idaho's business climate, and fighting for our freedoms and against federal overreach. About all we know for sure about my opponent is that he supports same-sex marriage in Idaho -- against the wishes of Idaho voters -- that he agrees with Obamacare with all its mandates and is eager to lock up the Boulder-White Clouds in a national monument. If he disagrees in any meaningful way with Obama, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and the other D.C. Democrats -- including their support for the unconstitutional Obamacare contraceptive mandate -- he certainly isn't talking about it. The people of Idaho deserve to know where someone who wants to lead them stands. So far, my opponent is trying hard to dance between the raindrops, and all he's doing is getting wet."
