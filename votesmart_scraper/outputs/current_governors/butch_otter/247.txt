Governor Reacts to Supreme Court Ruling on Obamacare
Statement
By: Butch Otter
Date: June 28, 2012
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to the United States Supreme Court's 5-4 decision on Obamacare that was challenged by Idaho and 25 other states.
"Although five Supreme Court justices upheld Obamacare and the individual mandate under Congress's power to tax, it does not mean it's the right thing to do. Obamacare has been bad for America from the beginning. This is a sad day for self-determination and for individual liberty. Change is now in the hands of the American people and we must elect a new president and congressional candidates who will repeal Obamacare and protect our freedom to remain the architects of our own destiny."
