Taking A Larger View Of The Tax Issue

Property Tax Reform also offers opportunity to reform government.
There has been some clamor among editorial writers and political pundits lately over my "silence" on the issue of property tax reform. It's made me wonder just what those critics have been listening to for the past five years that's left them so puzzled.
Were they confused by my votes to provide income tax relief for millions of American families?
Were they flummoxed by my dozens of votes for tax relief and fairness for married couples, for adoptive and foster parents, for military personnel, veterans and seniors?
Were they paying attention to my votes for eliminating the death tax and enabling grieving families to keep the fruits of a lifetime's work and thrift?
Were they aware of my initiative to put some federal lands back on the property tax rolls when the government continues failing to pay its fair share toward the cost of local services?
The fact is, my position on property taxes is clear: I don't like the property tax any more than anyone else. It is generally unfair and particularly onerous to senior citizens and those on fixed incomes.
