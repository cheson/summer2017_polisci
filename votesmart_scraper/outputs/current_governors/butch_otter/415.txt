The Western Governors' Association wrapped up its winter meeting with plenary sessions focused on creating a path for new transmission and the West's overall energy future.
"The recession has slowed the growth in demand for electricity, but we cannot squander this opportunity to address future needs," said Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter (Idaho), WGA's Vice Chairman. "It is clear that coordination among states, the federal government, all segments of the industry and non-governmental organizations is essential for the region to meet its clean energy needs."
The governors have long maintained that the West can expand energy and transmission development while protecting lands, wildlife and natural resources. Gov. Brian Schweitzer (Mont.), WGA's Chairman, said it is imperative that federal agencies work with states to expedite construction of new transmission and make sure that renewable resources are being appropriately developed on federal lands.
"Western governors recognize that we do not have time to waste, and we are prepared to move ahead with needed transmission development," Schweitzer said. "We look forward to partnering with the federal government in making it happen."
Plenary sessions over the two-day meeting highlighted some of the most difficult issues that must be addressed in developing an energy portfolio that is clean, diverse, reliable and reasonably priced. They include:
