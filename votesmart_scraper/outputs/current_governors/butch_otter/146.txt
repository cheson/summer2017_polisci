Governor Otter Reinforces Need for Controlling Wolves
Statement

Nobody in Idaho or anywhere else has any doubts about where I stand on wolves. I fought to keep them out; I fought to limit their impact; and I fought successfully for Idaho's right to manage them. I am committed to asserting whatever control we can by having Idaho people manage the federally imposed challenges we can't avoid. Unfortunately, my Democrat opponent disagrees. He supported the wolves being brought to Idaho from Canada, and he thinks spending tax dollars to help control the damage they're doing to Idaho's big game and livestock is a waste of money. Once again, while I'm working for us and fighting to protect Idaho values, he's supporting environmental absolutists and rolling over to the Obama White House.
