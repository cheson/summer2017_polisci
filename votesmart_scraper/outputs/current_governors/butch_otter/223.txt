Christensen and his wife Katherine have three children.
"This isn't the first time Rich has been among the outstanding candidates forwarded to me by the Judicial Council. I respect and admire his perseverance and his commitment to serving the people of northern Idaho as a district judge," Governor Otter said. "Given this opportunity, I'm confident that Judge Christensen will be an outstanding jurist and a credit to the bench."
