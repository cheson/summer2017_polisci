GOVERNORS URGE USDA TO WAIT ON BRUCELLOSIS ELIMINATION ZONE
The Governors of Idaho and Wyoming expressed their concern to the U.S. Department of Agriculture on what they say is an "ill-conceived and hastily contrived" approach to eliminate brucellosis.
Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter of Idaho and Gov. Dave Freudenthal of Wyoming wrote to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack regarding the proposed National Brucellosis Elimination Zone (NBEZ), which they say would further impede the progress of disease eradication.
Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that causes pregnant cows and elk and wild bison to abort their fetuses. An aggressive eradication program has eliminated the disease in much of the United States. The only known reservoir of brucellosis infection left in the nation is in wild bison and elk in the Greater Yellowstone Area.
Governors Otter and Freudenthal say that the USDA' s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) proposal does not address the root problem of brucellosis transmission in the Greater Yellowstone Area - wildlife.
"NBEZ seems to simply fence' the wildlife and livestock together, with no real wildlife management being required within the National Parks and on the National Elk Refuge," they wrote. "While we have no interest in federal management of wildlife populations in our states, we are all too aware of the hands-off' management policies of the National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service."
"More concerning still is our perspective that the efforts of USDA-APHIS to address our states' collective and individual concerns, at least thus far, have seemed superficial and non-engaging," the Governors said. "To be blunt, the NBEZ process has been a top-down, formulaic federal effort."
