To restore balance between our private and public lives, we must take full advantage of our growing opportunities to become a true laboratory of the republic. We must more directly and substantially engage the private sector, individuals and organizations throughout Idaho to achieve our shared goals -- a safe, well-educated and engaged population prepared for the challenges of tomorrow.
As your governor, it's my hope that everyone in our great state will join me in embracing the responsibilities as well as the opportunities afforded by citizenship.
For me, that means committing every day to ensuring that your government becomes what it was meant to be -- the people's servant, not their master.
