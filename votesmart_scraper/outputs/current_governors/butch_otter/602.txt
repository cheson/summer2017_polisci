Congressman applauds Sensenbrenner-Simpson Bill to fix broken court.
WASHINGTON, D.C.- Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement on Thursday, October 20, 2005 in support of the Federal Judgeship and Administrative Efficiency Act of 2005, H.R. 4093, sponsored by House Judiciary Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and cosponsored by Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson.
"Moving Idaho into a new 12th Circuit will be a big step toward restoring the public's faith in our judiciary. The leadership of Chairman Sensenbrenner and Congressman Simpson is exactly what's needed to make this common-sense change a reality. They have my enthusiastic support in working for judicial efficiency and the kind of respect for the rule of law that can only come from a court that reflects our values."
