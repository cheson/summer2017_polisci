ARROWROCK PROJECT HYDROELECTRIC LICENSE EXTENSION BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4377, the Arrowrock Project Hydroelectric License Extension Bill, which extends the time in the hydroelectric license to begin construction of a 15-megawatt project by 3 years from the date of passage of this bill. The facility will be built at the existing Arrowrock Dam on the Boise River in Idaho and has been designated to minimize impacts there.
Over the past decade, this project has been delayed by a number of factors not necessarily within the control of the project developer, including delays related to the bull trout being declared threatened under the Endangered Species Act. We have now solved that problem and we have been assured that the project is ready to go once the license is extended.
This project has bipartisan support. It will further develop the hydroelectric facilities at existing dams, something we promoted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, so I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
