Public Statements
Otter For Idaho First General Election Campaign Ads To Hit The Airwaves
Press Release
By: Butch Otter
Date: Sept. 2, 2014
Location: Boise, ID

The first television and radio advertisements highlighting Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter's accomplishments in growing the state's economy and creating new job opportunities for Idahoans, will begin airing on Tuesday, Sept. 2.
Over the past seven years, Governor Otter has worked with the Idaho State Legislature to balance the budget and maintain a friendly business climate without increasing the tax burden on Idahoans. This year, the Governor also introduced the Tax Reimbursement Incentive, which encourages new and expanding businesses to add high-paying jobs throughout the state.
"During my two terms as Governor, I've made the difficult decisions that have launched our state out of the recession. That's something most states can't say. And while there is still work to be done, I'm confident we've laid a solid foundation and I'm the right leader to continue to guide our state forward for the next four years."
The Governor's Accelerate Idaho initiative was launched several months ago. It outlines specific strategies and tactics to grow the state's economy. The mission includes three main objectives: advancing individuals, elevating industry, and strengthening communities. We've included more on this initiative, as well as other links related to facts presented in the advertisements, below.
