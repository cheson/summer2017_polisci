GOVERNOR ESTABLISHES STATE POLICY ON REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued an executive order today establishing a policy on the role of state government in reducing greenhouse gases, and tasking Department of Environmental Quality Director Toni Hardesty with coordinating the effort.
"The Director of the Department of Environmental Quality shall take a leadership role to work with all state government departments and agencies and shall serve as the central point of contact for coordination and implementation of greenhouse gas reduction efforts and other associated activities," according to Executive Order No. 2007-05.
Further, "The Director of the Department of Environmental Quality shall develop a greenhouse gas emission inventory and provide recommendations to the Governor on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Idaho, recognizing Idaho's interest in continued growth, economic development and energy security."
Governor Otter issued the order because, as he wrote, "it is incumbent upon states to take a leadership role in developing responsive state-level policies and programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, develop alternative energy sources and use energy efficiently."
