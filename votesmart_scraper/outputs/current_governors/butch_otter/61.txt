Press Release

Date: June 4, 2015
Location: Boise, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter today announced the recipients of the 2015 Governor's Cup Scholarships to Idaho colleges and universities.
After a banner year for fundraising during the 40th anniversary of the Governor's Cup in 2014, 38 scholarships will be awarded this year, up from 23 last year.

Recipients were chosen from among more than 700 applicants by the Idaho Governor's Cup Scholarship Fund Inc.'s 16-member board of directors. Selections were made based on each applicant's commitment to public service, academic achievement and community involvement.
The award is $3,000 per year, renewable for up to four (4) years, or two to three years for professional-technical programs, contingent upon the availability of funds.
"If there are two things we can never get enough of -- but already have in abundance -- it's talented, committed young people and generous citizens eager to help them achieve their dreams," Governor Otter said. "The Governor's Cup Scholarship program is honored to have the support of great sponsors who care about Idaho's future and understand that it's in the hands of today's youth. I'm overjoyed to be able to reward these students with a hand up toward reaching their higher education goals. And I'm equally proud of the sponsors who make it all possible."
