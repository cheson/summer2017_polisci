Guests are invited into the Capitol after the Christmas tree is lighted. Music will continue and free books will be given to children in attendance, compliments of First Lady Lori Otter and Scholastic, Inc. Guests are encouraged to visit the Governor's Ceremonial Office and the Capitol Gift Shop, where Idaho's 2013 State Christmas ornament will be available -- created by "A Touch of Glass" in Idaho Falls -- along with other items crafted by Idaho artists.
