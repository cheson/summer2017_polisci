After a week of public testimony, Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Luna presented changes to Students Come First today, in the form of three pieces of revised legislation. All the changes are based on citizen feedback heard in the Senate Education Committee public hearings, and from legislators.
"I am both pleased and encouraged by the actions being taken in the Senate Education Committee," Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter said. "I believe we proposed meaningful legislation to the Legislature. The changes, based on input from the public and members of the Senate, have only enhanced the package."
"Over the past week, we have seen our legislative process in action as many Idahoans came to the Statehouse to discuss education reform. The public testimony we heard was not window dressing. We gathered several good ideas and have made changes based on this input," Superintendent Luna said.
The Students Come First plan is a comprehensive plan for improving Idaho's public education system by ensuring it is customer-driven and educates more students at a higher level with limited resources.
For the past two years, the State of Idaho has cut revenues at the State level but has done nothing to reduce costs at the local school district level. Under Students Come First, the State will take a different approach in order to put our public education system back on firm financial footing. It will not just reduce revenues at the State level, but also reduce the costs that our local districts must shoulder so we can stabilize the public schools budget and direct more money into the classroom, where it's needed most.
