Some Things Never Change

Some things never change: Shifting the burden of supporting government from homeowners to business is not tax relief - it's a tax shift, and the consumer ends up paying for it eventually, writes C.L. "Butch" Otter.
Some Things Never Change
In his May 3 editorial (reprinted May 8), Jim Fisher lived up to his reputation as an addicted apologist for big government and higher taxes.
Jim took issue with my property tax reform proposal, in the process restating his liberal belief that the laws of physics simply do not apply to taxes and the size of government.
Sir Isaac Newton figured out centuries ago that what goes up must come down. Jim and his ilk seem to believe taxes and the size of government can only go up - not unlike the price of newspaper advertising!
They assume tax relief can only come by shifting the burden from one group to another. The idea of reducing the overall tax burden by reining in government growth just doesn't compute.
To them, government and the rush toward total statism is the indispensable mechanism of what I consider legalized plunder, the instrument by which economic "fairness" is achieved through the benevolent redistribution of wealth.
Yes, Jim is consistent in his belief in more and bigger government. Anyone who disagrees is ignorant or evil. But ask yourself for a moment: What do families do when faced with more expenses than income?
Do they gather around the kitchen table and decide the parents or children must find more ways to increase their income? Do they impose a tax on their neighbor, who may be better off financially than they are, simply to be "fair?"
No. They figure out together what expenses they can reduce. Can they do without cable TV for a while, or have the cobbler fix that old pair of shoes? Can they buy the cheaper cuts of meat, fish or fowl? Can they carpool a little more? Can they drop their newspaper subscription?
But Jim lives in a zero-sum world. To him, tax relief for some almost certainly means others are getting the shaft. He has yet to grasp the economic truth that every penny of taxes shifted to businesses and employers winds up being paid by the consumers of those products and the employees who make them.
That's the way our system works: Costs of doing business, like fuel expenses and taxes, are passed along to the end users - us. Businesses that fail to pass those expenses along soon go broke and lay off their employees, who then no longer are taxpayers. But to Jim, at least it was "fair."
Regarding my proposal for property tax relief, Jim alleges that it would be at the expense of local governments. His basis for such an allegation is unclear, and his conclusion is mistaken.
Besides empowering taxpayers to petition their local taxing districts for an election on reducing their tax burden, rather than only being able to approve or reject an increase, I would see to it that state government stops imposing the same kind of unfunded mandates on local governments that we rightly complain about the federal government imposing on the state.
As for moving all remaining public school district maintenance and operations costs from local property taxes to the state general fund, Jim's myopia allows him only to see one way to absorb the expense - raise taxes.
I don't see it that way, which leads Jim to the conclusion that I must be wrong.
My model is Phil Batt, who as governor disproved Jim's theory that bigger is better - there were 600 fewer state employees when he left office than when he was sworn in. It can be done.
Meanwhile, state tax revenue for the current budget year is running about $100 million ahead of projections and what the Legislature appropriated.
In the past, that kind of money has inspired new government programs and more government spending. But without such profligate spending on making government bigger and more intrusive, it might be possible for public school maintenance and operations expenses to be assumed by the state - as the Idaho Constitution and the Idaho Supreme Court say they should - with no need for higher taxes.
I do not rule out the possibility of a broader-based method of meeting the legitimate and proper responsibilities of government to the people. Education certainly is among the first of those obligations.
But Jim and others who worship at the altar of more and bigger government must realize that not everyone agrees with them, and that leadership means more than agreeing with conventional wisdom and hidebound tradition. It means - at last - putting principle into practice.
As always - Idaho, "Esto Perpetua"
