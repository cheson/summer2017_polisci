Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter cited the importance of maintaining public confidence in the Idaho Core Standards process by keeping private student information secure as he signed the Student Data Accessibility, Transparency and Accountability Act into law.
"Technology affords us unprecedented ability to assess the progress of our students and better address their needs. We also face legitimate and understandable concerns about protecting that information from those who might misuse it. This law places Idaho among the nation's leaders in monitoring, securing and protecting that data from the federal government or any other entity," Governor Otter said after signing Senate Bill 1372 late Wednesday.
The legislation was adopted unanimously by both the Idaho House and Senate.
Under the legislation championed by Senate Education Committee Chairman John Goedde, the State Board of Education and State Department of Education will develop a detailed security plan and ensure it is carefully administered. An annual report must be submitted to the Governor and the Legislature on new data requirements, changes in federal reporting requirements, exceptions to the policies, and the results of regular security audits.
"Legislators across the country share concerns about the security and use of data collected on K-12 students. I believe that S1372 puts Idaho at the forefront of this effort," Senator Goedde said. "The bill and the collaborative process that led stakeholders to move it forward already are models to which other states are looking. Parents and students should rest easier with this legislation in place."
