WATER SUMMIT ESTABLISHES Â‘PATH FORWARD'
GOVERNOR LAUDS PARTICIPANTS FOR WILLINGNESS TO WORK THROUGH ISSUES
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter told an estimated 300 people attending the Idaho Water Summit on Tuesday that their united efforts would result in a healthier economic future for all of Idaho.
"Generations from now, I hope people will look to today and say that was the beginning of our healthy life," Governor Otter said at the conclusion of the daylong summit, featuring water users and other stakeholders from throughout the state. He said the principles that will be developed as a result of Tuesday's work would be a blueprint for water management statewide.
Governor Otter outlined a personal "action plan" offering a "path forward" toward greater certainty for Idaho's future. It includes:
1) Making management decisions regarding both surface and ground water using the state's existing model of the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer as the guide. The model is a scientifically designed diagram of the aquifer's size and characteristics, which Otter said must be accepted as the best available tool for making those decisions. However, he said the model will be subject to ongoing assessment and refinement.
2) Working with Idaho's congressional delegation to expand opportunities for farmers to participate in federal programs for setting aside acreage. The water they save is devoted to recharging the aquifer, which is the federally designated "sole source" of drinking water for about 250,000 Idahoans.
3) Working with the state Department of Environmental Quality to speed up the permitting process for recharge, without compromising it. The DEQ must issue recharge permits certifying the quality of water that users propose to restore to the aquifer, but Otter said Water Summit participants made the point that the process takes too long.
4) A broad understanding that "A healthy aquifer should be the sum and substance of all our efforts. The health of that aquifer is the health of Idaho's economy."
Governor Otter said he expected summit participants to continue focused discussions toward resolving immediate water issues. He also did not rule out the possibility of reconvening the summit to reinforce broader aquifer health goals.
"It may be important to come back once again and refresh ourselves on our single focus," he said.
David Tuthill, who had been serving as interim director of the Idaho Department of Water Resources since January, was named director by Governor Otter earlier Tuesday.
Tuthill said the governor's leadership in water management discussions held the potential for helping to finally resolve decades-old disputes, including conflicts between senior and junior water rights holders. He said that impact was evidenced by the level of participation in Tuesday's summit.
"While we don't have a solution for everything," he said, "I would say we have a way to proceed on these issues."
