Idaho's Welcome Mat is Out for Washington Businesses
By Clement Otter
Published by The Seattle Times on April 9, 2010
AS I was considering how to respond to a March 21 Seattle Times column by Washington State Department of Commerce Director Rogers Weed, I found an OregonPolitico.com piece that summed it up.
Lewis Barnes, president of Summit Manufacturing in Hillsboro, Ore., was quoted talking about receiving a copy of my "Love Letter" to Oregon and Washington employers unhappy about hundreds of millions of dollars in tax increases heading their way.
"The state of Oregon continues to demonstrate that small businesses are here to simply be a source of funding for its out-of-control spending habits," Barnes said. "They don't realize, as Idaho does, that the very fabric that makes for a vibrant and stable economy is in fact small business."
The same goes for Washington, which has four times Idaho's population but even before this year's apparently inevitable tax increase had more than five times the government spending per year -- plus America's highest minimum wage at $8.55 an hour. Idaho's is $7.25.
Business owners understand that having a state government working with you, rather than against you, makes all the difference. Just ask Areva, the French company that was looking for somewhere to build a multibillion-dollar uranium-enrichment plant in 2008. Idaho and Washington were in the running, and competition was fierce for the 700 construction jobs and 250 permanent career opportunities -- not to mention many expected spinoff and support businesses.
