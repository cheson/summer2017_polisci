House Votes To Tighten America's Borders 12/17/2005
OTTER AND SIMPSON SUPPORT EFFORT TO ELIMINATE ILLEGAL CROSSINGS
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Idaho Congressmen C.L. "Butch" Otter and Mike Simpson joined the 239-182 House majority late Friday in approving a bill requiring concrete steps to regain control of America's porous borders, which threaten our economy and security.
The Border Protection, Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005, H.R. 4437, is aimed at preventing illegal immigration by holding people accountable and reestablishing respect for our laws. Its focus is on eliminating the primary incentive for illegal immigration - jobs for undocumented workers - while cracking down on smugglers trafficking in human beings, and confronting the emerging problem of alien gangs.
"Border security is the threshold issue in immigration reform. Until our borders are secure, it does little good to debate how to deal with those who already are shoplifting citizenship," Congressman Otter said. "Only when we're effectively regulating our borders can we begin dealing with the economic and social costs that illegal immigration is imposing on our communities and people. Only when we start taking our own laws seriously will others understand that along with the opportunity it offers, living in America means being accountable."
"Today's aggressive House action to stem the tide of illegal immigration is long overdue," Congressman Simpson said. "The untold billions that we've spent beefing up our homeland security are wasted if we can't secure our nation's border and keep would-be terrorists out. I'm especially pleased with the House vote to construct a robust fence along our border with Mexico and study the use of physical barriers on our border with Canada."
