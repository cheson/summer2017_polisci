By: Butch Otter
Date: Jan. 11, 2010
Location: Boise, ID

Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Honorable Justices, my fellow constitutional officers, legislators, members of my Cabinet, Senator Risch, honored guests, friends, my family and our First Lady  my fellow Idahoans.
Welcome back to the People's House!
It's been three years since a State of the State address was delivered in this historic building -- this great monument to freedom and self‐determination.
Please join me in showing our thanks to the skilled men and women who restored our Capitol beyond its original glory, and in doing so reflected our best hopes for an even brighter future.
And they did it on time and on budget!
Now let me extend my congratulations to two outstanding football teams that have made all of us in Idaho proud.
Whether you're a Bronco or a Vandal, you have a lot to celebrate right now!
I also appreciate them giving me bragging rights as one of only three Governors in America with a 100‐percent winning percentage in this season's bowl games!
Let's hear it now for the University of Idaho Vandals and head coach Robb Akey, and for the Boise State University Broncos and head coach Chris Petersen for giving us all so much to cheer about!
