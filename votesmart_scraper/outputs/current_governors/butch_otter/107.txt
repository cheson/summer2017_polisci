In today's #TopicTuesday, Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter compares balancing the state budget to balancing a family budget at home -- defining between items that are necessities and nice to have. The Governor says it was important to balance the budget without raising taxes because like the state, families had to tighten their belts over the past few years.
"Too many times the government knows the cost of everything and the value of very little, so we disciplined ourselves to say that we are going to value those things that are necessary and that are guided by the law and the constitution and that's what we are going to stay with. Had we raised taxes, I don't think we would have seen the robust recovery that we are leading the nation in."
