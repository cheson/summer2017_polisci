Otter Backs Affordable Health Care Bill 7/26/2005
CONGRESSMAN SUPPORTS MEASURE OFFERING COVERAGE FOR UNINSURED FAMILIES
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter helped the House pass legislation on Tuesday to expand access to health-care coverage for many of the 45 million Americans who are uninsured.
Congressman Otter voted with the 263-165 majority for the Small Business Health Fairness Act, H.R. 525. The measure, which now goes to the Senate, would allow small businesses upon which more than 60 percent of uninsured Americans work or depend to join together through association health plans to help cut the high cost of health insurance.
Association health plans (AHPs) enable small businesses to pool their resources and increase their bargaining power with benefit providers, which will allow them to negotiate better rates and purchase quality health care at a lower cost.
A broad and diverse coalition of more than 180 groups has endorsed the bipartisan Small Business Health Fairness Act. They include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, the American Farm Bureau Federation and the Associated Builders and Contractors.
"The AHPs allowed by this bill are among the best ways of using market forces to give people more options for health-care coverage," Congressman Otter said. "Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, especially in the small rural communities that are home to so many of the people I represent. This is a way for those businesses and the folks who rely on them to benefit from the same economies of scale that big corporations and unions use to keep insurance affordable. "
