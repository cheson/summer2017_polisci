Simpson And Otter Support Transportation Bill 7/29/2005

Final passage in House brings numerous projects, more efficiency to Idaho
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Idaho Congressmen Mike Simpson and C.L. "Butch" Otter today supported House passage of the conference report to H.R. 3 - The Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users. The Senate also approved the conference report today and forwarded it to the President Bush for his signature.
H.R. 3 provides $286.5 billion in federal highway, transit and road safety funding nationwide through 2009, including an average allocation of approximately $276.7 million per year for Idaho. The legislation also seeks to correct problems of congestion, unsafe highways and an inefficient, cumbersome process for moving projects to completion, all while providing for creation of millions of new jobs in the transportation sector and related industries.
"A safe, efficient, and modern transportation system is essential to the economic stability of our state," said Congressman Simpson. "The passage of this legislation is great news for anyone in Idaho who wants to operate a business, grow a farm or ranch, or take their family on vacation. I'm thrilled that within a fiscally responsible budget the Idaho congressional delegation was able to deliver a number of vitally important projects for our state."
"Besides the clear financial benefits for Idaho in this legislation, my focus has been on crafting a more reasonable and efficient highway bill that ensures those benefits won't be tied up for years in hand-wringing bureaucracy and legal wrangling," Congressman Otter said. "The streamlining provisions in this conference report will empower states to play a bigger role in moving transportation projects from planning to creation of more jobs and safer highways. That's a welcome change."
