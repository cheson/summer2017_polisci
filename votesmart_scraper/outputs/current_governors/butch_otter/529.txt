GOVERNOR DETAILS RELOCATION ADDRESSES FOR STATEHOUSE OFFICES
Seeking to maintain open public access to state government, Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter had a link posted to his Web site today containing a listing of the new addresses and scheduled relocation dates for offices that have been housed in the Idaho Statehouse.
Renovation has started on the lower levels of the Capitol, and all offices are scheduled to be vacated for the project by May 20th. The entire Capitol will be closed to the public effective May 22nd for the duration of the renovation work.
This link will take you to a list of the new sites and dates of relocation for all offices that have been in the Statehouse, including the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Attorney General, Division of Financial Management, and the Idaho House, Idaho Senate and Legislative Service Office: http://gov.idaho.gov/RelocationDirectory.pdf
"We hope you'll bear with us during the upheaval. Our goal is to keep delivering the timely, customer-oriented service that the people of Idaho deserve from their state government," Governor Otter said. "I know my fellow constitutional officers join me in inviting you to visit our temporary offices during the renovation and stay connected with your elected representatives."
