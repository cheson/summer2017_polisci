Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today in reaction to Thursday night's Apache helicopter crash that took the lives of two Idaho Army National Guard pilots south of Boise.
"The First Lady and I mourn the loss of these Idaho Army National Guard pilots. Their loved ones and brothers and sisters in arms are in our thoughts and prayers. This tragedy reminds us of the enormous sacrifice and great risk involved in military service -- whether here at home preparing to go into harm's way or on the battle lines of freedom. I ask all Idahoans to join me in honoring these courageous citizen soldiers along with all those who have gone before them in defense of the liberties we hold so dear."
