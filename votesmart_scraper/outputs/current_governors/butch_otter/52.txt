"Arco just this month celebrated "Atomic Days' which commemorates its place in history as the first city in the world to be powered by nuclear energy back in July of 1955," said Governor Otter. "I want to salute that accomplishment while we continue to move Idaho towards a promising future in continued nuclear research and development."
The event on July 28 will be the governor's 83rd Capital for a Day and is scheduled from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the BIC Center, conference room, located at 159 S. Idaho Street in downtown Arco. This will be Arco's second Capital for a Day having played host to one back in 2008.
State officials joining Governor Otter at Capital for a Day will include Lt. Governor Brad Little, Idaho Department of Parks Director David Langhorst, Idaho Department of Water Resources Director, Gary Spackman, Idaho Office of Energy Resources Director, John Chatburn and Idaho Department of Environmental Quality Director, John Tippets.
