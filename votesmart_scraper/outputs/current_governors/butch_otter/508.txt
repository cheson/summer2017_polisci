Trade Mission Brings Mission Sales, Opportunities
Idaho Delegation Sells Hay and Pork; More to Come
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter's recently concluded 10-day trade mission to four cities in China resulted in immediate sales of compressed hay from eastern Idaho and pork from the Magic Valley. But the Governor said the contacts made and relationships developed with potential Chinese customers for Idaho goods and services were the most valuable outcome of the trip.

"China already is the number-one international destination for Idaho products. But relative to the potential that's there, we have barely scratched the surface," Governor Otter said. "From Idaho providers of export services to farm machinery sales and establishment of strategic business partnerships, China offers great opportunities for profit, job creation and more economy diversity."

Larsen Farms Hay Terminal of Dubois signed a contract with a Chinese purchaser for 500 tons a month of compressed alfalfa hay. That amounts to more than $1.5 million in annual sales. Independent Meat of Twin Falls also received several orders totaling six containers of pork products valued at more than $300,000.

In addition, all the representatives of businesses that joined the Governor and First Lady on the trade mission to Beijing, Harbin, Shanghai and Shenzhen reported making excellent contacts with the potential for future sales, promotional opportunities or partnerships.
"We were able to establish some very good relationships during the trip. We believe China will be a very important long-term sales opportunity and being part of the Governor's trade mission helped establish very important contacts," said Rick Stott, vice president of AB Foods, a Boise-based meat supplier. "Although we did not Â‘ink' any sales, we certainly established the basis for future opportunities."

"China produces and consumes more potatoes than any other country in the world. It represents a huge opportunity for Idaho potato products in all forms," said Frank Muir, president and chief executive officer of the Idaho Potato Commission. "This trade mission not only helped address current barriers to gain access for fresh Idaho potatoes but also helped set the stage for expanded sales of Idaho frozen and dehydrated products."

"We believe that the market through Russia and China could more than triple our business sales if we can find a way to produce commensurate with demand," said Brek Pilling, president of Kodiak Northwest, which manufactures heavy duty snow blowers and attachments in Paul. "We think the trade mission helped us in that regard."

Idaho exports to China totaled $731.4 million in 2006. So far in 2007, Idaho exports to China total $712 million - a 32.4-percent increase over the same period last year. Semiconductors comprise the largest share of exports to China, but shipments of industrial equipment, farm machinery and food processing equipment, paper products and agricultural products such as frozen potatoes, frozen pork, wheat and alfalfa also are increasing.

The Idaho delegation's visit to Harbin marked Idaho's first official visit to Heilongjiang Province in northern China. Governor Otter met there with top officials including the governor, vice governor and provincial party secretary.
