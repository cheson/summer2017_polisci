GOVERNOR COMMENTS ON MICRON ANNOUNCEMENT
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement today regarding Boise-based Micron Technology's announcement that it is cutting 15 percent of its global workforce:
"Our thoughts and our best efforts are with those individuals and families who will be experiencing this difficult period firsthand. I met with Steve Appleton and assured him that state agencies stand ready to assist with job placement services and other help. I asked Department of Labor Director Roger Madsen to increase staffing at all area Job Service offices to operate during extended hours and on Saturdays. I also asked Department of Commerce Director Don Dietrich to identify businesses with the potential for adding on some of these highly qualified workers. And state economist Mike Ferguson and Budget Director Wayne Hammon are tracking the potential impact of this news on our economy and state revenue. The global marketplace is driving this situation. But Micron will remain one of Idaho's largest employers and is positioning itself for better times ahead. Meanwhile, this highlights the importance of state government doing all we can to diversify and expand our economic base - being frugal and acting prudently while preparing the infrastructure and our workforce for job growth and new opportunities."
