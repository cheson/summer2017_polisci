Press Release
By: Butch Otter

Location: Idaho Falls, ID

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter and his Democrat opponent faced off today in eastern Idaho at the City Club of Idaho Falls debate.
Governor Otter's knowledge of Idaho values, his proven track record moving the state forward and his fiscally conservative plans for the future set him apart from his opponent in their second gubernatorial debate.
The Governor highlighted his top priorities, including improving education, protecting the state from federal overreach and continuing his efforts to make Idaho the best place in America to do business and raise a family.
"One of my top priorities when I became Governor was to make sure we are taking full advantage of all our assets as a state by leveraging them to build a brighter future. High among those assets is the Idaho National Laboratory. And that commitment is making a big difference," Governor Otter said. "I've helped establish a long-term vision for the INL that includes building on its value for broader economic benefit."
The Governor's next debate is set for October 14th in Nampa, Idaho and will be hosted by KTVB Idaho's Newschannel 7.
