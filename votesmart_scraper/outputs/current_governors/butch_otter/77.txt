Statement

Date: Feb. 26, 2015
Location: Boise

Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter has signed Executive Order 2015-01, establishing an Idaho Military Advocacy Commission (IMAC) to support the missions, the people and the communities where our armed forces perform their duties in Idaho.
The IMAC, officially formed late Tuesday, will advocate for the military assets at Mountain Home Air Force Base and Boise's Gowen Field as the bases respond to changing military needs and Pentagon priorities. It also will support and facilitate the growth of U.S. Department of Defense platforms in Idaho as well as encourage collaboration between the state, cities, counties, federal government, and other advocacy organizations on public awareness and the functionality of military installations in Idaho.
"Idaho has always proudly supported its military. The men and women who serve at Mountain Home and Gowen have long helped our state grow economically as well as maintaining a strong defense for our nation and Idaho," Governor Otter said. "But the world is changing fast, and government leaders must work more closely with our communities and the military to strengthen the ability of these installations to meet those challenges."
The IMAC will consist of members appointed by the Governor from the Office of the Governor, the offices of Idaho's members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, the Office of the Lieutenant Governor, members of the Idaho Senate and Idaho House of Representatives, the Idaho National Guard, and members of the public.
