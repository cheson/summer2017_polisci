Otter Backs Health Incentive Proposal 3/15/2006
CONGRESSMAN COSPONSORS BILL PROMOTING MARKET-BASED OBESITY SOLUTION
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter is cosponsoring legislation in the House of Representatives to offer a preventive, free-market response to obesity-related illnesses through tax incentives for healthier lifestyle choices.
The Workforce Health Improvement Program (WHIP) Act, H.R. 1634, would allow all employers to provide a fitness center subsidy to their employees - such as partial payment of a gym membership - without counting it as part of employees' taxable income. Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is cosponsoring a companion Senate bill, S. 772.
Current law requires employees to pay fringe benefit income tax on any subsidy an employer provides to help them join a fitness center, unless that fitness center is located at the employer's worksite. That's fine for large companies, but it is a disadvantage for most small- and medium-sized businesses that employ the vast majority of Americans.
"An alarming number of Americans today struggle with obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other ailments related to being overweight. I believe we can best address this problem by creating incentives for Americans to make choices that benefit their health and reduce health-care costs," Congressman Otter said.
"Rolling back or even preventing these debilitating illnesses earlier in life rather than blaming others for our lifestyle decisions later on will save taxpayer dollars, and lives. It will help today's young people develop a greater sense of personal responsibility that will pay dividends for their own children tomorrow, and for generations to come."
