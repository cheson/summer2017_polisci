Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement in reaction to today's U.S. Supreme Court ruling on legal challenges to the Idaho Constitution's definition of marriage.
"The Supreme Court's order lifting Justice Kennedy's stay effectively allows same-sex marriage in Idaho as soon as the 9th Circuit directs compliance with its decision. I disagree with the court's conclusion, which negates the 2006 vote of the people of Idaho, is contrary to the values of most Idahoans, and undermines fundamental states' rights. But we are a nation of laws. Idaho now should proceed with civility and in an orderly manner to comply with any forthcoming order from the 9th Circuit."
