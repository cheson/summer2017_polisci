Statement on June Unemployment Numbers
Statement

Today Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter issued the following statement regarding the announcement the unemployment rate fell by another two tenths of a point to 4.7% percent in the month of June.
"There's no doubt that Idaho is on the move. Our economy is growing and producing more and better jobs. Our unemployment rate is steadily declining and the number of Idahoans on the job is at an all-time high. And the recovery isn't concentrated in a few fortunate pockets - 24 of Idaho's 44 counties have unemployment rates below the statewide figure. But like you, I'm not satisfied with our progress. We still have some important work to do toward achieving our goals for a more prosperous Idaho. Too many of our citizens remain 'underemployed' in lower-paying jobs than they need. Our focus now is on continuing to make Idaho the best place to start, grow or move a business. That means keeping taxes low, keeping regulations reasonable, and improving our education system and workforce training opportunities so that more people have the skills they need to succeed in an increasingly competitive economy. The confidence that employers are showing in Idaho is encouraging. They've added 34,000 jobs just since January! Building on that success by sustainably investing in a brighter future is Job One for me. I'm gratified that Idaho is moving in the right direction."
