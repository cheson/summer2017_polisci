Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter announced today that Kristine Sasser, a veteran legal counsel for the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (PUC), will succeed retiring Commissioner Marsha Smith on the three-member commission effective Thursday.
Smith is retiring today after serving on the PUC since being appointed by then-Governor Cecil Andrus in 1991. Like Sasser, Smith is a Democrat who previously served the commission as a deputy attorney general. Sasser will serve a six-year term as commissioner.
"Over the past seven years, Kristine has distinguished herself as someone who is thorough, professional, collegial and devoted to fulfilling the vital role of an ombudsman for ratepayers and regulator for our public utilities," Governor Otter said. "The electricity, natural gas and other services enjoyed by Idaho citizens are in good hands with Kristine's knowledge, skills and temperament ensuring that our system works."
The Governor praised Smith for the legacy of exemplary service she created at the PUC. Pending Idaho Senate confirmation, Sasser will join Commission President Paul Kjellander and Mack Redford on the quasi-judicial panel.
