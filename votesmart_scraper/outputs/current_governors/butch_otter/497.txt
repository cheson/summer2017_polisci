GOVERNOR ENDORSES REVISED ISTARS PLAN
OTTER GIVES HIS SUPPORT TO PERFORMANCE-BASED PAY INCREASE PROPOSAL
Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter today endorsed State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Luna's revised plan for financially rewarding Idaho's best public school employees.
The Idaho State Teacher Advancement and Recognition System (ISTARS) is being considered in the Idaho Senate. Governor Otter wants legislators to clearly understand that he supports investing $33 million in higher public school salaries during the fiscal year that begins July 1.
"Superintendent Luna's plan meets my requirements that any pay increase for public schools maximize our limited resources and be based on performance," the Governor said. "It's time to move forward with a responsible, achievable plan for rewarding Idaho's best teachers. The discussion has been productive. Now I hope JFAC will include Superintendent Luna's figures as it writes the budget for fiscal 2009."
