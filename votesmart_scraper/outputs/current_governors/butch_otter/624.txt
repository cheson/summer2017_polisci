USA PATRIOT ACT -- HON. C.L. ``BUTCH'' OTTER (Extensions of Remarks - June 22, 2005)
HON. C.L. ``BUTCH'' OTTER OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 22, 2005
* Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, please allow me to express my great respect and support for the manner in which Chairman SENSENBRENNER managed the recent hearings of the House Committee on the Judiciary regarding the USA PATRIOT Act. His resolve in following the rules while providing as much flexibility as possible in the face of often partisan and inflammatory rhetoric was a credit to his leadership, and was precisely what was needed in this deliberative process.
* There are legitimate criticisms to be made of the PATRIOT Act, and I have been among those maintaining that ensuring a greater balance of judicial oversight and adherence to the spirit as well as the letter of our constitutional protections would enhance its usefulness. However, associating the PATRIOT Act with what may occur in a prisoner of war camp or other well intentioned but illegal or inhumane action--as some members and witnesses have done--is a disservice to the process and to those who wish to keep the debate focused on improving the law, not destroying it.
* As the House continues deliberating reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, it is my goal to restore balance to the branches of our Federal government, secure the people in their homes and personal affects, and renew the promise of our Founders. That will not be accomplished by blaming the law for the real or alleged behavior of individual acting outside this or any other law. I will not stand idly by while some who wish not to rein in but rather to eviscerate the PATRIOT Act, or to use it as a political cudgel, use some of the very tactics we have professed to fear in the law itself in order to bring public ridicule and professional discredit to either Chairman SENSENBRENNER or the Judiciary Committee.
* In closing, Mr. Speaker, I wish to remind us all of the words of George Washington, uttered as a promise of the faith he had in our political system, this great Republic and those who govern:
* If, to please the people, we offer what we ourselves disprove, how can we afterwards defend our work? Let us raise a standard to which the wise and the honest can repair. The event is in the hand of God.
