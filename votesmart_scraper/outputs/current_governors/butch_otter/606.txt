Bill Uses Market Forces to Help Reduce Prices, Cracks Down on Price Gouging.
WASHINGTON, D.C.- Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter helped the House pass legislation on Friday providing market-based responses to conditions driving gasoline prices to unprecedented levels.
The Gasoline for America's Security (GAS) Act of 2005, H.R. 3893, also offers the first-ever federal ban on gas price gouging so American consumers can be confident they are paying the lowest possible price at the pump.
Congressman Otter, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the GAS Act will help employ market forces to lower mid- to long-term gas prices while addressing important national security concerns.
"This bill's provisions increasing refinery capacity, streamlining fuel supplies, making the process of pricing gasoline more transparent, fighting price gouging and reducing bureaucracy all will contribute to a better deal at the pump without imposing government price controls," Congressman Otter said. "Along with the broader national energy policy that we passed in July, this represents a strong commitment to modernizing our domestic infrastructure and reducing our dependence on foreign energy."
