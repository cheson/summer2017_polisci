Otter, Luna Endorse School Choices
GOP CANDIDATES WELCOME AGREEMENT ON GOALS FOR IDAHO CHILDREN
BOISE, Idaho - The Republican candidates for governor and state superintendent of public instruction agreed to the principles in their Democrat opponents' "Contract for Kids," but called for new solutions that provide real educational choice for Idaho children - something missing from the Democrat contract.
Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter, the GOP candidate for governor, and Tom Luna, the Republican nominee for state schools superintendent, said they would sign an agreement to the seven basic principles in the Contract for Kids, which are consistent with positions both Otter and Luna have long promoted.
"In addition, we all agree with returning control to parents, promoting character development and sustainable funding for public schools, but that does not mean approving of the same old Democrat Â‘solutions' for reaching those goals that got us where we are today," Otter and Luna said in a joint statement. "Parents deserve better. Our dedicated teachers deserve better. Our children deserve better. They deserve choice, and the Democrats don't offer it."
"Giving parents a real voice in their children's education, through expanded development of charter schools and promoting other options, will create the kind of competition that enables parents to choose excellence," Otter and Luna said. "We should be advocating for change and providing real incentives for our students - and teachers - to excel."
Otter and Luna said they would support the Contract for Kids, but not Proposition 1. They urged the Democrats to instead join them in signing a contract embracing more school choice and a commitment to ensuring that hard work, accountability and innovation by students and teachers alike will be rewarded in Idaho classrooms.
