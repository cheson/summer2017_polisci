Gov. Terry E. Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds today announced the Home Base Iowa Certified Higher Academic Military Partner (CHAMP) program. The program allows Iowa colleges and universities to become CHAMP certified for their ability to educate and assist veterans on campus. The certification will help attract veterans leaving the service to Iowa and help academic institutions market their campus as veteran friendly.
"With 495 veterans hired through Home Base Iowa thus far, it's clear our veterans' jobs initiative is a growing success," said Branstad. "Today's announcement of the Home Base Iowa Certified Higher Academic Military Partner program is another step toward ensuring service members transitioning to civilian life have the educational resources they need here in Iowa."
The Home Base Iowa Act was signed into law on May 26, 2014. It passed the Iowa Senate 46-0 and the Iowa House 94-2.
"Governor Branstad and I are pleased to see the continued broad bipartisan support Home Base Iowa continues to receive across the state," said Reynolds. "With nearly two-thirds of Iowa currently in the process of becoming Home Base Iowa Communities, it's clear Iowans are embracing this initiative to match veterans with quality careers."
