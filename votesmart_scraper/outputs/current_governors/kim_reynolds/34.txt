Gov. Terry Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds today released the following statements applauding the Iowa Board of Regents' action, which is the first step toward freezing tuition at Regent universities for the third-straight year.
"We're pleased the Iowa Board of Regents continues working with us to give Iowa students access to affordable, high-quality education in Iowa. We look forward to working with the Board of Regents on our initiative to provide Iowa students a variety of fixed-priced four-year degrees. Upon receiving the Revenue Estimating Conference's December report, we will begin crafting the state budget with hopes to continue the tuition freeze." -- Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad
"I commend the Iowa Board of Regents for their ongoing commitment to affordable higher education. Governor Branstad and I believe that Iowa can take another step by implementing four-year degrees for $10,000 and a tax credit initiative to align charitable giving with student debt reduction." -- Iowa Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds
