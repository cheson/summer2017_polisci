Press Release
By: Terry Branstad Kim Reynolds
Date: Sept. 20, 2013
Location: Des Moines, IA

Gov. Terry Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds today unveiled their new "Connect Every Iowan" initiative to increase the access, adoption, and use of broadband technology.
The governor and lt. governor have asked the existing STEM Advisory Council's Broadband Committee to develop legislative recommendations to encourage broadband build-out throughout Iowa, particularly in unserved or underserved areas. The committee's first meeting will be Sept. 10, from 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., and its recommendations are expected to be delivered by December 1, 2013.
The committee has also been asked to develop a long-term strategic plan for broadband by January 1, 2015, and to identify and pursue any possible federal funding opportunities or public private partnerships.
"We want to make Iowa the most connected state in the Midwest," said Branstad.
Currently Iowa ranks 11th out of 12 Midwestern states on the TechNet State Broadband Index, behind neighboring states such as Nebraska, Minnesota, Missouri and Illinois. The index is compiled from three measures: The household adoption rate of broadband, network speeds of available broadband infrastructure, and the amount of jobs in information and communication technology industries that benefit from broadband technology.
"I'm confident Iowans all across the state will benefit from the initiative -- most importantly, more broadband access means more jobs for Iowans," said Branstad.
