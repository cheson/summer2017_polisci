Location: Des Moines, IA

Gov. Kim Reynolds and Lt. Gov. Adam Gregg will continue their Building a Better Iowa tour Wednesday and Thursday with visits to Iowa energy innovators. Developing the most innovative energy policy in the country is one of the Reynolds-Gregg administration's four priorities. The stops are part of their 99 County Tour.
"Last December, we released an energy plan that sets Iowa on the path to be one of the most innovative states in the nation when it comes to creating an affordable, reliable and stable energy policy," Gov. Reynolds said. "We're already a national leader in wind energy, biodiesel and ethanol production. I want us to expand that leadership and to look for innovative and efficient ways to use Iowa's rich resources to fuel our vehicles, homes and businesses. Today and tomorrow, we're going to visit Iowa businesses and institutions that are helping to meet those goals and to build a better Iowa."
"We all know that Iowa is a leader in renewable fuels," Lt. Gov. Gregg added. "But many people don't know that under Governor Reynolds's leadership, Iowa's energy policy is also driving innovation, fostering research and development and creating career opportunities that bring good paying jobs to Iowans across the state. I look forward to visiting Iowa's 99 counties to see that success first hand."
