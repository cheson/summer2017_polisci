The Office of Governor Terry E. Branstad today announced that United States Senator-elect Joni Ernst has submitted her formal resignation from the Iowa State Senate. Ernst, who was elected to the United States Senate on November 4, 2014, delivered the letter of resignation on Friday, November 28, 2014. Her resignation was effective immediately on Friday, November 28, 2014.
"United States Senator-elect Joni Ernst has served her state and country as a soldier in the Iowa National Guard, local elected official and as a State Senator," said Branstad. "Though I'm disappointed to lose Senator-elect Ernst's leadership in the Iowa Legislature, I know she will be a strong voice of Iowa common sense in Washington, D.C."
Branstad has ordered a special election for Iowa State Senate District 12 to be held on Tuesday, December 30, 2014. Senate District 12 includes Fremont, Mills, Montgomery, Page, Ringgold and Taylor counties.
"As a State Senator, Joni helped Governor Branstad and I reduce burdensome government regulations, lower taxes, balance the budget, pass transformational education reform and, fight the Federal Government's attempt to gut the Renewable Fuel Standard," said Iowa Lt. Governor Kim Reynolds, who recruited Ernst to run for Montgomery County Treasurer and Iowa State Senate. "I'm confident Joni will take our Iowa values to the United States Senate."
Iowa Code 69.14 outlines the authority given to the governor to set a special election.
