Today, Gov. Terry E. Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds released the following statements in regards to the dismissal of the Des Moines Water Works lawsuit:
Gov. Branstad:
"I'm pleased to see an end to this costly litigation brought about by the Des Moines Water Works. From the very beginning, we've attempted to work in a collaborative way with our partners in the field and our communities to improve water quality in Iowa. That's the Iowa way. Now, we can finally put this distraction behind us and focus on the full implementation of the nutrient reduction strategy."
Lt. Gov. Reynolds:
"The dismissal of this lawsuit is very welcome news for our farmers, small businesses and communities across Iowa. We've believed all along that this lawsuit was not only the wrong approach, but would hinder the positive progress we've made by working collaboratively in addressing water quality through the nutrient reduction strategy. We look forward to continuing our conversation with the Legislature in the weeks ahead to finalize a plan that will continue to grow our water quality efforts."
