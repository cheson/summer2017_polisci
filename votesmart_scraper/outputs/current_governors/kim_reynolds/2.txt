Gov. Kim Reynolds highlighted an Iowa Healthiest State Initiative program at her weekly press conference on Tuesday that expands Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) shoppers' access to fresh foods.
"The Double Up Food Bucks program puts healthy food grown by Iowa famers on the plates of vulnerable Iowa families," Gov. Reynolds said. "Everyone wins when we increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables. We grow healthier communities while strengthening local economies."
The Iowa Healthiest State Initiative launched Double Up Food Bucks as a pilot produce incentive program in 2016. Iowa is a national agricultural leader, but according to the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index, it ranks last in fruit and vegetable consumption.
Double Up Food Bucks aims to serve nearly 5,000 vulnerable Iowa families by matching SNAP benefits at participating farmers' markets (up to $10 per day). The doubled dollars can be used to buy more locally grown fruits and vegetables.
The program will also benefit more than 300 Iowa farmers. The program expects $100,000 in fresh produce sales at Iowa farmers' markets, keeping more food dollars in the local economy. This year, there are 13 sites in eight counties.
