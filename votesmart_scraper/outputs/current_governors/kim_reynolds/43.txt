Gov. Terry Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds today announced the launch of "Zero Fatalities," Iowa's plan to keep every man, woman, and child safe on Iowa's roadways.
Iowa's Zero Fatalities program is a multiagency effort currently supported by the Iowa departments of Transportation, Health, and Public Safety through the Governor's Traffic Safety Bureau. The leaders of each agency were on hand today to help kick off the program.
"Last year 317 men, women, and children died on Iowa's highways. While that is a decrease from years past, we know with simple improvements, we can do much better and prevent traffic deaths," said Branstad. "If each of us adopts a zero fatalities goal for our families, we can make zero a reality statewide. To achieve this, we all must give full attention to the task of driving when we are behind the wheel."
The program highlights five dangerous driving behaviors and encourages Iowans to:
Slow down.
Drive sober.
Focus on the road.
Stay alert.
Buckle up. Every seat, every time.
