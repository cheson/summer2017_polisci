Gov. Terry Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds today issued a statement following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) decision on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The Agency will not finalize a rule in 2014 and will delay the ruling until 2015 "prior to or in conjunction with action on the 2015 standards rule."
"We're pleased the Environmental Protection Agency and the Obama Administration halted their ill-advised proposed rule for the time being, but unfortunately, this decision only creates more uncertainty," said Branstad. "Across the nation, renewable fuels have helped spark economic development, create jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and increase consumer choice. While we would have liked to see the Environmental Protection Agency commit to a robust Renewable Fuel Standard for the long-term, we received a clear signal through this process that America supports renewable fuels and our state's work to produce high-quality biofuels."
"Though we were hoping for the certainty of a robust Renewable Fuel Standard, we're pleased the Environmental Protection Agency backed away from their initial proposal," said Reynolds. "We'll continue fighting for Iowa farmers and consumers who value a choice at the pump and Americans who seek energy independence through safe, reliable and renewable energy."
Branstad and Reynolds have led the effort in Iowa to stop the EPA's proposed rule on the RFS.
