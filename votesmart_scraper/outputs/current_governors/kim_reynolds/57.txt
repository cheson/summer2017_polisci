Lt. Governor Reynolds:
Good morning. It's an honor to be here with all of you at the Iowa Teacher and Principal Leadership Symposium at Drake University. Thank you, President Maxwell, for that gracious welcome and for making it possible for us to gather in beautiful Sheslow Auditorium in historic Old Main.
I also want to thank all the other sponsors who helped make today possible. We could not hold this important event without your generous support.
Thank you, too, to everyone here today for taking time out of your busy schedules to attend the symposium, and to our outstanding speakers and panel participants. We are looking forward to hearing from you.
This is a great opportunity to discuss how Iowa can take a critical next step in giving our children a world-class education.
The question before us is how to create new, formal leadership roles for teachers to better use their talents to raise student achievement.
Principals alone cannot reasonably be expected to provide all the instructional leadership needed inside every school building to help ALL students succeed.
Top teachers and principals, working together, CAN provide that leadership.
