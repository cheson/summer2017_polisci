Des Moines has put in a tremendous amount of work to receive this designation. I want to thank city leaders and the business community for supporting this program and ensuring all veterans know Iowa is the most veteran friendly state in the nation."
"This program is all about people helping people, and I'm thankful to live in a state where that's what we do," Lt. Gov. Gregg said. "The support from Iowa businesses, communities and educational institutions is inspiring and sends a clear message to veterans: we appreciate your service and your sacrifice."
