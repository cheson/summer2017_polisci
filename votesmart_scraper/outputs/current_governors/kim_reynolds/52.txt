Gov. Terry Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds released the following statements to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks:
"We must never forget the terrible atrocities of that fateful day, and we must continue to promote this great experiment that is America. Iowans answered the call of duty on 9/11, and have every day since. As our Iowa military service members so bravely responded with their determination, I hope all Iowans will take time today to remember the sacrifices of our service members and their families." -- Gov. Terry E. Branstad
"Today we remember those who perished in the deliberate, violent attack on our nation. The terrorists hoped to tear a hole in the fabric of our ideals, but instead Americans responded with a strengthened resolve as a united country. I encourage all Iowans to take a moment, remember those we lost, and pledge their time and energy to make this country a better place for all who reside within its borders." -- Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds
