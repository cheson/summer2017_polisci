Gov. Terry E. Branstad released the following statement today in response to the conference committee report on education reform:
"This is an important first step, with much work left to be done to give all students a globally competitive education. That requires a great teacher in every classroom, a great principal leading every building, high academic standards and strong matching assessments.
"Going forward, we must recognize that developing teacher leadership is essential to provide all children a world-class education. Principals alone can't shoulder all the responsibilities involved in helping all youngsters succeed academically, including updating achievement goals, evaluating student data and improving instructional practices."
Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds released the following statement:
"It is encouraging that young children struggling to learn to read will receive more intensive instruction. That is a basic, but very important step.
"As we begin this decade-long process of restoring Iowa schools to best in the nation, we appreciate all the time and hard work legislators put into reaching an initial reform agreement. We look forward to working together in the next year to take bold steps to give children the education they deserve."
