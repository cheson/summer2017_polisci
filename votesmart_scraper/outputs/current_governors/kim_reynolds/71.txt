Gov. Terry Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds today released their final recommendations for restoring Iowa's standing as a leader in education and preparing all students to compete for jobs in a global economy.
The document represents an overview of proposed education legislation that will be presented by the Governor and Lt. Governor in the 2012 session.
The recommendations stay true to three key areas outlined in a blueprint for education reform released by the Branstad-Reynolds administration in October: highly effective teachers and leaders, high expectations for all students with fair measures for results, and innovation that boosts learning.
"Iowans have played a critical role as we've worked to elevate the conversation about improving our schools," Branstad said. "These proposals will put us on the path to make Iowa schools among the best in the world."
World-class schools are one of four top priorities set by Branstad and Reynolds. The administration has worked for the past year to carve out a long-term, reform-minded policy direction that builds from Iowa's strengths and adopts improvements with lessons learned from the highest-performing systems in the world.
In July, the Branstad-Reynolds administration convened an education summit to discuss ideas about what it takes to lead the world in education.
