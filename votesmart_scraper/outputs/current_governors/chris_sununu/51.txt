Chris Sununu, Republican candidate for Governor, issued the following statement today regarding the Executive Council vote on Smarter Balanced testing:
"Today the Governor and Department of Education asked for a vote by the Executive Council for a retroactive contract renewal with the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium for statewide academic testing of New Hampshire school students. Parents and teachers across the state have raised serious questions about Smarter Balanced testing and Common Core standards, and whether this is the right path for New Hampshire. Yet by bringing the contract before the Executive Council seven months late, the state has been put in a position of having to accept these tests and standards or risk losing over $250 million in federal funding.
"This is yet another example of the federal government forcing their priorities onto states by threatening to withhold funding from anyone who does not toe the line. This is a failure of leadership at both the national and state level, and I am committed to restoring local control to New Hampshire schools and providing assessments and standards that are aligned with the interests of New Hampshire, not Washington D.C. bureaucrats. Unlike the Governor, who has not provided the leadership and accountability we need, I will always put our students, parents, and teachers first.
"It is time for new leadership in Concord that is going to stand up to out of state interests and allow New Hampshire to do what it does best, empower our local schools to have the flexibility and support they need to provide the very best education possible to our students."
