Governor Chris Sununu issued the following statement after today signing HB 103, relative to school district policies regarding objectionable course material:
"This bipartisan legislation is consistent with my longtime support for measures that further empower parents' involvement in their child's education. New Hampshire is now joining with 22 other states and the District of Columbia in ensuring school districts allow parental involvement when sensitive topics and materials are discussed in the classroom. It is important to let parents know what students are learning and this bill encourages clear and open lines of communication regarding curriculum content in this important area."
