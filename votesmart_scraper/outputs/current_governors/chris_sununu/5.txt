Governor Chris Sununu today issued the following statement on the Committee of Conference's amendment to SB 191:
"Today, full-day kindergarten is one step further in becoming a reality for every community and family across New Hampshire. This is not a time for partisan politics, we need to get this done. I'm very confident that members of both parties can come together over the next week to get this legislation to my desk.
This is one of the most transformative pieces of legislation, and more progress for kindergarten then this state has ever seen. As revenues increase, the amount of funding can increase for kids. It is not only a first step, it is a real plan that funds full-day kindergarten across every community in this state."
