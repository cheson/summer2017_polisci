Executive Councilor Chris Sununu made the following statement regarding the announcement that Kinder Morgan had suspended the proposed Northeast Energy Direct (NED) Pipeline project.
"I made it clear to Kinder Morgan early on in this process that they had to show commitments to the gas subscriptions by early summer or else the project was going to hit a major roadblock with the state of New Hampshire. It is obvious that Kinder Morgan was not able to meet those subscription requirements and therefore they made the right decision in suspending the project indefinitely. I believe it is important to hold people to their commitments and obligations on behalf of the citizens and taxpayers in New Hampshire. We are a state that cherishes local control and the strength of local opposition against this project ensured that those obligations would be held firm."
