Location: Concord, NH

Following the Legislature's actions to pass the state budget, Governor Chris Sununu issued the following statement:
"New Hampshire is on a pathway to prosperity, and Republicans are leading the way. Granite Staters sent us to Concord to take action and to address New Hampshire's most critical public policy and program priorities. I am proud to say that we have delivered results for the people of New Hampshire. This is a fiscally responsible budget that lives within our means, promotes job creation through tax cuts, reforms the Division of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF), and funds our broken mental health system. Our budget is a bold step in the right direction - a step toward restoring the New Hampshire advantage, and reaffirming the commitment we made to the people to provide tax relief that boosts our economy and returns money to your pocket. From business tax cuts to eliminating the Electricity Consumption Tax, our budget empowers small business owners to reinvest, which will reinvigorate and grow our economy."
