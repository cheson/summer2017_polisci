Statement

Location: Concord, NH

Following today's announcement that Minuteman Health plans to withdraw from the New Hampshire insurance market, Governor Chris Sununu issued the following statement:
"Today's announcement by Minuteman Health is more clear evidence that Obamacare has failed and that our nation's healthcare system demands reform. It further underscores why Washington must act now to reform our healthcare system and take actions to stabilize our individual health insurance market. This environment of instability was created by Obamacare's costly regulations and taxes that are causing premiums to sky rocket. Washington must work together to end the partisan gridlock and move reform forward otherwise more Granite Staters are likely to be negatively impacted. New Hampshire deserves better and the time for reform is now. Failure is not an option."
