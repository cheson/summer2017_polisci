When New Hampshire does it New Hampshire's way, we do it better than everybody else. Chris believes that to be especially true for education. A father of three young children, Chris has seen up close the erosion of school choice and the adverse effects of Common Core standards. He'll be a governor that is committed to restoring local control in our schools, providing students a better path to success and empowering teachers to do what they do best. His plan includes:
*Pushing back on Washington D.C. bureaucracy
*Replacing Common Core with a New Hampshire test built for New Hampshire students
*Promoting school choice through increased funding for charter schools
*Empowering teachers to better prepare their students
