Ohio Gov. John Kasich will return to New Hampshire later this month to endorse Chris Sununu's bid for the Corner Office.
NH1 News learned on Tuesday that the former Republican presidential candidate will be back in the Granite State August 28-29, for his first visit since finishing a strong second in the February 9th first-in-the-nation primary.
Kasich will hold a reunion with supporters of his White House bid on Sunday. On Monday Kasich will campaign with Sununu, the three-term member of the Executive Council who's running for the GOP gubernatorial nomination. He will also help fundraise for Sununu.
"It's been too many years since New Hampshire has had a Republican governor and Chris Sununu is the right choice to win in November. As a business leader he understands how to grow New Hampshire's economy and keep taxes low to grow jobs and new businesses," Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf told NH1 News.
