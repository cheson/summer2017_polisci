Governor Chris Sununu issued the statement below following today's Senate Finance committee action on SB 38-FN as amended:
"As I said in my budget address, in setting aside an Infrastructure Revitalization Fund we are making local needs a priority and providing a vehicle to get important projects done. In no area is this more important than with roads and bridges," said Governor Chris Sununu. "Today's legislation will dedicate more than $38 million to spend on municipal roads and bridges. This is not money dedicated to the needs and wishes of state government, but rather resources directed through existing formulas to directly help local taxpayers. I'm proud to stand with the legislature and make a real difference for local communities."
