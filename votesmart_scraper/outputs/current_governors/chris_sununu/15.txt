Governor Chris Sununu's abridged remarks at today's press conference with Tim Pifer, Director of New Hampshire's forensic lab, Attorney General Gordon Macdonald, and Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeff Meyers:
Just within the last few hours, the New Hampshire medical examiner and the state forensic lab confirmed that for the first time, Carfentanil has been identified as being present in New Hampshire.
This extremely dangerous drug is visually identical to fentanyl, however it is 100 times more powerful and unfortunately, it is now here in our state.
It presents a serious risk to public safety, first responders, medical treatment and laboratory personnel because it can be absorbed through the skin or accidently inhaled so these individuals should exercise extreme caution and seek immediate medical attention should exposure occur.
The medical examiner confirmed today that it can be linked to three known deaths in our state.
We are continuing to assess the situation, but there is clearly enough evidence to make the public aware and felt it was imperative to urge caution for those that may come in contact with this substance.
