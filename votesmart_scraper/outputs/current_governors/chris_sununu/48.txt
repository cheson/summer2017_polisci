"I am very disappointed that our New Hampshire Republican Party is embroiled in a self-created dispute regarding the NH delegation to the Republican National Convention. As a Republican who believes in openness, transparency, and fairness, I urge the Party leadership to choose that path over one of expediency and secrecy in electing the chair of our delegation and delegates to serve on key Convention committees. Our fight must be with the Democratic Party, and not amongst fellow Republicans, if we are to win in November."
