Over the last year, the New Hampshire School Connectivity Initiative made important progress in expanding high-speed Internet to more schools and students across the Granite State, with 25,583 students gaining access to high-speed Internet. This is according to EducationSuperHighway's second annual "State of the States" report. EducationSuperHighway is the leading national non-profit focused on upgrading the Internet access in every public school classroom in America.
This year's report, issued today, finds that:
85 percent of New Hampshire school districts meet the minimum connectivity goal of 100 kbps per student, up from 66 percent at this time last year;
25,583 students gained access to more bandwidth in their classrooms, but 46,015 still do not have the minimum connectivity they need.
Speaking about the findings in EducationSuperHighway's State of the States report, Governor Chris Sununu said, "It's clear that New Hampshire has made important strides in increasing bandwidth in our schools, providing students a 21st century education and pathway into a competitive American workforce. I look forward to working with parents and communities to help ensure that students have the tools they need to succeed in the classroom and beyond."
"Governor Sununu has shown a strong commitment to building New Hampshire's economy. That work starts in New Hampshire classrooms by ensuring that students have access to the most innovative technology and learning techniques," Evan Marwell, Founder and CEO of EducationSuperHighway said. "At EducationSuperHighway, our mission is student connectivity and unleashing the potential of digital learning for every student. We will work closely with Governor Sununu to ensure that New Hampshire students are prepared to compete in the 21st century economy."
