Location: Concord, NH

Governor Chris Sununu today issued the following statement related to FY 18-19:
"While I'm disappointed that House leadership couldn't get a budget passed today, I am encouraged that the Senate has moved swiftly to take up my budget as a starting point for their deliberations.
"The people of New Hampshire sent us here to get things done and to address our state's most critical public policy and program priorities. I look forward to taking the next steps in the budget process by working closely with members of the Senate to do exactly that and, as always, my door remains open to all members of the House who want to bring good ideas forward. On matters of economic development, education and our opioid crisis, failure is not an option. Granite Staters deserve results. We will deliver a fiscally responsible budget."
