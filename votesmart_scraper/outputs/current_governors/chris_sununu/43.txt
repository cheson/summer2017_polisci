Chris Sununu for Governor communications director David Abrams released the following statement in response to Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas's new ad:
"Mayor Gatsas's failing campaign has turned desperate. His new ad attacking Chris Sununu is a flat out lie and a clear attempt to draw attention away from his own failed record in Manchester, where violent crime has risen steeply and heroin overdoses have reached unprecedented levels. Now after 16 long years in politics, Mayor Gatsas wants to do to New Hampshire what he's already done to Manchester. Voters are smart enough to know we need an innovative, conservative governor who can take our state in a new direction. Failed leadership and tired, old politics of the past are no answer for New Hampshire's future. The voters know better."
