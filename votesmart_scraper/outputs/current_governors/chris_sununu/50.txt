Executive Councilor Chris Sununu, Republican candidate for Governor, issued the following statement responding to today's State of the State address:
"Governor Hassan clearly believes that spending government money is the way to create jobs. It is not. As a business owner, I know businesses that prosper create jobs and I will be the Governor who will restore the New Hampshire Advantage. We must reestablish a vibrant economic climate for the businesses that power our economy for they will provide the dependable, high paying jobs for our citizens."
