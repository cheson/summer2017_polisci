Fix Red-Listed Roads & Bridges Now: New Hampshire has over 2,000 miles of roads and 150 red listed bridges in need of repair. Leadership is about priorities and New Hampshire must be led by a governor who understands where our most critical needs are. Unfortunately, Democratic governors over the past decade have stalled on these important infrastructure needs and instead focused on more politically expedient projects. A Sununu administration will take action immediately to address long-overdue projects.
Fiber Connectivity: As governor, Chris Sununu will expand fiber connectivity across the state through support for public-private partnerships, ensuring that New Hampshire does not fall behind competitors in the region and across the country in technological advancements. New business must be assured complete connectivity when competing in a global market.
