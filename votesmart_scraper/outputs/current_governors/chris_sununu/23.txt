Location: Concord, NH

Governor Chris Sununu today spoke with Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera by phone to discuss the region's ongoing opiate crisis. Following the call, Governor Sununu issued the following statement:
"It is no secret that the opiate crisis is the most serious public health and safety issue facing New Hampshire and the neighboring states across New England. This afternoon I spoke with Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera. The Mayor and his local law enforcement personnel have been doing a good job on this issue, but we must recognize this is a cross-border problem that requires cross-border solutions. It has no geographic boundaries and it remains incumbent upon all of us to come together and work collaboratively across our borders along with federal, state and local law enforcement. I am encouraged by my conversation with the Mayor and have invited him to join me in developing a plan that will find solutions to this problem in both of our communities."
