Governor Chris Sununu today issued the following statement in support of action to protect drinking water:
"There is no more important display of public trust than each time we, as citizens, turn on our faucets -- a trust that our government has done its job in ensuring clean water for us and our children. The Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund can and will be an invaluable asset in protecting our public health and safety, as it invests critical dollars in vital infrastructure projects across New Hampshire," said Governor Chris Sununu. "This is an excellent example of a prudent use of the Trust Fund, as the legislative and executive branches are working together to employ existing expertise and responsible corporate citizenship to solve a real problem."
