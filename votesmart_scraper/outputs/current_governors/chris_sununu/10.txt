Quebec Manufacturer Expanding to Berlin, NH

Location: Berlin, NH

A Quebec-based composites manufacturer, with a contract to produce parts for Volvo, is expanding to northern New Hampshire, according to the New Hampshire Department of Resources and Economic Development.
Deflex Composite, located in Saint-Victor, Quebec, has signed a lease to occupy 9,600 square feet at 22 Jericho Rd. in Berlin. This is its first U.S. operation and the manufacturer plans to hire three people initially, and seven more by the end of the year, to manufacture front and rear bumpers for Volvo buses.
The company was first introduced to New Hampshire in 2009 at a state presentation in Drummondville, Quebec. Since then, Michael Bergeron and Benoit Lamontagne of the Division of Economic Development have kept in touch with the company. Representatives of Deflex Composite took part in a webinar hosted by Gov. Chris Sununu last month about doing business in New Hampshire.
"New Hampshire welcomes Deflex Composite to Berlin," Governor Sununu said. "We are committed to doing everything possible to reach out and promote what New Hampshire has to offer."
"We are pleased to welcome Deflex Composite to New Hampshire for its first U.S. expansion," Department of Resources and Economic Development Commissioner Jeffrey Rose said. "Berlin, with its deep French-Canadian roots, is a great location for this company to grow its presence on this side of the border."
"The Buy America Act is one of the reasons that we have seen a strong interest from Quebec manufacturers recently," Lamontagne said. "This law requires companies under federal contracts to make their end product in the U.S. and more than 50 percent of the cost of the parts must be made here."
