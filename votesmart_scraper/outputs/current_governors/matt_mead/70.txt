Governor Matt Mead held a news conference today to sign an Executive Order appointing A. Rose Hill of Sheridan as Wyoming's new Poet Laureate. Mrs. Hill is the seventh Poet Laureate in state history.
"Rose is an exceptional writer. She writes poems that remind us how beautiful poetry is and that make us want to hear more. Devoted to her family and community, she has taken time to share her talent in classrooms, public readings and workshops," said Governor Mead.
Hill graduated from Sheridan High School and Sheridan College with a degree in accounting. Her writing has appeared in Serendipity magazine, in Emerging Voices published by Western Nebraska Community College, and in numerous publications featuring Wyoming poets and writers.
"I am so honored and humbled to be in the company of the tall Poets Laureate who came before me," said Mrs. Hill. "I want to thank my family for being here with me and supporting me. I'm really looking forward to this!"
"Rose is the third Poet Laureate during my time in office," continued Mead. "Knowing that Wyoming has many talented poets, I early on decided to give more than one person the opportunity to serve in this important capacity. Rose follows Echo Klaproth and Pat Frolander and I thank all three for giving us the gift of their time and talent."
