Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead accepted an invitation for Wyoming to join the Complete College America Alliance of States. As part of this Alliance Wyoming will work on plans to significantly increase the number of students successfully completing college. Governor Mead has assembled a team representing Wyoming community colleges, the University of Wyoming, the executive branch and employers to develop the plans.
"We invest a lot in the education of Wyoming children -- from kindergarten through graduation and into college with the Hathaway Scholarship. I believe these investments are a wise use of our money and am proud of the programs we have in place," Governor Mead said. "But, the data shows we can do better at preparing students for college."
The team Governor Mead assembled will also set goals for college completion at the state level and at the campus level and report on progress each year.
"I believe Wyoming's team can serve as a tool for educators at all levels as we make improvements in helping students before and after they enter college," Governor Mead said. "Improving college completion rates at the University of Wyoming and in community colleges means a better workforce and a brighter future for these men and women."
The Wyoming Community College Commission will prepare baseline data on college completion based on metrics from the Complete College America Alliance.
