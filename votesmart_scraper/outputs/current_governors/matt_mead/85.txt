On Friday, February 27th, Governor Mead signed HB107 which streamlines the process for physicians from across the country to bring their expertise to Wyoming. Wyoming is the first state in the nation to sign the compact, but several other state legislatures are considering it as well.
"Physician recruitment is key to improving access to quality health care. There are places in Wyoming with limited access to doctors. This compact helps the process for out of state physicians to practice in Wyoming. It opens doors to telemedicine and access to specialists," Governor Mead said.
The Wyoming Board of Medicine supports the compact and will continue to have licensing and regulatory authority over physicians wishing to practice in Wyoming.
