Statement

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead is traveling to China this week to attend the 2012 International Advanced Coal Technologies Conference, and to promote Wyoming businesses in China. Previously, the Advanced Coal Technologies conference took place in Wyoming and Australia. The series of conferences furthers coal technology research.
"This conference supports collaboration on research that can add value to coal, a most important Wyoming resource. Wyoming is the number one state in coal production in the United States," Governor Mead said. Governor Mead will be one of the speakers at the conference, which takes place in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. Shaanxi Province is China's largest coal-producing province.
The trip will provide an opportunity for the Governor to visit a large scale coal-to-liquids plant that has been operating for several years. Governor Mead will also have a meeting with the Governor of Shaanxi Province -- reciprocating a previous visit to Wyoming.
"China is the second largest economy in the world and one of the fastest growing economies," Governor Mead said. "On this trip, I hope to learn about additional ways in which Wyoming companies can tap into this market and grow the economy for our businesses and create jobs for the people of Wyoming.
"I will convey the message that Wyoming has many strengths, including our talented and highly-educated workforce, our significant energy and agricultural resources, and our world-class natural beauty and desirable living environment. I know businesses, government entities and the Chinese people will be listening to it," Governor Mead said.
