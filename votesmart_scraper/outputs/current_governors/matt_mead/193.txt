At the closing of the budget session, Governor Matt Mead said that Wyoming is well-served by its citizen legislature. He noted that members leave their families, their homes, to work incredibly hard and over long hours during the session. The Governor thanked the legislators for all their efforts, especially related to the budget.
"I am excited about the budget. I said in my state of the state address that we have agriculture, resources, wildlife -- we are fortunate for all we have. We have savings. If Wyoming were a stock, we would not invest anywhere else," Governor Mead said.
The Governor thanked the legislators for making important investments in Wyoming, including:
· $175 million for communities, keeping them strong;
· Providing for the unified network, which will help Wyoming lead in broadband;
· Funding for state facilities, so that where the state has committed to care, we give it well and in safe facilities;
· Support for an integrated test center, which says to the country and the world that coal is part of today, part of the future, part of Wyoming;
· Support for UW, for example, the Tier-1 College of Engineering;
· Support for community colleges, which are strong and getting stronger;
· Work to reduce the DD wait list, an area where we could do better and we have;
· Compensation increases for state employees, so we can keep the best talent; and
· Providing for tourism and predator control in support of tourism and ag, two of our top three industries.
"We invested in Wyoming not just for two years but for many years to come," Governor Mead said.
