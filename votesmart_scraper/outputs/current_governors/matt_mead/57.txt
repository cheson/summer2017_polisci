Governor Matt Mead praised the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) announcement today that the Greater sage-grouse will not be listed under the Endangered Species Act. The Governor joined the Secretary of the Department of the Interior Sally Jewell and USFWS Director Dan Ashe for the announcement in Denver.
"I am pleased that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service made the right decision. This is the result of Wyoming and other Western states taking a proactive approach to the Greater sage-grouse - working with industry, agriculture and conservation groups and the federal government," Governor Mead said. "Today's decision recognizes Wyoming and other western states were successful. We can continue to create jobs and share our natural resources with the rest of the nation while the Greater sage-grouse thrives. I thank the Sage Grouse Implementation Team and the many others involved for their service and dedication to this important issue."

Wyoming has aggressively worked for more than a decade to prevent the sage-grouse from being listed. In July, Governor Mead updated an earlier Executive Order that protects core areas of grouse habitat.

"Many diverse interests worked together and this was the key to our success," Governor Mead said. "This plan should serve as an example for other states that face challenges with the Endangered Species Act."
