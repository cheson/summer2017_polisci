At Governor Matt Mead's direction, Wyoming Attorney General Peter Michael sent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy a Petition for Reconsideration of EPA's Final Rule on Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources. The Petition was submitted this afternoon via email as well as by overnight mail.
"This rulemaking has been flawed from the very beginning. The Final Rule is the result of an unfair process -- it has both procedural and substantive deficiencies," said Governor Mead. "I am directing the Attorney General to use every tool in the legal toolbox to stop this arbitrary and extremely harmful Rule."
