Governor Matt Mead today joined over a hundred people to march and commemorate the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Standing before a statue of Esther Hobart Morris, Governor Mead spoke about the continual need to strive for the goals that Dr. King espoused.
"In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize, King spoke of his audacious belief that peoples everywhere could have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits," Mead said. "Food for the body, mind and soul are not things to be taken for granted. Not everyone has enough of it and we must continue to strive to provide it for all of our citizens. The work is not done."
Mrs. Morris championed woman's suffrage and Mead noted that women voting, serving on juries, and holding public office were all Wyoming firsts. But, he went on to add that the people of this state should always build on our equality heritage.
It is fitting that we do more than just think and talk about freedom and equality. We should also act upon these principles that guide us in respectful ways -- such as our gathering here on the Capitol steps and gathering for other ceremonies in cities and towns around our state and country,Mead said to the crowd.
Mead ended by reminding people that King said when it comes to freedom we are all inextricably bound. We cannot walk alone.
