Gov. Jack Dalrymple has joined nine other governors and Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall in urging President Obama to act swiftly in approving the Keystone XL pipeline project. The governors and Premier Wall signed a joint letter, urging the President to move expeditiously in approving the pipeline project.
"The Keystone XL pipeline project is important to U.S. energy security and it would greatly expand the market opportunities for Bakken crude oil," Gov. Jack Dalrymple said. "Given that Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman has approved an alternate route through his state, we see no reason to delay the project any further."
In the letter, the governors and Wall said the Keystone XL pipeline would also create thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs and support the most efficient and reliable means of transporting crude oil to U.S. refineries.
The governors who joined Dalrymple in signing the letter are: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, Idaho Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter, Kan. Gov. Sam Brownback, Nev. Gov. Brian Sandoval, Okla. Gov. Mary Fallin, S. D. Gov. Dennis Daugaard, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and Wyo. Gov. Matt Mead.
TransCanada's proposed XL pipeline would carry crude oil from Alberta, Canada and from the Bakken shale formation to Gulf Coast refineries.
