Press Release

Western Watershed Project challenged the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) decision to allow grazing on BLM land near Boulder, Wyoming. Wyoming filed a Motion to Intervene.
"Wyoming worked closely with BLM during the initial review and prior to BLM's decision," Governor Mead said. "The BLM reached a good decision and has a good plan. Wyoming's motion supports ranchers who move livestock over this land and the State of Wyoming's ability to manage state land."
The decision affects 10,200 acres of state land and 18,400 acres of private land peppered among 72,000 acres of BLM land. Wyoming leases state land for grazing. If grazing were disallowed on BLM land adjacent to state land Wyoming grazing leases would be devalued.
"Agriculture is important to Wyoming's culture and economy. Grazing and grazing leases are part of good management and support schools across Wyoming," Governor Mead said.
