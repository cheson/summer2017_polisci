Governor Matt Mead complimented the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission for taking the next step in its aggressive four-year plan to plug orphaned coal bed methane wells. The OGCC has selected a contractor to conduct reclamation work on 141 wells in the Ucross and Spotted Horse areas in Sheridan and Campbell Counties.

"In our effort to be the standard-bearer for responsible energy development, Wyoming is committed to protecting and restoring our natural resources for the benefit of our citizens," Governor Mead said. "Protecting our land, water and wildlife is as important as responsible oil and gas development. In Wyoming we are committed to both. I am pleased the Oil and Gas Commission is moving forward with this project."

The work will be conducted by Pluggin Along LLC of Gillette. The project's funding comes via revenues from the conservation tax, which is assessed on oil and gas production. The contract specifically covers wellbore plugging. Landowners will have input into surface restoration.
