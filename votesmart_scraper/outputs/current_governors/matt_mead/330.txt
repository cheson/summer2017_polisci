Every ten years the Legislature must adjust voting districts to match new census figures. Lawmakers worked on the latest redistricting bill throughout the past year.
"Redistricting is no easy job and I want to thank all the members of the Corporations Committee for their hard work," Governor Mead said. "Not everyone is pleased with this plan. It is such a difficult process and lawmakers should be commended for their effort."
Governor Matt Mead signed the redistricting bill today. He also signed a bill that allows Wyoming to regulate greenhouse gases. He said Wyoming will continue with its legal challenge of the EPA's decisions regarding a State Implementation Plan.
"This new law is an important change -- needed in order for Wyoming to have a lead role over the federal government in regulation of its greenhouse gases," Governor Mead said. "Absent this law the federal government would regulate greenhouse gases in Wyoming. We want to take on that responsibility whenever possible. Companies that produce greenhouse gases would have to apply to both Wyoming and the federal government for permits without Wyoming as the lead regulator."
