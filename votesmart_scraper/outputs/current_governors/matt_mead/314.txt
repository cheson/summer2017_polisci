Governor Looks to Support CO2 Pipeline Network
Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

As part of his energy strategy, Governor Matt Mead is opening a discussion about a proposed statewide network of carbon dioxide (CO2) pipeline corridors within federal land boundaries. Establishing pre-approved corridors would protect open spaces and minimize environmental impacts. Such corridors are intended to significantly shorten permitting time for future pipeline projects, which in turn would allow for enhanced oil recovery.
"There is currently no consistent, statewide plan for CO2 pipelines," Governor Mead said. Presently, pipeline corridors on federal land are separately determined by the nine individual Bureau of Land Management offices in Wyoming. "This is a piecemeal approach and we can benefit the diverse interests across the state by providing instead a cohesive approach. A well thought out and laid out statewide network could serve as a model for other projects and as an economic tool for Wyoming." Capture and storage of CO2 have the potential to advance energy technology and improve air quality. CO2 flooding is also a proven method of enhanced oil recovery.
Governor Mead plans to work on proposed corridors with the Bureau of Land Management. Any proposal would be reviewed and open to public comment, possibly becoming a Record of Decision to update each Resource Management Plan of the various BLM offices across Wyoming.
An introduction of this concept is on the Wyoming Pipeline Authority's agenda for May 15th. The Authority meets at 10:00 a.m. at the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission offices in Casper.
