Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: May 16, 2014
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead will speak at the first Wyoming Energy Summit next week. The event, sponsored by Governor Mead and the Wyoming Business Report, will address a wide range of topics including coal exports, sage grouse and the next generation of energy. The Energy Summit has adopted "Leading the Charge" as both its name and goal based on the Wyoming Energy Strategy Governor Mead released last year.
"I am impressed by the interest in the Summit. It shows Wyoming recognizes the significance of energy and the difference it makes in our personal lives from the utility bill to jobs. We can have energy development and a healthy environment. Both are important to our quality of life," Governor Mead said.
