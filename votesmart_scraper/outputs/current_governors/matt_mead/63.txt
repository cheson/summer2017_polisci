Governor Matt Mead today responded to a request from the state of Washington for help fighting fires by authorizing the deployment of two UH-60 helicopters equipped with aerial firefighting equipment under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact. Each helicopter includes a crew of three. A two person maintenance crew is also driving to Washington to assist the helicopter crews.
"Wildfires can be devastating," said Governor Mead. "We want to do all we can to help keep people and property safe. Wyoming crews are well-trained and able to help."
The crews will be based at Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, WA. The deployment is expected to last around 16 days. However, the crews can be recalled at any time if a need arises in Wyoming.
"The National Guard is based on partnerships," said Maj. Gen. Luke Reiner, Wyoming's adjutant general. "When one of our partners needs support in times of need it is important to step up and assist. We are pleased to be asked to assist with firefighting efforts."
