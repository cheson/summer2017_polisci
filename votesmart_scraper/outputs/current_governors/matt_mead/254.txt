Local Solution Means Wyoming Plows to Head for Yellowstone Today
Statement
By: Matt Mead
Date: April 1, 2013
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead thanked the communities of Cody and Jackson for rallying together to pay for plowing of the roads to Yellowstone National Park. The local funding will cover the cost of Wyoming Department of Transportation equipment and personnel to start plowing roads to Yellowstone's east gates today. Crews will head north from Jackson next week.
"This is an example of what this country needs right now -- people working together," Governor Mead said. "The federal government made cuts that would have shutout visitors for two weeks. I decided Wyoming will not bail them out, but we do want to find solutions. Our towns of Cody and Jackson rallied to raise money and the beneficiaries are all of the visitors who want access to America's first national park who will now have it."
Governor Mead thanked the donors, the plow crews and the Superintendent of Yellowstone for working with Wyoming and the communities.
