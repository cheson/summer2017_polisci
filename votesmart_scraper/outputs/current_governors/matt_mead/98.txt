Good morning. Good to see you. Thank you.
Good morning. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you very much. Very nice. Thank you. Thank you.
Good morning. Thank you for the warm welcome. I don't know that it can get any better than that. Thank you very much. It's very kind.
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the 63rd Wyoming Legislature, Secretary Murray, Auditor Cloud, Treasurer Gordon, Superintendent Balow, Federal Circuit Judge Phillips, Chief Justice Burke, all members of the judiciary, all military and veterans, fellow citizens, good morning. Thank you all for being here.
And thank you for those who are participating via the Internet or other media. We welcome all of you. And we're pleased that technology has many benefits, including the freedom to be wherever you want to be in Wyoming or anywhere else to take part in these proceedings.
I want to say good morning to my family. For those of you who have been here for four years, you've seen some growth in the -- in the kids. I mentioned at the inauguration that one place on the governor's residence wall -- which we'll make sure we get painted before we leave -- we have marked the height of our children over the years, and it's remarkable. And we think they have grown not only in height, but in other ways, and in many ways they've grown up with this body. You all have seen them grow up. But it causes us all to reflect upon one of the main reasons we're here, for our kids and our grandkids.
And I can't imagine being here without the love and the support of Carol and Mary and Pete. I thank all of you for helping me get here and helping me do this job.
