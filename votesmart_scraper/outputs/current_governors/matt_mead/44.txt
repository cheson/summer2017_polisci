Statement from Governor's Office on Arch Coal Bankruptcy

"Governor Mead is focused on protecting Wyoming's interests. Most important are the jobs involved. With bankruptcy reorganization proceedings, the mines in Wyoming will remain open which means employees of Arch will still be working. DEQ will be attuned to the state's reclamation interests. The plight of the coal industry has been hard to watch. Unrelenting pressure from federal regulations and policies coming out of D.C. are pushing companies to a financial brink. Today's news further shows how the Administration's efforts to move the country away from a reliable, abundant and affordable energy source are harming the economy."
