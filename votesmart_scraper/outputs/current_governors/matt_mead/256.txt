Governor Matt Mead issued the following statement after the order of District Judge Wilking affirming Wyoming's policy regarding the disclosure of hydraulic fracturing components. This policy was implemented by the Supervisor of the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission.
"I am pleased that the Supervisor's actions were affirmed. Wyoming led the nation in requiring the disclosure of hydraulic fracturing components, these disclosure requirements were well done, and other states have followed Wyoming's lead in this area.
"This decision recognizes the importance of a state-based approach to regulating hydraulic fracturing - one that balances this important method for producing energy with environmental protection."
