Governor Matt Mead appointed a Task Force on Science and Facilities. The panel, composed of accomplished scientists, industry leaders and other professionals, will focus on upgrading the science programs and laboratories at the University of Wyoming.
The Legislature created the panel as a first step in a process for UW to become one of the top academic and research institutions in science.
"These outstanding individuals have agreed to contribute their time and expertise to help UW," Governor Mead said. "These are some of our nation's best and brightest. Their insights will be invaluable as we work for a top-tier program at UW."
The Task Force is scheduled to meet for the first time September 9-10 in Laramie.

UW's Science Initiative includes planning for remodeled and upgraded laboratory facilities and emphasizes existing research strengths.
"If Wyoming and its people are to prosper in an increasingly competitive global economy, UW's students must be educated to meet head-on the challenges of that environment. And if Wyoming is to develop its own entrepreneurs and grow a diversity of businesses, then UW's extraordinary scientific talent must have world-class laboratory facilities in which to teach and to undertake research," UW President Dick McGinity says. "The university is delighted to work with the Governor's Task Force to carry out this exciting, important project."
The Task Force expects to have a report by November 1, 2014 to the Governor, who will then submit any funding recommendations for program and facilities improvements to the Legislature's Joint Appropriations Committee.
