Forest Biomass Conference Examines Program for Wyoming
Statement
By: Matt Mead
Date: April 8, 2016
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Innovative thinking and leadership were on display at the Wyoming Forest Biomass Conference, held March 29-31 in Laramie, Wyoming. The Conference highlighted opportunities to improve forest health, innovate and add value to local economies by utilizing forest products, like dead trees and other management by-products for "biomass" industries. The conference came as a result of Governor Matt Mead's Energy Strategy and Task Force on Forests.
Attendees including national experts from biomass industries discussed steps leading to a sustainable biomass industry in the Cowboy State. Governor Mead stressed that a program for Wyoming needed to be "long-term" in nature.
"A woody biomass effort should complement existing forestry industries" said Mead. "This idea is not a cure-all, but a piece of the puzzle."
A final report with recommendations from the conference will be published by the Wyoming State Forestry Division and the conference's steering committee.
