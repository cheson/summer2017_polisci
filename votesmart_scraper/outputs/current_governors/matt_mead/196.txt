Governor Matt Mead joined officials from Halliburton and the University of Wyoming to announce a major gift today. Halliburton is investing $3 million to help build a new energy and engineering research complex, called the UW High Bay Research Facility.
"We thank Halliburton for choosing the University of Wyoming. UW and all of the private partners who have come forward to date are creating a brighter future. We want to develop leading technologies to make energy production more efficient, safer and better for the environment. Halliburton is choosing to invest here. This is significant because these multi-national businesses can invest their research dollars anywhere," Governor Mead said.
The High Bay Facility is funded by $15 million in private donations doubled by a $15 million appropriation from the Wyoming State Legislature. It will contain approximately 81,000 square feet with large-scale, flexibly configured research laboratories, offices, and meeting areas. To date, UW has raised nearly $13 million toward the goal of $15 million from Hess, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Ultra Petroleum, Baker Hughes, and Shell to construct and equip the facility. UW has confirmed that the final gift to complete this major fundraising drive is in process and will be announced in the near future.
