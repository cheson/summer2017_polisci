Governor Marks Sawmill's Startup and Celebrates New Jobs
Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead attended a ribbon cutting today at the Saratoga Forest Management Mill. The sawmill is up and running again after closing down in 2003. The mill will employ a total of 80 people and support 40-50 loggers.
"It is exciting to see this sawmill up and running again. The mills in Carbon County are important to the economy, provide great jobs and produce a needed commodity. They are also a valuable tool to help deal with the effects of bark beetle," Governor Mead said. "The Medicine Bow National Forest is the hardest hit forest in Wyoming and this sawmill will help turn a negative into fuel for the economy."
The Wyoming Department of Workforce Services helped provide training for new employees at the sawmill so they would be prepared to use the specialized equipment. Governor Mead noted that the mill will also take advantage of workplace safety advice from Wyoming OSHA.
"This is a great partnership between the National Forest, the State of Wyoming and private industry," Governor Mead said.
