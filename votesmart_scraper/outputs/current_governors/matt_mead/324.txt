Governor Matt Mead plans to provide $5 million dollars from the Governor's Data Center Recruitment fund for "Project Summit." These funds would be used for infrastructure in support of a $112 million dollar data center, which a company is considering building near Cheyenne. The State Loan and Investment Board approved a separate $5 million dollar Business Ready Community Managed Data Center Cost Reduction grant in support of this project today.
The company can consider these actions in its decision making process to determine where it will locate its data center. A decision from the company is expected within six weeks. This is a Fortune 100 company. Right now Cheyenne LEADS has a non-disclosure agreement with the company, which will unveil its name if it enters into a formal contract with Cheyenne LEADS, the Laramie County economic development entity.
"I am pleased that Wyoming has shown it is attractive for a large data center," Governor Mead said. "It is impressive that Cheyenne has made it this far in the selection process. I thank the other members of the State Loan and Investment Board, Cheyenne LEADS, the Wyoming Business Council, its board and those in Laramie County who have carefully reviewed this proposal and proven Wyoming is a great place for data centers and other technology companies."
The Governor's investment of funds is contingent on several factors - specifically, the execution of a purchase agreement, a development agreement and a document demonstrating a bond has been posted securing repayment of all funds if the data center has not commenced construction in three years.
