Governor Mead's Statement on Supreme Court Decision
Statement

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead issued the following statement after today's decision from the U.S. Supreme Court:
"While it is significant that the Supreme Court recognized the limits of the Commerce and Spending Clauses, I was disappointed they otherwise did not find the law unconstitutional. As always I respect the legal process we have in this country and therefore recognize that any change in the ACA will now only come through the legislative process. This result makes the November election all the more important.
"Concerning the direction Wyoming will take, it is appropriate to study the opinion, meet with health care experts, citizens and the Legislature before making further decisions.
"While ruled constitutional, I believe the ACA is not a good fit for Wyoming citizens and we must continue to work on solutions developed in Wyoming."
