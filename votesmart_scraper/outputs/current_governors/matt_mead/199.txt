Wyoming Appeals EPA's Decision on Tribal Boundary
Statement

Location: Cheyenne, WY

When the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publicized its decision purporting to redefine the boundaries of the Wind River Reservation, Governor Matt Mead challenged the EPA's decision. He, simultaneously, directed the Wyoming Attorney General to get the matter before the court. Today, the Attorney General appealed the EPA's decision to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.
"I firmly believe that a decision of this significance should not come from a regulatory agency, especially when it goes against over 100 years of history, law and practice. Those facts are why we had to challenge this in the courts and ask the agency to reconsider its decision," Governor Mead said. "We received good news yesterday when the EPA stayed its decision. The action creates some certainty while we wait for the agency to reconsider its position during a judicial review of this flawed decision."
