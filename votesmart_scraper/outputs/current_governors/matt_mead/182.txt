Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead will welcome a delegation from Taiwan to Wyoming this week. Governor Mead led a trade mission to Taiwan last year to start to develop new markets for Wyoming industries. The delegation includes the Governor of Taiwan Province and representatives of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Seattle.
"This is a burgeoning relationship, full of potential and as I seek to expand markets for Wyoming industries, Taiwan has shown interest and compatibility," Governor Mead said. "I am honored to host our guests and continue the discussion about how we can export energy and agriculture products to Taiwan while welcoming tourists from Taiwan."
There is demand in Taiwan for American coal and American beef, and there are new opportunities for tourism given the inclusion of Taiwan in the U.S. visa waiver program. The delegation will be in Cheyenne on April 17th.
In 2013, Governor Mead traveled to Taiwan and met with the President, Ma Ying-jeou. The Governor also attended Taiwan's largest travel trade show.
"Wyoming had one of the highest rates of growth in exports in 2012. To build on that success we need a widespread push and long-term commitment. International trade development is an initiative the Legislature and I supported in the budget and will continue," Governor Mead said.
Governor Mead recently signed a joint resolution that recognizes the importance of the relationship between Taiwan and the State of Wyoming. The Resolution supports Taiwan's participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
