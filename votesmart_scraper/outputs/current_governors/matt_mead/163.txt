Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead will continue to deploy the Wyoming National Guard and other resources to assist local efforts to prevent flooding. There are several areas of concern in Wyoming right now where a large snowpack and warm temperatures are causing water levels to rise. Governor Mead is activating two units of the Wyoming National Guard to join in flood prevention measures in Carbon County.
"We are working with local officials across the state to stay as prepared as possible. I thank the men and women of the National Guard for serving Wyoming. The Guard is a critical resource that will provide meaningful support to local efforts to prevent and contain flooding," Governor Mead said.
The two teams activated consist of a total of 48 individuals and equipment. They will be in Carbon County supporting flood prevention efforts. Other teams will be called up as needed in other parts of Wyoming where there is significant flooding potential.
"We have proactively planned to deploy our Guard members quickly to assist county officials with flood mitigation efforts. It is our mission to assist Wyoming residents and we are pleased to do so," Major General Luke Reiner said.
There is already an initial assessment team in Carbon County made up of representatives of the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security and the National Guard as well as a crew of Smokebusters. That crew consists of 24 individuals. (An earlier release quoted the number as 40).
