Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead released money to the University of Wyoming for the Engineering Building and the High Bay Research Facility. The Governor's Energy, Engineering, STEM Integration Task Force reviewed and approved design and construction plans for both buildings.
"The University of Wyoming, the Legislature and I are aiming for a world-class engineering program. A College of Engineering of this caliber provides opportunities for Wyoming students to access top professors, researchers and laboratories," Governor Mead said. "I thank the staff at UW and the Task Force members for putting together a plan for both buildings. Wyoming is on course to be a world leader in engineering."
The High Bay Research Facility will house labs for large-scale experiments that exceed the capacity of a traditional engineering laboratory. UW's research capacity in strategic energy areas will be enhanced by this addition.
The major renovation and expansion of the Engineering Building upgrades existing facilities. The Legislature, UW and the Governor's Energy, Engineering, STEM Integration Task Force were instrumental in these projects. UW currently is implementing many recommendations, in addition to facility upgrades, called for by the Task Force.
