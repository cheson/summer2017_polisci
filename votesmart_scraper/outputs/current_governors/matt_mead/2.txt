Wolves Returned to State Management in Wyoming
Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead announced today the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. entered its final order upholding Wyoming's wolf management plan which confirms Wyoming's management of wolves. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) will file notice in the Federal Register in the coming days.
"I am delighted that the Circuit Court recognized Wyoming's commitment to manage a recovered wolf population," said Governor Mead. "Our wolf management plan is a result of years of hard work by people across Wyoming. We recognize the need to maintain a healthy wolf population. I thank former Secretaries of the Interior Ken Salazar and Sally Jewell as well as former Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department for their commitment to getting this done. This is a good day for Wyoming."
Wyoming managed wolves from 2012 to 2014. In 2014, a federal District Court judge reinstated federal protections for wolves on the premise that population commitments in Wyoming's wolf management plan needed to be found in regulation or statute. Wyoming and the federal government appealed that decision and ultimately prevailed in the D.C. Circuit Court.
