Governor Matt Mead announced today the appointment of David Bush as his Communications Director. Interim Director Michelle Panos will resume her duties with the Governor's Policy Office.
"We want to engage the press and public across all media platforms -- giving every person in the state an opportunity to know and understand issues we are working on in Wyoming. David's background makes him the ideal person for this task," Governor Mead said.
David Bush grew up in Cheyenne and earned his bachelor's degree in history from the University of Wyoming. He served as Legislative Correspondent for Senator Craig Thomas working on public lands, agriculture, and energy issues. David also managed Senator Enzi's 2008 re-election campaign and provided communications services for Senator Barrasso in his Cheyenne office.
"I am grateful to Governor Mead for choosing me for this position and I'm thrilled to join such an outstanding staff," Bush said.
Governor Mead also announced Seth Waggener as a contracted communications consultant.
"Seth's background as a journalist gives us insight into how our information is received by the media and where we can improve in our communication efforts," Governor Mead said.
Waggener was raised in Cheyenne. While attending Laramie County Community College's Mass Media program Seth worked for KGWN-TV Cheyenne. Waggener later worked as a television news producer in Alabama and South Carolina and most recently as executive producer for the NBC affiliate in Raleigh, North Carolina.
"I am excited to be back home in Wyoming and I thank Governor Mead for this opportunity. I look forward to helping further his communications strategy," Waggener said.
