Wyoming Shows Leadership on Wolf Management
Press Release

Governor Matt Mead's successful effort to return wolf management to the state continues to have positive results. A Wyoming Game and Fish Department report reflects that the population and number of breeding pairs is stable, more wolves are now being monitored, and confirmed livestock depredations are down -- all under state management.
"This confirms that Wyoming is in the best position to manage its wildlife, including sensitive and high-profile species like wolves," Governor Mead said. "Wyoming's wolf population has been over the target number established for taking wolves off of the endangered species list for 12 consecutive years. It was appropriate for wolf management to return to Wyoming. Wyoming continues to play a leading role in managing various species in such a way that they flourish and do not need the protection of the Endangered Species Act."
Governor Mead negotiated a plan for delisting wolves with former Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and wolves were returned to state management in September 2012. The report shows the population of wolves in Wyoming increased slightly between 2012 and 2013 and the number of breeding pairs stayed the same.
"Governor Mead fought hard to ensure delisting occurred and wolf management transferred to the state. He knew that we had a sound plan for wolf management. I believe we have implemented that plan responsibly and these numbers support that position," said the Director of the Game and Fish Department Scott Talbott.
