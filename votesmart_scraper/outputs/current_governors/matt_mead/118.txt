Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Today Judge Amy Berman Jackson remanded gray wolf management in Wyoming to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).
"I am disappointed in Judge Berman Jackson's ruling. Wyoming has been successful in its management of gray wolves. There were more wolves in Wyoming at the end of 2013 than in 2012. Wyoming has managed wolves well above the minimum and buffer population numbers," Governor Mead said. "Overturning the USFW delisting decision on a technicality highlights Wyoming's concerns with the Endangered Species Act".
The governor's office will work with the Attorney General and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to examine the best way to re-establish Wyoming's management of wolves.
