Public Statements
Wyoming and Google Team Up to Improve Government Services
Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: April 16, 2014
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead is excited to announce that the State of Wyoming is joining Google and the State of Colorado to bring together computer programmers who will develop creative solutions for problems faced by Wyoming and Colorado state agencies. The event is open to developers who will compete for 24 hours and can win prizes from Google.
In 2011, Wyoming became the first state in the country to move state employees to Google Apps for Government, which includes email. This reduced costs for the State, put all employees on a single email platform and created more opportunities for collaboration.
"I am proud that Wyoming is looking for innovative ways to develop new technologies and build new tools that will benefit the public. Google has been a good partner for our state and this is another example of the unique relationship we have with them," Governor Mead said. "I am eager to see what comes of the challenge - this approach has never been taken before."
