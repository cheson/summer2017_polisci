Governor Urges Action to Delist Grizzly Bears
Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead is asking the Secretary of the Interior to remove grizzly bears from the endangered species list. Secretary Sally Jewell wrote to Governor Mead in late 2013 saying she expected to make a decision in early 2014 and take final action this year.
"The recovery of grizzly bears in the Yellowstone Ecosystem is a conservation success story of our time," Governor Mead said. "The State of Wyoming has managed grizzly bears under federal control responsibly for years at significant cost. There is no reason to wait to remove federal protections and return control of grizzly bears to the states."
Governor Mead points out that Wyoming has worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to research food sources and the effect of those food sources on populations. That research demonstrates that grizzly bears forage on numerous sources and are expanding in population and range.
"Both the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee and the Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee have reviewed the data and both recommend FWS delist the grizzly bears. All regulatory requirements and biological objectives have been met or exceeded," Governor Mead wrote.
Governor Mead is encouraging the FWS to work with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to develop and publish a proposed rule for taking grizzly bears off the endangered species list quickly.
