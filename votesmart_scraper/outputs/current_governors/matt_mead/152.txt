Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead met with the Task Force on Forests today - as the Task Force finalizes its plans for Wyoming's forest health and use. The Task Force will put out a report with specific points for forest management that Wyoming can use to focus discussion with federal and private partners.
"Wyoming's forests provide jobs, recreation and scenic beauty for Wyoming people and for visitors. We recognize how valuable they are today and for the future. I established this task force to talk about forests and to focus on their many benefits. Specifically I wanted a plan that fit Wyoming," Governor Mead said. "I thank all of the members of the Task Force for their time and expertise. It is a diverse group and they represent many different views -- all important to a comprehensive plan."
The Task Force held five public meetings in various locations around Wyoming since last November. It is made up of industry, conservation groups, forest users, and representatives of federal, state and local government.
