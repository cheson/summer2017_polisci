By: Matt Mead
Date: Nov. 10, 2014
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead will honor veterans during a Veterans Day Ceremony at the Oregon Trail State Veterans Cemetery on November 11, 2014. The ceremony is organized by the Natrona County United Veterans Council and will also recognize contractors who completed recent improvements to the cemetery. Reverend Leonard L. Robinson, who survived the Bataan Death March during WWII, will be specially recognized with the dedication of the cemetery's front driveway in his name.
"Veterans Day reminds us that men and women who bravely served our country are all around us," Governor Mead said. "They are young and old, friends and neighbors and members of our families. Many are peace officers, fire fighters, teachers, doctors, and nurses. There are veterans in every profession throughout Wyoming. We should take the time to personally say a grateful "thank you' to the veterans we know. They have earned it."
The ceremony will be held at 11:00 am at the Oregon Trail State Veterans Cemetery, 80 Veterans Cemetery Road, Evansville.
