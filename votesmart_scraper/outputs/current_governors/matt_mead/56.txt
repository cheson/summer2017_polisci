Governor Matt Mead will travel to Washington, D.C. this week to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources and the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water and Wildlife. Governor Mead will discuss the Endangered Species Act before the Senate. He will address state authority and expertise in resource management and energy development before the House. Governor Mead is Chairman of the Western Governors' Association (WGA) and is leading a delegation of other governors to Washington, D.C.
"This is an opportunity for Western Governors to share insights directly with Congress," said Governor Mead. "Western Governors have particular expertise in natural resources. We continue to work with our Congressional delegations on these issues."
"The Endangered Species Act is broken and changes need to be made. I am confident we can work with environmental groups and others to improve the Act," Governor Mead said. "There are also numerous ways the federal government can better engage with states and Western Governors will address them."
