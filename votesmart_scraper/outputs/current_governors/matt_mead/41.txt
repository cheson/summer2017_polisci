The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) has entered into an agreement with Wyoming for management of bighorn sheep on National Forest System Lands. The agency signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the State last week. Wyoming's plan for management was formalized and has been utilized since 2004.
"This is good news for our sheep producers and good news for wildlife managers. It provides certainty-- that grazing on public lands will continue as it has for decades -- that the Forest Service and Wyoming will work together to manage in a way that works best for forest health, for industry and for wildlife," said Governor Matt Mead.
The goal of the MOU is to maintain healthy bighorn sheep populations while sustaining an economically viable domestic sheep industry in the state.
"Wyoming's bighorn sheep are doing well. The Game and Fish Department is committed to an effective plan for bighorn and domestic sheep. This MOU accomplishes that," said Scott Talbott, Director of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.
Sheep producers in Wyoming generate more than $60 million annually in total economic benefit and provide more than 800 jobs in the state.
"We are excited to announce the signing of the memorandum of understanding. The document formalizes our commitment to collaboratively manage bighorn sheep and their habitats on National Forest System Lands within the State of Wyoming," said Jacque Buchanan, Deputy Regional Forester for the Rocky Mountain Region.
"We look forward to continue working with all of our working group partners and affected grazing permittees on developing strategies for the future" added Nora Rasure, Regional Forester for the Intermountain Region.
