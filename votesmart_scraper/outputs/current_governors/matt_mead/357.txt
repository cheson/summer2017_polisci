Governor Matt Mead said he is glad to see that Wyoming saw a significant increase in access on the latest nationwide map of access to broadband internet. The most recent National Telecommunications and Information Administration and Federal Communications Commission map shows access to high speed downloads in Wyoming moved from 54% to 85% of the population.
"While this is good news, we need to push for even greater access," Governor Mead said. "I understand the challenges we face with geography, but I believe we will continue to improve. Broadband access drives so much of economic activity in today's world that we must continue to push for solutions."
This map shows that 84.7% of the population in Wyoming has access to download speeds of 3 MB/second and upload speeds of 0.768 Mb/second.
"I am very impressed with the innovative public-private partnerships that increased broadband access to current levels and I continue to support plans for further infrastructure improvements," Governor Mead said.
