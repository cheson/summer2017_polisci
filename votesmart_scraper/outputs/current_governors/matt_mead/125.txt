The U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Wyoming's favor on a wild horse management case. The Court denied a request for an emergency injunction by wild horse advocates, clearing the way for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to remove horses from private lands in southwest Wyoming.
"Wyoming is not against wild horses on public lands, but they must be managed appropriately. Today's ruling allows that to happen and protects Wyoming land, supports ranchers and wildlife, and it benefits wild horse populations," Governor Matt Mead said.
The BLM is planning to roundup wild horses in an area where private, federal and state lands intermingle. The BLM's plan complies with an agreement between the BLM and a group of local ranchers. Wyoming points out unmanaged wild horse populations negatively impact habitat health on public lands.
