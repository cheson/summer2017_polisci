Statement

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead announced today that the Integrated Test Center (ITC) will be built at Basin Electric Power Cooperative's Dry Fork Station near Gillette, WY. The ITC will provide space for researchers to develop commercially viable uses for carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. A construction date has not been set.
"We are making an investment in the future of coal. The research at the ITC will lead to new opportunities in petrochemicals and other commercial uses for carbon dioxide," said Governor Mead. "We lead the nation in coal production. This facility allows us to provide the same leadership in research and to do all we can to make sure the coal industry can continue to serve Wyoming and the country for many years to come."
In 2014, the Wyoming Legislature approved Governor Mead's request for $15 million in state funds to build and operate the ITC provided $5 million in private matching funds were secured. Those funds have been pledged by Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc. In addition, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association has pledged $1 million.
"I want to thank our partners at Tri-State Generation, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and Basin Electric for their generous support. I also want to thank Rocky Mountain Power and Black Hills Power for their efforts to make this day a reality," continued Governor Mead. "I'm thrilled to announce as well that XPRIZE Foundation will be the first tenants in the ITC. Their recent announcement of the $20 million NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE is intended to foster a global competition and innovation in carbon technology."
