Governor Matt Mead has appointed Judge Keith Kautz as the newest member of the Wyoming Supreme Court. Kautz replaces Justice Marilyn Kite, who has been on the Supreme Court since 2000 -- serving as the first female justice and chief justice on the high court. She will retire on August 3, 2015.
The Honorable Keith Kautz has served as a District Judge for the Eighth Judicial District since 1993. Prior to his judgeship, Kautz was a partner at Sawyer, Warren and Kautz in Torrington. Judge Kautz has served the bar, judiciary and community in numerous capacities during his long career in public service. Kautz graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1975 and from the University of Wyoming College of Law in 1978.
"The appointment of a Supreme Court Justice is a decision with long-lasting impact on Wyoming. My choice was an extremely hard one to make. I thank the Judicial Nominating Commission for selecting three such outstanding candidates for me to choose from," Governor Mead said. "Judge Kautz's experience in private practice and his exemplary work on the bench for more than two decades gives me confidence that he will serve Wyoming and its citizens well on the Supreme Court."
"I am deeply honored and humbled to be able to continue my career serving the people of Wyoming," said Judge Kautz. "I'm really grateful to my family and friends for all of their support and I appreciate Governor Mead's faith in appointing me to the Wyoming Supreme Court."
