Press Release

Date: Sept. 9, 2014
Location: Cheyenne, WY

The U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) rejection of part of Wyoming's plan for visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. This decision is based on the State's likelihood of success on appeal as well as the irreparable harm to the State and utilities without a stay.
"Wyoming has a solid and effective plan. The rejection of Wyoming's plan by the EPA was wrong," Governor Matt Mead said. "This decision sends a message to the federal government and affirms Wyoming's leadership in these important areas."
The Regional Haze rule is part of the federal Clean Air Act, which gives states "wide discretion" to meet the objectives of the law. The rule relates to aesthetics and not human health.
