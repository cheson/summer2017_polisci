At the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Western Governors' Association (WGA) in Incline Village, Nevada, Wyoming Governor Matt Mead has been elected as Chairman of the WGA for the coming year. Governor Mead succeeds Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, who served as Chairman for the past year. Montana Governor Steve Bullock will serve as Vice Chairman.
"It is an honor to be chosen to lead the Western Governors' Association, and I very much look forward to serving as Chairman. I thank Governor Sandoval for his leadership this past year and for his work creating the Western Governors Drought Forum," said Governor Mead.
The Governor announced he will focus on the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as his Chairman's Initiative for 2016.
"Western states have shown leadership in species and habitat conservation and the bipartisan nature of WGA allows the Western Governors to be well-positioned to continue leading on the issue. This is a western issue and my focus as Chairman will center on habitat conservation, recovery of species and making the law better," Governor Mead said.
The June 2016 WGA Annual Meeting will take place in Jackson, Wyoming.
Established in 1984, the Western Governors' Association is an independent, non-partisan organization of Governors from 19 Western states and 3 U.S. flag islands.
