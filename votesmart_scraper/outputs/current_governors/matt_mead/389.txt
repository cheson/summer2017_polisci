Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead said today that one year after the signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), we still know little about how the law will affect the state. "There is so much uncertainty about how this law will truly affect the state," Mead said. "What we do know is that we in Wyoming are better prepared than Washington to solve our state's health care problems."
Mead noted that President Obama challenged states to come up with alternatives to the ACA. "We have accepted that challenge," Mead said. "Our legislature passed a bill this session to continue a state health care demonstration project that focuses on keeping people healthy and controlling costs."
