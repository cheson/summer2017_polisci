Location: Cheyenne, WY

Today Governor Mead signed HB0027-NRC agreement state authorization - which begins the process to give the State of Wyoming regulatory authority over uranium mine permitting. The legislation takes effect immediately.
"This legislation is the first step in cuting the bureaucracy in the licensing process and gives the state the power to regulate uranium mining. It's good for Wyoming and our economy," said Governor Mead.
The bill allows the Governor, through the Department of Environmental Quality, to negotiate and enter into a final agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the State of Wyoming to assume regulation of source materials from uranium mining and milling. It would also cover the wastes associated with the recovery, mining and milling of such source materials.
Governor Mead also sent a letter to the NRC notifying them of the state's intent to seek an agreement to regulate source material.
