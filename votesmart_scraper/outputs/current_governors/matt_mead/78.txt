Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy called Governor Mead to announce that she is signing the controversial Waters of the United States rule. Wyoming, along with a number of other states, asked McCarthy to work on concerns with the rule. Consultation with governors is required under the Clean Water Act.
"I am disappointed at the lack of consideration for the law and procedure," said Mead. "The Administrator ignored requests to consult with states and develop a rule that complies with the law and protects water."
Once it is signed the rule will go into the federal register for review and comment.
"This rule has wide ranging impact," said Mead. "I am frustrated the EPA has again stepped out of the bounds of its authority and has disregarded the role and concerns of the state."
