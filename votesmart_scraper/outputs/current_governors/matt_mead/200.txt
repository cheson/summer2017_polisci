Governor Matt Mead through the Wyoming Attorney General filed an amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear a significant Second Amendment case. Eighteen states joined Wyoming's brief, which expresses concern over a Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision that threatens Second Amendment protections.
"This decision out of New Jersey impacts the right to keep and bear arms outside of the home. So, I felt it was necessary to have the Attorney General support a petition to the Supreme Court to hear this case," Governor Mead said. "If the current decision stands states providing greater protections than New Jersey under the Second Amendment may be preempted by future federal action. That is the importance of this case."
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision is announced in the Drake v. Filko case.
