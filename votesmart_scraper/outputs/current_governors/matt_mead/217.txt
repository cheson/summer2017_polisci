Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead is seeking opinions from interested individuals and groups across the state on how Wyoming can better manage, develop, protect, conserve and restore its water. Starting next week the Governor's Office will host listening sessions around the state as the first step in developing a Wyoming Water Strategy.
The creation of a water strategy was identified as one of the most important initiatives of "Leading the Charge: Wyoming's Action Plan for Energy, Environment and Economy." The series of nine meetings will allow people in various communities and from different backgrounds to share their opinions.
"The Wyoming Energy Strategy lays out a direction for how we can best develop energy and conserve the environment. Water is our most valuable resource and that is why we need to ensure we, as a state, identify specific action items for how to be leaders in water management," Governor Mead said. "I am hopeful that these listening sessions will be widely attended and help shape this Water Strategy."
