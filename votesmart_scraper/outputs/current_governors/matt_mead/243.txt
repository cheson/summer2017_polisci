Location: Cheyenne, WY

In response to the tornado in Moore, Oklahoma, Wyoming Governor Matt Mead is joining an effort to raise money to support victims of the natural disaster and help Oklahoma rebuild. Wyoming residents Foster and Lynn Friess have committed to donate $1 million in challenging all 50 Governors to raise a matching million dollars by working with citizens in their respective states to raise $20,000 per state.
"Americans were heartbroken over the loss of lives and devastation in Moore," Governor Mead said. "My wife Carol and I appreciate the Friesses and their generosity. I ask people from across Wyoming to join us and help the citizens of Oklahoma start to rebuild their lives."
The National Christian Foundation, working with the Salvation Army and the Jewish Federation of Greater Oklahoma City, has agreed to accept donations, make distributions free of charge and deliver donations to Moore. The money will be used to restore local parks and playgrounds at the schools, and for gift cards to local stores, which people can use to purchase toiletries, bedding and kitchen utensils.
Donations should note "Governors' Match" to qualify for the Friess' match and to be free of charge. Donations can be made at www.nationalchristian.com/governorsmatch or by mail to:
