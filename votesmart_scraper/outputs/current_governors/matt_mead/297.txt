Governor Comments on Yellowstone Winter Use
Press Release

Date: Aug. 22, 2012
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead in favorable comments about a Yellowstone National Park Winter Use Plan said it "allows for market driven decisions, an opportunity for increased access and operator flexibility." Alternative 4 has been identified as the preferred option by the National Park Service. Mead concurs, while suggesting clarifications in the comment letter he sent to Daniel Wenk, Superintendent of Yellowstone National Park.
Mead's clarifying comments address support for a two-season transition period. His comments support non-commercial guided access for snowmobiles, the development of metrics and standards that address increased access, and maintaining entry to Yellowstone through the east gateway.
"Yellowstone is a magical place, particularly in the winter. Alternative 4 is the optimum choice for managing over-snow vehicle use in Yellowstone," Governor Mead said. "This gives citizens the opportunity to visit Yellowstone through a non-commercial guided snowmobile access program."
The Governor has committed to working with the National Park Service to provide for non-commercial guided snowmobile access, including identification of resources required to ensure the program's success.
