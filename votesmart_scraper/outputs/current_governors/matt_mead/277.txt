Public Statements
Senate File 104 Will Receive Thorough Review
Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: Jan. 25, 2013
Location: Cheyenne, WY

All bills, including Senate File 104, sent to the Governor's Office go through a legal review process before the Governor takes action. From the time a bill is received the Governor has three days to sign the bill, allow the bill to become law without his signature, or veto the bill.
"I am committed to a thorough and thoughtful deliberation before acting on this bill," Governor Mead said. Governor Mead has until the end of the day on Tuesday, January 29, 2013 to take action.
Many requirements in this bill would be effective upon signature. For example, the legislation would require Governor Mead to appoint an interim director for the Department of Education upon enactment. The process of selecting a permanent director requires the Wyoming State Board of Education to provide three names to the Governor. The Governor selects from those names and appoints a director by December 1, 2013. That appointment is subject to Senate confirmation.
