Governor Joins Wyoming Wildlife - the Foundation to Donate Bison Tags to Charity
Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: July 22, 2014
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead drew the names of five Wyoming non-profits that will receive a Governor's Wild Bison License tag. These organizations can sell the tags to benefit their specific missions. The tags are administered by Wyoming Wildlife -- the Foundation, which supports many other wildlife conservation groups throughout the state.
The Governor has donated 5 elk, 5 deer, 5 wild sheep, 5 moose and 5 wild bison licenses to the Wyoming Governor's Big Game License Coalition (WGBGLC) each year. These tags are marketed at sporting venues across the nation. The proceeds are used to benefit Wyoming's wildlife.
Wild bison licenses are available for the first time this year to any Wyoming 501(c)3 organization. Many groups applied to be one of five names randomly drawn for a Wild Bison License in 2014.
"The Governor's Big Game Licenses are an effective way to raise money for an important cause -- wildlife. Each year a coalition meets to review applications and choose conservation projects to fund. That is a good process," Governor Mead said. "The bison licenses offer a way to benefit groups with other missions. I am glad to give these licenses to support Wyoming."
The winning organizations are: Parents Helping Parents of Wyoming Inc., Carbon County Museum Foundation, Natrona County Child Protection Team, Laramie County Library Foundation and Dubois Volunteers Inc.
