Wyoming Will Not Object to Third Party Candidates Fundraising During Primary

The Wyoming Attorney General has filed a motion stating the State does not object to third party candidates raising money during the primary election period. A third party candidate has sued the state in federal district court over a law passed in 2009. This law prohibited candidates who are not Republicans or Democrats from raising money until the general election.
"Both the Secretary of State and I believe that, given the decision rendered in another federal court case this year, third party candidates should be able to raise money during the primary for use in the general election," Governor Mead said. "It is an important issue and one where we all benefit from clear direction."
The law in question is related to contributions to political candidates. Third-party candidates do not run in a primary, instead they are nominated by their parties. Wyoming law says those candidates cannot accept campaign contributions from anyone other than family members until the general election starts.
