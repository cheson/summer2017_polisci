Location: Cheyenne, WY

Wyoming's January unemployment rate remained at a near four-year low. The jobless rate of 4.9% is a full 3 points below the national average. This comes on the heels of other positive indicators of Wyoming's economy. Wyoming has the 7th largest growth of international exports among the states with a 17% increase in 2012. Wyoming also had the 4th highest population growth in the nation between July 2011 and July 2012.
Governor Matt Mead complimented Wyoming's business leaders and workers. "The credit goes to the entrepreneurs around the state, the business owners and those that go to work every day and drive our economy forward," Governor Mead said. "I am proud to see Wyoming as a leader in the nation when it comes to our economy."
Governor Mead said creating jobs and supporting the state's economy are critical to his administration. "We need to look to support businesses in every sector. We can continue to diversify our economy, especially by looking to attract companies like Microsoft. This should only be the beginning. I want these trends to continue."
Governor Mead noted that there are always challenges. This year's uncertainties include the drought, sequestration and federal regulations. The drought is already impacting agricultural producers, while sequestration and federal regulations have an adverse effect on numerous industries in Wyoming. "To thrive in an uncertain time shows the resilience, ingenuity, and tenacity of Wyoming people. I continue to stand up for our citizens and industries at every opportunity. The role of government should be limited, allowing the private sector to create jobs, grow businesses and innovate - we do this as a state and see the results in these economic indicators," Governor Mead said.
