Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead and First Lady Carol Mead marched in Cheyenne today as part of a ceremony to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Governor Mead spoke on the steps of the State Capitol after the march.
"If Dr. King were still alive he would have been 83 years old as of yesterday. While he is passed, in many ways his legacy lives on and grows with each passing year. Dr. King was a man who never gave up on his fundamental beliefs, he never gave up on the civil rights movement, and he never gave up as to the using of peaceful means to bring about social change," Governor Mead said.
