Location: Cheyenne, WY

By signing the Wolf Management bill Governor Matt Mead has moved Wyoming closer to managing wolves and getting them off the endangered species in the state. The bill is the culmination of Governor Mead's efforts over the past year to find a resolution to the wolf management question for Wyoming.
"I thank Wyoming's lawmakers for their work on this bill and for their support of this plan," Governor Mead said. "This has been a long journey and while we are not at journey's end yet, we are closer than we have been in years to having Wyoming control wolves."
Governor Mead also thanked all the agriculture and sportsmen groups that turned out for the bill signing. "We met with people from many diverse viewpoints and not everyone is in love with the plan, but it is grounded in science and ensures wolves stay off of the endangered species list. I believe this plan is in the best interest of Wyoming," Governor Mead said.
The next step in the process is for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to revise its wolf management and wolf hunting regulations.
