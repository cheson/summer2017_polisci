Location: Cheyenne, WY

Today Governor Matt Mead announced the launch of Wyoming Grown. The program connects individuals who grew up in Wyoming with in-demand career opportunities from employers around the state.
At www.wyominggrown.org, family and friends living in Wyoming can refer someone to the program who has left the state. Those interested in relocating can upload their résumé to the site. These individuals will receive assistance from the Department of Workforce Services's (DWS) state-wide network of employment specialists to find the right opportunity.
"We know we have great career opportunities in Wyoming," said Governor Mead. "We want to be able to keep Wyoming people in Wyoming. This might allow people to find a perfect match for employers, employees and Wyoming."
"Wyoming Grown is a tool to make it easier for people who know and love our state to return and continue their careers in Wyoming," said DWS Director Joan Evans. "I encourage people in Wyoming to refer their loved ones who have expressed an interest in relocating to the state to Wyoming Grown. With this program, we look forward to the continued strengthening of Wyoming's workforce."
Wyoming businesses can partner with Wyoming Grown by posting job openings at no charge on the state's online job-matching system, Wyoming at Work. DWS employment specialists in the state's 20 workforce centers will offer free and confidential job placement support.
Wyoming Grown program partners include Wyoming Chambers of Commerce, the University of Wyoming, the Wyoming Workforce Development Council, the Office of Tourism, the Wyoming Department of State Parks and Cultural Resources and the Wyoming Military Department.
