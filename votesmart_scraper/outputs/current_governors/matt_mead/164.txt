Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead has activated a team from the Wyoming National Guard and the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security to mobilize in Carbon County. The team will assist local officials preparing for potential flooding. They will be joined by the Smokebusters. The North Platte River in Carbon County is at action stage.
"We are getting resources on the ground ahead of potential flooding. I believe a proactive approach is best to protect people and homes," Governor Mead said. "We will use the same strategy throughout the spring and with a large snowpack, there is a high risk of flooding."
The team deployed is made up of three officials from the Office of Homeland Security and two members of the Wyoming National Guard. The Smokebusters is made up of approximately 40 individuals. The teams will assist Carbon County officials and provide information back to the State.
