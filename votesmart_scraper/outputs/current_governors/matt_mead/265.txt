Governor Matt Mead spoke to members of the Wyoming House and Senate at the close of the 2013 Legislative Session. Governor Mead said Wyoming benefits greatly by having a citizen legislature and this year lawmakers faced many tough challenges, but addressed them head on.
"As I thought about what all of you did this session and the decisions you made, I want you to go home knowing I really appreciate you addressing the tough issues," Governor Mead said. The Governor also contrasted the work of Wyoming's Legislature with the approach in Washington DC. "One of the fundamental problems with Congress is they do not make tough decisions. They think first of their own future rather than the country's future."
When revenues in Wyoming declined Governor Mead and Legislature strategically reduced spending. Wyoming also recognized the need for long-term stable funding to maintain roads. The Legislature passed a fuel tax increase to address highways. They passed important measures to strengthen education.
"While I do not always agree with the Legislature I have the utmost respect for what lawmakers do and the sacrifices they make for the State of Wyoming. We can say that their decisions are based on what is best for the next generation not the next election or what is popular," Governor Mead said.
