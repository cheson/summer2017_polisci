Governor Matt Mead has called up the Wyoming National Guard to help with flooding of the Big Horn River in Washakie County. The flooding has displaced residents from their homes.

"With people out of their homes in Washakie County because of this flooding, I have asked the National Guard to lend a hand," Governor Mead said. "We are watching the situation closely and will work with local officials in Washakie County and neighboring Big Horn County to make sure they have all the support needed."
Other agencies involved are: Wyoming Office of Homeland Security, Wyoming Department of Transportation, Department of Health, Department of Environmental Quality, State Engineer, and Department of Insurance.
The Washakie County Sheriff's Office is providing guidance about evacuations and the water treatment plant is being monitored. The Red Cross has set up a shelter for those displaced by the flooding.
