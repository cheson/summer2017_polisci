Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead has again directed the Wyoming Attorney General to join a lawsuit to protect the Second Amendment rights of citizens. The case at question is in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals and challenges New York State's restrictive gun law. Wyoming is joining 21 states in asking the Court to apply strict scrutiny on gun restrictions.
"This is another case where one state's gun laws could have a negative impact on Second Amendment rights nationally and in Wyoming. These rights are fundamental to the people and critical to our way of life," Governor Mead said. "I will continue to protect our Second Amendment rights."
The case in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals is called Nojay v Cuomo.
