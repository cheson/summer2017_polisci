Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead is hosting the second annual Wyoming Broadband Summit in Cheyenne. The event brings together leaders from the technology sector in Wyoming to discuss opportunities and challenges in the industry. This year Wyoming has seen incredible growth in broadband connectivity with access to Ethernet internet in the state's schools increasing by 700 percent.
"Thanks to a public-private partnership we have improved internet access significantly, but we have more to do. One project I support is constructing a unified network. This should improve internet speeds and reliability for Wyoming schools, which in turns creates more access points for private industry. I will ask the Legislature to fund this project, but I need the support of those in the tech sector," Governor Mead said. He also complimented the tech sector for being trail blazers. "You are innovators. You recognize that the future has not been built here and that the possibilities here are endless."
The summit is co-sponsored by the Wyoming Business Council, LINK Wyoming and the State of Wyoming. This year's summit featured discussions about the role broadband plays in economic and social impacts, data centers, mobile and wireless connections, and other sectors in Wyoming.
