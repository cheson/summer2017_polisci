Governor Mead Announces Public Meetings to Discuss Updated Energy Strategy
Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: July 27, 2015
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead has announced a series of public meetings to identify additional energy initiatives for Wyoming -- two years after the state became the first in the nation to develop a comprehensive energy strategy with the release of Leading the Charge, Wyoming's Action Plan for Energy, Environment and Economy. Since its release in 2013, more than three-fourths of the initiatives in that strategy have been completed.
"I said when I announced the energy strategy that it is designed to be regularly revised, updated and integrated into budgeting and planning," Governor Mead said. "The past two years have seen many successes and we want to build on them. The purpose of these meetings is to review existing initiatives, to identify additional initiatives in order to support energy development, balanced with sound environmental stewardship."
The meetings are open to the public. Anyone interested is encouraged to come and discuss ideas that should be incorporated into the updated strategy. A list of meeting dates and locations is set out below. Public comments will be accepted at the meetings and can also be sent to the Governor's office via email at: energy.strategy@wyo.gov
