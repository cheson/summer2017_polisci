Governor Asks AG to Intervene in Uranium Lawsuit
Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead instructed the Wyoming Attorney General to file a motion to intervene in the lawsuit over in-situ uranium mining at the Lost Creek Mine. The motion was filed this week in U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming. An environmental group seeks to shut the project down over concerns to wildlife and groundwater. Governor Mead is seeking to intervene to protect Wyoming's interests in the project.
"Wyoming has put a lot of resources into making sure this mine operates in a safe and responsible manner," Governor Mead said. "This project provides energy for the nation, jobs for Wyoming and revenue to local, state and federal governments."
The Lost Creek Mine is in Sweetwater County and the project area includes a section of state land. Wyoming estimates it will receive over $19 million in severance tax revenue and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) estimates 160 jobs would result.
"Work on permitting this project started over five years ago and I believe state agencies and Ur-Energy have done sound work to protect Wyoming's water and wildlife. This includes mitigating impacts to sage-grouse. Ur-Energy, as a company, committed to do things right," Governor Mead said. He has determined that the project complies with the Greater Sage-Grouse Core Area Protection Executive Order.
Wyoming has the most uranium reserves in the nation.
