Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

The Governor's Council on Impaired Driving announces the launch of the Drive Sober Wyoming smart phone app. This app gives those who have had too much to drink another way to find a ride home.
The "Drive Sober Wyoming" app helps users phone or text a friend for a ride. The text message sends a map link with the approximate user location. The app user designates friends to contact with one tap of the icon. Taxi services are listed by town and can be contacted from a drop down menu.
The Laws, Penalties and Cost of a DUI icon quickly lets the app user know the risk of driving drunk including steep monetary costs, the loss of driving privileges and jail. The app also allows anyone to report an impaired driver on the road to the Highway Patrol.
"I applaud the Wyoming Governor's Council on Impaired Driving. This is a smart way to prevent drunk driving and to improve safety. We want people to make good choices and this makes that easier," Governor Mead said.
Drive Sober Wyoming can be downloaded from your smart phone or by scanning the QR code. The QR code can be found on www.drivesoberwy.com, on posters and drink coasters coming soon to all Wyoming locations with a state liquor license. Posters are available to the public and can be requested through the Governor's Council on Impaired Driving website at www.wygcid.org.
