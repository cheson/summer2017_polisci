Governor Mead Continues to Push for Government Efficiency with First Bill Signing of 2012
Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: March 5, 2012
Location: Cheyenne, WY

This afternoon Governor Matt Mead signed the first bill of the 2012 legislative session. The new law finalizes the consolidation of two governmental agencies, a process which began when Governor Mead took office. House Bill 8 moves to improve consolidation of what used to be the Department of Employment inside the Department of Workforce Services.
"The streamlining of these two agencies helps improve the delivery of services to the public and makes government more efficient," Governor Mead said. "I appreciate all the work of our lawmakers in helping make this possible."
The new law changes language in state statutes to reflect the merger of the two agencies and provides for information sharing within the two formerly separate entities. This sharing was previously restricted by law.
