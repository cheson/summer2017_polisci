Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead signed a joint resolution today that recognizes the importance of the relationship between Taiwan and the State of Wyoming. The Resolution supports Taiwan's participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In October, Governor Mead led a trade mission to Taiwan, an island with 23 million citizens, promoting Wyoming's tourism, agriculture and energy industries.
"We are putting new emphasis on developing international trade -- new markets for Wyoming industries. Taiwan is a great match for our leading industries," Governor Mead said. "There is demand in Taiwan for American beef and new opportunities for tourism given the inclusion of Taiwan in the visa waiver program. In addition, Taiwanese utilities are interested in Wyoming coal and natural gas. This is a relationship to build upon."
