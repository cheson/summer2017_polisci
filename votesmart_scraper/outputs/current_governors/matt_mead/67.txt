Governor Mead Finalizes Consistency Review of BLM and Forest Service Plans
Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: July 30, 2015
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead submitted his comments, through the Governor's consistency review, concerning land use revisions proposed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The BLM and USFS land use plans undergoing amendments or revisions cover most federal lands in the state and are expected to guide management on those lands for 20 or more years. These plans include the Wyoming Greater Sage-Grouse Amendment (commonly referred to as "the 9 Plan"), Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Amendment, and Bighorn Basin and Buffalo Resource Management Plan Revisions.
The plans include management actions to strengthen Greater sage-grouse protections as the federal government considers a potential listing for the grouse under the Endangered Species Act. Governor Mead's comments are designed to address inconsistencies with Wyoming's Greater sage-grouse Core Area Protection strategy contained in Executive Order 2015-4. The governor also made several recommendations in support of maintaining multiple-use and sustained resource management on BLM and USFS managed lands.
The governor's Executive Order, letter to the BLM and the USFS and comments common to all plans are attached and also available on his website http://governor.wyo.gov/documents/executive-orders. Also available on the website are the governor's comments on each forest plan as well as letters from local governments and other entities.
