In the wake of a number of mass shootings last year, Governor Matt Mead requested active shooter training be made available to all State of Wyoming employees. The Wyoming Highway Patrol, working with The Wyoming Office of Homeland Security (OHS) offered the training on January 11-12 at the Herschler Building in Cheyenne.
"The safety of state employees is a big concern for me as governor," said Governor Mead. "This training teaches employees how to react-- so they have this knowledge if they are faced with an active-shooter situation."
