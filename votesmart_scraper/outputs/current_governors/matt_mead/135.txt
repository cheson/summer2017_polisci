Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge today to support finding a cure and treatments for ALS. Dr. Paul Cox from the Institute for Ethnomedicine based in Jackson, Wyoming had issued the challenge and Governor Mead readily accepted it.
"I am proud to support ALS research across the globe. My wife Carol and I will make a donation to further this effort," Governor Mead said. "Wyoming is well known for its scenery, but few know that the state is home to leading research into ALS and Alzheimer's Disease. I thank Dr. Cox and his colleagues for their work and for raising awareness about this campaign to find treatments and a cure for ALS."
Governor Mead did the Ice Bucket Challenge with the help of his family. The video is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUFQzV7_iA Governor Mead directed his challenge to Governor Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota and Governor Steve Bullock of Montana.
