Governor Matt Mead and First Lady Carol Mead are again joining the national campaign to raise awareness about Down Syndrome cognitive research. To kick off the campaign the Governor's residence will be illuminated in blue light on the evening of Thursday, March 21, 2013.
"Tangible progress is being made in Down Syndrome research thanks, in part, to the Light the Way campaign," First Lady Carol Mead said. "Raising awareness on the issue by being a part of this campaign is important to the Governor and me, and we are happy to be involved again this year."
The Light the Way campaign was first launched on World Down Syndrome Day, March 21, 2011. The campaign supports the Research Down Syndrome organization's efforts to educate, increase awareness, and raise funds for Down Syndrome cognitive research.
New developments in the area bring the promise of biomedical therapies to improve memory, learning and communication, helping individuals with Down Syndrome live healthier, more active lives.
Down Syndrome, the most common chromosomal anomaly in humans, is the result of having 47 chromosomes instead of 46. The extra genetic material is typically associated with delays in physical and intellectual development ranging from mild to moderate in nature.
An estimated three million people worldwide have Down Syndrome, including approximately 400,000 in the United States. Life expectancy for people with Down Syndrome has more than doubled in the past twenty-five years and now averages 55 to 60 years.
