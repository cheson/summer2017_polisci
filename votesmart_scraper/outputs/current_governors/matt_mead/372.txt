Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead met with Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, and the Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Dan Ashe, today in Cheyenne. The Governor discussed wolf management with the two federal officials. Afterward Governor Mead said the meeting was a move towards a solution that works for Wyoming, "I am pleased to report that we agree in principle on major issues and have worked on details that have been stumbling blocks to an approved Wyoming plan."
Since taking office Governor Mead has actively worked on a plan to return management of wolves to Wyoming and remove the species from the Endangered Species List. Any accepted plan would need approval of the State Legislature. Governor Mead firmly advocates that any deal also must have Congressional consent as well. Today, Governor Mead thanked the Congressional delegation for its assistance in moving this process forward.
"I feel we are much closer to an agreement than we have been since I took office," Governor Mead said. Secretary Salazar said today that because of the great leadership of Governor Mead and his staff that Wyoming will soon have a plan he will approve.
