Governor Delays State Office Building Construction Planning
Statement

Date: May 30, 2012
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead will delay spending state money for planning and design of a proposed new office building. The Legislature had allocated $4.4 million dollars for the planning of a new state office building. Governor Mead has discretion about whether or not to spend the money now.
"We are currently reviewing budget cuts that will have an impact across state government," Governor Mead said. "This is not the time to spend money on a large construction project; it is the time for fiscal restraint. I also recognize that doing the planning now might not be prudent because the plans could become outdated if the Legislature and other elected officials agree with me and we hold off construction for several years."
