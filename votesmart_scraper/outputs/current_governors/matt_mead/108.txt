The Wyoming Business Council has received the Top 5 Award for Excellence in data center recruiting from Expansion Solutions, a national site selection magazine. This is the third consecutive year Wyoming has been recognized.
"One of my priorities has been to diversify Wyoming's economy. Key to achieving this goal is recruitment of technology industries. This award three years running shows great progress," Governor Mead said. "We have cultivated a business climate that works well for technology businesses big and small. Companies like Microsoft and Green House Data have benefited from what Wyoming has to offer."
The award recognizes economic development organizations that excel in efforts to recruit and retain data centers. Expansion Solutions uses a scoring system from 1 to 10. Wyoming scored all 10s in the data center category.
"Affordable energy, cool climate with low humidity, redundant fiber optics, business friendly policies, the number of announcements and the total investment for data center operations expanding and locating to the state has earned Wyoming a well-deserved award as a digital leader," said Kimberly Merkel, national account director for Expansion Solutions.
The zero-carbon, waste-to-fuel-cell-powered Microsoft Data Plant at the Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility southeast of Cheyenne contributed to Wyoming earning the award.
Wyoming Business Council CEO Shawn Reese said, "Wyoming can now add biogas fuel cell power to its technology and energy portfolios. This is the first facility of its kind in the world. It is one more reason why Wyoming is a place for technology and technological advancements."
