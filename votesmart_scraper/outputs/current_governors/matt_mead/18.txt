Location: Cheyenne, WY

Today Governor Matt Mead announced a new initiative to promote the outdoor recreational industry in Wyoming. The Department of State Parks and Cultural Resources will work with private and public stakeholders to develop recommendations to grow Wyoming's strong outdoor recreation economy. Expanding outdoor recreation was suggested by the Governor's 2015 Task Force on Forests.
"Wyoming has world-class opportunities for hunting, fishing, photography and other outdoor recreation. Many of our fondest memories are with friends and family in the outdoors," said Governor Mead. "The Task Force will build on the considerable work already done and offer ideas to improve outdoor recreation opportunities, marketing and business recruitment."
Wyoming has seen its outdoor business sector grow in recent years. A 2012 Outdoor Industry Association report found that outdoor recreation in Wyoming generates approximately $4.5 billion annually in consumer spending, $1.4 billion in wages and salaries, $300 million in state and local tax revenue and creates 50,000 jobs. The Governor has championed Wyoming's outdoor economy since taking office in 2011. The fourth Cowboy Tough Adventure Race was held in July and in 2017 Wyoming will host the World Adventure Race championship. This August the Governor announced three shooting sports inititiatives. Representatives from Wyoming firearms and outdoor equipment companies, along with national media, joined Governor Mead for the first "Wyoming Day at the Range."
"There is no better place for outdoor-related businesses than Wyoming," continued Governor Mead. "Our business climate, workforce, cost of living and quality of life make Wyoming a great option for new and existing businesses."
