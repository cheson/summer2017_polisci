Governor Matt Mead's Council on Impaired Driving released a new message intended to reduce impaired driving. This depicts a family struck by a drunk driver. The new message is available online at http://youtu.be/Dju6NFrbzT0.
"This ad is strong and depicts the senseless loss of lives in a way that strikes the heart. We need a culture where no one drives impaired," Governor Mead said.
The Council has also continued the "Welcome to the DUI Life" campaign. These ads will appear in newspapers and on billboards. The Governor established the Council on Impaired Driving in 2011.
In 2013, 31 highway fatalities involved impaired drivers. That was the lowest number in several decades. So far in 2014 26 highway fatalities have been alcohol related.
