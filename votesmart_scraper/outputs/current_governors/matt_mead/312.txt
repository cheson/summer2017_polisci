The State of Wyoming has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its challenge of the Clinton Administration's Roadless Rule. Wyoming filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari today. The petition argues that the U.S. Forest Service exceeded the limit of its authority when it created the Roadless Rule by usurping a power reserved to Congress.
Governor Matt Mead directed the Attorney General to appeal to the Supreme Court after the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the opinion of U.S. District Judge Clarence Brimmer. "I believe that Judge Brimmer provided a well-reasoned opinion, which stated that the Forest Service circumvented Congress with the Roadless Rule, and I hope that opinion will be reinstated by the Supreme Court," Governor Mead said.
The Roadless Rule affects over 3 million acres of National Forest lands in Wyoming. "This has real impacts for multiple use in Wyoming and the rule was developed without meaningful input from any state, county or town. This rule affects our economy and our ability to fight the bark beetle epidemic," Governor Mead said.
