Governor Matt Mead said he is encouraged that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is set to turn management of wolves over to Wyoming. The Service announced it will publish a proposed delisting rule for wolves tomorrow. This means that within a year, with wolves off of the Endangered Species List, the State would be responsible for managing wolves.
"This is an important step for Wyoming," Governor Mead said. "The Department of Interior is following through on its commitment to turn over wolf management to Wyoming, which is where it belongs. I am encouraged, but there are still several more steps to go. I do want to thank Secretary Salazar, Director Ashe and our Congressional Delegation for all of their work to get us to this point and I look forward to working with the Wyoming Legislature to keep us moving towards having control of a species that has such a significant impact on the state."
