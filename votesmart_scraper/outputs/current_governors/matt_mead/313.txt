Governor Mead's Statement on BLM's Draft Rule for Hydraulic Fracturing
"Wyoming is well ahead of the BLM on regulating hydraulic fracturing. We were the first state to require disclosure of materials used in the process, we require disclosure before the hydraulic fracturing occurs and this requirement is for all land in Wyoming. Proven leadership and effective regulation at the state level cause me to question the need and purpose of federal regulation, especially when it is less effective and in many respects duplicative."
