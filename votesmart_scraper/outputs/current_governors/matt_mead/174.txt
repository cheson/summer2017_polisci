Governor Matt Mead will address the future of Wyoming's coal industry at a meeting of the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority on May 14th. Updates on carbon capture innovations, coal regulations, the global coal outlook and coal exports will be other topics at the meeting.
"We in Wyoming are supporting advancements in coal technology. By innovating at the University of Wyoming, with private companies and with international partners we are responding to market pressures and protecting this abundant resource and the jobs associated with coal mining and power production," Governor Mead said. "I appreciate the opportunity to be part of the discussion with the Infrastructure Authority."
The conference will take place in Cheyenne at Little America May 14-15. Governor Mead will speak at 12:30 on the 14th. Electric transmission projects important to Wyoming and wind power production will also be discussed at the conference.
"Wyoming truly is an all-of-the-above energy state and these discussions are reflective of the work being done to provide affordable power to the entire nation now and in the future," Governor Mead said.
"As we fulfill our mission of diversifying and expanding the economy in Wyoming we work closely with Governor Mead and Legislators on initiatives like coal exports and the integrated test center. That center will be used to explore new commercial uses for carbon from power production. I invite others to come and listen in on the discussion at our conference," Loyd Drain, Executive Director of the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority said.
