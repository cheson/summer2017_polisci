Public Statements
Governor and Legislature Further Streamline State Government
Statement
By: Matt Mead
Date: March 8, 2012
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead has signed a bill into law, which will consolidate state government's common Information Technology services and staff in one agency. Previously the state had individuals assigned to each agency to handle things like email. With the consolidation fewer people will be able to provide better service to the public.
"We are already seeing some savings as services are consolidated," Governor Mead said. When Wyoming switched to use Google Apps last year, all state employees went on the same email server. Before, Wyoming had more than 13 different servers. Just this week Colorado followed Wyoming's lead and switched to Google. "This new law and the move to Google have improved the security for our data and Information Technology," Governor Mead said.
This afternoon Governor Mead also signed House Bill 89, which enhances the Wyoming OSHA program to support companies in their efforts to improve workplace safety. "This new law and the work already underway in the Department of Workforce Services are great steps toward making Wyoming workplaces safer," Governor Mead said.
