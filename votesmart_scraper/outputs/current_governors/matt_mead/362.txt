Governor Matt Mead said the State of Wyoming has lost one of its great leaders with the passing of Senator Malcolm Wallop. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976 and left office in 1995.
"My wife Carol and I are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Senator Wallop. With his brilliance and determination he fiercely defended Wyoming values; advocating for our military, for smaller government and for individual freedoms. Senator Wallop provided leadership for Wyoming and America during his three terms as Senator and every day since. He fought for lower taxes, multiple-use of public lands and developing America's energy resources. Senator Wallop will be greatly missed as a leader and as a friend."
