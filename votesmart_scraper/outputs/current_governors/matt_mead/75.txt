Governor Matt Mead issued an Executive Order today declaring a State of Emergency in response to flooding in Wyoming. The Order directs the Office of Homeland Security and the Wyoming Army National Guard to take all necessary steps to mobilize their resources to aid citizens in affected areas.
"I am very concerned about the weather-related damage across Wyoming and the toll it is taking on our citizens and communities," said Governor Mead. "Mudslides have closed some roads in Sunlight Basin near Cody, Wind River Canyon and Togwotee Pass and flooding has caused damage in Niobrara, Johnson and other counties. We are doing all we can to be at the ready to help city and county authorities."
Governor Mead visited Lusk on Thursday, June 4th to view the damage there firsthand. He also met with local and state emergency officials and answered questions from citizens at a town hall meeting.
