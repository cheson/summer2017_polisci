Wyoming Governor Matt Mead has pledged his support to firefighting efforts in Colorado. The fires in Colorado have been extremely destructive, causing a loss of lives and hundreds of burned homes.
"I spoke with Governor Hickenlooper this morning and let him know that our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Colorado and if there is any way Wyoming can help we are ready to help. This is a trying time for Colorado. We have resources that can engage in the fight against these fires and we want to lend our support," Governor Mead said.
Governor Hickenlooper is expected to transmit a formal written request for specific firefighting resources from Wyoming today. Acting Governor Max Maxfield will coordinate with Governor Mead, who is in Canada on a trade mission, to deploy equipment and personnel as soon as possible.
