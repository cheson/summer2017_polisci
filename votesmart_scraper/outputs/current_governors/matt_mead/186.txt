Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead traveled the state today to thank veterans for their service, and he welcomed home veterans who did not receive a proper reception after serving. This is the fourth annual celebration of "Wyoming Veterans Welcome Home Day." The day of welcoming was added to state law in 2011 during the 61st legislative session. The Wyoming Veterans Commission and the Wyoming National Guard helps to commemorate the occasion.
Ceremonies took place in Torrington, Buffalo and Jackson. Wyoming veterans, including those from the Korean War, Vietnam War, and other veterans who were not properly recognized upon their return home, attended. Military personnel, surviving spouses of veterans and family members also participated.
"We all have a responsibility to thank those who stepped forward and served. Today is our chance to go around the state and say welcome home. But, every day should be Welcome Home Day. We should never miss an opportunity to thank a veteran," Governor Mead said.
This year's ceremonies featured remarks by Governor Matt Mead, Major General Luke Reiner, the Adjutant General of Wyoming, and Veterans Commission Chairman Al Ellefson of Hulett and Vice Chair Lee Alley, a Distinguished Service Cross recipient of the Vietnam War. Local officials and veterans from the community also spoke. In the past, "Wyoming Veterans Welcome Home Day" events have taken place in Casper, Cheyenne, Wheatland, Gillette, Worland, Laramie, Sheridan, Riverton, Afton, Rock Springs and Cody.
