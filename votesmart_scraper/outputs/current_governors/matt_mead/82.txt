Senate File 12 Myth Buster - Trespassing to Collect Data
Statement

There has been some misinformation circulating about Senate File 12-Trespassing to collect data - which I signed into law on March 5, 2015. The legislation is aimed at protecting and strengthening private property rights and has nothing to do with animals or animal cruelty. It is important to note that this bill does not prevent the legal collection of data or remove protections for the safety of animals.
