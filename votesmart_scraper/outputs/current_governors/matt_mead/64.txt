Governor Mead: Federal Clean Power Plan Flawed and Unworkable
Statement

Governor Matt Mead reiterated his position that the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan is wrong for Wyoming. The final rule unveiled by the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a 44% carbon emission reduction requirement on Wyoming -- more than doubling the 19% reduction in the agency's proposed rule.
"I have argued that this rule is scientifically and legally flawed from the very beginning of the process," said Governor Mead. "Today, Wyoming joined 15 other states in asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to issue an emergency stay of deadlines imposed by the Plan while the courts decide its legality. We anticipate the best outcome from this case. However, just as we explored all possibilities when the recent Obamacare litigation was pending, I have asked my staff and state agencies to do the same here."
