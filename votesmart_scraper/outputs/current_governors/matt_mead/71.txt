Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: July 8, 2015
Location: Cheyenne, WY

President Obama approved Governor Matt Mead's request for a Presidential Disaster Declaration for Individual Disaster Assistance. The Declaration is a result of flood damage that occurred in Johnson and Niobrara Counties from May 24 -- June 6, 2015.
Due to severe weather-related events, significant losses - 14 homes destroyed and more than 100 homes harmed and road and bridge damage - occurred.
The Disaster Declaration triggers federal financial assistance or direct services to homeowners and small businesses.
"Those affected by the flooding need assistance and I thank the President for approving my request," Governor Mead said. "This flood showed the indomitable spirit of the people in these communities and the many who responded to help. I will continue to work with Homeland Security and do whatever is necessary to help them recover."
The Wyoming Office of Homeland Security is working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), affected counties and communities to ensure individuals and businesses get registered for federal assistance and to assist as needed.
