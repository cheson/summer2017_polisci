Governor's Initiative to Require Baseline Water Testing Moves to Formal Comment Period
Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead thanked all of the individuals, companies and groups that provided input on Wyoming's baseline water testing rule. The Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission published the draft rule today and will take public comments until October 7. The rule requires oil and gas operators to test existing water sources before and after drilling an oil or gas well.
"This proposal to require baseline water testing strikes the right balance for Wyoming. It supports a robust energy sector and it enhances our protection of groundwater - an important natural resource," Governor Mead said. "This required people from industry, environmental groups and landowners to work together. I thank them and believe we have come up with a plan that will be a model policy."
Landowners must give consent for operators to sample the permitted or adjudicated water sources. These sources include domestic, stock, industrial, irrigation, municipal or other permitted uses of water. The sampling would occur before a well is drilled and after production begins. Those results would not create a presumption of or against liability or fault. Liability is determined by an investigation and or a court of law.
A public meeting on the rule will take place on October 15th in Casper.
