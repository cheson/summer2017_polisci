Statement

Governor Matt Mead applauds the U.S. Department of Interior for its decision to delist wolves in Wyoming. This action will return management of wolves to the State of Wyoming. Wolves are slated to come off the endangered species list, officially, on October 1, 2012.
"Today's announcement represents a significant achievement for the State of Wyoming," Governor Mead said. "A remarkable effort was made by many in our state, by Secretary Ken Salazar and by his team to reach this milestone. The work and support of the State Legislature, the Congressional Delegation, ranchers, outfitters and guides, and sportsmen were instrumental in the delisting of wolves in Wyoming and I extend my appreciation."
Governor Mead and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar worked out an agreement to remove wolves from the endangered species list last year. Wolf numbers in Wyoming reached federal delisting criteria in 2002. "The wolf population in Wyoming is recovered, and it is appropriate that the responsibility for wolf management be returned to the state," Governor Mead said. "I commend Secretary Salazar and Director Dan Ashe for their commitment to this process and for helping the State achieve wolf delisting in Wyoming."
Wyoming's wolf management plan was reviewed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and by independent wolf scientists twice. "I am proud of Wyoming's Wolf Management Plan. I am confident Wyoming's plan will provide a sustainable wolf population in Northwest Wyoming that will contribute substantially to the wolf population in the Northern Rocky Mountains. I have every expectation that Wyoming will do an excellent job managing wolves and the species will not be relisted," Governor Mead said.
