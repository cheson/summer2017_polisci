The unemployment rate in Wyoming for February is 4.2%. That is the state's lowest jobless rate since 2008 and places Wyoming sixth in the nation. Additionally, Wyoming had the 7th highest ranking for personal income according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released at the end of March. Governor Matt Mead said these latest indicators show the strength of Wyoming, and he believes the economy will continue to expand.
"We saw growth in personal income in 2013 across the economy -- in mining, construction, agriculture, transportation and tourism. That is encouraging and is a sign that the private sector in Wyoming is healthy," Governor Mead said. "We continue to strive to support our top three industries - energy, tourism and agriculture - and our small businesses, while we also look to diversify with new manufacturing and technology businesses."
Wyoming's per capita personal income for 2013 was $50,924. On April 2, the Tax Foundation, which is a nonpartisan tax policy research group, found that Wyoming residents enjoyed the lowest state and local tax burden in the country. This is on the heels of an analysis showing Wyoming is the second best run state in the nation.
"All of these rankings are nice to receive, but most important to me is that they translate to jobs and good wages for the people of Wyoming and the third lowest poverty rate in the country," Governor Mead said.
