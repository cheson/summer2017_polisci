Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead will join U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and Director Dan Ashe of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on October 15th in Pinedale to applaud local ranchers who completed nine Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances (CCAA) for the protection of the Greater Sage Grouse in Wyoming.
"I am proud to celebrate this occasion. Wyoming ranchers have been strong advocates for effective land and wildlife stewardship and have worked cooperatively with the USFWS to reach this milestone," Governor Mead said.
CCAA's are agreements between the USFWS and public or private landowners to identify threats to candidate species and design conservation plans to reduce or eliminate those threats. These agreements not only benefit the sage grouse and other species that live on sagebrush steppe rangelands, but ranchers benefit by the assurances given to them by the USFWS that they can continue ranching operations even if the species is eventually listed as endangered or threatened.
The celebration will be held at 11:00 am at Trappers' Point, 1-5 E. Green River Road in Pinedale.
