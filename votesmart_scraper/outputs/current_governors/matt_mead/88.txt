Wyoming Governor Matt Mead serves as Vice Chair of the Natural Resources Committee of the National Governors Associations (NGA). This Committee will host a televised discussion between the nation's governors and U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy during the NGA Winter Meeting in Washington, D.C.
The discussion will feature a question and answer session between governors and the Administrator on proposed federal actions related to energy and water.
"EPA's proposed rules for power plants and Waters of the U.S. show little regard for the states who must implement these proposals and for others affected by them," Governor Mead said. "As states we are best positioned to make decisions about our natural resources. Federal agencies should not be proposing over-the-top rules like these.
The event will be take place Sunday, February 22nd, at 1:00 p.m. MST on C-Span.
