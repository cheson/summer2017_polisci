Governor Matt Mead has extended the Executive Order creating emergency rules for the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WyDOT). This Order is specific to drivers of propane delivery trucks working inside of Wyoming and it allows them to make extra deliveries to heat homes and businesses.
"The extreme cold temperatures have continued and demand for propane, a fuel many people here use to heat their homes, remains high. We need to extend the emergency rules to help meet that demand for the safety of Wyoming residents," Governor Mead said. "We continue to stay in touch with the companies involved stressing the importance of safety for both drivers and the general public."
The Executive Order is in effect for an additional five days until midnight on December 16, 2013.
