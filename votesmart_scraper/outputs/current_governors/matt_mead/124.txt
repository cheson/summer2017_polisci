National Governors Association Chair Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Vice Chair Governor Gary Herbert of Utah have appointed Governor Matt Mead as vice chair of the National Governors Association (NGA) Natural Resources Committee.
The Natural Resources Committee oversees issues related to agriculture, energy, the environment and natural resources. The committee ensures that the Governors' views are represented to the federal government.
"Governors are uniquely positioned to influence federal legislation and regulations that affect national and state natural resources policies. I look forward to working with other Governors in making a positive difference on issues that are critical to Wyoming and the country," Governor Mead said.
Governor Mead's term as vice chair is for one year from 2014 to 2015. California Governor Jerry Brown will serve as the committee chair.
Founded in 1908, NGA is the bipartisan organization of the nation's Governors. Through NGA, Governors share best practices, speak with a collective voice on national policy and develop innovative solutions that improve state government and support the principles of federalism.
