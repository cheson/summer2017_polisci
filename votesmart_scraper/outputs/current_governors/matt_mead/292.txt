Governor Mead's Statement on USGS Report
Statement

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead issued the following statement about the U.S. Geological Survey's data report. This report refers to water samples taken from deep monitoring wells outside of the town of Pavillion. The samples were taken as part of a collaboration between the State of Wyoming, the U.S.G.S., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Wyoming Tribes. The following is Governor Mead's statement:
"I have said that we will be guided by science in the way we react to the investigation of impacts on water outside of Pavillion. The collaborative effort used to gather this data allowed Wyoming experts to have a say about sampling methodology and testing procedures. I feel that the process used to acquire this data was an improvement on the process used for the draft EPA report last December.
"I thank our partners for working together with Wyoming. We are now waiting as analysis of this data is done. It should help inform the peer review process."
