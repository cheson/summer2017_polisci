Governor Matt Mead announced Saturday that the Kauffman Index -- a report on entrepreneurial activity throughout the United States -- ranked Wyoming second in entrepreneurial startup activity. The governor was attending the Wyoming Global Tech Summit in Jackson where he was leading discussions on the state's growing tech sector.
"The information in the report confirms that Wyoming is a great place to start a business," said Governor Mead. "Our tax and regulatory structure are some of the best in the nation. I will continue to do all I can to promote Wyoming as a world-class center for innovation, research, commercialization and business development."
Wyoming improved its ranking in the index four spots from 2014. Governor Mead mentioned the Wyoming Business Technology Center with locations in Laramie, Casper and Sheridan, the "e2e Wyoming" entrepreneurial network, and the Unified Network which increased internet connectivity around the state, as examples of initiatives aimed at helping new businesses.
"I am excited about the entrepreneurial spirit we see around the state and from the University of Wyoming," continued Governor Mead. "The message is clear: Wyoming's innovators are solving the problems of the world. They are growing and diversifying our economy."
