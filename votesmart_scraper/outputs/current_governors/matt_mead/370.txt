Location: Cheyenne, WY

n comments sent to the National Park Service, Governor Matt Mead, advocated for a winter-use plan that allows more people to visit Yellowstone National Park during the winter months. The Governor's comments push for more visits by snowmobile per day than proposed by the Park Service and for allowance of non-commercial snowmobiling.
In the letter to the Superintendent of Yellowstone, Daniel Wenk, Governor Mead wrote, "I have been vocal and direct about my position -- I want to see as much reasonable use of Yellowstone as possible. Access to the Park is important to Wyoming's economy and especially to the communities that support and surround it. I also view higher visitation as necessary for Yellowstone and the National Park Service (NPS). People must have the chance to experience the Park -- summer and winter -- for the NPS to fulfill its mission of providing opportunities for enjoyment and to create an affinity for this special place, which benefits all National Parks into the future."
