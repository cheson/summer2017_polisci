Just before noon today WYDOT plows met a Yellowstone National Park road crew. The WYDOT team has finished its part in opening the East Entrance of Yellowstone. Now Park Service plows will take over and the East Gate to Yellowstone will open on schedule, May 3rd, barring unforeseen weather.
Plowing was paid for by the Cody Country Chamber of Commerce, the City of Cody, Park County and many private donors. WYDOT finished early and under budget according to the Department of Transportation. WYDOT is also working to open the South Entrance to the Park from Jackson by May 10th.
"When we thought the federal sequestration was going to shut the public out of Yellowstone and slow down tourism in our gateway communities Wyoming came together and solved the problem," Governor Mead said. "The two crews have had great support in Park and Teton Counties. I thank them and everyone in Cody and Jackson who have rallied to make it possible for Wyoming to welcome the world to America's first national park again this spring."
Governor Mead also thanked Yellowstone officials for being willing to work with Wyoming and the gateway communities to accomplish this task.
