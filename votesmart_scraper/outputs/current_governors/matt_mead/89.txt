My views on the asset forfeiture bill are set forth in my veto letter to the Senate President. That said, it is appropriate to scrutinize existing law, which my veto leaves intact, and there has been much scrutiny, as there should be - by legislators, interested groups, and the public. An executive branch official's impugning of others for a position taken on the bill is wrong - dead wrong, and the offending remarks should be removed from the public domain.They certainly do not reflect my views.
