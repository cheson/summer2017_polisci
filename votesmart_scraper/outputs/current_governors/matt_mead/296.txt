Governor Matt Mead announced today that he has appointed the Honorable Michael K. Davis as the newest member of the Wyoming Supreme Court. Davis replaces the Honorable Michael Golden who retired after 24 years on the Supreme Court.
"The appointment of a Supreme Court Justice is a momentous event for any governor because it has lasting effects on our state and its law. I received three well-qualified nominees and had a very tough decision. Judge Davis has significant private practice experience, a proven tenure on the bench, and strong writing skills. I believe he is an excellent choice to join the highest court in the state," Governor Mead said.
The Judicial Nominating Commission presented three nominees to Governor Mead. The Commission is chaired by Wyoming Supreme Court Chief Justice Marilyn Kite. Other members are: Robert Shively, Bruce Salzburg, Jeremy Michaels, Richard Bridger, Shelly Christianson and Gina Monk.
"I am deeply honored by the trust and confidence Governor Mead and the Judicial Nominating Commission have shown in me. I will work hard on the Supreme Court to serve the people of our great State well," Judge Davis said.
The Honorable Michael K. Davis was born in Kansas. He received his J.D. from the University of Wyoming. He was an associate and then a partner at the Yonkee and Toner law firm in Sheridan from 1980 until 2008, when he became a district judge in the First Judicial District. Judge Davis is an Army veteran and has been active in the Wyoming State Bar and in activities promoting the improvement of trial advocacy in the bar. He is a judicial fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers.
