Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: Nov. 6, 2013
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead has asked a group of stakeholders to develop recommendations on how Wyoming can best improve the health of its forests. The Wyoming Governor's Task Force on Forest Health is made up of representatives of federal, state and local government, industry, conservation groups, and forest users. Governor Mead has asked for Task Force recommendations by the fall of 2014.
"The health of our forests is critical to local economies in Wyoming as well as to wildlife the forests support. The well-being of Wyoming's forests requires commitment and, I believe, some new ideas," Governor Mead said.
The Co-Chairs of the Task Force are Lisa McGee, the National Parks and Forests Program Director for the Wyoming Outdoor Council and Jim Neiman, Vice President and CEO of Neiman Industries. The general charge for the Task Force is to develop strategies, recommendations and measurable actions that the State of Wyoming in conjunction with federal and private partners can implement. Senator Ogden Driskill and Representative Jerry Paxton will be key leaders on the Task Force.
"I am interested in seeing all Task Force recommendations, including specific recommendations related to wildfire prevention and mitigation and market innovation," Governor Mead said. The first Task Force meeting will take place by the end of 2013 and the meetings are open to the public.
