Governor Matt Mead issued the following statement after the State Senate rejected an amendment to the budget bill that would have expanded Medicaid:
"The Medicaid expansion amendment to the budget failed. We will not provide health care coverage for 20,000 Wyoming citizens. Wyoming's hospitals continue to struggle with the burden of uncompensated care. Millions of federal tax dollars paid by Wyoming people will continue to flow to other states.
I am disappointed. Support for Medicaid expansion in Wyoming is strong and continues to grow.
I appreciate the Wyoming employers, businesses and associations who have stepped forward in support of Medicaid expansion. I believe it is the right way to go. Their voices will continue to be important in the months ahead."
