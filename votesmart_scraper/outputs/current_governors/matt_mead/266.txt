Following the National Governors Association (NGA) Winter Meeting, the Council of Governors (CoG) finalized a consultative process with the Department of Defense (DoD) to maintain an ongoing dialogue that will ensure governors' priorities are better incorporated into the budget process in future years.
"This is a remarkable achievement for all of us. NGA and the Council have worked tirelessly on this issue for several months, and this resolution allows all governors to be a part of the process," said CoG co-chair Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. "As commanders-in-chief of the National Guard, it is critical that our voices are heard as part of this process. This agreement will help us avoid future unannounced spending changes that affect the safety and security of our citizens."
Similar to what governors and DoD were able to achieve on the Dual Status Command agreement to coordinate state and federal military forces during an emergency, this budget consultative process is part of on-going collective efforts to improve how states and DoD work together.
"Improving collaboration and communication with the states and the U.S. Department of Defense is a significant step forward," said CoG co-chair Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. "This agreement on the budget consultative process will help us foster an on-going dialogue so that working together, we can build a more resilient nation."
