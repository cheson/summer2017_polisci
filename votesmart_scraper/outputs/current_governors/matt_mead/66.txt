Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead released the following statement regarding the Clean Power Plan released today by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):
"The Clean Power Plan is scientifically flawed and if implemented will not achieve minimum reductions. It is in fact damaging -- not just to Wyoming, but the nation. I will continue to fight regulations that are fundamentally bad for Wyoming and exceed the regulatory authority of the federal government."
