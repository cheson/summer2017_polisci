Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead hosted US Forest Service Regional Forester Dan Jirón today as Mr. Jirón signed the Record of Decision for the Shoshone National Forest Plan. The Governor acknowledged the Forest Service's efforts to balance traditional uses with protecting the wild characteristics of the forest.
"The Forest Service worked well with state and local government on this plan," said Governor Mead. "The agency received hundreds of comments -- which proved how much people care about the future of the forest. The final document is a good compromise based on the input the Forest Service received and serves as an example of how the process should work."
The Governor's Office provided comments supporting continued customary uses of the forest including grazing and recreation.
