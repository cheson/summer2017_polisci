Governor to Live Stream State of the State Address
Statement
By: Matt Mead
Date: Feb. 4, 2014
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead will deliver the State of the State address to a Joint Session of the Wyoming Senate and House of Representatives on February 10th beginning at 10:00 a.m. That speech and the Chief Justice's State of the Judiciary address will stream live at governor.wy.gov. Governor Mead invites the public to tune in and watch.
"I believe it is important that anyone who wishes to participate in the legislative process has access to it. Thanks to our work with private partners, we have more access to broadband connections to the internet than we had in the past. In 2013 alone there was a 700% increase in connectivity for our school children. This means more learning opportunities, including access to the legislative process," Governor Mead said. The Governor started online broadcasts of the State of the State in 2011 when he took office.
