Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead was joined by U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Sally Jewell in Jackson today to announce progress on the sale of two tracts of state land inside Grand Teton National Park. The sale would bring $46 million per parcel for a total of $92 million to the Common School Permanent Land Fund. These parcels currently generate $1800 per year for the state. A final agreement requires a vote of the State Board of Land Commissioners which is comprised of the Governor, Secretary of State, Auditor, Treasurer and Superintendent of Public Instruction.
"The Park is a special place -- these lands should be protected for future generations to enjoy. I am pleased that we have made progress on the purchase of this land by the National Park Service," said Governor Mead. "We have a duty to realize the greatest benefit from state lands for Wyoming schools -- we aren't currently doing that with these tracts. This sale would be good for Wyoming. I want to thank the Legislature for their work on this issue and Secretary Jewell as well for her efforts to get this done."
The Antelope Flat and Kelly tracts are each 640 acres. The Antelope Flat tract will be the first of the two to be sold for $46 million. The federal government has committed one half, or $23 million for the purchase, and the balance of $23 million will come from private donations.
