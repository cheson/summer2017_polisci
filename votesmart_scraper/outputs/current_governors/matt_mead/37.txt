Governor Matt Mead is pleased the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is taking steps to remove grizzly bears from the endangered species list in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.
"We have been working for several years with the Secretary of Interior and the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service one on one, along with our staffs to get to this decision. The proposed rule is to delist grizzly bears. Grizzly bears are recovered and have been for more than a decade. It is a great success story," said Governor Mead. "I look forward to continued work with the Fish and Wildlife Service, Montana and Idaho as we move to a final rule later this year."
The grizzly bear was first listed as threatened in 1975, when biologists estimated as few as 136 bears in the Greater Yellowstone Area. Now there are estimated to be more than 700.
"Grizzly bears have exceeded all recovery goals. Delisting the grizzly bear is good for the species, for Wyoming and for the West," said Governor Mead.
FWS will now accept public comment on the proposed rule and an accompanying conservation strategy and has committed to complete delisting by the end of the summer.
