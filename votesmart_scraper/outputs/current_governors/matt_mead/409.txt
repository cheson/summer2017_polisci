Wyoming To Join Florida Lawsuit Challenging Health Care Mandate
Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: Jan. 7, 2011
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead announced today that on Monday, January 10, Wyoming will officially request permission to join the federal lawsuit filed in Florida, which challenges the constitutionality of the federal health care law passed in March 2010. The lawsuit claims that the federal health care law exceeds Congress's commerce clause power. The law imposes financial penalties on citizens who have not secured health insurance by 2014. "Wyoming's voice needs to be heard," Governor Mead said.
Governor Mead said that Wyoming will participate in the case through its final resolution, likely in the United States Supreme Court. He noted the initial cost to join the lawsuit was $1000.00. Additional costs might be assessed if the case proceeds to the U.S. Supreme Court which is expected. Governor Mead also noted there are issues other than those involved in the Florida case, that relate to the federal health care law, such as forthcoming regulations, which could require additional legal expenditures; and consequently he supports legislation this session that would establish a health litigation fund.
