In February, Wyoming filed an amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear a significant Second Amendment case. Eighteen states followed Wyoming in objecting to a Third Circuit decision that threatens Second Amendment protections.
The U.S. Supreme Court considered the petition today.
"The decision out of the Third Circuit could impact Wyoming gun owners and our right to carry weapons outside of the home. That is why I felt it was imperative to support this petition to the Supreme Court," Governor Mead said. "This is an important Second Amendment issue and I am proud Wyoming has taken an active lead in this case."
