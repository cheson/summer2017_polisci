Press Release

Governor Matt Mead said the State of Oregon's decision to block a coal port violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Wyoming Attorney General appealed Oregon's decision, denying a permit for an export facility that would ship coal from the Powder River Basin to Asia.
"Coal is the fastest growing fuel source in the world and this decision by the State of Oregon prevents Wyoming coal producers from competing in that marketplace," Governor Mead said. "Wyoming will continue to standup for the coal industry, which provides affordable and abundant power to people across the globe. We support coal including efforts to innovate and work on cleaner energy from all sources."
Wyoming's appeal is of the decision denying the Coyote Island Terminal's application for a removal-fill permit by the Oregon Department of State Lands. The Oregon Office of Administrative Hearings has jurisdiction. Wyoming asserts that Oregon's decision to deny this permit is based on its dislike of a specific commodity -- coal -- and that Oregon did not base its decision on the factors it must consider under law. This action impacts interstate and foreign commerce and comes at great cost to taxpayers in Wyoming and other coal producing states.
