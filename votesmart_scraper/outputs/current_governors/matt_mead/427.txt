* Provide the best education possible
* Demand results from our investment in education
* Ensure that community colleges and the University of Wyoming work together and are the best public schools available
Our future lies in our kids, and Wyoming should not settle for anything less than the best education for them.
I will work with teachers and administrators to meet what should be the first and common goal -- what is the best way to get the best education for our kids. Right now Wyoming gets an "A" for the amount of money it is spending on education but a "C" on results. That's not good. Our results should match our investment.
We need to recognize the challenges our teachers, principals and administrators face. The vast majority of administrators, principals and teachers are excellent (those of my kids are first-rate), and we must recognize, reward and retain them. But, if a child effectively misses a couple of grades because of ineffective teaching, then that child never catches up. We need a way of timely addressing ineffective teaching, too.
As Governor, I would like to see charter schools strengthened in Wyoming but, that said, charter schools should not receive unfair advantage over our public schools. Charter schools must be open to all students desiring to attend them.
We need to ask and answer tough questions. How should schools deal with non-English speaking students?
How can schools effectively educate the stable student population and yet accommodate students who move in and out of Wyoming during the school year? Is No Child Left Behind working for Wyoming children?
