Governor Matt Mead said the U.S. Postal Service's decision to delay closing post offices is prudent and he hopes Congress and the U.S.P.S. can use this time to develop savings and efficiencies other than closing rural post offices.

"There need to be cuts made to the Postal Service's budget and there are ways to find efficiencies," Governor Mead said. "But, closing rural post offices is not a big enough savings to make any real impact for the Postal Service and the closures would deeply impact people who depend on the mail system for communication."

Governor Mead originally sent a letter to the United States Postal Service in August expressing his concern about closures. The U.S.P.S. has listed 43 post offices in the state that could potentially be shuttered. Governor Mead's letter to the Regional Manager of the U.S.P.S. said closing these post offices is not a solution to the budgetary problems the Postal Service is facing.

"I believe a five-day delivery week is a better solution because it spreads the burden of cost savings out across the country," Governor Mead said. "I will continue to push for alternatives to closing the offices during this delay."

Governor Mead also expressed thanks to Wyoming's Congressional Delegation for its work on behalf of residents that would be potentially impacted by closures.
