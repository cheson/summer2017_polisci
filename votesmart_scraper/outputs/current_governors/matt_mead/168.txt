More people are working in Wyoming according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Information released today shows that Wyoming had the fourth lowest unemployment rate in the nation for April at 3.7%. The jobless rate has not been that low in Wyoming since November 2008. Governor Matt Mead said he was pleased by the news.
"This demonstrates Wyoming's economy is strong. Wyoming's trend of increasing wages and one of the lowest poverty rates in the nation, along with low unemployment show we are on the right path," Governor Mead said. "Our private sector is growing. New projects like Microsoft's data center expansion, Magpul's manufacturing facility, UL's technology center, the oil to rail loading projects and others across Wyoming are underway. There is a great opportunity in Wyoming now."
Revenue is ahead of projections according the latest reports and tourism forecasts for the summer are positive. The Wyoming Department of Workforce Services will have detailed employment information out for the state and counties out next week.
