Governor Matt Mead signed the bill allowing Wyoming to enter into a multi-state lottery or start a state lottery. The law creating a lottery corporation goes into effect on July 1st.
"This is a way to keep Wyoming money in Wyoming. Right now we are seeing many people cross the border and spending their dollars in out-of-state businesses. I want to keep those dollars here," Governor Mead said. "This is a form of gambling and I commit to keeping a close eye on any social impacts of the lottery when it gets up and running to see if there are ways to address those."
After July 1st Governor Mead will appoint a nine member board, which will hire a CEO.
