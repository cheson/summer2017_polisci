Governor Matt Mead supports Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals to export American natural gas. Governor Mead wrote to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy that studies prepared by the DOE support a market-driven course for infrastructure projects.
Governor Mead's letter says that the analyses quantify the benefits of increased LNG exports. "Wyoming, along with other energy states, will realize increased production, jobs and revenue." Governor Mead also commented that the country should remain mindful of market volatility and the integral relationship between natural gas consumers, agriculture and manufacturing. "That said, the studies correctly point out -- one remedy to imbalance is increased production."
A link to the letter to Secretary Chu is below. Governor Mead thanked the Department of Energy for commissioning the studies.
