With Drought Conditions Governor Requests a Disaster Declaration
Statement
By: Matt Mead
Date: June 22, 2012
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead has asked U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, to issue an agricultural disaster declaration for all of Wyoming, except Teton County. If granted, such a declaration could provide some federal emergency assistance to Wyoming producers.
"Wyoming farmers and ranchers are struggling to work through serious impacts caused by drought," Governor Mead wrote. "Over the past month, County Commissioners throughout Wyoming have requested agricultural disaster designations for the 2012 agricultural production year. After consultation with the Wyoming Farm Service Agency it is clear that every Wyoming county with the exception of Teton County has suffered grazing loss and dryland hay loss in excess of the disaster threshold."
