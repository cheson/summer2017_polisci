Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead sent the Speaker of the U.S. House and the Majority Leader of the Senate a letter today saying that Congressman Paul Ryan's budget proposal is, "Â…good for the states, good for Wyoming, and ultimately good for the federal government."
Governor Mead wrote that the budget plan put forward by Representative Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, will not only bring federal spending under control, but also provide flexibility for the states when it comes to programs like Medicaid. The letter also states that it is not too late to choose a path that cuts the deficit and cuts the debt. "[T]he budget plan announced today, would repeal the expansions in the Affordable Care Act and allow states to formulate programs, like Medicaid, to meet specific local needs using block grants as they choose."
"I support Congressman Ryan's and Congressional Republicans' efforts to do the right thing now," Governor Mead wrote.
