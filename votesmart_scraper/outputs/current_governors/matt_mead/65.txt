The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved Governor Mead's request for a direct housing benefit for Niobrara County. This stems from the flood disaster from early this summer. FEMA's direct housing program provides a temporary house for those eligible individuals after a disaster.
"People lost their homes, their businesses and more," said Governor Mead. "Those people are working hard to rebuild and temporary housing will help. I have asked the agencies involved to do all they can for those who suffered damages as a result of severe weather around the state."
Interim housing -- up to 18 months -- is put into place by FEMA while repairs are made to damaged homes or alternative permanent housing is secured. Families should work directly with FEMA to determine eligibility. FEMA specialists will provide monthly assistance to families on permanent housing plans over the 18 month interim period.
