Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead signed Senate Enrolled Act 3 into law this week. The bill changes the criteria to serve as the Wyoming Oil and Gas Supervisor. Previously state law required the Supervisor to be a professionally licensed petroleum engineer or petroleum geologist. Now the Supervisor must be a petroleum engineer or petroleum geologist with at least 10 years of experience in his or her respective field of expertise, but does not have to be professionally licensed.
With this change in place, the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission continues to seek applicants for the State Oil and Gas Supervisor position.
"We have received interest from many great candidates and we now have clarity from the Legislature about the requirements for the position. I hope others will put in an application. We would like to fill this important position as soon as possible," Governor Mead said. "I again express my thanks to Bob King for his work as Interim Supervisor and thank the other members of the Commission for their work in finding our next Supervisor."
Anyone interested in applying for the position should contact Interim Supervisor Bob King at (307) 234-7147 or Bob.King@wyo.gov.
