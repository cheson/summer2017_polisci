Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: May 28, 2014
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead will travel to Washington State next week to visit with local elected officials and tour a port that plans to export Wyoming coal. The trip offers Governor Mead the chance to hear directly from people in that state about their thoughts on the port and coal exports.
"Expanding markets for Wyoming products is a priority I have engaged for some time. I know about the demand in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan for our coal. Increasing exports, including coal, will lead to economic growth and more jobs," Governor Mead said. "I value meeting face to face with local legislators and other community members. I want to answer as many questions as possible and build mutually beneficial relationships."
Governor Mead will travel to Washington State on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. He will meet with Washington State legislators, the editorial board of a local newspaper and members of the business community. He will tour the Millennium Bulk Terminal in Longview, WA.
