Governor Signs 2014 Equal Pay Day Proclamation
Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: June 24, 2014
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead signed the 2014 Wyoming Equal Pay Day Proclamation on Tuesday. He was joined by the Wyoming Council for Women's Issues and the Wyoming Women's Foundation. The proclamation marked continuing efforts to create more opportunities for women and decrease the wage gap.

Wyoming's unemployment rate is currently 3.8 percent. Governor Mead said that he hears from employers who are now struggling to find workers. "We are pushing science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) in our schools and showing all students that there are many opportunities in these fields. Emphasizing STEM with girls - and boys - is a great way to pave the way into the higher paying careers in Wyoming."

The Wyoming Council for Women's Issues, which is funded by the State is chaired by Carma Corra. "The Wyoming Council for Women's Issues encourages employee-friendly practices like job sharing, flexible scheduling and access to child care. We want to promote anything that will help a mother, or a father, not to have to make a choice between career and family."

The proclamation states, in part, that "fair pay for everyone enhances the economy, improves financial security and lessens pressure on the costs of retirement."
