The State of Wyoming and CenturyLink (formerly Qwest) have agreed on a contract that means two-thirds of all Wyoming students will have Ethernet broadband access at their schools before the end of 2011. This is a significant increase from the current 27% of students now connected to Ethernet speeds. Wyoming has a total of 88,165 students.
"This is a tremendous tool for our education system and it is also a benefit to all of the communities that will now have Ethernet access," Governor Mead said. "I am very pleased we were able to work out an agreement with CenturyLink to bring Ethernet to 13 additional Wyoming cities."
Improving broadband connectivity has been a priority for Governor Mead since taking office. The new contract was made possible with work from the State's Chief Information Officer, the Wyoming Department of Education and the Department of Administration and Information's Information Technology Division.
"I will continue working to see that all Wyoming schools have access to Ethernet broadband speeds," Governor Mead said. "High-level connectivity across Wyoming will help support the great small businesses we have and attract more small businesses to our state. We have the quality of living, beneficial tax structure and economic stability that families and businesses want. Businesses need the technology to support their companies. Now we will have broadband in 13 more cities continuing to move Wyoming in the right direction."
This agreement will bring Ethernet access to Laramie, Rawlins, Rock Springs, Jackson, Riverton, Lander, Cody, Douglas, Gillette, Buffalo and Sheridan, Glenrock and Green River. Cheyenne and Casper already have access.
