Wyoming has received notice that a judge in Idaho has granted Wyoming's motion to intervene in sage-grouse litigation. Judge Lynn Winmill is hearing a challenge to the US Fish and Wildlife Service's decision that listing sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act is warranted but precluded by other higher listing priorities.
Western Watersheds Projects is seeking a court order requiring the Fish and Wildlife Service to list sage-grouse. Wyoming asked to intervene to defend the Service's determination that listing sage-grouse is precluded by other higher listing priorities. Governor Mead has worked hard to maintain a state-based solution for protecting sage-grouse habitat. The Sage-Grouse Core Area Protection Strategy is set forth in the Governor's Executive Order. Governor Mead has noted listing the sage-grouse would have very serious implications for Wyoming's economy.
Governor Mead said he is pleased Wyoming's motion to intervene was granted. "No state has come close to what Wyoming has done regarding the protection of sage-grouse," Governor Mead said. "Wyoming has more experience and more at stake than any other state so it is appropriate that Judge Winmill has let us into that lawsuit. We're very eager to present the Wyoming case for his consideration."
