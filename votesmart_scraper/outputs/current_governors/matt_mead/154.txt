Location: Cheyenne, WY

The Wyoming Legislature approved Governor Matt Mead's request for $15 million to build an Integrated Test Center for developing commercial uses of carbon. The Governor is actively working to make this facility a reality. The Test Center would supply gas to researchers who would develop different uses for CO2.
"Power companies and coal producers are excited about this proposal. Wyoming has an abundance of coal and we know we must find productive ways to put coal and its byproducts to use," Governor Mead said. "We are showing leadership in supporting this kind of advanced research."
The Test Center would be located next to a Wyoming coal-fired power plant. The Governor has asked representatives from industry to work on this project. The group is engaged with Wyoming utilities to explore interest in hosting the Test Center.
