Location: Cheyenne, WY

The Department of the Interior released a memo from Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar today. That memo directs the Bureau of Land Management to take no action under the Wild Lands Order. This Order was signed in December 2010. Governor Matt Mead has opposed the Order since taking office and has spoken on several occasions with the Secretary about potential impacts from the Wild Land Order.
"The decision to reverse course on the Wild Lands Order is in the best interest of Wyoming and the entire West," Governor Mead said. Governor Mead and Secretary Salazar talked by phone yesterday. "I have already thanked Secretary Salazar for listening to the people of Wyoming. My office worked closely with our county commissioners, our business owners and our Congressional delegation to let the Secretary know that this Order would have had serious effects on Wyoming's economy, which depends on the multiple-use of public lands."
