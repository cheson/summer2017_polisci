Governor Matt Mead announced today that Wyoming's Department of Family Services (DFS) has become the first state agency to have every employee trained in suicide prevention.
"This training is another important step to address this serious public health problem. I applaud DFS for training more than 700 employees in suicide prevention. The conversation about suicide raises awareness. Awareness is important to prevention. We cannot remain silent when lives are at stake," Governor Mead said.
DFS staff completed Jason Foundation suicide prevention training. The Jason Foundation is an educational organization dedicated to the prevention of youth suicide. The curriculum includes identifying risk factors and how to approach those who may be struggling with suicidal thoughts. The training is now part of the DFS new employee orientation.
"The suicide statistics in Wyoming are alarming and we want to help reverse those numbers. We made it part of our mission to ensure that each employee is trained to recognize the warning signs of suicide," DFS Director Steve Corsi said.
