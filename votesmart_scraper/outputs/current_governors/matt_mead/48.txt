Governor Mead Releases Proposed Budget
Statement
By: Matt Mead
Date: Dec. 2, 2015
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead released details of his 2017-2018 biennial budget and spending reductions for fiscal year 2016 (FY16). State revenue projections have decreased due to falling oil and natural gas prices and the market and regulatory difficulties faced by the coal industry. Governor Mead asked state agencies to prioritize their budgets and limit exception requests. Exception requests are for urgent needs and special projects beyond the standard budget.
"With the slump in the energy sector, the revenue decline comes as no surprise," said Governor Mead. "We have prepared well for this situation, and Wyoming has benefitted from a conservative fiscal policy."
"My budget incorporates strategic reductions while still providing the services that our citizens rely on and the projects needed for continued growth," Governor Mead continued. "These are difficult times for many in our state who have personally felt the effects of the depressed energy market. My budget helps local governments satisfy their obligations and invests in long-term economic growth for the state. We have challenges, but I feel confident in our ability to meet those challenges."
