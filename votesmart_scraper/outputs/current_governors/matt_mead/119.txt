Location: Cheyenne, WY

Wyoming established an emergency rule to address Judge Amy Berman Jackson's decision on Tuesday, September 23. Judge Jackson recognized the urgency of this matter and acted quickly to hear arguments on Wyoming's request that she reverse her order returning management of gray wolves to federal control. All parties were required to submit comments by noon today.
Judge Jackson ordered a hearing set for tomorrow, September 30, 2014.
"I believe that Wyoming's success in managing wolves for the last two years, the emergency rule and the commitment by the Game and Fish Commission to make a permanent rule shows Wyoming's resolution to manage wolves effectively," Governor Mead said. "I appreciate the decision by Judge Jackson to address Wyoming's motion quickly".
