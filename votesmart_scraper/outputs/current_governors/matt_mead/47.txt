Today, Governor Matt Mead received the 2015 Sheldon Coleman Great Outdoors Award from the American Recreation Coalition (ARC). The Governor was recognized for his commitment to conservation and the outdoors as was Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri.
"I am honored to receive this award. To join the distinguished list of recipients, which goes back to 1989 and includes a President of the United States, is a privilege indeed," said Governor Mead. "Being a Wyoming outdoor enthusiast all my life, I must say that supporting our state's wonderful recreation and conservation causes comes naturally and easily. It is one of the great joys of serving as Governor."
