Press Release

Date: Sept. 11, 2014
Location: Cheyenne, WY

According to Governor Matt Mead a decrease in the number of workplace fatalities and injuries in Wyoming last year shows the state is making progress. The State Occupational Epidemiologist released a report yesterday on trends in workplace safety in 2013. Fatalities dropped by more than 30% from 2012 to 2013 and hospitalizations were down as well.
"We must continue efforts to keep workers safe," Governor Mead said. "We continue to look for new ways to emphasize safe workplaces. Last year I joined with industry and others to start the Transportation Safety Alliance and this year we are focusing on a safer construction industry."
The report from the Occupational Epidemiologist is available online. This is only the second time this report has been put together.
"These reports help us focus resources and make recommendations based on hard data," Governor Mead said. "We have more to do but this report indicates we are headed in the right direction. It helps us build on current efforts and gives a heightened focus on safety."
Governor Mead was instrumental in the formation of the Transportation Safety Coalition, the Wyoming Refinery Safety Alliance and the Wyoming Construction Safety Alliance. He promotes the work of the Wyoming Oil and Gas Safety Alliance.
Since taking office Governor Mead and the Legislature have added new Wyoming OSHA safety positions. They also created a Safety Fund of $500,000 to provide matching grants to companies for safety equipment and training.
