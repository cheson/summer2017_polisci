Governor Matt Mead and 16 other Republican governors sent a letter to President Obama today expressing concern about excessive regulation from his administration. This letter reflects Governor Mead's belief that without a federal energy policy regulations are promulgated without consideration of their cumulative effect and form a de facto and deficient national policy.
The letter states, "The fragile nature of the economic recovery should remain at the forefront of every decision by federal policy makers. Energy operations in the our states not only provide the country with domestic energy, but these industries constitute a significant base of employment and royalties which fund our schools, police and other vital state and local services. Protecting these important economic resources, while protecting health and the environment, is our common goal."
Governor Mead says Wyoming has a proven track record of balancing development and the environment, while maintaining a strong economy. He also is concerned about the lack of a national energy policy, "In the absence of a national energy plan that ties our nation's security, treasury and welfare to state resource development and protection, there is a pressing need for leadership at the state level and a unified voice of reason." Governor Mead is committed to working with other governors, especially those from energy producing states to provide leadership.
