Governor Mead: Wyoming Continues to Work Towards Resolution for Wolf Management
Statement
By: Matt Mead
Date: May 4, 2011
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead said he was pleased with the announcement that wolves would come off of the Endangered Species List in several other Western states and looks forward to the time when Wyoming has control over wolves in this state.
"I appreciate that Secretary Salazar would restate his commitment to working with Wyoming to get wolves taken off the Endangered Species List here," Governor Mead said. "I am hopeful that we are close to an agreement with the Fish and Wildlife Service to move a proposal to Congress. I continue to believe that wolves should be delisted and a proposal should move through Congress, preventing litigation. Otherwise, Wyoming loses as wolf numbers grow and more big game and livestock are killed."
The conversation between Wyoming and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is ongoing.
