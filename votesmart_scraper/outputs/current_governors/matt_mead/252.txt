Governor Traveling to Middle East to Boost Support for UW and Explore Trade Opportunities
Statement
By: Matt Mead
Date: April 5, 2013
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead heads to the Middle East tomorrow. He will meet with international companies about Wyoming energy resources and the University of Wyoming.
"This trip provides an excellent opportunity to meet with companies interested in research being done at the University of Wyoming's School of Energy Resources," Governor Mead said. "The School of Energy Resources' reputation is growing and this is a good way for us to promote UW as a global leader in energy research and education."
Governor Mead also hopes to build on a positive trend. Last year Wyoming had the 7th highest growth rate in exports of any state in the country. Wyoming's increase was 17% between 2011 and 2012.
"I believe it is important to increase exports from Wyoming to overseas markets. The Legislature shares this perspective and built this initiative into the supplemental budget. I am hopeful that the contacts we make will build opportunities for more international exports," Governor Mead said.
He will land in Dubai and visit business leaders in the area. Governor Mead's trip will be paid for with non-state dollars. He returns to Wyoming late on April 12th.
