Location: Cheyenne, WY

At his news conference today, which is also Wyoming Day, Governor Matt Mead signed an Executive Order appointing Echo Klaproth as Wyoming's new Poet Laureate. Klaproth, a rancher from Shoshoni, is the sixth Poet Laureate in state history.
"Echo captures the essence of Wyoming and our state's ranching heritage in her poetry," Governor Mead said. "We look forward to her serving Wyoming in this distinguished capacity. Her poetry is inspiring and will enrich our lives."
Klaproth is a nationally recognized poet who has written three books of poetry. Klaproth is also a teacher who participated in an event at the Smithsonian celebrating ranch life.
"As a fourth generation Wyoming rancher, one of the reasons I write is to save the legacy my family has been blessed to enjoy - that which they've worked diligently to keep going since the late 1800s," Klaproth said. She takes the mantle from Pat Frolander who served as Poet Laureate from 2011 to the present.
