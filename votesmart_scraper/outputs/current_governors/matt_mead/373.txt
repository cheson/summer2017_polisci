As the nation heads into the holiday weekend marking America's Independence Governor Matt Mead sent a message to the people of Wyoming. "This is a very significant holiday for our country and I hope that everyone takes time to remember why we are celebrating."
Governor Mead also urged everyone to be safe, "I was so pleased to see that there were no deaths on our highways over the Memorial Day weekend and I hope everyone makes smart decisions this weekend as well. This is a time for families and friends to come together and we want everyone to be together again next year."
On the Fourth of July Governor Mead and his family will be in Teton County and will read excerpts of President Lincoln's documents to accompany the Grand Teton Music Festival Orchestra's performance of Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait.
"This is a time to remember how great a country we live in. From the Founding Fathers to President Lincoln to our current day public servants, we have seen so many individuals striving to ensure this is the greatest nation on earth," Governor Mead said. "Whether it is the Gettysburg Address, the Declaration of Independence or another wonderful American document, I hope everyone will take a moment to review some of the works that make the United States of America a beacon of liberty and justice."
