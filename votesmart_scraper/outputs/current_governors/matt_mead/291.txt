Governor Announces Results of Natural Gas Vehicle Push for Wyoming
Press Release

Date: Oct. 8, 2012
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Bid awards were announced from a multi-state Request For Proposal (RFP) to purchase natural gas vehicles from American auto manufacturers. This is part of an effort involving 22 states to encourage U.S. auto manufacturers to produce more functional and affordable compressed natural gas vehicles. All natural gas vehicles purchased by the State of Wyoming will come from Wyoming licensed dealerships.
"This initiative makes a lot of sense for Wyoming. It allows us to get a sense of where the market stands on natural gas vehicles because this has to be a market-based effort," Governor Mead said. "It allows efficiencies because moving fleet vehicles to run on natural gas will have a savings for taxpayers over the life of those cars and trucks. It also matches up with my energy strategy by adding value to an abundant Wyoming resource. We are the number three producer of natural gas in the nation and using more of this fuel source supports our economy."
The bid details for all 22 states, including Wyoming, are available here. The bid awards show which dealerships will be eligible to sell vehicles to the State of Wyoming. The three winning bids are Fremont Motors, Fremont Chevrolet-GMC and Spradley Barr.
"Having so many states involved provides more incentive for the private market to build up the natural gas fueling infrastructure," Governor Mead said. "That infrastructure and the confirmed demand from states should make more natural gas vehicles available to the general public too."
