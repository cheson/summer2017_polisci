The State of Wyoming is preparing a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court asking the Court to hear Wyoming's challenge of the Roadless Rule. Governor Matt Mead made the decision after the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order denying Wyoming's petition for a rehearing en banc in the Roadless Rule case.
"The Roadless Rule has seriously impacted Wyoming, our people, our industries and the health of our forests. Given the consequences it is important to ask the Supreme Court to hear this case," Governor Mead said.
Wyoming will petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. Four Supreme Court Justices must agree to hear the case for it to proceed.
The Roadless Rule limits activity on 3 million acres of National Forests in Wyoming. "When this Roadless Rule was put in place the concerns of the people of Wyoming about the significant adverse effects of the rule were ignored. This petition is a way to make our voice heard," Governor Mead said.
