The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) will withdraw a portion of proposed rules expanding their Waters of the United States (WOTUS) regulatory authority. The withdrawn portion of the WOTUS - the Interpretive Rule for Agriculture - removed normal farming exemptions. Governor Matt Mead has worked for the withdrawal of this portion of the rule. He has also worked for the withdrawal of the remainder of the proposed rule.
"These rules were not developed in consultation with states. They have far-reaching impacts on agriculture, industry, private property and state control of water and they need to be withdrawn," Governor Mead said. "I am pleased the agencies have begun the withdrawal process. I look forward to more."
The EPA and Army Corps denied the WOTUS proposed rules were aimed at expansion of federal authority. These proposals, however, increased federal oversight of agricultural practices, as well as controls over land and water resources under state authority.
