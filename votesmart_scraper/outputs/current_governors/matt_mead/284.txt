Wyoming and National Park Service Finish Second Land Sale with Grand Teton
Statement

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead applauded the U.S. Department of the Interior and the National Park Service for finalizing the purchase of an 86-acre parcel of state land. This is the second sale of state land inside Grand Teton National Park and is part of an agreement made in 2010. The $16 million from the federal government will go to the Wyoming Permanent Land Fund, which can be used to purchase other land for the state.
"I am pleased that we reached this stage in exchanging all of the state parcels inside Grand Teton National Park. The best outcome for all involved is for this land to be part of the National Park. I appreciate the work of Secretary Ken Salazar and Director Jon Jarvis in finalizing this second sale and I look forward to working with them to complete the final transactions," Governor Mead said.
The Wyoming constitution says the State Board of Land Commissioners must use state trust lands to realize the largest possible proceeds for Wyoming schools.
