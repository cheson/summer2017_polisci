A program Governor Matt Mead launched is being used by more state agencies and making state government more efficient. Known as WyoStat, the program aims to improve state agency performance and ensure smart decision making. It places an emphasis on the mission of each agency and ensures that decisions are made that match missions and advance effective delivery of services.
"We have great state employees. This focuses their work based on objectives and data," Governor Mead said. "I am pleased state agencies are using this system to improve and streamline their work."
The Wyoming Department of Health calls the WyoStat program HealthStat and began using it in 2011. The initial focus was on defining program missions. Then on developing quality outcome measures aligned with program missions. This year programs have focused on delivering the best "bang for the buck" through efficiencies.
WyoStat is used in the Departments of Workforce Services and Family Services. Seven other agencies are implementing the program. It is producing results - identifying gaps in services or processes and finding new and innovative ways to consistently ensure excellent customer service to Wyoming's citizens.
"We are already seeing the benefits. For example, this new system identified the importance of the Aging Disability Resource Center," Governor Mead said. "HealthStat is reducing the number of return admissions for elderly who are transitioning from a health care facility to home. This makes a difference for people helping families and the State save money."
In addition to state agencies, WyoStat is being incorporated by other organizations to help with efforts from industry-specific safety initiatives to mental health services for Wyoming Veterans.
