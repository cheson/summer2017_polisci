Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Wyoming was the first state in the nation to develop a comprehensive energy strategy with the release of Leading the Charge, Wyoming's Action Plan for Energy, Environment and Economy in 2013. More than three-fourths of the initiatives identified in the 2013 strategy are complete. Last year, Governor Mead worked with people across Wyoming to update the strategy.
"Wyoming has a track record of excellence in energy development and stewardship. The energy strategy provides a systematic approach. The past few years have seen many successes from baseline water testing to a comprehensive energy atlas. The strategy is dynamic and this update continues this important work."
The updated energy strategy is the result of public input, comments and ranking of initiatives. Upon completion of the public comment period, Governor Mead chose which initiatives would be incorporated into the 2016 Energy Strategy.
"Today marks the beginning of a new implementation phase for the state's energy strategy. This latest iteration is the result of the hard work of many -- from people in industry and agriculture to environmental groups and the general public. I thank them all and look forward to working together for the future of energy in Wyoming," said Governor Mead.
