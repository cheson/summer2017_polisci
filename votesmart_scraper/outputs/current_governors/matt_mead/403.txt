Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

A judge in Florida has issued an order adding Wyoming and five other states to the lawsuit against the federal government. This suit challenges the constitutionality of the federal health care law, which passed in March of last year.
This order means that Wyoming is officially a part of the lawsuit and comes in response to a motion filed by attorneys for the State of Florida. The motion was filed yesterday, January 18th.
The argument made in the suit matches up with Governor Matt Mead's assertion that it is unconstitutional to require someone to purchase health insurance and to impose a fine someone for failing to have health insurance and violates the commerce clause. "I'm very pleased that Wyoming is now a part of this effort and glad to see that we can move towards a final decision from the judge in this case," Mead says.
