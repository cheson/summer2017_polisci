Governor Matt Mead released the following statement regarding President Donald Trump's Executive Order on Immigration:
"As I expressed to President Obama, Wyoming recognizes immigration made this country great. The citizens of Wyoming and the entire United States must be able to rely on the government to have a process in place that allows robust immigration and that does not allow terrorists into our country. I hope President Trump's Administration can find the right way forward in these matters so critical to the future of our nation."
