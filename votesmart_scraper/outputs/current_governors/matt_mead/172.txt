Governor Matt Mead unveiled a report today showing that Wyoming is well positioned to be a leader in developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry for high horsepower uses. The "Wyoming LNG Roadmap Report" looks at how LNG can supplement diesel in mining, rail, drilling, pressure pumping and over-the-road trucking industries.
"This report shows there is potential for expansion of LNG use in Wyoming that can add value to our natural gas, be a sound business decision for Wyoming industries and lead to job growth," Governor Mead said. "I felt this was an opportune time to team up with private companies to facilitate research and understand what possibilities exist. The private sector will ultimately make investments in LNG technologies based on market conditions, and this report can be a catalyst."
Among other things, the report analyzes the amount of diesel used in Wyoming's high horsepower industries and inventories the engines currently in use in those industries. It shows that the Powder River Basin is the "heart of the market" for LNG.
"We now have some concrete ideas for how we can make our abundant natural gas be even more valuable to our economy. It is exciting to see the opportunities ahead," Governor Mead said.
The report produced by Gladstein, Neandross & Associates was paid for by the State of Wyoming and several private partners.
