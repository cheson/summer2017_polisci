Governor Mead Pleased with Judge's Decision Blocking BLM's Fracking Rule
Statement

Location: Cheyenne, WY

United States District Court Judge Scott Skavdahl has granted Wyoming and Colorado's request for a preliminary injunction on the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) hydraulic fracturing rule. The injunction prevents the BLM's rule from taking effect until the states' cases have been fully resolved.
"Today's decision supports Wyoming's position-- Congress has addressed hydraulic fracturing and precluded federal regulation of it," Governor Mead said. "Wyoming has sound and responsible rules for hydraulic fracturing -- those rules have been in place for years. I will continue to work with the Attorney General as this case moves forward."
