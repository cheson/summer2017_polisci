Governor Matt Mead recently traveled to Afghanistan as part of a delegation to visit with deployed troops there. The Governor traveled with Governors Terry McAuliffe of Virginia and Phil Bryant of Mississippi. The trip was organized by the Department of Defense and took place March 16-20, 2016.
"I was honored to join this delegation to see our troops," said Governor Mead. "All of Wyoming should be extremely proud of the service and sacrifice of the Guard members. They and their families commit a great deal to serve Wyoming and America."
The Governors' trip began at the Pentagon before flying to the Middle East. In Afghanistan they spent time meeting with troops from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Regional Command South (RC-S) and Regional Command East (RC-E) Headquarters. Trip details were kept confidential for the safety of the governors and the troops until after the return.
"We all should be proud of our military," continued Governor Mead. "They are doing a very difficult job and they are doing it extremely well."
