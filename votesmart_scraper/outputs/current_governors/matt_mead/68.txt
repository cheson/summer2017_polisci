Governor Matt Mead announced the creation of the Governor's Marijuana Impact Assessment Council (GMIAC) on June 30, 2015.
The Council will work to collect, review and coordinate scientific data on the effects of legalizing marijuana for medical and recreational use -- focusing on the impacts to public health and safety. The Council will provide its report prior to the next legislative session.
"We suffer because of substance abuse in this state and I remain against legalizing another substance that could add to the existing problem," Governor Mead said. "I want the voters of Wyoming to have access to good scientific evidence and a fair look at the pros and cons of the legalization of marijuana."
The first meeting of the GMIAC will be on Wednesday, July 29th, from 10:00AM - 12:30PM in Room 1699 of the Herschler Building located at 122 W. 25th St. Cheyenne, WY.
