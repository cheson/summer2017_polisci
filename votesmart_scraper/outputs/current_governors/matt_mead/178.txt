Governor Matt Mead issued the following statement after Judge Thomas Campbell issued an order regarding the lawsuit over education management:
"The State of Wyoming requested an expeditious resolution to this matter - with the goal of moving forward from the Supreme Court decision as quickly as possible. The Superintendent had the opportunity to assume leadership of the Wyoming Department of Education for several weeks while reserving all her arguments. She refused to return. I am pleased the Court has issued an order that brings finality to this matter."
