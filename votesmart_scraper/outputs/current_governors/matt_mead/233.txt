Public Statements
Governor to Testify Against Regional Haze Rule
Press Release
By: Matt Mead
Date: July 11, 2013
Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead will attend and testify at the Environmental Protection Agency's public hearing on the regional haze rule next week. The EPA accepted a portion of the Wyoming plan for reducing haze but proposes to replace part of the state plan with a federal plan.
"Wyoming has a strong plan for reducing haze from industrial sources," Governor Mead said. "The federal proposal places much more onerous requirements on power plants and yet does not create a noticeable improvement in visibility over Wyoming's plan. The federal plan would also cost significantly more, a burden that would be passed on to ratepayers - families and small businesses."
An analysis of the federal plan shows it would cost utilities $1 billion in capital expenses and an additional $100 million per year after that. Governor Mead will testify on July 17th at 1:00 p.m. The hearing is taking place at the Laramie County Public Library in Cheyenne.
"This is the first time I have testified at a public hearing as Governor and I do it because I believe this is a particularly important issue for Wyoming citizens," Governor Mead said.
Governor Mead will also provide written comments ahead of the public comment deadline, which is August 26, 2013.
