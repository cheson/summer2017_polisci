Location: Cheyenne, WY

Today the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission approved Governor Matt Mead's baseline water testing initiative. Baseline water testing is part of Governor Mead's Energy Strategy. Today's vote makes the rule for new oil and gas activities effective March 1, 2014.
"I thank all of the people that offered comments on this rule and specifically the Wyoming Outdoor Council, Environmental Defense Fund and Petroleum Association of Wyoming for their constructive input. This is another example of Wyoming leading the nation in striking the right balance between producing needed energy and protecting our natural resources," Governor Mead said.
The rule requires oil and gas operators to test existing water sources before and after drilling an oil or gas well. Landowners must give consent for operators to sample the permitted or adjudicated water sources. These sources include domestic, stock, industrial, irrigation, municipal or other permitted uses of water.
