Governor Matt Mead will sign the bill providing incentives for the construction of data centers and mega data centers in Wyoming. The signing ceremony will take place on Friday, February 18, 2011 at 9:00 AM.
"This is a tool for creating real economic diversification in Wyoming and I am glad the Legislature sent this bill to me so quickly," Governor Mead says. "We have existing opportunities to attract data centers and affiliated jobs soon and so the incentive comes at just the right time. We know that we are competing with every other state in the country for these data centers and so laying out the infrastructure for these facilities is appropriate."
The signing ceremony will take place in the Governor's Formal Office. Legislators and members of the public are welcome to attend.
