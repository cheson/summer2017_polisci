Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead has signed an Executive Order creating emergency rules for the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WyDOT). This Order allows drivers of propane trucks to continue deliveries to heat homes across Wyoming.
"This extreme cold has caused a spike in the demand for propane, a fuel many people here use to heat their homes. This temporary, emergency rule means those deliveries can continue and it keeps people in Wyoming safe," Governor Mead said. "We have spoken with the companies involved asking them to take precautions to ensure the safety of both drivers and the general public."
The Executive Order is in effect until midnight on December 11th, 2013.
