Wyoming is among the top five most friendly states for business according to the Pollina Corporate's Top 10 Pro-Business States analysis. Business analysts from across the country continue to rank Wyoming in the top tier of states. Recently, CNBC named Wyoming #9 in its Best States for Business and the American Legislative Exchange Council proclaimed Wyoming the state with the 4th best economic outlook in the country. The Tax Foundation gave Wyoming the distinction of the state with the Most Business Friendly Tax Climate for 2013.
"Wyoming has worked to solidify its place as one of the very best states for business and these accolades make the people of Wyoming proud," Governor Mead said. "These economic measures of how well our state is doing reflect the strength of the people who live and work here and the quality of life that attracts and keeps businesses, families and workers here."
In May Wyoming had the fifth lowest unemployment rate in the country at 4.6%. Wyoming also had the fourth highest population growth between July 2011 and July 2012. In the most recent rankings, 24/7 Wall Street named Wyoming the second best run state in the U.S.
"This recognition shows that our fiscally conservative approach and investments in state and local infrastructure produce tangible results. A strong energy sector, increasing numbers for tourism, a healthy agriculture sector and an emerging technology industry are part of what makes Wyoming a wonderful place to live and have a business. We are glad to be singled out for our efforts," Governor Mead said.
