Governor Matt Mead is pleased with U.S. District Court Judge Scott Skavdahl's decision in favor of Wyoming over the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) hydraulic fracturing rule. Wyoming's challenge to this rule was joined by North Dakota, Utah and Colorado. The BLM rule is outside the scope of BLM's jurisdiction. The Court ruling immediately sets aside the fracking rule.
"Wyoming continues to be a leader in energy development and environmental stewardship," said Governor Mead. "We were the first state to regulate fracking. The BLM rule overreaches its authority and creates confusion. I am pleased with the Court's decision and thank the Wyoming Attorney General for his work."
In the decision the court said that, "BLM has attempted an end-run around" the limitations Congress placed on the federal regulation of fracking in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. The Court explained that "regulation of an activity must be by Congressional authority, not administrative fiat."
"The Court got it right," continued Governor Mead. "This is of particular importance not only to Wyoming but the country. I have and I will continue to aggressively assert Wyoming's authority when threatened by federal overreach."
