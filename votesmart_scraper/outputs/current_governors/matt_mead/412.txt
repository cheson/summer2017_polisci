* Promote Wyoming agriculture interests
* Protect open spaces
* Ensure the continuity of family farms and ranches
Many people undervalue Wyoming agriculture. It provides benefits beyond dollars -- to tourism, wildlife, recreation, a clean environment and maintaining open spaces. Wyoming agriculture also helps feed our country.
It is more than a business. It is a national security issue, too.
The dollar value of the Wyoming agriculture sector annually approaches or exceeds $1 billion from 11,000 farms and ranches in Wyoming. Agriculture is an industry, and it is also a way of life in Wyoming.
As Governor, I will promote Wyoming's agriculture interests in every way I can because those interests are vital to our State in so many ways -- not the least of which is their importance to our history, tradition, heritage, and quality of life. I support the State's moving forward with a state-funded rangeland health assessment program (the beginning of which was put in place this legislative session). I also support efforts to provide proactively to ward off listing additional species under the Endangered Species Act.
I support a change to the Endangered Species Act that would require a lawsuit to be brought where the issue is located and nowhere else. Wyoming issues, relating to land use or anything else, should be decided by Wyoming judges and not by a judge in Washington, D.C.
We need to move away from environmental policies that have brought about the uncomfortable sentiment of shoot, shovel and shut up to a policy that leads to a sentiment of reveal, rejoice and reward. True protection of species can only begin when private property owners are benefited rather than punished for good stewardship.
