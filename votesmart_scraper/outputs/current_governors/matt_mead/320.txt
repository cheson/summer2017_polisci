Governor Says Wyoming Rules for Hydraulic Fracturing Should Lead

Governor Matt Mead underscored Wyoming's first in the nation rules for hydraulic fracturing are based on sound science and protect public health, safety and the environment. According to Governor Mead this is why the Bureau of Land Management's proposed rules for hydraulic fracturing are unnecessary and unreasonable.
In a letter to Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, Governor Mead wrote, "I have heard no concern from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) about the adequacy of Wyoming's regulatory structure. It is troubling, then, to learn that the BLM has drafted similar rules pertaining to hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas productionÂ… I am concerned that the proposed rules will duplicate and possibly be sequential to Wyoming's rules."
Governor Mead points out that the proposed rules seem to go against President Obama's Executive Order 13563. That Order requires the least burdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends and the promotion of predictability and certainty. "The BLM's exercise to regulate what is already state-regulated does not meet the letter or the spirit of the President's Order."
Governor Mead recommended that the BLM not duplicate Wyoming's regulations and defer to states, like Wyoming, which adequately and effectively manage hydraulic fracturing.
