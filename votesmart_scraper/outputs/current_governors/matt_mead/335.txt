Today, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order denying Wyoming's petition for a rehearing en banc in the Roadless Rule case. By doing so that the Court upheld its reversal of a decision by Judge Clarence Brimmer. Governor Matt Mead issued the following statement about today's order:

"In a well-reasoned opinion Judge Brimmer stated that the Roadless Rule creates de facto wilderness areas and only Congress should have this power. We have supported that position because the Roadless Rule has serious implications for Wyoming. Wyoming has over 3 million acres of national forests, which would be subject to restrictions under the Roadless Rule. I will review this decision with the Attorney General and decide on a course of action."
