Governor Matt Mead issued the following statement on the US Supreme Court's decision on the King vs. Burwell case:
"I challenged the ACA because I did not think this was a good law or a good approach to health care for the United States or for Wyoming," said Governor Mead. "Wyoming and other states lost this challenge in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has again spoken, upholding key provisions of the ACA. We recognize the ACA is the law of the land and that the United States Supreme Court's ruling confirms it is the law of the land. This decision allows 17,000 people in Wyoming to continue to receive a tax credit for health insurance and avoids many potential complications of those individuals losing that credit. Simply stated, this ruling maintains the status quo. It will still be necessary for Wyoming to develop its own path forward for better health care access and better health care for our citizens. I will continue to work with the Legislature on these important issues."
