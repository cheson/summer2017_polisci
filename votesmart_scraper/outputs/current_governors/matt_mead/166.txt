Governor Matt Mead said the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security is addressing concerns raised in an audit of the agency. Independent audits of state agencies are regularly conducted. The Wyoming Office of Homeland Security (WOHS) works closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Both FEMA and WOHS have been working with the Office of Inspector General, which conducted the audit. That audit identified some areas of questionable spending on grants. WOHS is providing additional information to substantiate the grants.
"Since the audit came out in February the Office of Homeland Security has actively engaged in providing additional information to FEMA. We have an obligation to follow all program rules. I have asked Homeland Security to work closely with the Inspector General to provide answers," Governor Mead said. "We are committed to a thorough evaluation."
The audit covered spending in fiscal years 2010-2012 and has nine recommendations to strengthen program management, performance and oversight. The audit notes that three of the recommendations are already resolved and closed. In April, another recommendation was resolved and closed, and the Office of Inspector General acknowledged that WOHS has taken corrective action on three more of the recommendations. WOHS is providing more details about accounting to FEMA to resolve the remaining issues.
Director of WOHS, Guy Cameron, said. "I welcomed this audit so we can improve as an agency. We are working on providing information to the Inspector General to resolve the questions put to us in the audit."
WOHS will report its progress to the Governor and will have a corrective plan in place by August.
