Wyoming Wins Suit to Have Equal Playing Field for Wyoming Travel Industry
Press Release

Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead commended the Wyoming Attorney General Office for its work. The Wyoming Supreme Court affirmed a decision requiring online travel companies to remit sales tax to Wyoming. The Wyoming Department of Revenue believed web-based travel sites were required to collect and remit sales tax on the full price of booking Wyoming hotel rooms. The online companies were charging tax on a reduced price.
"Wyoming is a premier tourist destination. It is our second leading industry and no company in the industry should have an unfair advantage," Governor Mead said. "This decision requires online companies to collect sales tax on the full price paid - the same as customers who book directly with a hotel or motel."
