Location: Cheyenne, WY

Governor Matt Mead announced today three initiatives to promote shooting sports across Wyoming: 1) The Open Ranges Initiative will facilitate locally led partnerships to increase access to public shooting ranges. 2) The Wyoming 100 Initiative will recognize the top 100 shooters in Wyoming and 3) The Governor's Match is a national 2-gun (semi-automatic rifle and pistol) match with some of the best competitors in the country featured. The Governor was joined by representatives of firearms companies from around Wyoming as he signed a proclamation declaring today as "Wyoming's Day at the Range."
"Wyoming is a firearms state and we are proud of that," said Governor Mead. "These initiatives promote safe shooting and participation in shooting sports -- whether that's hunting, target shooting or sanctioned competitions. Working with the Game and Fish Department, the National Rifle Association, the firearms industry and local governments we hope to open more opportunity for people to shoot safely."
"We have a growing firearms industry in Wyoming," continued Governor Mead. "Some of those companies relocated here because of our support for their industry. Some are Wyoming entrepreneurs starting a new business. They are helping to diversify our economy -- we are glad to have them here."
The "Wyoming 100" is an amateur level competition and will be open to all shooters. Rules for the competition will be posted on the Game and Fish website and on Facebook at "Wyoming's Top 100." Competitors must have a Wyoming Conservation Stamp available from the Game and Fish.
