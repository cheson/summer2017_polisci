Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement regarding the 100th Anniversary of Women's suffrage in Montana:
"As the state that elected Jeannette Rankin, the very first woman ever elected to Congress, Montana has a rich history of supporting women's suffrage. On this the 100th Anniversary of women's suffrage in Montana, Montanans should be proud of our past and continue to work to ensure all Montanans have access to a defining right of our democracy - a right so many fought for -- the right to participate in choosing our leaders.
While a woman's right to vote is here to stay, there is still work to be done to ensure full equality - including gender pay equity - in Montana."
