Today, Governor Bullock released the following statement in response to the Obama Administration's further delay in approving the Keystone XL Pipeline:
"I am very disappointed in today's decision by the Obama Administration to once again unnecessarily delay construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.
This project will be a shot in the arm to our economy by creating much-needed jobs, and will advance our domestic energy security. This has been pending for over 5 years. If we made decisions on permits this way in Montana, our economy would grind to a halt. At a time when our national unemployment rate remains near 7%, Montanans demand decisive action from Washington, DC, not further delays."
