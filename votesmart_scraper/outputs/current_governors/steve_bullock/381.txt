Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement on the Montana Supreme Court's decision allowing signature gathering for I-170 to continue:
"I'm pleased that the Montana Supreme Court has unanimously agreed with our view, and made it clear that signature collection on this initiative can move forward. Despite attempts to use procedural tactics to derail this effort, Montanans have consistently shown that they recognize that accepting federal funds to expand health coverage to 70,000 working Montanans, while creating jobs and throwing a lifeline to rural hospitals is the right thing to do. I've said all along that we will get this done, and today we've come one step closer."
