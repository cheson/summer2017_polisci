Governor Steve Bullock today joined Montana small businesses to celebrate their successes and spearhead the first-ever national Small Business Development Centers Day.
"Montana is a great place to do business, and with the support of Small Business Development Centers, entrepreneurs are even more equipped to succeed." said Governor Bullock. "I appreciate the opportunity to celebrate Montana's small businesses who have translated good ideas into a successful business."
During an event at the Stonetree Climbing Center in Helena, Governor Bullock recognized today as the Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) Day. Governor Bullock was also joined by business owners from The Survivor's Boutique, Blacklock Block Manufacturing, and Play "N' Learn Preschool and Daycare. These small Montana businesses worked with local SBDC advisors to develop business plans, purchase space, and hire employees.
"Our impact is exceptional, and this is our time to highlight our advisors and successful businesses that make our program," said SBDC State Director Chad Moore. "We are excited to lead this important national campaign."
"My start-up manufacturing company had many obstacles to overcome, but my SBDC business advisor gave me guidance and resources to get it done," said Tony Blacklock, Blacklock Block Manufacturing owner.
Montana was the creator of today's national campaign to share success stories and notable impacts of SBDCs on the small business community. Read Governor Bullock's recognition of SBDC Day here: http://bit.ly/SBDCDayMT.
