Governor Steve Bullock, joined by Sen. Ed Buttrey, and Holly Blouch announced today that Montana's innovative plan to extend health coverage to thousands of the state's residents has been approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
"For nearly three years, thousands of Montanans have worked and waited for our state to extend health coverage to our friends, neighbors, and family members. Today, I'm pleased to say that wait is over," Bullock said. "This plan will bring Montanans' tax dollars home to expand access to quality affordable healthcare, throw a lifeline to our state's struggling rural hospitals, and reduce the cost shifting to those of us fortunate enough to have insurance."
