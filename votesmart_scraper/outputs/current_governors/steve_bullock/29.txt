Governor Steve Bullock and Lt. Governor Mike Cooney today recognized 13 Montana public schools as the winners of the 2016-2017 SMART (Saving Money and Resources Today) Schools Challenges.
"Schools are leading the way to encourage energy efficiency, conservation, waste reduction, and health promotion across Montana and setting an example for state leaders as we implement Montana's energy blueprint," said Governor Bullock. "It's not just smart -- it's good for schools, good for students, and good for Montana taxpayers."
Through these challenges, schools found ways to improve energy efficiency, promote healthy and environmentally sound practices, and reduce waste by implementing or expanding programs in their schools. Each school will receive a $1,000 award to support their ongoing efforts.
"These students are the future of our state, and they are paving the way for a smarter energy future in Montana schools and communities," said Lt. Governor Cooney. "It's great to see the excitement all across the state as schools and students figure out how to make Montana an even greater place."
This year, nearly 60 public schools from across Montana enrolled in the 2016-2017 SMART Schools Challenge. Together, Montana's SMART Schools have saved more than $252,000 through energy conservation, recycled nearly 100,000 pounds of waste, offsetting 1373 metric tons of CO2 equivalents, and saved 16,118,900 kBTU's of energy.
"It has been such a privilege to participate in and win the SMART Schools Recycling Challenge these last two years," said Alisha Steffan, teacher at Brorson School in Sidney. "Our favorite part of participating was learning about how to reduce the waste in our community and how much trash we throw away that can actually be recycled."
