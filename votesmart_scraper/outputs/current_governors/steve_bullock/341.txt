As students across the state return to the classroom, Governor Steve Bullock is
encouraging Montana students to work hard and take advantage of all of the innovative opportunities that are available in our schools. The message came as part of Bullock's yearly back to school video message to students.
"Thanks to innovation in Montana's classrooms, students like you have opportunities to learn and explore in ways that were unimaginable when I was a student in a Montana classroom just like yours," Bullock says in the video.
The video, which was distributed by the School Administrators of Montana and the Office of Public Instruction, will be shown to public school students as they return over the coming weeks.
The video helps to kick-off Bullock's "Innovation for Student Success" back to school tour. Next week, Bullock, along with Lt. Gov. Angela McLean and Superintendent of Public Instruction Denise Juneau will visit schools to learn more about some of the innovative things happening, including uses of technology as a learning tool, creative teaching techniques, increased access to dual enrollment opportunities, and changes in administrative procedures to better support student success.
Last year, Bullock sent his first video, encouraging students to make Montana proud through their achievement in the classroom.
