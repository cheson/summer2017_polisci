Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement related to the federal government shutdown:
"Montana state government is open and our employees stand ready to serve the citizens of our state. All employees are on the job today, and all Montanans should be demanding that Congress gets its act together before we have to even consider furloughing state employees who are paid partially or fully with federal dollars.
"But don't fool yourself into thinking that this shutdown doesn't matter -- it impacts the services we expect from our federal government and over 10,000 Montana federal employees. This morning we had to send home nearly 600 Montana National Guard soldiers and airmen who are Department of Defense employees. We sent home moresoldiers and airmen than there are members of the US Senate and House of Representatives combined.
"We can have legitimate differences over public policy, but it's embarrassing that the greatest country in the world would shut down our government based on nothing more than political brinksmanship."
