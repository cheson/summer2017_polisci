Governor Steve Bullock announced today 16 Montana counties have received a total of $1.8 million in state funds designed to create or improve existing jail diversion and crisis intervention strategies at the local level for people in a mental health crisis.
"Too many Montanans are suffering with mental illness without access to the help they need," Bullock said. "I'm pleased to support these innovative community solutions and investments that will treat people before they end up in our jails and prisons."
