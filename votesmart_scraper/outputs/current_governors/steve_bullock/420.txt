Governor Steve Bullock announced a grant of $1.15 million to be awarded to Plains Elementary School for a six-classroom addition to the school.
"We owe it to our children to provide them with a safe learning environment. This grant will ensure our kids no longer have to walk along the shoulder of Highway 200 just to get to class or the cafeteria or the library. Instead, they will now be able to attend school on a single, more safely accessible campus," Bullock said.
The grant is part of the Quality Schools project grant awards, which are meant to promote the improvement of school facilities and technology, as well as provide funding for emergency school improvements.
The money will provide for construction of six additional classrooms to create a single K-12 campus. This addition will eliminate the inconvenience of walking across Highway 200 to access the cafeteria, music room, library, special services, nurse, and central office support.
More information on the grant can be accessed through the Department of Commerce Montana Quality Schools Program at 406-841-2770 or DOCQualitySchools@mt.gov.
