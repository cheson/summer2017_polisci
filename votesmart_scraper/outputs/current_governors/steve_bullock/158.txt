Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement following Attorney General Fox's request to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reconsider the final carbon emission rule.
"I support the Attorney General's petition for reconsideration filed today regarding EPA's Clean Power Plan rule. As I have said, in the final rule EPA moved the goalposts and left Montana with one of the most stringent standards in the nation. Under the proposed rule, we had done a significant amount of work to develop possible ways to comply -- but all of that work was tossed aside by EPA in the final rule, sending us back to the drawing board.
We need to address climate change but the EPA final rule is unfair to Montana. Nevertheless, I'm asking a group of Montanans to help me craft a Montana-based solution so that we won't have a plan imposed on us by people in Washington DC."
