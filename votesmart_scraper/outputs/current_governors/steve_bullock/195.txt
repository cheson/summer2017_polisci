Statement
By: Steve Bullock
Date: Sept. 21, 2015
Location: Missoula, MT

During a visit to First Step Resource Center, today Governor Steve Bullock announced the "Protect Montana Kids" initiative to improve systems serving children and families in the state. At the announcement, he was joined by Rep. Kim Dudik, a longtime advocate for vulnerable children.
"One of our most important obligations is to protect child victims of abuse and neglect. Unfortunately, for decades our child and family services system has been overburdened and under-resourced, compromising the ability of frontline workers to effectively do their jobs," Bullock said. "Today, I'm announcing a series of improvements to this system to better serve children and families across Montana. These improvements are an important step as we continue to work to find ways to bolster this system."
