Governor Bullock Statement on Latest Healthcare Bill Analysis
Statement
By: Steve Bullock

Location: Montana

Governor Steve Bullock this morning released the following statement after the release of an independent analysis of the current healthcare bill in Congress projected Montana's Medicaid program would lose $4.8 billion in federal funding and more than 70,0000 Montanans would lose healthcare coverage by 2026.
"Congress is moving full speed ahead to pass legislation that will increase healthcare costs for hard-working Montanans and their families, cut coverage for seniors and kids, and gut protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. And they're doing it behind closed doors," said Governor Bullock. "This report confirms that these proposals will have devastating impacts on Montanans and our state's budget. It's time for folks in Washington D.C. to work across the aisle to increase affordability and quality of health care across America -- instead of gutting Medicaid, a program that works."
Governor Bullock's statement comes as Republicans in the U.S. Senate are rushing forward on a secret plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- a plan written only by Republicans without public hearings or expert input. Senate leadership has already promised this repeal plan will be similar to the House's proposal, which Montanans and Americans have overwhelmingly rejected.
