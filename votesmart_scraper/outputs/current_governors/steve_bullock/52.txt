Standing on the site of what will become a 30-unit affordable housing development in Billings, Governor Steve Bullock today joined community leaders and private-sector partners to break ground for the Red Fox Apartments.
"Every Montanan deserves a safe and healthy place to call home," Governor Bullock said. "We know that kids do better in school when they have a stable home. We know adults will have a better chance at getting to work every morning when they know they'll make rent and have a community of support. And we know that towns in Montana do better when their workers can afford to live where the jobs are."
The State of Montana awarded nearly $3.4 million of Montana Board of Housing credits and $1.2 million of HOME program funding to the Housing Authority of Billings to be used to build 15 one-bedroom and 15 two-bedroom apartments for families earning less than $40,400 a year.
The Red Fox project will be built on land donated by the Housing Authority of Billings on Sioux Drive in the Billings Heights. It will create nearly 40 construction jobs that will generate nearly $3 million in wages.
