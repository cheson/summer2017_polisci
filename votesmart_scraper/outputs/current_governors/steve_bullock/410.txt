Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock's Office of Indian Affairs announced today that it is hosting the 2013 Tribal Relations Training on December 18th, from 8am-4:30pm, at the Best Western Great Northern Hotel in Helena.
"Having strong government-to-government relationships between the state and tribes begins with a mutual cultural understanding," Bullock said. "Ensuring we have strong relationships, will help to benefit all Montana communities--both tribal and non-tribal."
The training titled, "Developing Effective State-Tribal Relations," aims to support state and private sector employees in developing cultural understanding and learning how to work effectively with tribes. Shoshone-Bannock Tribal member, Mark Trahant will be the keynote speaker for the event. Trahant is a renowned author and journalist.
"Tribal governments play an important role in the success of our state," Jason Smith, State Director of Indian Affairs said. "This training will help to provide Montana state employees with a solid understanding of effective ways to build relationships with our tribal nations and native communities."
While this training will focus on some issues that are specific to the needs of state employees, all Montanans are encouraged to attend.
Registration for the event is $100 per participant. Those interested in registering should go to the Department of Administration's Professional Development Center website: www.pdc.mt.gov.
