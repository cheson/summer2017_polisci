Press Release

Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today noted that a report released last week shows that Montana has the highest ranking for entrepreneurial activity of all 50 states, with 530 entrepreneurs for every 100,000 adults.
"The Number 1 ranking confirms what I see when I meet with people in communities all across Montana," Governor Bullock said "Whether I'm talking with an optics firm in Bozeman, a software developer in Polson or a "green' bio-products company in Missoula, it's clear that the economic strength of Montana lies in our small businesses.
"The quality of life we enjoy in Montana, and the quality of our workforce and our education system, all contribute to attracting and inspiring people with a strong entrepreneurial spirit."
The annual ranking was published by the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, a leading indicator of new business creation in the United States.
In its report, the Kauffman Foundation found that the 2012 business start-up rate had declined slightly -- from 0.32 percent of American adults per month starting businesses in 2011, to 0.30 percent in 2012.
