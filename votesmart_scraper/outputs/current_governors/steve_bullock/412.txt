Governor Steve Bullock and BNSF Railway Foundation announced a $20,000 donation to the Montana Honor Flight at the Brawl of the Wild football game today in Bozeman. The donation will be used to fly Montana veterans to Washington D.C. to visit their memorials.
The donation was presented prior to kickoff of the 113th Brawl of the Wild in Bozeman. The Honor Flight Committee was also named Volunteers of the Game by the Governor's Office of Community Service.
"Our veterans have given so much, it is an honor to join BNSF to give something back," Bullock said. "The Big Sky Honor Flight has done amazing work to show the gratitude all Montanans have for the service and sacrifice of our veterans."
The Big Sky Honor Flight recognizes American veterans for their sacrifices and achievements by flying them to Washington D.C. to see their memorials at no cost. Top priority is given to World War II and terminally ill veterans from all wars.
"The Big Sky Honor Flight has taken on a responsibility we all share to recognize the service and sacrifice of our military veterans," said BNSF spokesperson Matt Jones. "The BNSF Railway Foundation is proud to be part of that effort."
To date, the Big Sky Honor Flight has made seven trips to Washington D.C. Approximately 600 Montana veterans have participated in the honor flight, visiting our nation's capital to view the memorials and pay their respects to their fellow soldiers and America's fallen heroes.
The BNSF Railway Foundation supports efforts to improve the general welfare and quality of life in communities served by BNSF. The Foundation has contributed more than $3.5 million to charities throughout Montana since 2005.
