Today, Governor Steve Bullock and Attorney General Tim Fox announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (USDHS) had backed off of their threat to stop accepting Montana driver's licenses and identification cards for certain purposes listed under the REAL ID Act.
"Montanans do not want or need REAL ID," Bullock said. "REAL ID raises real concerns about the unnecessary collection of Montanans' personal and private information by the federal government. Our state has taken significant steps, independent of a federal mandate, to bolster the security of licenses, while protecting the right to privacy that Montanans hold dear."
