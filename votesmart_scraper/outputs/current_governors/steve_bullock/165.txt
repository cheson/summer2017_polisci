For the first time since 2009, the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Contribution Rate Schedule will be set at its lowest level for Montana employers, saving employers money on their unemployment insurance taxes in 2016. On average, businesses that pay a wage at or above the taxable wage base ($30,500) will see a savings of $106.80 per employee.
Governor Steve Bullock and Commissioner of Labor & Industry Pam Bucy announced that the Unemployment Insurance Contribution Rate Schedule will be adjusted from Schedule 3 to Schedule 1 in 2016. This adjustment means the unemployment contribution rates for most employers in 2016 will be over 26 percent lower than in 2015. The current Schedule 3 average tax rate is 1.52 percent. For 2016, the average rate will be 1.12 percent. As a result, most Montana businesses will see a decrease in UI taxes due for the next year.
"Montana's economy is strong and we have more people working in our state than ever before," said Bullock. "Montana is the best state in the nation for entrepreneurs, this reduction means that these small businesses are able to keep more money in their pockets and focus those funds on growing their operation."
