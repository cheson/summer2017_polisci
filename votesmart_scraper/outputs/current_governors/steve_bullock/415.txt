Press Release

Location: Helena, MT

Governor Bullock announced a grant of $231,493 to be awarded to Lewis and Clark County to replace
two bridges.
"A reliable infrastructure is a crucial part of a thriving community. Replacing these bridges will ensure safe travels for residence and ranching operations," Bullock said. "I'm proud we can be sure our communities' infrastructure is up-to-date for their day-to-day needs, all while creating good-paying construction jobs in the process."
The grant is part of the Treasure State Endowment Program (TSEP) which is designed to help fund infrastructure projects throughout Montana. The grant will replace the Sun Canyon Road Bridge and Flat Creek Road Bridge, both near Augusta. The two bridges are used by residents and ranchers, as well as recreational traffic traveling to Gibson Reservoir.
"The grant has saved two bridges in Lewis and Clark County," commented Lewis and Clark County Public Works Director Eric Griffin. "The Treasure State Endowment Program is great--both for Lewis and Clark County and for the State of Montana."
More information on the grant can be accessed through the Community Development Division at 406-841-2770or e-mail DOCTSEP@mt.gov.
