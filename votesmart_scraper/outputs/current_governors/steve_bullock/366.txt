Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today announced that more than $1.7 million to rebuild infrastructure damaged in the March floods and ice jams will soon be distributed.
"Montana communities continue to face the impacts of flooding from this past March," Bullock said. "I'm pleased that these communities will begin seeing these crucial resources that will help them recover."
The Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide $1.35 million, or 75 percent, of the expected cost for 43 projects across the state. The Montana Disaster and Emergency Services Division will provide more than $445,000 for the other 25 percent of the costs.
The grants will be distributed to 15 counties, towns and state agencies to repair damage from the floods and ice jams of March 1-16. The projects are primarily for road repairs, debris removal and emergency protective measures.
Other projects remain under review awaiting documentation. Additional funds for hazard mitigation grants will also be made available.
Upon Governor Bullock's request, President Obama declared 15 Montana counties eligible for disaster funds to repair public infrastructure on April 17. The declared counties are: Broadwater, Dawson, Golden Valley, Jefferson, Lake, Musselshell, Park, Pondera, Prairie, Ravalli, Richland, Rosebud, Sanders, Stillwater and Wheatland
