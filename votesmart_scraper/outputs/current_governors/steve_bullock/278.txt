Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement on President Obama's decision to veto legislation related to the Keystone XL pipeline:
"While I understand the president's desire to protect his office from what he sees as congressional overreach, the time for political statements is over. Montanans need an answer on Keystone, and I urge the president to approve the pipeline with measures to protect communities and private property rights as quickly as possible."
