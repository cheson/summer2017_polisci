Montana's done a lot of things right during the Great Recession.
We're one of two states that weathered the storm of difficult economic times consistently maintaining a budget surplus and an unemployment rate 2 percent below the national average. Our success is grounded upon making responsible decisions about budgeting and saving, making common-sense cuts when necessary and working hard to support a diverse economy.
Our state's history taught us the danger of putting all of our eggs in one basket. As a result, Montana's economy is one of the most diverse in the United States, with thriving traditional industries like agriculture and mining, to cutting-edge businesses built on information technology and biotech.
