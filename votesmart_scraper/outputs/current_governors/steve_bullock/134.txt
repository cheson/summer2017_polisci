St. James Healthcare Clinical Nurse Leader Danette Melvin, said 69 percent of the hospital's Registered Nurses are earning their bachelor's degrees in nursing -- an increase from 49 percent 5 years ago.
Montana Tech is transforming into a state leader in training nurses to meet increasing demand.
Gov. Steve Bullock can testify to that.
Showcasing Tech's spanking-new four-year nursing degree, the governor, teaching faculty and other luminaries on Tuesday pumped up students and others about the expanding profession.
"Montana's health care industry continues to grow by leaps and bounds and as a result is creating more high-wage jobs for our students," said Bullock.
Commissioner Pam Bucy said Montana Department of Labor and Industry employment projections estimate the industry will add about 1,300 jobs every year until 2024.
"We need to start educating students about how great these jobs are," said Bucy during a roundtable discussion about Montana's health care future. About 35 people attended, including Tech Chancellor Don Blackketter and Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney.
All toured the nursing department and high-tech simulation training lab with the governor afterward.
