Montana Governor Steve Bullock today honored the 2016 Good Neighbor Award winners and awarded each of the honorees a framed certificate featuring a photograph by Evelyn Cameron, a famous Montana photographer.
Nominees for the award are sought each fall and judged by representatives of The Nature Conservancy of Montana, Artemis Common Ground, the Montana Association of Land Trusts, the Montana Council of Trout Unlimited, the Montana Governor's office, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and Chris King who is a representative from the ranching community.
"In Montana, being known as a good neighbor is an honor and reflection of the pride and commitment one has to their land, community, and state," said Governor Bullock. "This year's honorees represent the best our state has to offer in the way of cooperation, stewardship, and community spirit."
The concept for the Montana Good Neighbor Award grew out of a desire to honor and recognize the spirit of community that was a hallmark of Montana's traditional ranching and rural life, according to Brian Kahn, president of the Artemis Common Ground and one of the founders of the award.
