Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock and Montana Department of Commerce Director Meg O'Leary announced the award of $128,026 for seven economic development and business planning projects in Bozeman, Libby, Missoula and Butte. The projects range from a market research report for a proposed micro-malting facility, a feasibility study of production capacity for a beef-based energy snack bar, and the development of a
conceptual design for a new Welcome Center near Yellowstone National Park.
"Montana's economy depends on entrepreneurs who are willing to take risks in order to create job opportunities for themselves and other Montanans," said Governor Bullock. "Through these grants, we're able to help Montana business owners and communities strategically plan for future business success and continued economic growth."
The funds are being made available through the Big Sky Economic Development Trust Fund (BSTF). The BSTF Category II Planning Project grants are awarded to local Certified Regional Development Corporations (CRDCs), tribal governments and local economic development agencies to assist in planning efforts to promote longterm stable economic growth in Montana.
"These funding programs are proven economic development tools that expand Montana's economy," said Director O'Leary. "All of these grant dollars go towards helping Montana businesses and communities invest wisely in their main streets and provide good-paying jobs for Montanans."
The projects awarded support several key objectives of the Governor's economic development plan for the state, called the Main Street Montana Project, including increasing awareness of Made in Montana products, supporting and promoting the development of value-added agricultural processing facilities and supporting Montana's entrepreneurs and small businesses.

"Support from the State's Big Sky Trust Fund program is an important part of helping us meet our growing demand. Continuing to grow and produce our product is very important to us and part of our brand story," said Cooper Burchenal, owner of Omnivore, Inc.
