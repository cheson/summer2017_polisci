Governor Steve Bullock this morning announced T-Mobile will expand high-speed wireless broadband access in Montana. Governor Bullock expressed his support of T-Mobile's agreement with Charter Communications through a letter to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Tom Wheeler:
"Montana's economy is strong and we are seeing great opportunities for businesses to grow and expand all across the state," said Governor Bullock. "Increased access to high-speed internet and enhanced mobile coverage will further strengthen our state's business climate and enable Montana businesses to thrive in a global economy and create more job opportunities for hard-working Montana families."
T-Mobile has agreed to buy Charter Communications wireless licenses in Montana and plans to aggressively build out the state for high-speed wireless broadband. Governor Bullock expressed strong support to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler for the transfer of three of Charter's 700 MHz spectrum to provide Montana residents with increased access to high-speed services.
Through the purchase of these three licenses, which cover nearly all of Montana east of I-15 and four counties in northwestern Wyoming, T-Mobile will be able to provide 4G LTE wireless broadband to underserved areas covering nearly 1.1 million people in Montana and Wyoming.
