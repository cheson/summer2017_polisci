Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement on the 80th anniversary of Social Security being signed into law:
"Since being signed into law 80 years ago, Social Security has provided protection for generations of Americans. It is not only a responsible economic policy, it is also a promise to the men and women who helped build our state and nation--a promise that if you work hard and play by the rules, you will have certainty rather than struggle in your senior years. It is a promise that I will fight to keep for future generations and resist any efforts to shortchange the middle-class workers who have lived up to their end of the bargain."
