Today, Governor Steve Bullock touted a report from the Tax Foundation which found that Montana continues to have one of the best business tax climates in the nation. Montana was ranked as having the sixth best tax climate in the study. The Tax Foundation is a non-partisan tax research group.
"This is yet another sign of all of the benefits of doing business in Montana," Bullock said. "This report shows that in addition to the highly-trained workforce, and unmatched quality of life, Montana also offers new and existing businesses a climate that will allow them to thrive."
Through his Main Street Montana Project, Bullock has made it a priority to create a climate that attracts, retains, and grows businesses. To this effort, Bullock has:
-Cut taxes for every Montana business, and eliminated the business equipment tax for two-thirds of companies
-Secured $45 million for workforce development partnerships to meet the needs of private businesses
-Froze tuition at Montana colleges and universities, and made historic investments in K-12 education
Montana's unemployment rate has dropped 1.2 percent in the last 20 months, with 2014 seeing historic job creation.
