Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement regarding the release of the 2015 Montana Graduation and Dropout Report by Superintendent Denise Juneau:
"Montana's graduation rates are at record levels and the future is bright for our students, our state, and our economy. Putting more students on a path to success will better prepare Montanans for the jobs of tomorrow and is a critical step in addressing Montana's future workforce needs.
I am pleased with the our partnership with Superintendent Juneau through Graduation Matters Montana and proud of each community, school district, teacher, and student who has worked hard to bring Montana's graduation rates to the highest levels. More Montanans graduating from high school, attending college, and entering our workforce is critical not only for students and their own futures, but also for our state's economy and future growth."
