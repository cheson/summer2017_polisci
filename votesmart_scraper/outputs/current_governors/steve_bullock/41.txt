Governor Steve Bullock is proposing a constitutional amendment to prohibit a statewide general sales tax and allow Montanans' voices to be heard at the ballot box.
"Montanans have rejected time and time again a statewide sales tax by large margins," said Governor Bullock. "Our Montana Constitution needs to reflect our Montana values -- and Montanans do not value a statewide general sales tax that hurts hard-working, middle-class Montana families who are already paying their fair share."
Senate Bill 351, sponsored by Senator Dick Barrett, had its first hearing today in Senate Taxation. The bill proposes a simple change to Montanan's Constitution to prohibit a statewide general sales tax and end the possibility that future legislators and Governors could impose a statewide general sales tax. If the amendment is approved by the Legislature, the people of Montana would be given the final say at the ballot box in 2018.
The proposed constitutional amendment would only apply to a statewide, broad general sales tax.
In 1971, Montana voters rejected a statewide sales tax more than two to one. In 1993, Montana voters rejected it three to one. Montana's Constitution currently limits a statewide general sales tax to 4%.
