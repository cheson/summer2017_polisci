Montana's economy added over 10,000 jobs in 2015, according to the latest labor statistics.
The unemployment rate finished 2015 by declining slightly by one-tenth of a percent to 4 percent in December. The U.S. unemployment rate remained unchanged over the month at 5 percent.
The state's economy added 10,224 jobs over the year for a growth rate of 2.1 percent compared to the long-term average of about 1 percent. It marked the second year in a row of over 2-percent growth. In 2014, Montana had one of its strongest years for the state's economy, adding 12,633 jobs for a job growth of 2.6 percent. The state added 7,880 jobs in 2013 for a 1.7 percent growth rate.
"More Montanans are working today than ever before and that's a testament to the small business environment we've worked so hard to strengthen over the last three years," said Gov. Steve Bullock, who noted that Montana's unemployment rate now falls a full percentage point below the national average. "But our work isn't done. My responsibility is to keep moving Montana in the right direction by holding the line on taxes, getting rid of red tape and making responsible financial decisions that keeps our budget balanced and keeping our rainy day fund intact."
Both total employment and payroll employment levels showed little change in December, labor officials said. Payroll employment indicated a gain of 600 jobs, with more construction jobs and fewer retail jobs than usual for December. Total employment estimates, which include agricultural and self-employed workers along with payroll workers, indicate a statistically insignificant loss of 201 jobs, labor officials said.
"Our economy continues to add jobs and Montanans can look forward to a positive outlook for the new year," said Labor & Industry Commissioner Pam Bucy. "We continue to build partnerships with businesses and higher education to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our worker training systems."
The non-seasonally adjusted jobless rate in Flathead County was 6.2 percent in December, the sixth highest in the state and the same as a year ago. The county finished 2015 with a workforce of 40,900, adding 711 jobs over the year, according to state statistics.
