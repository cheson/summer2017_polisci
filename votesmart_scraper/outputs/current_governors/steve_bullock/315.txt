Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement on the court ruling bringing marriage equality to Montana:
"Today's decision ensures we are closer to fulfilling our promise of freedom, dignity, and equality for all Montanans. It is a day to celebrate our progress, while recognizing the qualities that bind us as Montanans: a desire to make a good life for ourselves and our families, while providing greater opportunities to the next generation.
I have instructed my administration to quickly take all appropriate steps to ensure that we are recognizing and affording the same rights and responsibilities to legally married same-sex couples that all married Montanans have long enjoyed."
Bullock has long been a champion for equal rights for all Montanans. He was the first state official to express his support for this lawsuit, and earlier this year became the first Montana Governor to speak at a Montana Pride Celebration
