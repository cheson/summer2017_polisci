Here in Montana, we don't need permission to lawfully access public lands and waters at public access points. But if you watched the first gubernatorial debate, then you know that Mr. Gianforte doesn't understand this. So we printed Don't Need Permission slips.
They fit in your wallet so you can always have it on you if you run across someone who is trying to keep you from accessing a public access point. Click the link below and we'll send you your Don't Need Permission slip right away!
