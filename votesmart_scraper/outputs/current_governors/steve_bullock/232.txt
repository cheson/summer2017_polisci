Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today issued an executive order declaring a state disaster to exist in Powder River County, and authorized the expenditure of funds to assist in the community's recovery.
"Several weeks of storms have proven incredibly damaging to the infrastructure of Powder River County and caused difficulty for their residents," Bullock said of the declaration. "In Montana, when a neighbor is struggling we offer a helping hand. I'm pleased that the state is able to provide some much needed assistance to this community."
The declaration, which came at the request of Powder River County Commissioners, is in response to a series of storms in late May through mid-June that brought heavy rain and caused rivers to rise to near flood levels. It is estimated that the storms caused more than $223,700 in damage, including damage to bridges and roads that are essential for the health, safety and welfare of residents of the county.
