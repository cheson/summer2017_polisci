Today, in conjunction with his Main Street Montana Plan, Governor Steve Bullock announced a $45,000,000 aid package for Eastern Montana communities impacted by oil development in the Bakken area of Montana.
In announcing the aid package, Bullock said: "The Bakken development is bringing jobs and economic opportunities, but it's also posing challenges to local communities that we could not have imagined even a decade ago. Soaring prices, inadequate infrastructure, and a massive influx of new residents is vexing local governments like never before. Some of these challenges require solutions that can be handled at the local level, but many of them require help and resources from the state. As Governor, I am committed to helping impacted communities deal with these challenges."
The package, entitled the "Eastern Montana Impact and Infrastructure Project," is defined by three main initiatives:
 a $45,000,000 grant program to cities, towns, tribal governments, and water and sewer districts, financed through state bond proceeds;
 an immediate reduction in the State Revolving Fund (SRF) interest rate from 3.0% to 1.25% for construction projects;
 and local access to expert technical assistance -- dubbed "Rapid Response Teams" in the areas of land use planning, affordable housing, and grant application processing.
The reduction in the SRF interest rate, which leverages the state's sterling bond rating, is projected to save local governments millions of dollars in interest payments, and the Rapid Response Teams, will be implemented immediately. The grant program and its bonding component will require legislative approval during the 2015 legislative session.
