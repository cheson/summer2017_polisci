Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today announced $500,000 in grants to support the production of 11 new film and multimedia projects taking place in Montana, stimulating local economies and providing job opportunities for Montanans.
"Highlighting Montana's beauty and richness of character on the big screen while creating local jobs is a win-win," said Governor Bullock. "Film production in Montana boosts our strong economy and supports additional job creation in our local communities."
The Big Sky Film Grant offers funding to resident filmmakers, filmmakers looking to shoot in-state, in-state production companies, and filmmakers taking Montana-made films to internationally juried film festivals. Administered through the Montana Department of Commerce, the grant provides funding for Montana-centric content that shows the state in an indelible light and can be used for promoting Montana as a travel and filmmaking destination.
"The biggest challenge for an independent production shooting on location is to find the right combination of story authenticity and accessibility," said Ed Parks, Producer (The Ballad of Lefty Brown). "We are grateful to have the support of Montana and overwhelmed by such natural beauty."
