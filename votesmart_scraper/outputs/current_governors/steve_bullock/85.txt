Whopper: Gianforte Misleads Montanans About Bullock's Leadership on Timber
Press Release

Location: Helena, MT

As Greg Gianforte continues to bet against Montana and its strong economy under Governor Steve Bullock, the Bullock campaign released another misleading claim from Gianforte as part of its #WhopperWednesdays series.
This Wednesday's "whopper" shows Gianforte misleading Montanans about Steve Bullock's leadership on timber policy.
Gianforte authored a misleading opinion piece claiming that Bullock has "failed to lead on timber policy."
But groups like the Montana Wood Products Association aren't buying this whopper. Their own Executive Director told MTN news that Bullock has "done more than any other governor has done" to help expedite timber sales.
This comes just weeks after Gianforte was caught misleading Montanans about receiving an endorsement from the Montana Wood Products Association.
What a whopper!
The #WhopperWednesdays series will look at different "whoppers" made by Greg Gianforte on the campaign trail.
