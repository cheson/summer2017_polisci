Montana Governor Steve Bullock issued the following statement after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced its record of decision to delist the Yellowstone Grizzly Bear.
"The recovery of the iconic Grizzly Bear is a remarkable success story -- one which we should celebrate while remaining focused on protecting the very habitat that made recovery possible," said Governor Bullock. "Montana embraces the responsibility of managing wildlife and we look forward to continuing the collaboration and responsible stewardship that led to this significant milestone."
The recovery of the Grizzly Bear is the product of decades of dedicated collaboration among state, federal and tribal land managers and countless private landowners and nonprofit partners.
The proposed rule would delist grizzly bears throughout the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming in a Demographic Monitoring Area (DMA) that includes the recovery zone and an additional surrounding area totally toughly 30,000 square miles (19+ million acres).
