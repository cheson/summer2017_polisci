Governor Steve Bullock today celebrated the completion of Hillview Apartments in Havre at a grand opening event. In 2013, the Hillview Apartment rehabilitation project was awarded $625,000 of low-income housing tax credits through the Montana Board of Housing. The Montana-based development team from GMD Development, LLC and Homeword Inc. were alongside Bullock for the ribbon-cutting ceremony that included residents of the complex and locals from the Havre community.
"Access to safe, quality, and affordable housing is a cornerstone of a strong community," said Bullock. "I'd like to congratulate everyone on the successful completion of this important project in Havre."
