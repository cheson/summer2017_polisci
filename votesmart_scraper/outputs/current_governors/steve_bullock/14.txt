Montana Governor Steve Bullock issued the following statement after President Trump announced his intent to withdraw the United States from participation in the Paris Agreement.
"Ask any Montana farmer, rancher, hunter, angler, or skier -- climate change is real and poses a threat to our economy and our way of life," said Governor Bullock. "To not acknowledge that or deal with it in a responsible way is short-sighted and dangerous. In Montana, and in America, we face our challenges head on and work together to find solutions. We do not run away from them or pretend they don't exist."
Last year Governor Bullock released an Energy Blueprint for Montana. The Blueprint provides a framework for preparing a responsible energy future for Montana -- one that drives economic growth and creates good-paying jobs with new technologies that allow the state's coal plants to generate energy with less pollution, builds more renewable energy, and encourages innovation and energy efficiency.
