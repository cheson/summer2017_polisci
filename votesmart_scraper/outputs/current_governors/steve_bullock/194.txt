Governor Bullock, Secretary Jewell, Western Governors Announce Sage Grouse Does Not Warrant Listing on Endangered Species Act
Statement

Location: Denver, CO

Governor Steve Bullock today joined Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and other western governors to announce that the US Department of Interior has decided the Greater Sage-grouse does not warrant protection under the Endangered Species Act. The decision ensures that states will continue to oversee management of the bird.
"Today's announcement is good for our state, our economy, and this iconic bird. Montana's Sage-grouse management plan is the right path forward in a state where 60 percent of the bird's habitat is privately owned," Bullock said. "This decision shows that when Montanans from diverse viewpoints put aside their differences, and focus on addressing a challenge, we can accomplish great things for our state."
