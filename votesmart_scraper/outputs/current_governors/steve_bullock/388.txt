Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock and Department of Commerce Director Meg O'Leary announced a grant of $500,000 to be awarded through the Treasure State Endowment Program (TSEP) to the Town of Plevna.
The Town of Plevna will use TSEP grant funding to replace the Town's water storage tank and replace water mains and fire hydrants within the community. The project will address the undersized capacity of the storage tank and the deterioration and undersized distribution mains.
"A strong infrastructure is an important part of building a strong economy," said Bullock. "This project will address ongoing storage issues and ensure that the water infrastructure is safe and reliable."
The TSEP program is administered by the Community Development Division at the Montana Department of Commerce. The program is funded by interest earnings on the Coal Tax Severance Fund to help local governments, tribal governments, and local water and sewer districts complete public infrastructure improvements, creating jobs and protecting the health and safety of Montana's residents.
For more information regarding the TSEP program, please contact Community Development Division staff at (406) 841-2770 or e-mail DOCTSEP@mt.gov.
