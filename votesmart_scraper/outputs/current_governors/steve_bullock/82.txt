Governor Steve Bullock today announced at the Veterans' Stand Down in Great Falls a new program for Montana Veterans and former Montana National Guard members.
"When our fellow Montanans make the commitment to serve, we make the commitment to do all that we can to support both their mission and their transition back to civilian life," said Governor Bullock. "This new program will deliver a set of no-cost mental health services to Montana's men and women who have worn our nation's uniform with honor and now need support and resources they can use to manage life's challenges."
The new Veterans Assistance Program (VAP) is an extension of the Montana State Employee Assistance Program. In April, Governor Bullock announced benefits of the program would be extended to current Montana National Guard members (approximately 3,800). This program goes one step further and extends benefits to all Montana veterans and former Montana National Guard members.
Montana has the highest percentage of uninsured Veterans in the nation. Not all Veterans are eligible to receive healthcare through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and those who are eligible don't always have full coverage. Too many of Montana's heroes still struggle with long wait times and lack of access to local care. The Veterans Assistance Program (VAP) will provide a more immediate option for Veterans in need. All services are provided free of charge.
