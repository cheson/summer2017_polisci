As part of his efforts to ensure Montana businesses have a deep pool of talented and trained workers, Governor Steve Bullock today announced that the successful Choose Montana business recruitment campaign is expanding to recruit workers from across the nation. The increased focus on workforce recruitment is a significant part of Bullock's Main Street Montana Project.
"Montana is an amazing place to call home, and with rising wages and rapid job creation, now is the perfect time to invite folks from around the country to choose Montana and enjoy everything our state has to offer," Bullock said of the effort. "Workers looking to relocate to Montana for our unmatched quality of life, friendly residents, and amazing outdoor opportunities, now have a robust tool to help them find a good paying job to support themselves and their family."
