Governor Steve Bullock today highlighted a new Colorado College State of the Rockies Project Conservation in the West Poll that confirmed overwhelming support for public lands and outdoor recreation in Mountain West states.
"The national political winds change direction every few years, but a passion for the outdoors and strong support for American public lands remain constant in the Mountain West," said Montana Governor Steve Bullock. "Public lands drive our economy and define our way of life in Montana and in surrounding states. We have too much to lose if we allow these national treasures to be put at risk."
Among the results of the poll, 82% of respondents supported improving access to public lands for hunters, anglers, and hunters. Additionally, 94% of respondents supported improving and repairing infrastructure in national parks and outdoor destinations.
Montana's outdoor recreation economy support 64,000 Montana jobs and nearly $6 billion in economic activity. Governor Bullock renewed his support for Montana's outdoor recreation at a capitol rally yesterday.
