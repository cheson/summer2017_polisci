Press Release

Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today made the following statement following a press conference held by Montana Democrats encouraging legislators to work together to invest in infrastructure.
"Montanans have waited too long for infrastructure investments. It's time to put Montana jobs ahead of Montana politics and get this done," Governor Bullock said. "I'm hopeful that by working together, we can ensure that Montana's roads, bridges, water and wastewater systems and schools get the critical investments they need and we create thousands of jobs for hard-working Montanans in the process."
Governor Bullock is proposing a $292 million investment in infrastructure financed through a responsible mix of cash and bonds. The proposal includes Long-Range Building, the Treasure State Endowment Program, Renewable Resource Grants, Resource Development Grants, Quality Schools program investments, and direct loans and grants to local governments.
Bullock is also proposing a long-term solution to Montana's infrastructure funding through the creation of the Build Montana Trust. The Trust will direct coal severance tax revenues into a new sub-trust within the coal tax trust fund to finance infrastructure investments for future generations of Montanans.
