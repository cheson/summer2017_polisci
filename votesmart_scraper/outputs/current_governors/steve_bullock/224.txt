Montana's unemployment rate remained unchanged in June at 3.9 percent. Employment levels in Montana continued to rise over the month, but the unemployment rate held steady due to growth in the labor force. The U.S. unemployment rate decreased by 0.2 percentage points to 5.3 percent.
"Montana's economy continues to grow, adding roughly 8,800 jobs in the first half of 2015," Governor Steve Bullock said. "Strong employment and labor force growth helps ensure Montanans have access to good-paying jobs, and businesses can find the workers they need to drive economic growth."
"We expect strong wage growth in 2015, as businesses compete to recruit workers in this low unemployment rate environment" said Labor Commissioner Pam Bucy. "The Montana Department of Labor and Industry is committed to identifying and training more Montanans to ensure that we have enough workers to meet the needs of Montana employers."
Montana's total employment levels continued to grow, increasing by a few hundred jobs in June, for a total of 12,193 jobs added over the last twelve months and total employment of 504,627. Total employment estimates include payroll employment, plus agricultural and self-employed workers. Payroll employment fell over the month, but has still posted a gain of 2,100 jobs since the beginning of the year.
The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.3 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis, with advances in the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food all contributing. The index for all items less food and energy, also called core inflation, rose 0.2 percent in June.
