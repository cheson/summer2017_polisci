Governor Steve Bullock announced $738,044 to 36 public school districts throughout Montana through the Montana Department of Commerce's Quality Schools Planning Grants Program.
"Our kids should be receiving a twenty-first century education in buildings equipped with twenty first century infrastructure," said Governor Bullock. "Public school buildings across the state will receive updates that improve learning opportunities for Montana students--an investment we can all be proud of."
These planning grants are part of the 2015 Biennium Quality Schools Grant Program funds. The program provides financial assistance to K-12 public schools to improve their facilities and enhance learning opportunities for students. Planning funds are awarded on a competitive basis and may be awarded in dollar amounts up to $25,000, and the applicant district must provide match on a 1:4 basis. Awarded projects include school facility condition assessments, energy audits, Preliminary Engineering Reports (PER), Preliminary Architectural Reports (PAR), and comprehensive Master Plans.
"We're proud to provide Montana schools with additional resources to help maintain and enhance our system of quality public education across the state," said Department of Commerce Director Meg O'Leary. "These funds will create jobs in local communities, while enhancing quality of life and protecting the health, safety and welfare of Montana's public school students."
