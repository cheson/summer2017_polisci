Governor Steve Bullock today announced that his administration has taken steps to ensure there are no negative impacts to Montana Disaster and Emergency Services (MTDES) as a result of a potential federal government shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security.
MTDES employees are funded by both federal and state funds for disaster preparedness and response. As a result of Bullock's efforts, none of the MTDES employees across the state will be furloughed or have their work hours cut.
"Montana's strong fiscal position and prudent fiscal management will enable us to endure yet another federal government budget lapse without any disruption in state services for the people of Montana," said Bullock.
During the federal government shutdown of 2013, Bullock made similar moves to ensure no state services in Montana that are funded by federal dollars were interrupted.
"Unexpected events like a federal government shutdown are exactly why I insist on a rainy day fund, and part of why Montana has been named the most fiscally prudent state in the nation," said Bullock.
