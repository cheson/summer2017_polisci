Dear Fellow Americans,
As we close out this year and look toward the future, we as Montana's elected leaders are focused on the values that reflect our true character. Therefore, we condemn attacks on our religious freedom manifesting in a group of anti-Semites. We stand firmly together to send a clear message that ignorance, hatred and threats of violence are unacceptable and have no place in the town of Whitefish, or in any other community in Montana or across this nation. We say to those few who seek to publicize anti-Semitic views that they shall find no safe haven here.
We offer our full support to the Jewish community, Montana families, businesses, faith organizations and law enforcement officers as they ensure the security of all our communities. We will address these threats directly and forcefully, putting our political differences aside to stand up for what's right. That's the Montana way, and the American way.
Rest assured, any demonstration or threat of intimidation against any Montanan's religious liberty will not be tolerated. It takes all Montanans working together to eradicate religious intolerance.
We are encouraged that so many Montanans from a variety of religious backgrounds have joined us in condemning this extreme ideology.
God bless the great state of Montana and the United States of America.
U.S. Senator Jon Tester
U.S. Senator Steve Daines
U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke
Governor Steve Bullock
Attorney General Tim Fox
