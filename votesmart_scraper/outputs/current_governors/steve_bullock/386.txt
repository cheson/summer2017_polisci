Public Statements
Governor Bullock, Larry Simkins and Bill Johnstone Release Business Plan for Montana
Press Release
By: Steve Bullock
Date: April 2, 2014
Location: Billings, MT

Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, a decision which removes overall limits on individual campaign contributions.
"It seems as if the Supreme Court is determined to give total license to the wealthy to use their resources to drown out the voices of working families in our elections. It's disappointing that Court's majority once again issued a ruling that seeks to turn our elections into auctions. I wish I could say that I'm surprised, but I'm not.
This ruling, along with previous rulings from the Supreme Court's majority, makes it all the more important that we protect our Montana laws that require disclosure and transparency. "
As Montana's Attorney General, Bullock led the fight against the now-infamous Citizens United ruling, defending Montana's century-old "Corrupt Practices Act" all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Because of that fight, Bullock was called, "the biggest threat to Citizens United."
