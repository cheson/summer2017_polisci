Governor Steve Bullock today announced $919,358 in grants to nine research projects in Missoula, Billings, and Bozeman to encourage innovation, cutting-edge research, and high-wage job creation.
"Montana's diverse economy is strong and growing, and these technology projects will help create future business and job creation opportunities," said Governor Bullock. "These cutting-edge investments in research ensure Montana remains a step ahead of other states in keeping pace with rapidly-changing global economy."
The funding is being made available through the Montana Board of Research and Commercialization Technology (MBRCT). MBRCT supports economic development by investing in research projects that have a clear path to commercialization. The Board has funded 225 research projects totaling $42 million since 2001.
A study conducted by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research (BBER) found that the operations of MBRCT "have produced a larger, more prosperous and populous state economy, increasing the tax base since 2000, than would have existed in its absence."
