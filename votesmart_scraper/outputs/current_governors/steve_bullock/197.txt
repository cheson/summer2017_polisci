In honor of National POW/MIA Recognition Day Governor Steve Bullock today was joined by Sue MacPherson of Butte, and Adjutant General Matthew Quinn, at a ceremony to rededicate the Freedom Tree and Montana MIA plaque on that capitol grounds. The memorial recognizes Montana's twenty-two Vietnam veterans who are missing in action.
"We must never forget the sacrifices made by the twenty two soldiers honored by this memorial, as well as those made by all servicemen and women from Montana," Bullock said. "This memorial is an enduring reminder of those who were killed or captured while serving our state and nation."
