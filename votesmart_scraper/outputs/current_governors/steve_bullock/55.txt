Governor Steve Bullock today highlighted an infrastructure project waiting for funding from the legislature in Frenchtown, Montana and reinforced the need to pass a statewide infrastructure bill.
"Infrastructure should not be about wins and losses in Helena -- this is about Montana jobs and investing in our future," said Governor Bullock during the tour. "The only people that will really lose if the legislature fails to pass a responsible, statewide infrastructure bill are the people of Montana. Let's get this done."
House Bill 14, the Governor Bullock's proposed infrastructure plan, advanced through the Joint Subcommittee on Long-Range Planning last week and is currently waiting for a hearing in House Appropriations Committee. The Build Montana Plan would make a $292 million investment in infrastructure financed through a responsible mix of cash and bonds, and create over 1,900 jobs for Montanans.
