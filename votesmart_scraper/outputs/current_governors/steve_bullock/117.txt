Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today recognized the one-year anniversary of the signing of the bipartisan Montana Disclose Act, passed by the legislature last year and signed into law by Governor Bullock on April 22, 2015.
"Today we celebrate signing the Disclose Act into law and renew our commitment to making sure Montana's elections are among the most transparent in the nation," said Governor Bullock. "Montanans deserve and expect fair, transparent, and accessible elections. I, along with all Montanans, believe our elections should be decided by "we the people' -- not by corporations and a handful of millionaires who seek to hide their money and their motivations."
Last year Governor Bullock worked with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to pass the Disclose Act to require the disclosure of all donors to any independent group spending money on state-level elections.
Republican Senator Duane Ankney today also reflected on the one-year anniversary of the bill, saying, "This was never a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. It was a Montana issue. We came together one year ago and passed the Disclose Act. No more shots from the shadows with no trail to follow. All Montanans deserve straight-up elections."
