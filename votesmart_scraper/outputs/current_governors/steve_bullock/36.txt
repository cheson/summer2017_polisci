Governor Steve Bullock's proposal to incentivize businesses to provide on-the-job training for veterans and hard-working Montanans has its second hearing today in the Senate Taxation Committee. House Bill 308, carried by Rep. Casey Schreiner, is one of two bills in Governor Bullock's Quality Jobs Plan to make it easier for businesses across Montana to grow, expand, and create good-paying jobs for Montanans.
"This is a straightforward proposal that would build on our previous work to create a climate that attracts, retains, and grows businesses," said Governor Bullock. "I urge legislators to vote to create jobs for veterans and hard-working Montanans and grow our economy."
If passed, HB 308 will provide businesses a $1,000 tax credit for every position hired where the worker is offered on-the-job training through the Montana Registered Apprenticeship unit, and $2,000 for every Montana veteran hired. Apprenticeships provide earn-while-you-learn training opportunities in almost 1,000 occupations.
