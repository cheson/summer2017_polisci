Governor Steve Bullock announced that seven Montana employers have placed in Outside Magazine's Best Places to Work, a compilation of the nation's top 100 employers.
"Time and time again we are reminded that the best place to do business is in Montana," said Governor Bullock. "We can all be proud that Montana employers are envied by businesses across the country --not only is Montana a great place to play, it's an amazing place to work."
Amongst the ranking 100 was Seeley Lake Elementary, ranked number six, which was highlighted for their commitment to outdoor learning as they use school-owned bikes, canoes, and rafts, and a schoolhouse with a bouldering wall and bike shop. MercuryCSC topped the list for Montana and was ranked number three in the country. The Bozeman-based creative marketing firm was recognized for the company's flexible scheduling policy that allows employees to plan their own hours.
"The recognition is a testament not just to the people who work here, but also to our clients and everyone we associate with," said President and Co-founder of MercuryCSC, Jeff Welch. "Because of Montana's outdoor and recreational opportunities, location really is our only advantage; we would be just some other town in the country if it weren't for these opportunities."
Other Montana businesses ranked are: the ZaneRay Group and River Design Group in Whitefish, Outlaw Partners in Big Sky, along with Ecology Project International and Adventure Life in Missoula.
