Press Release

Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today sent a letter to Montana's congressional delegation encouraging them to work together to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS). In his letter, Bullock highlighted the detrimental impacts on Montana schools, roads and fire prevention efforts if the program is not reauthorized. Montana stands to lose more than $16 million this year if the act is not reauthorized.
"Montana's schools and counties will be hit hard. Many county roads will lose the necessary funding for maintenance and many schools will be suffering huge budget shortfalls," Bullock said in his letter. "I know that each of you share my commitment to the livelihoods of Montanans and the livelihoods of our communities. That is why I am asking for your help in reauthorizing the program."
Bullock's letter noted that thirty-four of Montana's counties will be impacted by the failure to reauthorize the SRS act. Beaverhead, Flathead, Lincoln, Ravalli, and Sanders Counties will all lose more than a million each if the act is not reauthorized.
The 113th Congress failed to reauthorize the SRS Act, which expired in September of last year.
