Press Release
By: Steve Bullock

Location: Helena, MT

Governor Bullock announced a grant of $109,955 to be awarded to Park County to replace the Rock Creek North Bridge near Clyde Park and rehabilitate three additional bridges.
"A reliable infrastructure is a crucial part of a thriving community. Replacing these structurally deficient bridges will ensure safe travels for residence and ranching operations in Park County," Bullock said. "I'm proud we can be sure our communities' infrastructure is up-to-date for their day-to-day needs, all while creating good-paying construction jobs in the process."
The grant is part of the Treasure State Endowment Program (TSEP), which is designed to help fund infrastructure projects throughout Montana. The money will provide the funds needed to replace the Rock Creek North Bridge located ten miles east of Clyde Park. The concrete slab bridge was constructed in 1940, and is structurally deficient. Castle Mountain Road Bridge, Cottonwood Bench Bridge and Indian Creek Road Bridge--all just south of Wilsall--will also undergo repairs.
More information on the grant can be accessed through the Community Development Division at 406-841-2770 or e-mail DOCTSEP@mt.gov.
