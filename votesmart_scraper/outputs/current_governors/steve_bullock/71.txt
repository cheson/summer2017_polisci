Governor Steve Bullock today announced that Fitch Ratings has renewed Montana's high AA+ bond rating.
"My Administration's efforts are paying dividends for Montana's economy and our state's budget," said Governor Bullock. "This rating ensures that the state and local communities can responsibly invest in Montanans' priorities -- like infrastructure -- by leveraging the state's fiscal health."
Fitch cited the following as reasons for renewing Montana's rating:
"increasingly diverse economic base, strong growth prospects, low liabilities and conservative financial practices"
"the state's consistently conservative approach to fiscal management"
"Montana's solid operating performance is supported by ongoing conservative budgeting practices."
raised Governor Bullock's efforts to fix the public pension system without raising taxes, creation of the state's fire suppression fund, and maintenance of a solid rainy day fund.
Governor Bullock noted that, "This is a good reminder to all policy makers that we cannot ignore what has ensured our state's fiscal strength: a $300 million rainy day fund, ensuring we don't spend more than we take in, and using best fiscal practices to govern responsibly."
