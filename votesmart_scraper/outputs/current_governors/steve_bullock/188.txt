New Facility to Relieve Overcrowding at Montana State Hospital
Statement
By: Steve Bullock
Date: Sept. 29, 2015
Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today announced a new treatment facility for Montanans committed to Montana State Hospital (MSH) due to alleged or adjudicated criminal actions. The new facility in Galen, Montana will reduce pressures on MSH -- the hospital is licensed for 216 beds, but the current occupancy is 253 - and provide a greater level of treatment and security to conduct client evaluation and treatment, improve client and staff safety and reduce the risk of client flight.
"As we make historic investments in community mental health services, we must also remember we have a moral and legal obligation to serve Montanans with the most significant mental health needs," said Governor Bullock. "This facility will provide much needed relief to our acute care mental health facilities' patients and employees, but cannot be our only effort to reduce the overcrowding at Montana State Hospital. We must do all we can to ensure Montanans are only committed there as a last resort."
