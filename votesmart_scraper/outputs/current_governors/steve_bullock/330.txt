Location: Helena, MT

Today, Governor Steve Bullock announced that his request for a Presidential Disaster Declaration was approved by President Obama. Bullock made the request after severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding caused damage in Blaine, Carter, Musselshell, Petroleum, and Valley counties and the Fort Belknap Reservation within Blaine County.
"I'm pleased that the President has approved the request for a disaster declaration for the affected counties," Bullock said. "With these additional resources, we'll be able to more effectively assist the Montana families and counties that suffered losses during the storms and resultant floods."
The Presidential Disaster Declaration provides additional resources to the state from the federal government for cleanup and recovery.
Under the disaster declaration, the affected counties are eligible for federal assistance for emergency work and repair or replacement of disaster damaged facilities.
Bullock also announced that the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is making low interest federal disaster loans available to small, nonfarm businesses in Blaine, Fergus, Garfield, Petroleum, Phillips and Valley counties. According to the SBA, "these loans offset economic losses because of reduced revenues caused by heavy rains, flooding and hail that occurred August 22 - September 24, 2014."
Finally, Bullock announced that he has secured a secretarial disaster declaration from the United States Department of Agriculture in response to damages and losses caused by the heavy rains and flooding that occurred from August 22 through September 24th.
