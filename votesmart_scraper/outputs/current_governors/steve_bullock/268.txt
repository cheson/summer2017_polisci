Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement on the passing of Governor Tim Babcock:
"Whether in the Montana Capitol building or in the battlefields of Europe during Battle of the Bulge, Governor Babcock had a long and storied history of service to our state and nation. He was a pillar of politics in Montana for over 50 years, stepping up to lead our state when tragedy struck and helping to guide it through the years that followed. His presence will be missed, but his legacy and contributions to Montana will live on. Lisa and my thoughts and prayers are with Lorna, and Governor Babcock's grandchildren and great grandchildren."
