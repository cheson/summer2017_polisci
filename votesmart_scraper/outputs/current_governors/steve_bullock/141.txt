Press Release

Date: Jan. 28, 2016
Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today presented an economic development report that provides an overview of Montana's strong economy, including economic rankings, employment trends, and key industry sector updates. The report was prepared by the Governor's Office of Economic Development as part of the Main Street Montana Project.
"Montana's economy is strong and the state's ability to work collaboratively with the private sector has never been better," said Governor Bullock. "There is a lot to be excited about right now, from a government that lives within its means, businesses that are constantly innovating and leading the nation in terms of job creation, to growing a highly-skilled workforce that can compete in the global market."
The report covers Montana's current economic rankings, employment trends, key industry sector updates, and accomplishments of the Main Street Montana Project, Governor Bullock's flagship economic development initiative.
"These new opportunities do not come without challenges, however," said Governor Bullock. "As global markets and demand for certain commodities shift, we must focus on sparking innovation, economic growth and good-paying jobs in Montana's traditional and emerging industries."
Governor Bullock noted that Montana consistently ranks in the top ten in the nation for entrepreneurship, business climate, tax fairness, government responsibility, and income growth.
