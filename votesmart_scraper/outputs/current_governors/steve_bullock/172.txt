Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement in honor of Veterans' Day:
"When we ask our men and women in uniform to serve our state and nation--at home or abroad--we're making a commitment that when they return home we will honor their service, ensure they have access to quality medical--both physical and mental, career options, and educational opportunities. In Montana, we're making important progress in fulfilling this commitment, but we must continue our efforts to ensure that those who gave so much defending our freedoms never fall through the cracks."
