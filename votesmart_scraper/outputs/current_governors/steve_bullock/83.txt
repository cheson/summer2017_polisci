New data from the U.S. Census Bureau released today highlights that Montana is number one in the nation for percentage increase in median household income from 2014 to 2015.
"Montana is leading the nation in income growth and it's another sign that our economy is growing by leaps and bounds," said Governor Bullock. "This means more money in the pockets of hard working Montanans. Add this to the fact that Montana is the most fiscally prudent state in the country and we are consistently ranked among the top ten in the nation for innovation, entrepreneurship, and business tax climate -- Montana is definitely on the right track."
Montana leads the nation in household income growth last year according to the new American Community Survey Statistics released today. Montana's median household income grew 6.8% between 2014 and 2015, the highest percentage increase of any other state. Montana also ranked 5th for nominal median household income growth, with a near $3,200 annual increase. All ACS figures in the report are adjusted for inflation rates.
