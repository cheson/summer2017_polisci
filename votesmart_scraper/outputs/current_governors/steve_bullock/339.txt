Today, Governor Bullock announced that Montana has been awarded $2 million by
the US Fish and Wildlife Service to aid in the acquisition of a conservation easement on the Haskill Basin property near Whitefish.
The easement will help protect habitat vital to grizzly bears and Canada lynx and is part of a larger effort to protect the Crown of the Continent in northwest Montana.
"I'm pleased that the US Fish and Wildlife Service recognizes that collaborative efforts in Montana work. We continue to find new and innovative ways to protect our wildlife and wild places, while also protecting our economy and quality of life, because we all work together," said Bullock.
According the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the competitive grants are issued through the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund and are designed to "allow states to work with private landowners, conservation groups and other government agencies to initiate conservation planning efforts and acquire and protect habitat that benefits threatened and endangered fish, wildlife and plants.
