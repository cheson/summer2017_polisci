Press Release

Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today announced that Montana had been awarded $409,615 for outdoor recreation and conservation projects. The grant comes from the popular Land & Water Conservation Fund, through the U.S. Department of Interior.
"Montanans know the value of our public lands, rivers and streams--it's where our memories of hiking, fishing, or floating are created," Bullock said. "We're working to make sure the next generation of Montanans has the same opportunities to explore the wild places that we did growing up here."
The funds come as part of a package of grants announced today by the U.S. Department of Interior.
The Land and Water Conservation Fund was established by Congress in 1964 to ensure access to outdoor recreation resources for present and future generations, and to provide money to federal, state and local governments to purchase land, water and wetlands for the benefit of all Americans. The primary source of revenue for the Land and Water Conservation Fund is from federal oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf.
The funds enable state and local governments to establish everything from baseball fields to community green spaces; to provide public access to rivers, lakes and other water resources; to expand the interpretation of historic and cultural sites; and to conserve natural landscapes for public outdoor recreation use and enjoyment.
Land and Water Conservation Fund grants have been shown to have a significant economic impact. Studies have found that for every $1 invested in land acquisition generated a $4 return on the investment for communities.
