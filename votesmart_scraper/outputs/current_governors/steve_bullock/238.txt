Montana's Personal Income Growth Among Best in Nation
Press Release
By: Steve Bullock
Date: June 25, 2015
Location: Helena, MT

Governor Bullock today announced that Montana personal income growth accelerated in the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015 according the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Data shows Montanans' personal income grew faster under Bullock's leadership than all but 4 states nationally and faster than all surrounding states during this time period. In addition, the state's personal income growth in the first quarter of calendar year 2015 was among the fastest in the nation, with Montana experiencing income growth of 1.2 percent.
"With strong income and job growth, Montana workers are on the job and have more money in their pockets. These numbers show that our state is an economic leader for the nation," said Bullock. "Montana's economy continues to thrive by creating new, higher paying jobs for Montana's hard working residents all across the state."
This growth has Montana outpacing neighboring states North Dakota (0.4%, 43rd overall), South Dakota (-0.8, 49th overall), Wyoming (0.4%, 45th overall), and Idaho (-0.1%, 47th overall).
"Training and educating tomorrow's workforce, creating a climate that attracts, retains and grows businesses, building upon our strong economic foundation, marketing Montana, and nurturing emerging industries and encouraging innovation -- all pillars envisioned by my Main Street Montana business plan -- are paying dividends for Montanans and our economy," said Bullock.
This data follows on the recent reduction in that state's unemployment rate, which dropped to 3.9 percent in May. In addition, Montana's total employment surpassed the half million threshold for the first time ever.
