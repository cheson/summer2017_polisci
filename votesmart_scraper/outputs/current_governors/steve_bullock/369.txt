Press Release

Location: Helena, MT

Governor Bullock released the following statement concerning the legal action filed today in Federal Court challenging Montana's prohibition against marriage equality:
"Montanans cherish our freedom and recognize the individual dignity of every one of us. The time has come for our state to recognize and celebrate -- not discriminate against -- two people who love one another, are committed to each other, and want to spend their lives together.
I look forward to a future where all Montanans have the opportunity to marry the person they love, just as Lisa and I did almost 15 years ago. We are on the path to greater understanding and equality, and we will all be better for it."
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for Montana, Great Falls Division, is brought by Angela Rolando and Tonya Rolando; Chase Weinhandl and Benjamin Milano; Susan Hawthorne and Adel Johnson; and Shauna Goubeaux and Nicole Goubeaux.
