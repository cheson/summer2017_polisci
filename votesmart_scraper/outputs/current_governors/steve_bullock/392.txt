Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock and Montana Department of Commerce Director Meg O'Leary announced a grant of $281,927 to be awarded through the Treasure State Endowment Program (TSEP) to Glacier County.
Glacier County will use the TSEP grant, along with local funds, to replace the Pardue Road Bridge (also known as Cut Bank Creek Bridge) with a new bridge. The project will address the failing of the bridge being caused by rotting of the timber deck, cracking and potholes in the asphalt, rusting and pitting of abutments and steel girders, as well as only being posted for 13 tons.
"A strong infrastructure is an important part of building a strong economy," said Bullock. "Replacing this bridge will ensure safe travels for residents and visitors to Glacier County and create good-paying construction jobs in the process."
"This grant will help make some much needed improvements to the infrastructure and safety of our community," Glacier County Commissioner Mike DesRosier said. "Ensuring we have a strong infrastructure is a priority for our community. With these improvements we'll be more appealing to residents, visitors and businesses."
The TSEP program is administered by the Community Development Division at the Montana Department of Commerce. The program is funded by interest earnings on the Coal Tax Severance Fund to help local governments, tribal governments, and local water and sewer districts complete public infrastructure improvements, creating jobs and protecting the health and safety of Montana's residents.
For more information regarding the TSEP program, please contact Community Development Division staff at (406) 841-2770 or e-mail DOCTSEP@mt.gov.
