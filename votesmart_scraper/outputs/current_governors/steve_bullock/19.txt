Montana Governor Steve Bullock today issued the following statement on President Donald J. Trump's 2018 proposed budget:
"Ripping essential services away from thousands of hard-working Montana families and millions of Americans in order to give tax breaks to millionaires and corporations is unacceptable and un-American," said Governor Bullock. "This budget would destroy investments in jobs, education, infrastructure and healthcare, and have devastating impacts on rural states like Montana. Montanans, and all Americans, deserve better."
