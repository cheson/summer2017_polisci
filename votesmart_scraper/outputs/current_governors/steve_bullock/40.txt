Governor Steve Bullock this morning urged Montana legislators to pass Senate Bill 305 to allow the special election to fill the vacancy of Montana's lone representative in the U.S. House of Representatives to held by mail ballot.
"We sure shouldn't be spending more money to try to get fewer people to vote," said Governor Bullock. "This commonsense proposal is fiscally responsible and supported by hard-working public servants and Montanans all across our state."
Senate Bill 305 has received bipartisan support from clerks and recorders, county commissioners, as well as members from all political parties. The bill passed out of the Senate in February and is being heard today in House Judiciary.
This proposal is anticipated to save taxpayers around $750,000 on the upcoming special election.
Montana will hold a special election to fill the vacancy resulting from Ryan Zinke's appointment as Secretary of Interior on Thursday, May 25, 2017.
