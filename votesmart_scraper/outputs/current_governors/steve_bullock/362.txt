During the summer, students from low-income families who take advantage of the school breakfast and lunch programs often find themselves hungry when those programs are no longer available.
It's with this in mind, that Governor Steve Bullock and First Lady Lisa Bullock today announced that the Montana No Kid Hungry program has awarded more than $20,000 in grants to support local Summer Meal Programs that are adding a site or meal, expanding days of operation, or increasing outreach.
"Summer is a great time for hikes, camping, and spending time on lakes, but for many Montana families it also means reworking their finances and schedules to ensure their kids have access to nutritious meals," Governor Bullock said. "Summer meal programs are a great way for families to ensure their kids have access to nutritious meals in a safe and healthy environment."
"Even during summer, hunger and poor nutrition can have negative impacts on a child's development," First Lady Lisa Bullock said. "These summer meal programs are finding innovative ways to ensure that kids have nutritious meals, served in a safe environment."
Summer meal programs are free to kids and teens ages 18 and younger. They serve nutritious meals, as well as offering fun learning and recreational activities so kids and teens can stay active and spend time with friends, while enjoying healthy meals. There is no application to fill out and programs do not require proof of income.
In 2013, nearly half a million meals were served at Montana Summer Food Service programs. There are currently 174 summer meal programs in Montana, with on average more than 8000 kids participating daily.
