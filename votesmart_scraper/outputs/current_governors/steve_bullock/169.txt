This week, as Montana families prepare for their Thanksgiving meals, Governor Steve Bullock is touring the state to highlight the efforts of schools, nonprofits, and organizations in combatting childhood hunger and ensuring kids have access to the nutritious meals they need to succeed. The tour includes visits in Lame Deer, Missoula, Browning, Kalispell, Helena, and Livingston.
"Giving Montana children every opportunity to succeed starts with ensuring they never have to worry about where their next meal comes from," Bullock said. "Childhood hunger is a solvable problem. By working with schools and community partners, we have provided more and more of Montana's kids with access to the meals that are so important to their future."
