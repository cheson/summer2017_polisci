Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement following the successful passage of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act.
"With the passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act, Montana educators will no longer be restricted by the failed requirements of the No Child Left Behind laws, freeing them to better incorporate their creative and innovative talents into the classroom. We know that Montana's public schools and our students are much different than New York, California or Virginia. The ESSA recognizes our ability to determine the best way to support and educate the students of our state, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach written in Washington D.C. Equally important are the provisions the new Act provides to continue supporting preschool education helping to ensure access to free, quality early education to our Montana kids."
