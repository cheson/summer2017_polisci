Bullock Statement on Failure of Constitutional Amendment to Undo Citizens' United Ruling
Press Release

Governor Bullock released the following statement concerning failure of a bill in the United State Senate that would undo the impact of the Citizens' United decision:
"Montanans believe that our elections should be decided by "we the people,' and not by shadowy dark money groups, that seek to hide their money and motivations. We've already seen the negative impacts of the Citizens' United decision on Montana elections, as anonymous attack ads flood our televisions and mailboxes with false attacks.
I'm disappointed that obstruction in the Senate has prevented our nation from taking an important step towards correcting the Citizens' United decision. While the failure of this bill is a set-back to restoring faith in our election system, it is by no means an end to our efforts to ensure that elections are decided fair, transparent, and accessible."
As attorney general, Bullock led the effort to preserve Montana's 100-year-old Corrupt Practices Act, taking the case for the state's citizen democracy all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. His office defended Montana's campaign finance limits and disclosure laws against a wave of lawsuits filed by American Traditions Partnership and other dark money groups. He has been called "the biggest threat to Citizens' United."
