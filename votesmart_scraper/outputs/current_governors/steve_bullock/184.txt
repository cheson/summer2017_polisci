Governor Steve Bullock announced today that $1 million in funding is available over the next two years to reimburse health facilities that provide short-term voluntary inpatient care for individuals in mental health crisis.
The 2015 Legislature appropriated the funds to divert individuals from commitment to the Montana State Hospital. The program will serve approximately 100 individuals over the next two years.
"This funding will provide immediate help to Montanans experiencing a mental health crisis, and ensure fewer people require care at the Montana State Hospital," Bullock said. "This is yet another example of how Montana has strengthened the entire mental health system, from community-based services to acute care facilities."
