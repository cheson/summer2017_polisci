Governor Steve Bullock, along with Montana Rail Link President Tom Walsh and Commissioner Pam Bucy today highlighted a new private-public partnership between Montana Rail Link and the Montana Registered Apprenticeship program at the Montana Department of Labor & Industry. This new partnership will help train more Montana workers, giving them the skills and tools they need to succeed in today's job market.
"Apprenticeships have been used for generations in Montana and are a vital tool for creating a pipeline of highly trained workers," said Governor Bullock. "Apprenticeships give Montanans the chance to earn a paycheck and support a family while learning the hard and soft skills needed to have a good-paying job and grow the economy."
Montana Rail Link has been a long-time practitioner of apprenticeships, but recently began working with the Montana Registered Apprenticeship program directly administered by the Montana Department of Labor & Industry.
"For a long time, we've kept our signal and mechanical departments' apprenticeship programs in-house," said Walsh. "By working with the Montana Registered Apprenticeship program, we have been able to expand our reach to potential apprentices and raise the profile of this vital tool for our workforce."
Apprenticeships in Montana have recently gained a higher profile as a valuable tool to train Montana's workforce.
"Apprenticeships are critical in making sure Montana businesses of any size are filling their labor force with the talent they need," said Commissioner Bucy. "With almost 700 apprenticeship sponsors providing training in over 50 occupations, we continue to see how important this model is for our state, especially once they receive their nationally recognized industry credentials."
