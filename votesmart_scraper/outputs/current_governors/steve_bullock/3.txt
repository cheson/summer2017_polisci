Governor Steve Bullock Friday spoke to a crowd of local officials and state leaders at the grand opening of 38 affordable homes in Great Falls. The newly-built accessible apartments are for seniors and those living with a disability and funded by more than $7 million from the Montana Department of Commerce HOME Investment Partnership and Housing Credits programs.
"Montana seniors have helped to build our state and make it a place we can be proud to call home," said Governor Bullock. "These new homes will provide a safe and affordable place for aging Great Falls residents for many years to come and ensure they can continue to live and thrive in a community they love."
The Voyageur Apartments will be home to Great Falls seniors aged 55 and older, and people living with a disability who earn less than 60 percent of the Area Median Income. That's an annual salary of about $25,440 for a one-person household. The rental homes will remain affordable for at least 31 years.
The three-story residence includes accessible physical spaces and social supports to allow seniors and disabled residents to age in place in a setting that promotes independence.
The $8.2 million project was put together by Accessible Space Incorporated (ASI), a nationally-recognized leader in wheelchair accessible housing. Other funding sources for the property include the Great Falls HOME Program, US Bancorp, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago Affordable Housing Program.
