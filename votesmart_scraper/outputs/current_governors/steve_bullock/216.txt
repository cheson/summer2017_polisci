Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement on the Montana Supreme Court's decision upholding the 24/7 sobriety program that he implemented as attorney general:
"When it came to repeat DUI offenders, Montana had been doing the same thing for decades and expecting different results. As Attorney General, I led the effort to build the 24/7 Program, and worked with a bipartisan coalition of legislators and law enforcement to expand it statewide. Today's ruling will ensure that this program continues to save lives, make our highways safer, and hold drunk drivers accountable for their actions."
