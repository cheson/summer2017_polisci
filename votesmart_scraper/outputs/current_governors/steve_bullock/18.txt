Montana Governor Steve Bullock today blasted Republican leaders in Congress after the Congressional Budget Office report confirmed the latest version of the American Health Care Act would have damaging impacts on Montanans and throw the state's fiscal health into jeopardy.
"The House of Representatives has passed a half-baked and heartless proposal that would increase healthcare costs and throw thousands of Montanans off their insurance," said Governor Bullock. "People's lives are on the line. Congress needs to focus on solutions that will increase quality of care and drive down costs for hard-working families across the country instead of giving tax cuts to millionaires and drug companies."
If passed in its current form, the American Health Care Act would:
Increase the average Montanans' premium and out-of-pocket costs by$4,606.
Result in denied coverage or unaffordable prices for 426,400 Montanans with pre-existing conditions.
Shift over $3 billion of costs to the state, posing a threat to the fiscal health of the state.
331,300 Montanans would be subject to lifetime limits, leaving them vulnerable to caps from insurance companies.
Put 77,000 Montanans at risk of losing coverage under Medicaid expansion.
Give 2.1% of the wealthiest Montanans tax cuts while 259,000 Montanans would be at risk of losing their coverage or facing increased costs.
This information is based on a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The American Health Care Act, as written, would mean higher costs, less coverage, and weaker protections for Montanans. The Congressional Budget Office Report can be found HERE.
