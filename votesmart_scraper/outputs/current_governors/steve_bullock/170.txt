In response to the hearing in Congress before House Natural Resources on reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), Montana Governor Steve Bullock again urged Congress to support full mandatory funding and permanent reauthorization of the LWCF, which expired in September. The LWCF uses royalties from the depletion of offshore oil and gas to create and protect natural areas and water resources across the nation.
"The LWCF has made Montana a richer and more productive place to live and work. While some in Washington DC wring their hands over how to move forward, Montanans know a good thing when they see it," Bullock said, adding "The current structure and flexibility that is built into the LWCF has served Montana well."
