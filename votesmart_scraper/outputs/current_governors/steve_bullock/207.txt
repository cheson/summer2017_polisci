In response to damage from frost and hail, as well as low precipitation and extreme heat, Governor Steve Bullock this week requested a Natural Disaster Designation from the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture for Blaine and Lake Counties.
"Above and beyond drought conditions across the state, extreme weather has had significant impacts on agricultural producers in Montana," Bullock said. "I've requested this declaration to ensure producers have the resources they need to recover quickly and continue to bolster our state's economy."
Bullock noted in his letter that a severe hail storm on July 4th which produced golf ball sized hail damaged crops, native range, equipment and farm structures. In addition, livestock producers in Lake County have shown losses of up to 70 percent of pasture and hay yields due to drought conditions.
A USDA Disaster Designation will provide access to financial assistance for agriculture producers impacted by these conditions.
