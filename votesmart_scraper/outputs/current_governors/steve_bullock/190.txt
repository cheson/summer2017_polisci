Governor Bullock Announces Recipients of Tourism Grants
Statement
By: Steve Bullock
Date: Sept. 25, 2015
Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock and Montana Department of Commerce Director Meg O'Leary announced the first round of tourism grants under a new program it launched July 1, 2015. Awarded funds totaling $718,053 will support 12 projects designed to develop and enhance Montana's nearly $4-billion tourism industry.
"Montana's tourism economy is headed for another record-breaking year as more and more non-resident visitors are coming to experience our spectacular, unspoiled nature and vibrant small towns," said Bullock. "And while this is great news for the economy, it also means our local businesses have to adapt to provide for increased demand, and grant programs such as this one help them grow and expand to be able to meet those needs."
