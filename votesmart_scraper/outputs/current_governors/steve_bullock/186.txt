Bullock on LWCF Expiration: "Congress must stop the political games and quickly reauthorize the LWCF"
Statement
By: Steve Bullock
Date: Sept. 30, 2015
Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement on the Congressional failure to reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF):
"Thanks to partisan obstruction, for the first time in its fifty year history, today, Congress failed to reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This important fund has ensured that generations of Montanans had access to public lands and waterways that otherwise would be locked up.
Montanans demand more from Washington. Congress must stop the political games and quickly reauthorize the LWCF."
