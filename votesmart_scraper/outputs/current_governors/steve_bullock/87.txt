Press Release

As Greg Gianforte continues to bet against Montana and its strong economy under Governor Steve Bullock, the Bullock campaign released another misleading claim from Gianforte as part of its #WhopperWednesdays series.
This Wednesday's "whopper" shows Gianforte once again misleading Montanans about putting up a gate and no trespassing signs to keep Montanans from accessing a public easement on his property.
Gianforte told Montana Public Radio that public access across his property was never blocked. But Montana's Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) confirmed that "he put a gate on the line of public access and there was a no trespassing sign on the gate."
What a whopper!
Montana FWP also asked Gianforte to remove "intimidating signs and gate" blocking people from accessing the public easement.
The #WhopperWednesdays series will look at different "whoppers" made by Greg Gianforte on the campaign trail.
