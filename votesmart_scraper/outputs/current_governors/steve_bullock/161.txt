Governor Steve Bullock's statement today on the USDA announcement to fund $40 million to help ranchers and other partners in 11 western states restore and protect sagebrush habitat for greater sage-grouse on privately-owned land.
"This is great news for Montana. One of the keys to conserving sage grouse in Montana is private lands, where most of Montana's sage grouse live. Through their stewardship, Montana landowners have played an important role in conserving sage grouse and sage grouse habitat. They will continue to play an important role in the future by helping to make sure that a listing under the federal Endangered Species Act is never warranted.
Montanans recognize that it is in the best interest of our state, its economy, and our quality of life to maintain state management of sage grouse. Effective conservation requires an "all hands, all lands" approach where we work together collaboratively across all lands and address all threats. These federal initiatives bring much needed resources to Montana to implement our Conservation Strategy."
