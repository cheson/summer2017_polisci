Statement
By: Steve Bullock

Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock joined District Judge Ingrid Gustafson and leaders from both parties today to launch a comprehensive examination of the state's criminal justice system as Montana faces a growing prison population and costly projections to expand capacity.
"A thorough examination of our criminal justice system is long overdue," Bullock said. "We must determine what is driving the growth in our prison population. We're at a pivotal moment as our prison population nears capacity, and we must take a proactive and collaborative approach to establishing a more effective system that bolsters public safety."
