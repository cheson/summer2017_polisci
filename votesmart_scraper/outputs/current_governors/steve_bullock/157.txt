Press Release

Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today issued a decision to allow for the presence of bison year-round in Montana on the perimeter of Yellowstone National Park.
"An adaptive approach to bison management means we look at how we are doing things, assess our effectiveness, and adapt accordingly," said Gov. Bullock. "This decision is a very modest expansion of the conditions under which bison may remain outside of the Park, in response to changing science and changing circumstances on the ground. While at the same time I am confident our livestock industry is protected. Further, I remain committed to continuing to pressure the Park Service to reduce the bison population in the Park, and keep those numbers to manageable levels. "
