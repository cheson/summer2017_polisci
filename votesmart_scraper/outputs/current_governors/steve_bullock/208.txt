With students returning to classrooms across the state, Governor Steve Bullock is encouraging them to take advantage of opportunities that will prepare them for college and careers. The message came as part of Bullock's annual "Back to School" video message to students.
"In Montana classrooms across the state, students are gaining valuable real world skills that will help them secure a job after they graduate high school or be ready to pursue a degree or certificate from one of our world-class two or four year colleges and universities," Bullock says in the video.
