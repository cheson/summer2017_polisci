Governor Steve Bullock today hosted outdoor industry businesses leaders from across the state to discuss ways to grow Montana's outdoor recreation economy and create jobs.
"The outdoor recreation industry is a massive driver of Montana's strong economy with plenty of room to grow," said Governor Bullock. "I look forward to continuing today's conversation with industry leaders as we explore more ways to encourage job creation and economic growth within the outdoor manufacturing industry."
Over 30 outdoor recreation business owners and entrepreneurs attended the Governor Bullock's half-day roundtable discussion about opportunities for growth in Montana's outdoor recreation industry.
"We applaud Governor Bullock for taking the lead in quantifying the important contributors to our outdoor industry," said Marne Hayes, Business for Montana's Outdoors executive director "The people of Montana who work hard outside, enjoy outdoor adventure and raise their families with an ethic of stewardship are critical in driving innovation and fueling economic growth across the state."
"We're grateful for the opportunity to highlight Made in America manufacturing in the outdoor industry," said Sarah Calhoun, founder and owner of Red Ants Pants. "Red Ants Pants were created to solve a problem for women who work hard outside - for the makers and the growers, the builders and the doers. Fueled by the outdoors, our hope is to grow and provide even more opportunities for Made in America manufacturing."
The summit comes on the heels of Bullock highlighting Montana's commitment to public lands and positive business climate in a public pitch to outdoor retailers and businesses.
