With just days remaining in the 65th Legislative session, Governor Steve Bullock today urged Republicans and Democrats to put party differences aside and pass a major infrastructure bill and a fiscally responsible budget.
"Montanans are counting on this legislature to do the right thing and work together to strengthen our state," said Governor Bullock. "In the final days of the session, I expect each legislator to put the needs of their constituents ahead of divisive party politics and invest in Montana communities, Montana workers, and Montana students."
Governor Bullock has repeatedly said he does not care who gets credit for passing an infrastructure, only that it gets done, because an investment in Montana roads, bridges, and schools is far overdue. Bullock has also called for a fiscally responsible budget that doesn't spend more than it takes in, leaves a healthy rainy day fund, and investments in programs that protect Montana's most vulnerable.
The Montana Legislature is on day 79 of 90.
