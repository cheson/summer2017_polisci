Today, Governor Steve Bullock and Montana Department of Commerce Director Meg O'Leary announced the recent award of $600,000 to the City of Missoula. The grant will be used to assist low- and very low-income households to provide down payment and closing cost assistance to prospective homeowners. The funds are being made available through the Montana Home Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and administered by the Montana Department of Commerce.
"Providing these funds to the City of Missoula will give some of our fellow Montana citizens the extra boost they need to become homeowners and strengthen the social and economic ties to their neighborhoods and community," said Bullock.
The City is working with the District XI Human Resource Council to distribute the financial assistance, which can provide each income eligible household up to $35,000 of assistance.
"The City is pleased to be able to continue providing down payment assistance funded by this grant to low-income Missoula families through the very successful work of the District XI Human Resource Council," said City of Missoula Mayor John Engen. "That first home purchase is often a key to future economic success, and provides Missoula residents with the stability and pride that comes with homeownership."
