Press Release

Date: Dec. 14, 2015
Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock is requesting EPA to remove the designation of nonattainment with air quality standards that was placed on the Billings area in 2013. The Billings area met, and continues to meet, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for sulfur dioxide (SO2).
Governor Bullock said, "We have worked with the EPA to meet the sulfur dioxide standards under the Clean Air Act. By demonstrating our success we hope to prevent burdensome regulations being placed on Montana and the Billings area."
