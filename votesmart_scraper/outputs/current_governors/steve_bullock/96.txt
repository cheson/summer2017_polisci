Press Release
By: Steve Bullock
Date: July 12, 2016
Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock issued the following statement regarding settlement of the lawsuit by Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC) against the owners of the Colstrip facility, and the commitment by Talen Energy and Puget Sound Energy, the owners of Colstrip Units 1 and 2 to close those units by 2022.
"I stand with the workers and the community of Colstrip in being angry about this settlement outcome. The parties of this lawsuit took care of themselves. I am going to work to take care of the employees and their families," said Governor Bullock. "The task before us is large but achievable: we will protect the people of Colstrip and their families, keep energy flowing out of Colstrip, and harness the energy jobs of the future -- without propping up out-of-state corporations with taxpayer resources."
Governor Bullock is reaching out to community leaders, including Colstrip Mayor John Williams, Senator Duane Ankney, and Representative Geraldine Custer, to tell them that the state will continue to have discussions about options for the units at Colstrip.
Tomorrow, Wednesday, July 13 Governor Bullock will be meeting with Angela Martinez, the new Regional Director of the Economic Development Administration, to discuss options for economic development grants that would enable Colstrip to strengthen its economic base.
Governor Bullock has directed his Director of Economic Development for Eastern Montana, Liz Ching, to be on the ground in Colstrip and be available to discuss and address concerns from Colstrip leaders and the community.
