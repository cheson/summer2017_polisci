Citing active wildfires and extreme fire danger across the state, Governor Steve Bullock has issued an executive order declaring a fire emergency in Montana.
"Montana is facing extreme fire conditions. This declaration will provide additional resources to the brave men and women fighting these fires,," Bullock said of the declaration. "As firefighters continue to battle blazes across the state, I encourage Montanans to be aware of fires in their area, obey any evacuation orders that may be issued, and ensure they're not taking actions that might spark new fires."
The declaration allows Bullock to mobilize state resources and the Montana National Guard to combat the fires, as well as expend funds to meet the contingencies and needs that may arise from them.
Bullock made the declaration after receiving a fire briefing from the Director of the Montana Department of Natural Resources & Conservation and State Forester.
High temperatures, dry conditions, lightning, and wind have helped to spark fires across the state.
Bullock plans to visit fire locations this week as conditions allow.
