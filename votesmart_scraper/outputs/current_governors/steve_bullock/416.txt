Governor Bullock announced a grant of $212,489 to be awarded to Ravalli County to replace Willoughby Lane Bridge near Stevensville.
"A reliable infrastructure is a crucial part of a thriving community. Replacing the bridge will ensure safe travels for the community's residents, school children and mail carriers, as well as making transit easier for businesses and ranchers," Bullock said. "We can be sure our communities' infrastructure is up-to-date for their day-to-day needs, all while creating good-paying construction jobs in the process."
The grant is part of the Treasure State Endowment Program (TSEP), which is designed to help fund infrastructure projects throughout Montana. The grant will replace the Willoughby Lane Bridge, located six miles southeast of Stevensville and serving about 900 vehicles per day.
"Ravalli County and the Road and Bridge Department are very thankful for the funding to help reconstruct needed infrastructure," County Road and Bridge Department Superintendent John Horat commented, "The grant funds are helping make our road system safer by replacing the aged Willoughby Bridge in Stevensville."
More information on the grant can be accessed through the Community Development Division at 406-841-2770 or e-mail DOCTSEP@mt.gov.
