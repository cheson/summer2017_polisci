Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today released his blueprint for Montana's energy future. Bullock's energy plan stems from numerous meetings with Montanans to gather input and perspective from all sectors of the energy industry.
"Montanans should determine our energy future," said Governor Bullock. "That's why today I'm announcing a blueprint for a balanced and responsible plan that provides good-paying jobs for Montanans, strengthens our rural communities and supports local schools, while safeguarding our quality of life."
Bullock in recent weeks met with wind energy developers, energy efficiency advocates, small businesses, coal workers and solar installers.
"Done right, we can drive economic growth and create and maintain good-paying jobs across Montana," Governor Bullock continued. "We can improve our traditional base of energy generation while sparking a new generation of clean technology business, moving us toward more renewable energy, and encouraging innovation, savings, and energy efficiency for homes and for businesses."
The following is a sampling of the activities contained in Governor Bullock's Energy Blueprint.
Building Montana's Energy Presence in the Region
Develop legislation and an appropriate funding mechanism in coordination with DEQ, the legislature, and other stakeholders to establish an energy infrastructure authority based on the recommendation of the Energy and Utilities Key Industry Network (Main Street Montana Project).
Work with the United States Department of Energy to review and bolster Montana's transmission opportunities in delivering power to out-of-state markets.
