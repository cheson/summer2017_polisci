Montana Governor Steve Bullock today emphasized the importance of protecting and preserving public lands and Americans' access to them during his keynote speech at the "Why Public Lands Matter" conference hosted by the Andrus Center at Boise State University.
"Think about what we have inherited from those that came before us," said Governor Bullock. "Setting lands aside for the public's benefit is one of America's greatest ideas. And now it's up to us to pay it forward and to make sure that future generations have the opportunity to wander, to contemplate, and to create lifelong memories on our prized public lands."
Boise State University is hosting the conference to "look at current federal management practices, the various voices in support and dissent, and potential stakeholder collaboration toward forward-looking best practices designed to manage, protect, and preserve out public lands for the generations to follow."
The conference comes on the heels of renewed calls to transfer public lands, not just in the West, but throughout the country.
"As Governor of a state with millions of acres of public land, I will not stand idly by if Congress or other outside special interests try to erode the birthright of all Americans. I'll say it before, and I'll say it again. The transfer of public lands won't happen, not on my watch," Bullock continued. "And it's up to all of us to say not on our watch."
