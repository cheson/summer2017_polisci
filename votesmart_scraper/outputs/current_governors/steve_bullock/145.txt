Governor Bullock: I Will Continue to Fight for Fair, Transparent, and Accessible Elections
Statement
By: Steve Bullock
Date: Jan. 21, 2016
Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement on the 6th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission ruling and vowed to uphold his history of fighting to keep dark money out of elections:
"It has been six years since the disastrous Citizens United decision and the corrupting impact of that action is being felt more than ever. I will continue to fight for fair, transparent, and accessible elections because I, along with all Montanans, believe that our elections should be decided by "we the people' - not by a small number of wealthy people who seek to hide their money and motivations."
In 2015, Governor Bullock worked with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to pass the Disclose Act to require the disclosure of all donors to any independent group spending money on state-level elections. As attorney general, he led the effort to preserve Montana's 100-year-old Corrupt Practices Act, taking the case for the state's citizen democracy all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. His office defended Montana's campaign finance limits and disclosure laws against a wave of lawsuits filed by American Traditions Partnership and other dark money groups.
Governor Bullock has been called "the biggest threat to Citizens United."
