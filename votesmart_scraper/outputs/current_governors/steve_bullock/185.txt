Location: Helena, MT

Governor Steve Bullock today announced that ratepayers in Eureka will save $129,563 thanks to changes he made to the State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan program last year. The savings come as a result of an SRF loan to the city, totaling $646,000, to fund improvements to the city's wastewater system. In addition, the community is also receiving a loan in the amount of $215,500; this loan is forgivable if certain conditions are met, resulting in even higher savings for the community.
"Through strong fiscal management, and a bit of common sense, we're ensuring ratepayers in Eureka can keep more money in their pockets, while making critical infrastructure upgrades. These upgrades will help to support important economic development in the community, while improving the community's water system" Bullock said of the loan. "We'll continue to work with local communities to find responsible ways to make critical infrastructure improvements, and save money for Main Street Montana businesses and customers."
