Montana's unemployment rate was down .1 percent in September to 4.6 percent. The unemployment rate has decreased by 0.7 percentage points since January. The U.S. unemployment rate decreased by 0.2 percentage points during the same period, to 5.9 percent.
"With nearly 1,000 jobs added last month, Montana's economy continues its strong growth," Governor Steve Bullock said. "Main Street Montana businesses are hiring, and more workers are on the job, which continues to fuel our growing economy."
"As businesses increase hiring and our labor force continues to grow, it's more important than ever to take steps to ensure workers have the skills and training to meet the demands of today's economy," said Labor Commissioner Pam Bucy. "Through partnerships between private employers and educational institutions, and an increased focus on apprenticeship and training opportunities, Montana is leading the nation in innovative workforce development strategies."
Total employment estimates suggested job growth of 983 jobs over the last month. Total employment estimates include payroll employment plus agricultural and self-employed workers. The labor force increased by 694 workers in September, while the number of unemployed declined by 289 workers. Payroll employment estimates indicate stronger over-the-month growth of 1,900 jobs, with widespread employment gains across all industries. Payroll employment has added 9,700 jobs over the past year.
