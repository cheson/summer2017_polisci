Montana Governor Steve Bullock today released the following statement in honor of International Women's Day and highlighted the work of his Equal Pay for Equal Work Task Force.
"As a father, husband, and son, I know when Montana women succeed, Montana working families succeed," said Governor Bullock. "On International Women's Day, and every day, we recognize the contributions of women in ensuring Montana is the best place to live, work, start a business, and raise a family."
Since its inception via Governor Bullock's 2013 Executive Order, the Equal Pay for Equal Work Task Force has taken a multi-pronged approach to closing the wage gap, which includes legislation, wage negotiation trainings of hundreds across the state, educational and networking Summits, and research and advocacy targeted at closing the wage gap in Montana.
Governor Bullock's Equal Pay for Equal Work Task Force is meeting today in Helena at 2PM to continue its work to close Montana's wage gap.
