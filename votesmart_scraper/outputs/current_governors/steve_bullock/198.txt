Governor Steve Bullock announced today the State of Montana is launching a pilot project in five Montana communities that will focus on changing the way community-based mental health services are provided to youth and families.
The Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) has awarded a total of $1 million ($200,000 each) to five communities: Kalispell, Missoula, Great Falls, Helena, and Billings as part of recently passed legislation referred to as the mental health crisis diversion pilot project, or HB 47 by Rep. Carolyn Pease-Lopez (D-Billings).
"Too many Montana children don't have the access to the mental health services they need to be safe," said Bullock. "Montana must continue strengthening programs that keep Montana kid's closer to their families who can support them in their time of need."
