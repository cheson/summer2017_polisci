Governor Steve Bullock and First Lady Lisa Bullock today announced $26,586 in private grant funding for six Montana schools to expand school breakfast programs through an ongoing partnership with Montana No Kid Hungry.
"My wife and I are committed to ending childhood hunger in Montana," said Governor Bullock. "Through private partnerships, these grants have helped serve over 650,000 more breakfast meals during this school year than the year before. The progress we're seeing today is translating into a stronger, healthier, and more stable Montana for years to come."
Grant funding is offered in continuation of the Governor and First Lady's Breakfast after the Bell initiative, which provides food service programs with resources they need to increase students' participation in school breakfast, giving children better access to quality nutrition so that they can approach their schoolwork without the distraction of an empty stomach. Since the fall of 2014, Governor and First Lady Bullock have awarded over $260,000 to more than 70 Montana schools.
"It's heartbreaking to imagine a child going even a day without a proper meal, but the reality is thousands of kids in Montana aren't getting enough of the food they need to prepare for a brighter future," First Lady Bullock said. "We owe it to our communities to ensure that every child who shows up for school has an opportunity to start their day well-fed and ready to learn."
The six schools that received breakfast grants during this cycle include:
Kennedy Elementary, Butte, $5,000.00
