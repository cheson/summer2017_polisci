Governor Bullock today announced that Montana saw record general fund revenue
collections during the first quarter of this fiscal year. Montana's revenue collections, bolstered by strong private-sector job growth and higher wage earnings, are 7.18% higher than the previous record.
"Montana has rebounded from the downturn in record fashion due to strong private-sector job growth and higher wage earnings. It is a testament to the progress made last legislative session to freeze tuition and keep higher education affordable, make historic investments in k-12 education, expand workforce training opportunities, and maintain a balanced budget," said Bullock.
In addition to total general fund record revenue, first quarter personal income collections were the highest ever recorded, totaling 6.44% ahead of the previous record. During the last legislative session Governor Steve Bullock put an emphasis on education, workforce training, and infrastructure projects to expand the workforce and increase wages.
The unemployment rate in Montana has continued its downward trend at 4.6 percent in September after shaving 0.7 percent since January. "More people are in the labor force, earning wages and growing the economy," said Bullock.
Montana's economy has seen a steady progression under Governor Bullock's leadership.
According to various sources, Montana has been ranked:
-#1 for growth in start-ups per capita for the second consecutive year (Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity)
