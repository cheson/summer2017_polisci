Governor Bullock announced a grant of $41,494 to be awarded to Daly Elementary School in Hamilton
for upgrades to the building.
"We owe it to our children to provide them with a safe learning environment. The fact that part of the floor structure in the boys' bathroom had rotted and collapsed is unacceptable," Bullock said. "That's why it's important to update the school, and create good-paying construction jobs in the process. All Montanans can be proud of that."
The grant is part of the Quality Schools project grant awards, which are meant to promote the improvement of school facilities and technology as well as provide funding for emergency school improvements.
The grant will provide for the replacement of the floor in the boys bathroom, which had partially collapsed and is currently being braced with temporary supports. These updates are critical to the safety of the students.
"What we will be able to accomplish probably isn't huge compared to other projects, but the ability to remodel
our bathrooms in our elementary school will make them safer for kids," said School Superintendent Tom Korst. "The bathroom floors will no longer be held up with blocks and jacks, and the school district is very appreciative of receiving the necessary funds through the grant."
More information on the grant can be accessed through the Quality Schools Team at 406 -841-2770 or DOCQualitySchools@mt.gov.
