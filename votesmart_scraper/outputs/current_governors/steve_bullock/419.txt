Governor Steve Bullock announced a grant of $750,000 to be awarded to the Town of Cascade to replace water distribution lines.
"The grant not only improves public safety in Cascade, it also creates construction jobs to improve existing water mains," said Bullock. "It will replace distribution lines that are nearly 100 years old, ensuring that Cascade's water infrastructure is up-to-date."
The grant is part of the Treasure State Endowment Program (TSEP), which is designed to help fund infrastructure projects throughout Montana. It will be used to make much needed improvements to the water distribution lines in Cascade. Cascade's current water distribution system contains deteriorated steel and cast iron. The system is 97 years old and has outlived its useful life, causing decreased water pressure, limited fire flow capacity and the potential for public health risks.
"The money we received will allow us to complete the water project, which is in dire need to be done," commented Cascade Mayor William Petersen. "Pipe that was put in the ground in 1913 will be replaced, allowing us to remove the deteriorating pipe. This is finally going to make the water system in Cascade up-to-date."
More information on the grant can be accessed through the Community Development Division at 406-841-2770 or e-mail DOCTSEP@mt.gov.
