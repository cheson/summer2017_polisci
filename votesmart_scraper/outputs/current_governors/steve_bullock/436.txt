This week, most Montana students end their summer vacation, and return to the classroom. Governor Steve Bullock encouraged students to "Make Montana Proud" with a video and new online website with resources for students, parents and teachers.
In the video, which was sent to all schools in Montana, Bullock encourages students to work hard and thanks teachers for their commitment and dedication.
"I encourage you to work hard and stick to it because your commitment today will make a difference throughout the rest of your life," Bullock told the students. "Over the years I've said thanks to my teachers dozens of times, and you should do the same. They worked hard to push me to reach my potential."
In the video, Bullock also announced that he'll be traveling to schools throughout the year to meet students and learn about the things students are accomplishing. These school visits will begin this week in Helena, Great Falls and Fort Peck.
Bullock also unveiled an online toolkit for the new school year. The toolkit provides resources to help students, parents and teachers have a successful school year. Included on the site is an interactive map pinpointing the location of all schools in the state, links to resources for financial assistance, career pathway planning and information about early childhood education.
"As a father, I know that back to school time is filled with excitement, but can also be filled questions. This toolkit helps students, parents and teachers start the school year off on the right foot, " Bullock said of the website. "We all have an important role to play in ensuring our students are equipped to be successful this year."
