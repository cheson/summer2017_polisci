Montana's unemployment rate rose slightly in July to 4.0 percent, an increase of 0.1 percentage points. Overall, Montana's unemployment rate has fallen 0.6 percentage points in the past year. The U.S. unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent.
"With strong job growth, and more people on the job than ever before, Montana's economy continues to lead the nation," Governor Steve Bullock said. "We'll continue to work to make sure workers have access to training opportunities that equip them with the skills to meet the demands of Montana employers."
"With the unemployment rate around four percent, workers should expect to see wages grow" said Labor Commissioner, Pam Bucy. "The Montana Department of Labor & Industry, through your community Job Service office and workforce development programs, is working hard to ensure that job seekers have the tools they need to take advantage of the many work opportunities provided by employers across the state."
Total employment sits at 503,841 in Montana after July's change. Overall, 11,311 jobs have been added in the past twelve months. Total employment estimates include payroll employment, plus agricultural and self-employed workers. Payroll employment added 700 jobs in July, and has now increased by 2,600 jobs since the beginning of the year. Total and payroll employment's over-the-month changes were within the margin of error, signifying little change to employment levels.
The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.1 percent in July on a seasonally adjusted basis, with advances in the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food. The index for all items less food and energy (also called core inflation) also rose 0.1 percent, mostly because of increases in housing costs.
