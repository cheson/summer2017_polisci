Today, Gov. John Bel Edwards released the following statement congratulating Donald J. Trump on being elected President of the United States of America:
"Donna and I congratulate President-elect Donald Trump on this historic victory. The campaign is over, and it is critical that we set the politics aside and come together to strengthen the country we all love. We have real challenges in Louisiana and across the country that require our full attention. Louisiana will be a strong partner with President-elect Trump and his new administration as we continue to recover from historic flooding, as we make critical investments in our infrastructure and as we work to give our kids every opportunity to succeed. I look forward to working with him, and we will keep him and his family in our prayers as they begin this new journey."
