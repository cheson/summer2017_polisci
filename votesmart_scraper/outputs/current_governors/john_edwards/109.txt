Gov. Edwards Issues Statement on State Budget
Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: June 5, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards released the following statement on the state budget passed by the Louisiana Legislature:
"Our state continues to face a serious budget deficit that threatens our ability to adequately fund state services that we all consider to be priorities," said Gov. Edwards. "This is not the budget that I, and a vast majority of the legislature, want to see implemented and is further evidence that we need to work together in the next special session to stabilize our budget and fund critical programs, such as TOPS, K-12 education, higher education, and health care services. While I appreciate the legislature crafting a budget, we need to develop a long-term plan that is worthy of the people of Louisiana. We have critical work ahead of us over the next two weeks, and I am confident we will make the tough choices necessary to put Louisiana on a path to long-term prosperity."
