Gov. Edwards' Statement on TOPS Funding
Press Release
By: John Bel Edwards

On TOPS funding, Gov. Edwards said the following:
"As I said last night, students on TOPS this semester will not see cuts. The universities will absorb the TOPS shortfall this year. Students will not receive any bills for this shortfall or lose any TOPS awards this semester.
"For this semester, LOSFA has only been able to pay universities 80% of students' TOPS bills. This is due in part to the previous administration not budgeting properly for all the students who would be using TOPS this year. However, the budget problems created by the previous administration do have the potential to hurt students directly. Next year, as it stands, TOPS is only funded 25 percent, unless the legislature acts to change that. This means fewer TOPS scholarships will be awarded next year. That is why it is so important for the legislature to work with me to balance this budget and prevent future cuts to the TOPS Scholarship Program."
