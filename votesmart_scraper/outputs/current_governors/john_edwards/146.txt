Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards released the following statement on the 6th anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill:
"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was devastating to Louisiana's economy, environment, and way of life, but because of the resiliency of our people, we were determined to come back stronger than ever. Six years later, we are on our way to a strong recovery, but our hard work must continue. Today, it's important for us to remember the lives lost and reaffirm our commitment to work with our partners along the Gulf Coast and in the federal government to ensure this never happens again. Most importantly, I want to assure the people of Louisiana that, consistent with the State's Master Plan, funds from the BP settlement will be used for coastal protection and restoration. I am committed to working with industry leaders, environmental advocates, and the people of Louisiana on a robust plan that provides much needed protection for our coast and environment and that meets the needs of offshore drilling."
