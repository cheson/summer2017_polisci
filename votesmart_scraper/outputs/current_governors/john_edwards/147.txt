Gov. Edwards Marks 100 Days in Office
Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: April 19, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards is marking his 100th day in office. Since taking office on January 11, 2016, Gov. Edwards has faced tough challenges and exciting opportunities including a presidential visit, a vice presidential visit, two instances of severe flooding across the entire state, a series of devastating tornadoes, a special legislative session, and now his first regular legislative session.
"These first 100 days have been challenging, no doubt," said Gov. Edwards. "But, when I think about how much we have already accomplished in such a short time, I am certain that we are well on our way to getting Louisiana back on a path to shared prosperity. As I've said, right now is about making the harder right choices rather than the easier wrong ones and we're going to move forward to the next 100 days with that mentality. I can't thank the people of Louisiana enough for this incredible opportunity to serve them, and I continue to ask them for their prayers, for me and our leaders, as we continue this critical work on their behalf."
