Governor John Bel Edwards Makes Personal Appeal to Voters in Latest Campbell for U.S. Senate Ad
Press Release
By: John Bel Edwards Foster Campbell, Jr.
Date: Oct. 17, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Governor John Bel Edwards makes his personal pitch to voters to ask them to support his pick for U.S. Senate in the newest ad released by Foster Campbell's campaign.
"I endorsed Foster Campbell months ago, and I'm looking forward to working with him," Edwards says.
Edwards was among Campbell's earliest and most vocal supporters, and he called upon Louisiana Democrats to support Campbell in May of 2016. In the newest ad, set for digital release today, Edwards says Campbell will fight to increase the minimum wage, expand access to healthcare and pass equal pay for women.
Acknowledging the uphill battle Louisiana is facing to in the aftermath of recent devastating floods, and in the wake of the $12 billion backlog of transportation and infrastructure projects left behind by Bobby Jindal, Edwards says Campbell is the right partner for our state in Washington D.C. for the times.
"Let's get [Foster Campbell] elected this fall, and let's rebuild Louisiana together," Edwards says in the ad.
Campbell said that Edwards has proven his leadership abilities in the first eight months in office, getting the state through crisis after crisis. "Governor Edwards and I will be a great team for Louisiana at a time when we need teamwork, not partisanship," said Campbell.
Campbell will release a series of targeted digital ads featuring former New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, State Senator Troy Carter, State Senator Wesley Bishop, Orleans Civil Court Clerk Dale Atkins, and faith leaders from around Louisiana in the coming weeks.
