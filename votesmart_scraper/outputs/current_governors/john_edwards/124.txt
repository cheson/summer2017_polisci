Today, Governor John Bel Edwards released the following statement on the passage of HB1 in the House of Representatives:
"I appreciate the hard work done by the House of Representatives to pass a budget today," said Gov. Edwards. "I remain committed to working with legislators to allocate all available resources in a way that responsibly funds the public-private partner hospitals, TOPS, and all critical services, such as the NOW and Children's Choice waivers. It is my hope that we can continue to work together during the next special session to explore revenue options that would allow us to fully fund TOPS next year, as well as the life-saving services that the citizens of Louisiana rely on us to protect."
