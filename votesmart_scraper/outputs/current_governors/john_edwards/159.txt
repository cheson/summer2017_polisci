Gov. Edwards Releases Statement on Terrorist Attacks in Belgium
Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: March 22, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

In response to the terrorist attacks in Brussels, Belgium today, Governor John Bel Edwards released the following statement:
"Our deepest sympathies go out to the people of Belgium and to all those suffering as a result of today's tragic events," said Gov. Edwards. "Louisiana and Belgium have a long and strong history of working together for more than 40 years. Our relationship has directly impacted the state's efforts to preserve and protect our rich French heritage. Donna and I send our prayers for those lost in today's tragedy, for the survivors, and for those who have lost friends and loved ones."
Thanks to an ongoing student exchange program, Belgian teachers have been coming to Louisiana schools to teach French for more than four decades. Every four years, the Louisiana Belgium Accord is signed to renew that commitment. Four years ago, the accord was signed in Brussels and this year it will be signed in Louisiana. Next month, Governor Edwards will host Governor Denis Mathen, governor of the province of Namur which is located in one of the three French speaking regions of Belgium.
