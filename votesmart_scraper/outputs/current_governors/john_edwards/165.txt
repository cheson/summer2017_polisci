Gov. Edwards' Statement on Moody's Credit Rating Downgrade
Press Release
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: Feb. 25, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Governor John Bel Edwards released the following statement on Moody's Investors Service downgrade of Louisiana's credit rating:
"This is a disappointing development, particularly since we believed that Moody's would wait until the conclusion of the special session to make any decision on our rating. Unfortunately, the downgrade confirms what we've been saying about the structural imbalance of our budget. The overuse and abuses of one time money and fund sweeps by the Jindal Administration were a major factor in this decision. It also reflects the global concern about the decline of oil prices and its impact on producing states. It is more important than ever for the legislature to work with me during this special session to stabilize our budget and repair the damage of the last eight years. We can do this by transitioning to a new tax structure that conforms to best practices promoted by organizations such as the Tax Foundation, which will help us achieve long term fiscal stability and predictability in Louisiana."
