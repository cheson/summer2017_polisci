Gov. Edwards Joins Amicus Brief Urging Reasonable Regulations on Abortion Clinics
Press Release
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: Feb. 3, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards joined Texas Governor Greg Abbott's amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court urging them to uphold provisions of legislation requiring certain admitting privileges for abortion clinics in the State of Texas. Last week, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana found a section of Act 620 of the 2014 Regular Legislative Session to be unconstitutional. The Texas law, which is similar to the Louisiana law, was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Texas case is now before the Supreme Court.
"As a pro-life legislator, I supported the effort in the Louisiana House of Representatives to improve access to quality health care for women by placing realistic regulations on clinics performing abortions," said Gov. Edwards. "While our overall goal should be to protect the lives of unborn children, we must also ensure that these facilities are operating in the safest manner possible and with ready access to emergency care."
The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the Texas case on March 2. The ruling will be delivered by the end of June.
Ten governors, including Gov. Edwards, have joined the amicus brief -- Texas, South Dakota, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and Maine.
