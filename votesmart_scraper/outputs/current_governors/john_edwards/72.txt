Today, Gov. John Bel Edwards released the following statement on his private meeting with President Barack Obama where he briefed the president on the on-going flood relief efforts in Louisiana:

As we continue to work with Congress in the coming days, I want to thank the president and the Louisiana delegation for their efforts to secure necessary relief funds for our state.
