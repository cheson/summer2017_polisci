Gov. Edwards' Statement on House Ways and Means Votes
Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: June 8, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards issued this statement following Wednesday's meeting of the House Committee on Ways and Means:
"Given the $600 million deficit, when you vote against additional revenue, you are voting to cut TOPS, higher education, K-12 education, and life-saving health care services including our safety-net hospitals. That's the choice some legislators are making, and that's the choice they will have to defend to their constituents. Putting politics over people got us into this mess. While some are insistent that we continue down that path, I am not. As I have said from day one, I am fully committed to funding TOPS, higher education, K-12 education, and essential health care services, and I presented a plan to do just that. But simple math does not allow us to do so without additional revenue."
