Gov. Edwards Orders Flags at Half-Staff for Former Lt. Gov. Bobby Freeman
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: May 18, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards ordered the flags of the United States and the State of Louisiana to be flown at half-staff over the State Capitol and all public buildings until sunset on Thursday, May 19, 2016 in honor of Robert L. "Bobby" Freeman.
While best known as former Lieutenant Governor, Bobby Freeman served the State of Louisiana in all three branches of government and was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in 2008. First elected in 1968, he served three consecutive terms in the House of Representatives representing District 60. In 1980, he was elected to serve as Lt. Governor, an office he held until 1988. He later served as a city judge in Plaquemine, LA from 1990-1996.
"Few people garner the life-long experience that comes with serving the public in all three branches of state government as Bobby Freeman had," said Gov. Edwards. "As an attorney, judge, state representative, and two-term Lt. Governor, he understood the full meaning of public service and, without a doubt, left a legacy that highlights the many unique aspects of Louisiana culture and life that make our state so special. Donna and I are keeping his family and friends in our thoughts and prayers during this time of loss."
Bobby Freeman also served in the United States Army for three years. A man of many talents, he was a two-time NCAA runner-up in his weight class as a member of the LSU Boxing Team and was later inducted into the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame.
