Date: April 4, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards released the following statement on a federal court's approval of the BP settlement. This decision clears the way for Louisiana to receive critical coastal restoration funding and provide immediate assistance to close the current fiscal year's budget deficit.
Gov. Edwards said:
"This is great news for the people of Louisiana," said Gov. Edwards. "The BP oil spill nearly crippled our state and did damage to our coast and communities that will take years to rectify. I am pleased with the court's decision to bring this issue to a close. Louisiana is in a race against time when it comes to saving our coast. Today's decision enables us to continue making critical investments in our coast, and equally important, to keep the funding in place needed to close the current fiscal year's budget deficit. I appreciate the work of everyone involved in this case."
