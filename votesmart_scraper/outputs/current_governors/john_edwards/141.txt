Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards announced $13,734,879 in awarded Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) to local municipalities across the state through the Louisiana Community Development Block Grant Program for Fiscal Year 2016.
The CDBG Program helps communities provide a suitable living environment and expand economic opportunities for their residents, particularly in low to moderate income areas. The block grants are awarded to the state annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The state's program awards and administers the funds to units of local government for improvements to public facilities, economic development, demonstrated needs projects and LaSTEP projects, which funds materials for local community projects while citizens provide a portion of the labor.
"I am thrilled to make this announcement," said Gov. Edwards. "These grants are going to make meaningful, lasting changes in communities where these resources are desperately needed. During challenging fiscal times like these, especially in the wake of three natural disasters in the last two months, the impact of these funds is even more important."
