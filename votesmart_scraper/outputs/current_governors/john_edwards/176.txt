Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: Feb. 10, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards released the following statement on the latest budget projections announced by the Revenue Estimating Conference (REC). The REC revised both the current year's budget shortfall, which must be addressed by June 30, and next year's budget shortfall, which begins July 1.
"Louisiana faces an unprecedented budget challenge that, if left unresolved, will devastate state government as we know it and impose unimaginable cuts to higher education, health care and other vital services the state delivers to our citizens," said Gov. Edwards. "This is a fiscal crisis, the likes of which we have never seen. We will come through this together, but we have reached the end of the road where cuts alone will work to solve this problem. We will need to work to find additional revenue to continue delivering the most basic of vital state services. I will address the people of Louisiana directly in a statewide televised address tomorrow evening, and will be asking for constructive engagement from every Louisiana citizen as we prepare to go into special session on Sunday."
Gov. Edwards announced on Wednesday (Feb. 10) that he would make a special address to the people of Louisiana concerning the state's budget crises.
