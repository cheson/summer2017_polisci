Press Release

Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards announced that the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has granted his request that Assumption, St. James and St. John parishes qualify for disaster assistance loans as a result of damage caused by tornadoes in those areas on February 23-24, 2016.
The SBA provides low-interest, long-term loans for physical and economic damage caused by a declared disaster. Acting under its own authority, the SBA issued the declaration following the denial of the state's appeal for a major disaster declaration on April 29, 2016.
"After meeting the families and seeing the devastation left in the wake of the tornadoes that passed through these three parishes, I promised to do everything within my power to ensure that they would get access to the resources needed to rebuild," said Gov. Edwards. "My team and I are doing all we can to follow through on that promise. This decision by the SBA is another step towardtheir recovery. It is my hope and prayer that these families will be able to get back to their normal lives as soon as possible."
The three parishes now qualify for three types of disaster assistance loans:
1) Home and Personal Property Loans: If you are in a declared disaster area and are the victim of a disaster, you may be eligible for financial assistance from the SBA, even if you don't own a business.
2) Business Physical Disaster Loans: Any business or organization located in a declared disaster area and that incurred damage during the disaster may apply for a loan to help replace or restore damaged property.
