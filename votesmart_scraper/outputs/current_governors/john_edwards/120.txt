Gov. Edwards' Statement on House Committee Failure to Pass Equal Pay Legislation
Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: May 19, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards issued the following statement on the House Labor Committee's failure to pass legislation that grants women equal pay for equal work. Louisiana women earn an average of 65 cents on the dollar compared to what their male counterparts make. Even worse, on average, African American women earn an average of 49 cents on the dollar for doing the same job. A statewide poll conducted in March 2016 indicated that 90 percent of Louisianans support passing equal pay legislation.
"The failure of the House Labor Committee to pass the Equal Pay Act today is a true disservice to the women of our state," said Gov. Edwards. "Very few issues have the support of 90 percent of Louisiana, but the support for legislation granting equal pay for equal work crosses the political spectrum. The pay gap in Louisiana is the worst in the entire country, and we can do better, not just for my wife and daughters, but for women all across the state. This disparity prevents our wives, daughters, sisters, and other women from earning equal pay for equal work, and that directly impacts children and families who many in the legislative body espouse they value. Actions speak louder than words, and the time has come to stop talking about family values and start making decisions that actually value families."
