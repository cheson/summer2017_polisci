Gov. Edwards Releases Legislative Agenda that Advances Family Values
Press Release
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: April 4, 2017
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Gov. John Bel Edwards released details on the legislation he will propose during the 2017 Regular Session to advance policies that value Louisiana families in very practical and real ways.
"We often say that we value Louisiana families, but the lack of state policies that ensure families are supported in meaningful ways suggests otherwise," said Gov. Edwards. "Louisiana has the highest gender wage gap in the country, is one of only five states that has not adopted a state minimum wage and is now facing an opioid epidemic that is impacting families in every part of our state. If we want our families to do better, then we must do better by them. That is why I am proposing legislation that will help eliminate the wage gap by ending pay secrecy, raise the minimum wage in a realistic way and address opioid abuse in our state. When our families thrive our state thrives."
Equal Pay for Equal Work
The governor announces this portion of his 2017 legislative agenda on Equal Pay Day, a national day highlighting the gap in earned wages between working women and men across the United States. Louisiana has the highest gender wage gap in the country, with the average Louisiana woman making only $0.66 for every $1 a man makes. Meaningful and enforceable equal pay legislation has been a priority for Gov. Edwards since his time in the state legislature and this portion of his legislative agenda is an expression of his commitment to advancing equal pay for women and families throughout Louisiana.
House Bill 222 Authored by Rep. Helena Moreno (D-District 93) would promote pay transparency by prohibiting employers from taking actions against employees for inquiring about, discussing or disclosing their wages or those of other employees.
