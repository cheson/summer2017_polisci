Today, Governor John Bel Edwards ordered the flags of the United States and the State of Louisiana to be flown at half-staff over the State Capitol and all public buildings until sunset on Tuesday, May 10, 2016 in honor of Mr. Frank Levingston.
Mr. Levingston was the oldest living man in the United States and the oldest verified surviving American World War II veteran. He died in Louisiana on May 4, 2016 at the age of 110. Mr. Levingston enlisted in the U.S. Army on October 6, 1942 and served in the Allied invasion in Italy. Receiving an honorable discharge in 1945, he later settled in Louisiana and became a proud citizen of this state.
"My wife Donna and I are keeping Frank Levingston's family and friends in our thoughts and prayers," said Gov. Edwards. "Mr. Levingston lived to see the governance of nineteen presidents and both world wars. His wealth of lived experience was a treasure to this state and our great nation. His bravery and service to the United States were honorable, and I am proud to issue this executive order in his memory today."
