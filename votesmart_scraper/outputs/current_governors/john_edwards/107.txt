Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Legislature, Honored Guests, My fellow Louisianans:
Good morning. Here we are again.
I've called you back here -- even though it might feel like you've never left -- because we've got unfinished business to tend to. That unfinished business is the difference between whether TOPS is fully funded, whether hospitals in the districts you represent remain open to serve your constituents, and whether we're going to stabilize our great state and put this budget crisis behind us once and for all.
We've been through a lot together since being sworn into office a little less than six months ago. Since January, we've faced three natural emergencies. We've eliminated a $940 million budget deficit for this fiscal year and whittled down the coming year's deficit from more than $2 billion to $600 million. We've cut spending to the tune of $230 million in the current fiscal year alone, implemented a statewide hiring freeze, and underwent an unprecedented review of government contracts -- all in an effort to operate government more efficiently and save taxpayer dollars. And we've begun the process of bringing our federal tax dollars back to Louisiana through Medicaid expansion, which will save more than $180 million for our state in the first year alone.
But while we all may be getting weary of what is beginning to feel like a never-ending legislative process, there is still more important work left to do. The people who sent us here expect us to finish the job. If we don't address this $600 million deficit, we force critical state services to remain unfunded next year.
We still have a real mess on our hands, and the longer we put off cleaning up that mess, the more damage we do and the more problems we create for ourselves down the line.
