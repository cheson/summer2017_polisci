Gov. Edwards Issues Statement on LDVA Audit Findings
Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: Feb. 1, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards responded to a joint investigative report conducted and released by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor and the Louisiana Office of State Inspector General in cooperation with the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs (LDVA). The audit was conducted to determine the validity of allegations received against LDVA and specifically the actions of former Secretary David LaCerte.
"I will not tolerate the kind of mismanagement that the previous leadership provided at the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs," said Gov. Edwards. "It is a new day for veterans in Louisiana. These heroes deserve our lifelong respect and gratitude for their selfless service and the sacrifice they and their families made for our country. Secretary Strickland is already well underway implementing the service improvements that our veterans deserve and that I will demand. Under my administration, Louisiana veterans can rest assured that veterans matter personally to me."
