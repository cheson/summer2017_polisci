Press Release

Location: New Orleans, LA

Today, Gov. John Bel Edwards, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) Secretary Shawn Wilson and local elected officials announced that a major transportation project has been accelerated to improve access to the Louis Armstrong International New Orleans Airport from I-10 and Loyola Avenue. The state of Louisiana is investing an additional $10 million to advance preconstruction activities, including design, that must take place prior to construction. Once the planning phase is complete, designing the interchange will begin immediately. The state was able to reallocate financial resources to fund this phase of the project after being awarded a $60 million FASTLANE grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT).
"I made a commitment to the people of Louisiana to bring our federal tax dollars home to invest in our road, bridges and ports," said Gov. Edwards. "The federal grant frees up financial resources that will allow us to make critical investments across the state, including New Orleans. Funding preconstruction and design is a critical step toward getting this project underway and keeping it moving forward. Once complete, the current interchange will be transformed to provide easier access for the millions of people who use the airport to travel. State, local and federal partners have worked tirelessly to get resources to Louisiana to improve our infrastructure, and I look forward to continuing that partnership to invest in our state."
