Governor Edwards Welcomes Medicaid Expansion Announcement
Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: Jan. 14, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards welcomed the news from President Barack Obama that additional federal resources would be available for states that choose to expand Medicaid to provide health care coverage for working families. Under the proposal, states, like Louisiana, that are just now expanding Medicaid, would receive the same full federal support for three years from the time of the expansion.
"With Louisiana's finances in disarray, this is welcome news for the more than 350,000 individuals who are going to benefit from Medicaid expansion," said Gov. Edwards. "This additional funding would ensure that Louisiana has the full financial support of the federal government to provide health care coverage for the next three years, allowing us to focus our attention on getting our finances in order. I look forward to working with our Congressional delegation to ensure this funding is a part of any budget passed by Congress."
Under current law, the federal government funds Medicaid expansion for states that choose to participate at 100 percent through 2016. The federal funding decreases each year after, down to 90 percent in 2020. The proposal will be part of the budget presented by the administration to Congress this year.
