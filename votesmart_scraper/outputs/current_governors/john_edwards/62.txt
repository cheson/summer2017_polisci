Gov. Edwards' Statement on Attorney General Lawsuit
Statement

Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Gov. John Bel Edwards release the following statement on a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Jeff Landry:
"We are still reviewing this lawsuit and will respond shortly. It is baffling, though not surprising, that the attorney general continues to put his own political interests ahead of the needs of our state. He maintains only businesses that reserve the right to discriminate are eligible for a state contract, and that's just wrong. New opportunities arise for our state every day because we will not discriminate, including having the 2017 NBA All-Star Game relocate to New Orleans. It's politics like the attorney general's that drove businesses away from North Carolina. If he continues to put his own political career ahead of the best interest of the citizens of Louisiana, he will do irreparable harm to our state."
