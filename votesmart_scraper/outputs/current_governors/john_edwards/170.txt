Today, Governor John Bel Edwards emphasized that his proposed budget solutions for the $940 million budget deficit this year and the $2 billion deficit next year includes significant cuts to how much the state spends writing checks every year to issue refunds for tax credits, rebates and other tax benefits.
Governor Edwards pointed out that well over half of his package of proposals to the legislature to solve the $940 million budget crisis this year -- or at least $537 million -- consists of spending cuts and non-revenue raising measures, including the following:
$128 million Rainy Day Fund dollars
$200 million Non-coastal BP settlement dollars
$160 million in governor's, JLCB, and legislatively approved cuts
$49 million Cutting state spending in issuing refunds for tax credits, rebates and other tax benefits
"The previous administration blew a hole in our state budget by writing checks for tax credits, rebates, or refunds to corporations with no consideration of whether Louisiana receives a good return on our investment," said Gov. Edwards. "Cutting spending should also include evaluating tax expenditures and subsidies our state gives out. This will help us strengthen the fiscal foundation of our state over the long term."
At a time when Gov. Edwards is fighting to protect higher education, the TOPS scholarship program, and critical health care services, Louisiana continues to be among the nation's leaders in subsidies to business. Louisiana ranks 4th highest in the nation in the subsidies provided to businesses -- just below New York, Michigan, and Washington. Louisiana's subsidies to business are double the State of Texas and 4.5 times the State of Alabama.
