Gov. Edwards' Statement Following Community Meeting in Washington, D.C.
Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: July 13, 2016
Location: Washington, DC

Today, Gov. John Bel Edwards and Louisiana State Police Superintendent Col. Mike Edmonson attended a meeting with President Barack Obama as well as individuals from around the country, including law enforcement, community advocates, faith leaders, and elected leaders, to discuss ways we can keep people safe, build community trust, and ensure justice for all Americans. Following the meeting, Gov. Edwards released the following statement:
"From the beginning, I have called for all Louisianans to come together so that we can emerge from this tragedy stronger than we were. I continue to believe that is not only possible, but it is a critical step in uniting our community, state, and nation. That means we all have to do our part. Law enforcement officers must carry out their sacred duty to protect and serve in a way that earns the trust of our communities. At the same time, all Louisianans must make their voices heard in a constructive way that brings us closer together and makes true progress a reality. That is how we honor the lives of Alton Sterling and the police officers who lost their lives in Dallas. I am proud of the work of law enforcement and the overwhelming number of citizens who want their voices heard in a peaceful manner, and I look forward to continuing this dialogue in the weeks and months ahead."
