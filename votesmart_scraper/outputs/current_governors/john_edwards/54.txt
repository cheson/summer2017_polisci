Gov. Edwards' Statement Following Court Ruling
Statement

Today, Gov. John Bel Edwards released the following statement on Judge Todd Hernandez's ruling in the attorney general's lawsuit regarding the governor's executive order prohibiting discrimination in state employment and by state contractors.
Gov. Edwards said:
"We are disappointed in the court's ruling today. However, we fully intend to appeal this issue, which is how the parties knew that this matter would ultimately be resolved. In his ruling, the judge declared that Louisiana law recognizes the governor as the constitutionally superior officer to the attorney general, but did not agree that the executive order is within the authority of the governor to implement. With great respect for the role of the Louisiana legislature, we continue to believe that discrimination is not a Louisiana value and that we are best served as a state when employment decisions are based solely on an individual's qualifications and job performance. We respect the trial court's decision and will abide by it while we vigorously pursue an appeal."
