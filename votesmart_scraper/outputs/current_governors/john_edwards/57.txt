Gov. Edwards' Statement on Passage of Continuing Resolution
Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: Oct. 28, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Gov. John Bel Edwards released the following statement on the passage of the Continuing Resolution that includes $500 million in funding for flood relief in Louisiana. With approval from both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, the bill will now go to President Barack Obama for his signature.
"The people whose lives were turned upside down by the historic flooding expect us to give them every opportunity to rebuild," said Gov. Edwards. "They need to know that help is on the way, and this is first step in that process. We still have work to do after the election to pass a comprehensive flood relief package, but I am confident we can get it done by working together.
"Crossing this milestone took the work of everyone - President Obama, our entire congressional delegation, Lt. Governor Billy Nungesser, and Commissioner Mike Strain. I want to thank them for working with me to bring home this relief for the people of Louisiana, and I look forward to working with all of them again after the election to bring additional assistance home."
