Press Release
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: May 26, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Governor John Bel Edwards signed an executive order creating the Governor's Advisory Council on the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) within the Office of the Governor.
The ESSA, a bipartisan and bicameral bill, was signed into law on December 10, 2015, reauthorizing the federal education law known as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The law strives to provide every student with high quality educational opportunities, regardless of his or her zip code, by empowering state and local decision-makers to develop and strengthen their respective systems for school improvement and accountability based upon evidence and by giving parents and local educators a voice in making decisions affecting education.
"I believe that a strong public education system is essential to the well-being of Louisiana children and communities," said Gov. Edwards. "Each and every student deserves equitable access to a quality public education that prepares them for college, career, and citizenship. The council created through my executive order is tasked with studying the Every Student Succeeds Act so that we implement this new law in the very best interest of our children."
The duties of the council established by the governor's executive order include, but are not limited to, the following:
Conduct an extensive review of the ESSA.
Make recommendations on specific actions necessary for successful implementation of the ESSA in Louisiana.
Submit to the Governor an initial and final report outlining the requirements and recommendations for implementation of the ESSA in Louisiana.
