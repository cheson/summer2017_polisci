Gov. Edwards, DOTD, Officials Highlight $60 Million Transportation Project
Statement
By: John Bel Edwards
Date: Aug. 3, 2016
Location: Baton Rouge, LA

Today, Gov. John Bel Edwards joined Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) Secretary Shawn Wilson and local elected officials to highlight a major transportation project set to begin between the I-10/I-49 interchange and the Atchafalaya Basin Bridge. Last month, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) awarded a $60 million FASTLANE grant to the state of Louisiana to partially fund the project. The award was made based on an application by the Edwards administration.
"I am committed to improving our state's infrastructure to support Louisiana's growing economy, and that starts by bringing our federal tax dollars home," said Gov. Edwards. "For too long, infrastructure needs in this state have been ignored, but by partnering with state, local and federal officials, we can make a real impact on the lives of our citizens. I'm proud of the application we've put together to receive this financial support, and I am looking forward to moving projects along all across this state."
