Governor John Bel Edwards' request that President Barack Obama expand the existing federal declaration for the State of Louisiana to include additional parishes has been granted. Jackson, Rapides, Red River, and Sabine make up the new parishes included in the declaration.
"Thousands of additional flood survivors will now have access to much needed assistance and resources to help them return to their normal lives thanks to the quick action of the White House," said Gov. Edwards. "I am very appreciative of the immediate attention given to our request to include the additional parishes in the federal declaration. It is going to make a tremendous difference in the lives of all who were caught off guard and overwhelmed by the severe weather."
On Thursday, March 24, Gov. Edwards requested assistance for an additional nine parishes - Catahoula, East Carroll, Franklin, Jackson, Lincoln, Rapides, Red River, Sabine, and St. Helena. The five remaining parishes not included in this declaration are still pending.
