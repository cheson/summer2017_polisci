Public Statements
Flags Lowered in Honor of Roseburg Victims
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: Oct. 2, 2015
Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker today ordered all Alaska state flags to be lowered in honor of the victims of yesterday's Umpqua Community College shooting in Roseburg, Oregon. This action follows a proclamation by President Barack Obama to lower all United States flags in honor of those who were killed in this tragic event.
"Yesterday's shootings in Roseburg broke the hearts of Alaska," said Governor Walker. "This senseless act of violence robbed families, friends, and colleagues of their loved ones. Donna and I want to extend our most heartfelt condolences, thoughts, and prayers to all those who are suffering."
Per the President's proclamation, and Governor Walker's order, all United States and Alaska flags should be flown at half-staff beginning immediately until sunset on Tuesday, October 6, 2015. This will coincide with Sunday's Fallen Firefighter Memorial Service in honor of which flags would normally be lowered on that date.
