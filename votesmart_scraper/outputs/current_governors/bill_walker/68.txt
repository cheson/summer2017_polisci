Our Vision: Build a pipeline from the North Slope to Cook Inlet to unlock the natural gas reserves, heat Alaskan homes, fuel Alaska's economy, and fund state government through sales in the Asian marketplace.

Overview: For the first time in our history, the destiny of Alaska's gasline is in the hands of Alaskans.
This project has not been successful to date because all three producers have traditionally each been given the final say over every aspect of the project, and they have been unable to agree amongst themselves on conditions necessary to advance. These companies are global competitors in this market; creating an inherent internal conflict that has caused the project to stall for decades.
Each producer has other natural gas opportunities/projects all around the world that compete for its limited pool of capital. These companies have fiduciary obligations to their shareholders that require them to invest in projects that can provide the highest possible rates of return; or in projects where there is the greatest risk of losing control of their gas resources. Therefore an Alaskan project may very well be profitable and economic, just not as profitable as some of the producers' other options; or just not as high of a risk for losing control of the gas.
The current market conditions that have caused the major producers to step back as controlling entities of the project creates a very good opportunity for Alaska. As the producers testified before the joint House Senate Resources committee on August 25th, the project itself is not dead; only some of the prior assumptions regarding structure, control, and ownership have been invalidated.
