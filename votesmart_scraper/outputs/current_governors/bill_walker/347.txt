Alaska Veterans
I will work to ensure that DMVA Veterans Affairs is doing its job to serve Alaska's military veterans. DMVA will be required to contact those vets in our Bush communities to ensure that they understand their benefits and that their needs are being met.
Alaska's vets deserve our respect and our support. The promises made to them need to be fulfilled. I will work to see that obligation is honored.
It is imperative that we build the all-Alaska natural gas pipeline to provide funding for State services.
