Governor Walker Signs Two Bills Into Law
Press Release
By: Bill Walker

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker signed HB 180 and HB 178 into law today. Both pieces of legislation were signed during bill signing events at the Governor's office in Anchorage.
HB 180, which was sponsored by Representative Cathy Munoz of Juneau, establishes the second Sunday in June as Children's Day in Alaska. The bill is meant to encourage the community to celebrate children, and reinforce our commitment to provide a nurturing community that helps children reach their full potential. To celebrate the new law, Governor's office staff and their children joined Governor Walker for cookies and lemonade after the bill signing.
"Alaska's children are valuable members of our communities and HB 180 reiterates that message," said Governor Walker. "I thank Representative Munoz for establishing this important recognition."
HB 178, sponsored by the Chair of the House Labor and Commerce Committee, Representative Kurt Olson of Soldotna, extends the effective date for the Workers' Compensation Medical Fee Schedule from July 1, 2015 to December 1, 2015. This allows the Medical Services Review Committee with enough time to complete their piece of larger reform efforts that will lower Alaska's workers' compensation costs in both the public and private sector.
"Workers' compensation is a large expense for both the State and private businesses," said Governor Walker. "This bill works hand-in-hand with existing reform efforts to help relieve employers from some of those costs."
