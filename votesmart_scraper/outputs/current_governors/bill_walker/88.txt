Below is a statement from Governor Bill Walker on his request for an expedited review of the lawsuit challenging his veto of half the money appropriated to permanent fund dividends:
"I have asked Senator Wielechowski to join the State in requesting an expedited review of his lawsuit challenging my veto of half the amount of money allotted to permanent fund dividend disbursements. Alaskans deserve a definitive answer as we gear up for a legislative session in which bold action is required to finally fix our fiscal deficit. The State's budget has shrunk 44 percent in the past four years, while we have drawn $12.6 billion from our savings accounts since 2013. Much as a family would after losing nearly 90 percent of its household income, Alaska must continue to make cuts, find new sources of revenue and use the interest from the wealth that we have accumulated. I know my decision to veto the dividend appropriation has not been popular. It was an action I did not make lightly. It was necessary, however, to keep the nearly $667 million in the earnings reserve account to ensure PFDs for future generations of Alaskans." -- Governor Bill Walker
