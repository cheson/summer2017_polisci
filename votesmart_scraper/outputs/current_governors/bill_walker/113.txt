WHEREAS, the United States of America was founded on the principle that all people have the natural right to live free with the opportunity to pursue their own destiny and happiness; and
WHEREAS, the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress forever enshrined these principles by the founding of a new sovereign nation -- the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, our nation's founders demonstrated their love for liberty and proved that they were willing to fight and die for freedom. Throughout our history, Americans have been steadfast in their efforts to build a country of liberty, peace, and opportunity for all; and
WHEREAS, our people and our freedom have been, and continue to be, defended daily by dedicated men and women of the United States Armed Forces. We owe a debt of honor to the heroes who have given the ultimate sacrifice for us and to recognize all reservists, active duty service members, national guard members and veterans for their service that has allowed us to continue a life of freedom; and
WHEREAS, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, "In the truest sense, freedom cannot be bestowed; it must be achieved;" and
WHEREAS, this Fourth of July, as we commemorate the signing of our nation's Declaration of Independence and celebrate our freedom, we should also take time to reflect on the meaning and true cost of the liberty we enjoy.
NOW THEREFORE, I, Bill Walker, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF ALASKA, do hereby proclaim July 4, 2016 as:
Independence Day
in Alaska, and encourage all Alaskans to acknowledge and celebrate the birth of our great nation and to honor those who have defended, and continue to defend, our state and country.
