Governor Walker Applauds Caelus Discovery
Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: Oct. 4, 2016
Location: Anchorage, AK

With an oil pipeline that is three-quarters empty, this is good news for the state of Alaska. I applaud Caelus for this major discovery, and for the company's commitment to do business in our state. My administration will continue to work with the industry to identify new development opportunities in Alaska's oil and gas sector, and provide appropriate investment incentives given our current fiscal climate.
