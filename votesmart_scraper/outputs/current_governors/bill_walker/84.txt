Location: Anchorage, AK

Following his meetings in South Korea last week, Governor Bill Walker accepted an invitation to return to Seoul tomorrow to speak about the role of Alaska's rich energy potential to provide economic opportunities in the Eurasian region. The Future Consensus Institute, a nonprofit public policy research institute, is hosting the forum in partnership with Joongang Ilbo, one of Korea's largest daily newspapers, and the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a London-based international affairs think tank. Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) President Keith Meyer will also attend the forum.
"I am grateful for this opportunity to talk directly to leaders from Korea, Japan, China, Russia and the United Kingdom about how Alaska's vast energy resources can mutually benefit our respective economies," Governor Walker said. "There will be discussion of the changing Arctic during this forum, so I am eager to talk about how Alaska's strategic location can provide the reliability and stability of resource delivery."
While in Seoul, Governor Walker and AGDC President Meyer will meet with the Deputy Prime Minister of Japan and other international leaders about Alaska's oil and gas opportunities.
The Future Consensus Institute is paying for lodging, travel and ground transportation.
