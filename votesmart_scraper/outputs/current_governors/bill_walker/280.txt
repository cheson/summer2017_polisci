Governor Bill Walker extended his condolences to President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal following the tragic earthquake and aftershocks that struck the country last week.
"The thoughts and prayers of Alaskans are with the people of Nepal this week," said Governor Walker. "We join people around the world in mourning the lives lost and the devastation that struck this beautiful country."
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which hit on Saturday just before noon, has claimed more than 3,800 lives and caused great destruction in the region. Governor Walker expressed sympathy to Alaska's Nepalese community and those across the world whose families have been impacted by this tragedy.
"As a survivor of the 1964 Good Friday earthquake, I have vivid memories of how thousands from around the globe sent donations and other forms of relief to those of us in Alaska," Governor Walker said. "I know Alaskans will reciprocate in kind. Donna and I continue to pray for the families of those affected by Saturday's earthquake. I know that fortitude and bravery will guide the people of Nepal through this incredible challenge."
