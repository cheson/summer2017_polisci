Governor Bill Walker today ordered all flags to be lowered to half-staff on Monday, May 25, in honor of Memorial Day.
"As Alaskans enjoy time with friends and family this holiday weekend, it's important that we all pause to remember why Memorial Day was established," Governor Walker said. "Many have died in service to our country, and this weekend we commemorate their service and sacrifice that we may live in peace. We say thank you, and we honor their lives."
President Barack Obama issued the Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day 2015 proclamation, and requested U.S. flags to be lowered to half-staff Monday, May 25, until noon. Congress has also designated 3 p.m. local time Monday as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.
Governor Walker ordered all flags to be lowered from sunrise until noon on Monday, May 25.
