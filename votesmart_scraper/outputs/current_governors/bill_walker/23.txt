Statement

Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker praised the Alaska House of Representatives today for passing the Education Funding Act, which would provide funding for essential state services like education, public safety, and road maintenance. Combined with continued budget cuts and the Permanent Fund Protection Act, SB 26, this bill would fill Alaska's $3 billion budget deficit and put the state on a path to economic security.
"I commend lawmakers in the House for taking the bold move to pass the Education Funding Act and establish a new source of revenue for our state," said Governor Walker. "We have seen far too many businesses close in recent years due to the uncertainty in Alaska's economy. We must pass a complete fiscal plan this year and stop the draw on our precious savings. This includes continued cuts to the budget, a restructure of our Permanent Fund Earnings Reserve, and new revenue. My administration will continue to work with the legislature to pass a complete plan this session so we can move on to building Alaska's future."
Governor Walker introduced his FY 2018 budget in December, and stressed the need to establish a complete fiscal plan through continued cuts, restructure of the Permanent Fund Earnings Reserve, and the establishment of a broad-based tax. This bill would fulfill the need for a broad-based tax, and provide a steady source of funding for essential services like public education and state troopers.
