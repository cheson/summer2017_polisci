Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker announced today he has been diagnosed with a treatable form of prostate cancer. The Governor released the following statement, and will hold a brief media availability at 1:30 p.m. today in the Governor's Cabinet Room on the 17th floor of the Atwood building.
"Donna and I recently learned that I have prostate cancer. As my doctor has advised, I will have surgery in December to remove the cancer. It is anticipated I will need no further treatment post-surgery. This diagnosis has not and will not impair my ability to perform my duties as governor. I want to emphasize that I had no symptoms, and it was only through a regular checkup that this diagnosis was made. I urge all Alaskans to make sure they schedule regular checkups so that early detection and treatment of health issues are possible."
