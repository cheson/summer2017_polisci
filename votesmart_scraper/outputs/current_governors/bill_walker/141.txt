Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker today applauded the Alaska Legislature for passing Senate Bill 74, which builds upon Medicaid reforms already under way. The legislation could save the state more than $365 million in the first six years. That is in addition to the millions of dollars in expected savings to the state with Governor Walker's implementation of Medicaid expansion.
"I thank Senator Pete Kelly for sponsoring this bill and his staff for working with members of my administration," Governor Walker said. "This legislation is an example of the great things we can accomplish as a state when we pull together as Alaskans to do what's right for Alaska."
