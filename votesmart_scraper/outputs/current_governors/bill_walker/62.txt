"We are very disappointed that the Department of Interior rejected the state's multiple efforts to bring the Eastern Interior Resource Management Plan into alignment with state and federal land management plans and existing laws.
Because key portions of the plan violate the 1958 statehood act and other laws, the State of Alaska took the significant step of formally protesting it. Doyon Limited, representing 19,000 Alaska Native shareholders, also protested the plan. Now that the plan has been adopted without fixing these serious defects, we will work with the incoming administration and our Congressional delegation to determine how to address this decision, which is just one in a series of disappointing decisions we've received from the Department of Interior in recent weeks.
We are concerned that implementing this plan will reduce economic opportunities in Interior Alaska. For example, the plan preemptively bans mineral exploration and development on more than three quarters of the available public lands, with no opportunity to show that these activities can be done in compliance with existing state and federal laws.
One significant way the BLM is restricting mining and other resource development in this plan is by creating new Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACECs), which lock up hundreds of thousands of acres of BLM land without consideration of existing environmental laws and regulations." -- Governor Bill Walker
