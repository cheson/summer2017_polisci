Governor Walker Prioritizes Safety with Re-start of Knik Goose Bay Road Project
Statement

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker, during a meeting yesterday on upcoming summer transportation projects, directed his administration to resume work to improve Knik Goose Bay Road between Vine Road and Settler's Bay Drive.
"There have been many crashes and collisions on this particular stretch of road in what is the fastest growing community in the state," Governor Walker said. "Residents of the Mat-Su region say it's one of the deadliest corridors in the state. We are taking a plan of action to protect Alaskans traveling from Vine to Settler's Bay as they drive to and from work. Because safety is a top priority--and you cannot put a price on a human life--I have ordered that we resume work on the project to improve Knik Goose Bay Road, which was identified in 2009 as a road safety corridor because of its past history of crashes."
The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities will resume work on the project immediately. The total cost of the project is $20 million.
