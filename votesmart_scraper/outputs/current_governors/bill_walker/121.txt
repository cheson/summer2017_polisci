"Too many Alaskan families have suffered from the effects of opioid abuse. I thank the Obama administration for committing $4 million to combat this epidemic. While Congress still needs to approve the appropriation, it's an important start. We look forward to leveraging this partnership opportunity to improve the health of Alaskans." --Governor Walker
