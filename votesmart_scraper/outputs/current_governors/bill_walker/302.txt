Gov. Lauds Arctic Exploration Announcements
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: April 2, 2015
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker today stated his support of two recent announcements on Arctic offshore oil and gas exploration.
On Tues., March 31, the U.S. Department of Interior issued a Record of Decision affirming Chukchi Sea OCS Oil and Gas Lease Sale 193 and the remaining oil and gas leases issued in 2008 as a result of the sale.
"I'm pleased Interior Secretary Sally Jewell has taken a thoughtful and balanced approach to oil and gas leasing," Governor Walker said. "This is an important step toward responsible Arctic exploration."
Governor Walker also said he is encouraged by the National Petroleum Council's report to the U.S. Secretary of Energy. The 500-page report contains a series of recommendations that reflect the Walker-Mallott administration's goals for sustainable and responsible development of the outer-continental shelf and greater Alaskan engagement.
"As the United States assumes chairmanship of the Arctic Council this month, I'm pleased to see NPC recommends more investment in and coordination of offshore Arctic oil and gas research," Governor Walker said. "The U.S. is an Arctic nation because of Alaska. This detailed and non-advocacy report underscores the importance of Alaska's oil and gas resources to the nation."
Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Mark Myers and Senator Bert Stedman are the only two Alaskan members of the NPC, an oil and natural gas advisory committee to the U.S. Secretary of Energy.
