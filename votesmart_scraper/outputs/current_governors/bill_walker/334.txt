Governor Bill Walker today ordered all state flags to be lowered to half-staff on Sunday to commemorate the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941--and to honor the individuals who died as a result of the attack.
"I encourage all Alaskans to come together to remember those whose lives were lost, and to pay homage to those who have served or are currently serving in our nation's military, and their families, for their sacrifices and dedication to our freedom," Governor Walker said.
On Dec. 7, all U.S. flags at federal, state and public facilities nationwide will be flown at half-staff. All flags should be returned to full-staff on Monday.
