Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker issued the following statement on Repsol and Armstrong's Horseshoe wells discovery:
"I applaud the announcement by Repsol and its partner, Armstrong, on their Horseshoe wells discovery. This is also great news for the State of Alaska, which yielded $17 million in our December lease sales. We must all pull together to fill an oil pipeline that's three-quarters empty--and today's announcement shows measurable results of that hard work." --Governor Bill Walker
