Governor Walker Applauds Air Force Decisions
By: Bill Walker
Date: April 14, 2015
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker today praised the United States Air Force for two announcements: its decision to keep the 18th Aggressor Squadron F-16s at Eielson Air Force Base (AFB) and the commencement of an environmental review process to station two F-35A Lightning squadrons at Eielson.
"This is great news for Alaska, given our strategic location in the world," Governor Walker said. "Having these F-16 fighter aircraft, at the ready, here in the Interior of Alaska, enhances our nation's overall readiness."
Governor Walker sent a letter welcoming the Air Force team's preliminary steps to bring F-35A squadrons to Eielson.
"Flying out of Eielson, planes can respond more quickly to hot spots in Asia, the Middle East or Europe," Governor Walker said. "Alaskans are ready, and excited, to accept the F-35 mission. Both of these announcements are good news for the Interior, where many Air Force families are a vital part of the community."
