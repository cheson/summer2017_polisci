Governor Bill Walker today welcomed to Alaska His Excellency Xi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China and Madame Peng Liyuan, First Lady of the People's Republic of China. Governor Walker, First Lady Donna Walker, Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott and Mrs. Toni Mallott greeted the President and more than a dozen of his Ministers and Directors when they flew into Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport Friday evening.
The Chinese government officially notified the governor's office last month that President Xi Jinping would be flying into Anchorage, and requested a meeting between President Xi and Governor Walker.
"I am honored to host President Xi and Madame Peng during their visit to Alaska," Governor Walker said. "China is one of our largest trading partners, and I am eager to tell President Xi about the abundance of Alaska's resource development opportunities. We have tremendous potential in our oil and gas, tourism, fish, air cargo and mineral resource industries."
Governor Walker and Lt. Governor Mallott met with President Xi and members of the President's delegation in Anchorage.
Governor Walker will hold a media availability at 10 a.m. tomorrow, Saturday, April 8, on the 17th floor of the Atwood building, 550 W. 7th Avenue in Anchorage.
