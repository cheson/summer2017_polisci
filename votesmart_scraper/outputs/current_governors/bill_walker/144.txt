Governor Bill Walker today ordered all Alaska state flags to be lowered in honor of the victims of the attacks in Brussels, Belgium. This action follows a proclamation by President Barack Obama to lower all United States flags.
"There are no words to express how devastating the events in Brussels are today," said Governor Walker. "Our hearts go out to all the people of Belgium. Alaska stands with you in solidarity at this dark time."
Per the President's proclamation and Governor Walker's order, all United States and Alaska flags should be flown at half-staff beginning immediately and remain lowered until sunset on March 26th, 2016.
