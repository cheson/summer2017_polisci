Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker today expressed his thanks for the work done by members of the Alaska Legislature to pass House Bill 123.
"I appreciate the deliberation that took place in both the House and Senate to establish this important board," Governor Walker said. "Our elected officials recognized the critical nature of this bill and acted decisively to protect public safety."
Governor Walker introduced HB 123 to create a Marijuana Control Board tasked with developing regulations covering aspects of marijuana cultivation, processing, and commercial sale. The board will include representatives from the public health and safety sectors, industry, and rural Alaska. Members will also share staff with the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.
Once signed into law, this legislation will fulfill a critical component of the initiative voters passed in November 2014 by establishing a governing body to oversee and uphold regulations related to marijuana production and distribution.
By empowering the new board with the authority and resources to develop a strong regulatory framework, Alaska has the opportunity to establish clear, consistent, and thorough rules around this substance for the benefit of citizens, licensees, and law enforcement..
