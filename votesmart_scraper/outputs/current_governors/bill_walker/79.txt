Governor Walker's Statement on Interior's Offshore Leasing Plan
Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: Nov. 19, 2016
Location: Anchorage, AK

"I am very disappointed with the U.S. Department of the Interior's announcement today. Alaska supports a plan that balances subsistence concerns with our need for economic development. There is enough opportunity and protection in the plan that it should have been an easy decision to move forward with our proposal. The State nominated the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas to ensure Alaskans' interests were protected in this process. The nominations provided subsistence protection, as well as the benefits under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). With the trans-Alaska pipeline three-quarters empty, we must spur more oil production. When Alaska became a state, the federal government mandated that we live off of our resources--but we must be able to access them. My administration will reconvene with the whaling communities and industry to determine next steps. "
