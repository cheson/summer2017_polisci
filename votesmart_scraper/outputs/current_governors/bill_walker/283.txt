Gov. Applauds Passage Of Child Support Bill
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: April 27, 2015
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker thanked the Alaska Legislature today for passing his amendments to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, HB 106. Under the newly adopted legislation, Alaska will be able to enforce and collect child support from people living in other countries.
Alaska's Uniform Interstate Family Support Act prevents a parent from evading his or her child support obligations by simply moving to another state. HB 106 amends the Uniform Act to ensure the same efficient and expedited processes can apply between countries, just as it occurs between states.
UIFSA also makes Alaska eligible to receive $64 million in federal money for continued funding of Alaska's child support program and Alaska's Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF) program.
"I thank the Legislature for passing this important piece of legislation so we can ensure the needs of the most vulnerable Alaskans are met," Governor Walker said. "With passage of this bill, we are upholding our obligation to Alaskan children."
