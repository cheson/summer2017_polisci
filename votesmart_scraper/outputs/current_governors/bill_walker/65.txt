Alaska makes the United States an Arctic nation. The State of Alaska leads the way in securing the future for those living in the Arctic and America's interests. Alaska is positioned as a critical hub for the global economy. The economic potential for this region of America is still, in many respects, unknown, but all current evidence suggests vast natural resources. Considering the future, choices for this region are best made at local and state levels. This responsibility for the State of Alaska is met with the firm understanding that policy affecting the Arctic is a cooperation of communities, industry, and science.
The State of Alaska encourages an ongoing and inclusive dialogue with stakeholders of the region and beyond.
Five key priority areas facilitate good stewardship, responsible development, and preparedness.
Increasing involvement and prominence in all areas of Arctic governance, with particular focus on the Arctic Council.
Ensuring the sustainability of rural Alaska, particularly Alaska Native communities.
Developing a better understanding of our changing climate, oceans, and environment.
Improving intergovernmental collaboration, transparency, and participation.
Implementing planning and holistic management to meet infrastructure needs and adapt to the rapidly changing Arctic.
