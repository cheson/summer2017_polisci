"While today's news from Fitch Ratings is concerning, it should not come as a surprise. Fitch notes that we have a deficit of more than $3 billion after cutting the budget 19 percent last year and another 20.5 percent this year. With no significant new revenue measures passed to date, Alaska will burn through its savings in just a few short years. This further underscores the need to pass a sustainable fiscal package this year. We have all the tools to solve the problem. I urge members of the House to create certainty and stability for all Alaskans by voting for the Permanent Fund Protection Act, which is the cornerstone of the plan for a sustainable future." -Governor Bill Walker
