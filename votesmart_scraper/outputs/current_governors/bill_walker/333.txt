Public Statements
Governor Asks for Help to Identify Cuts
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: Dec. 26, 2014
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker sent letters today to all commissioners asking them to identify potential cuts in their departments by January 10.
"With holiday celebrations winding down and oil prices dipping, it's time we all roll up our sleeves and get to work on reducing costs," Governor Walker said. "I have asked our commissioners to take a careful look at their departments to see where we can redesign or perhaps combine some services."
Governor Walker asked each department to look at the potential effects of a 5-percent and 8-percent cut from the previous administration's FY2016 Work-in-Progress budget released on December 15.
Governor Walker asked commissioners, in assessing places to cut, to also look for ways to maintain regional strength, partner with local governments and non-profit organizations and to evaluate whether the state should continue programs not legally required.
Governor Walker also asked state employees to weigh in anonymously through a survey to identify inefficiencies. That survey will be sent separately.
The public is invited to weigh in, as well. Governor Walker provided a survey website through which Alaskans can voice their ideas for cutting the budget: http://gov.alaska.gov/Walker/press-room/budget-survey.html
Those with the top five suggestions will have the opportunity to have a private lunch with Governor Walker and Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott.
"This is a challenging task, but I'm confident that with teamwork and creative thinking, we can streamline state services and cut spending," Governor Walker said. "I look forward to seeing the suggestions."
