Location: Anchorage, AK

Today, in a 6-to-3 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in favor of the defendant in the case of King v. Burwell. The court ruled that federal subsidies are legal in states like Alaska that did not establish state-based health insurance exchanges under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).
"We are pleased so many of our friends, family and neighbors will be able to continue to receive health care," said Governor Bill Walker. "Now it's important that we continue to work toward Medicaid expansion, so more Alaskans can receive the health coverage they need."
Over $1 billion in new federal revenue would be brought into the state to provide health care coverage to almost 42,000 Alaskans in the first six years through Medicaid expansion. Governor Walker reemphasized his support for Medicaid reform and expansion in Alaska given today's Supreme Court announcement.
