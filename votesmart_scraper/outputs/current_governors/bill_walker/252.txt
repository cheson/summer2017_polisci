Walker Clarifies Firewall with Leg. Mediator
Statement
By: Bill Walker

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker today emphasized he is not coordinating or communicating with Matt Peterson, the mediator who is working with members of the Legislature to resolve the budget impasse.
"I want to make it very clear that I am not directing Matt Peterson on his mediation," Governor Walker said. "Matt told me he will not be sharing with me any part of the mediation process--nor would I want him to. The goal of bringing on a mediator is to get past this gridlock so we can have a fully funded budget, and the state can move on to tackling this $4 billion deficit."
