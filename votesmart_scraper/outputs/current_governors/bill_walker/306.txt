Governor Bill Walker today transmitted legislation to provide health care coverage to up to 42,000 low-income Alaskans, reform Medicaid, and bring more money into the state.
"As Alaskans, we have a long tradition of caring for each other when times are tough," Governor Walker said. "This proposal will save money and save lives. It provides health care for more Alaskans using less state money. It's the right thing to do."
The bill
(1) Takes advantage of available federal resources by accepting an estimated $146 million in federal Medicaid expansion money; and
(2) Lays out the governor's plans to reform the state's Medicaid system to ensure the program is affordable over the long term.
The bill makes health coverage available through Medicaid to Alaskans who earn about $20,314 or less ($9.76 per hour) or married couplies who earn $27,490 or less.
"Governor Walker and I have heard from so many Alaskans about their inability to get the health care they need," Health and Social Services Commissioner Valerie Davidson said. "We all have an interest in ensuring that Alaskans are as productive as possible and can contribute to our communities and economy. But people can't work, hunt, or fish when they are not healthy."
Through 2016, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs for newly covered Alaskans. After that, the federal match transitions to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. The savings to the state will more than cover our match.
