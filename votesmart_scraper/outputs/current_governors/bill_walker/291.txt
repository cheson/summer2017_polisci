Governor Walker today thanked the 29th Alaska Legislature for passing House Bill 135 to provide public employees with a new Designated Roth 457 deferred compensation option to diversify their retirement savings.
"With passage of HB 135, we're providing options to help hard-working state employees, those who accomplish the core services that we in this great state depend upon daily, to make the most of their service with the state," said Governor Walker. "Respecting our public servants means providing them with the best opportunities to enjoy their retirement after a successful career in state government."

Designated Roth 457 is a government-specific, post-tax retirement deferred compensation investment option that allows state employees to pay taxes on additional income that is set aside from current pay checks in a deferred compensation account. That money is then disbursed with any accumulated earnings, during retirement, tax free. This provides a state employee the option of additional retirement savings to achieve the preferred level of tax liability in their retirement.
The introduction of HB 135 was in response to state employees who asked for the addition of this relatively new option, and Congress' 2011 passage of enabling legislation for qualified government plans. Now any active participating state employee of the Alaska Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) or Alaska Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) will be able to elect this new deferred compensation option starting around July 1, 2015.
