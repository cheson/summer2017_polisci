Walker Disappointed in Legislature's Decision

Governor Bill Walker today said he is disappointed the legislature voted to take a 12-day recess and leave the capital city without passing a fully funded budget. The vote in the House of Representatives was 24-13 with a 15-5 vote in the Senate.
The currently unfunded status could potentially jeopardize the state's credit ratings, as David Teal, director of the legislative finance division, testified during yesterday's House Finance hearing.
An unfunded budget creates uncertainty for school districts planning for the upcoming year, undermines the state's ability to honor its contracts, and compromises the ability of state agencies to provide basic services like transportation and public safety.
"As a nonpartisan Governor, I urge legislators to come back to the negotiating table, set aside their political differences, and cooperate with each other in the best interest of Alaskans," Governor Walker said. "This current climate of uncertainty is detrimental to Alaskans."
