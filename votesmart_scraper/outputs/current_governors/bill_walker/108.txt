Governor Walker Orders Flags Lowered to Honor Victims of Dallas Attack
Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: July 8, 2016
Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker ordered all Alaska flags to be lowered today in honor of the five police officers slain in Dallas, Texas. This order follows a directive from the White House to lower all United States flags to honor the victims of the Thursday attack.
"This is a sobering reminder that law enforcement officials give the public a blank check every day when they leave for work," Governor Walker said. "When they kiss loved ones goodbye before their shifts begin, they do so knowing it could be the last time. Law enforcement officials put themselves in harm's way to protect the rest of us. Please keep the family members of these slain officers in your prayers. And when you see a trooper or police officer today, be sure to say thank you."
Per President Obama's proclamation and Governor Walker's order, all United States and Alaska flags should be lowered to half-staff until sunset on Tuesday, July 12.
