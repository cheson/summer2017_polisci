Governor Clarifies Ambler Road Spending
Press Release

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker clarified to Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) the intent behind Administrative Order 271, the December 26, 2014, memo that halted all new spending on six mega projects, including the Ambler Road Project. After reviewing the project, Governor Walker permitted AIDEA to spend up to $3.6 million, which had already been appropriated, to begin the environmental impact statement (EIS) process.
"My team reviewed this project and has clarified what "discretionary spending' means for this project," Governor Walker said. "As we wrestle with a $3.5 billion deficit, it's important that we examine all spending. With the Ambler Road project, the $3.6 million had already been appropriated, so this clarification allows the project to progress to a natural stopping point instead of stalled mid-step."
The Ambler Road project evaluates the potential to build an industrial road into the Ambler mining district in northwest Alaska, which is rich in copper, zinc, lead and gold resources.
