Governor Walker Opens Mat-Su Regional Office
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: March 23, 2015
Location: Juneau, AK

In alignment with his goals to facilitate a more accessible government, Governor Bill Walker today announced the opening of his Matanuska Susitna regional office. The purpose of the office is to provide Mat-Su residents with better access to the Governor's Office, and build stronger relationships with residents, officials and organizations in the region.
"Mat-Su is the fastest growing region in Alaska and the only community to have consistent growth over the past 12 years," said Governor Walker. "That's why I felt it was important to reassign staff from my Anchorage office to oversee our operations in the Mat-Su."
Sarah Heath, Director of the Governor's Matanuska Susitna Regional Office, will provide support to Mat-Su residents, and act as a regional liaison to the Walker Administration. Heath was previously Deputy Director of Boards and Commissions for the Governor's Office. Prior to that, she worked with the Guardian Ad Litem in the Office of Public Advocacy. She is a trained mediator for the Alaska Court's Children in Need of Aid Mediation Program, and is an active member of the Alaska Bar Association. A long-time Valley resident, Heath received a bachelor's degree in business finance from the University of Alaska Anchorage and her juris doctor from Texas Wesleyan School of Law.
With its official opening today, the Mat-Su now joins Fairbanks, Anchorage, and Washington D.C. as regional hubs for the Governor's Office. The Governor's main office is located in the State Capitol Building in Juneau.
