Governor Bill Walker announced new leadership for the Department of Corrections today. Walter Monegan III was named Interim Commissioner of the state agency, which oversees the confinement of inmates living in correctional facilities, halfway houses, and community jails across Alaska. This announcement comes in conjunction with the release of Governor Walker's administrative review of the Department of Corrections and its facilities.
"The core values of this administration include public trust, respect, and community service. Everything we say and do as an administration must reflect these values, and that begins with the leadership in every department," said Governor Walker. "I have asked Walt Monegan to step in as the Department of Corrections Interim Commissioner to help us get our house in order, and begin DOC on a path to build public trust and restore integrity."
Governor Walker also released his office's administrative review of the Department of Corrections today. This report follows an 11-week review of DOC by Special Assistant Dean Williams and retired FBI agent Joe Hanlon. The report was prompted by several high-profile inmate deaths, and concerns expressed by lawmakers and the general public.
"The state has a valid interest in making sure its Department of Corrections is a thriving state agency that promotes inmate and public safety," said Governor Walker. "A majority of inmates will ultimately be released, so it behooves us to ensure their time in our correctional facilities does not hinder their pursuit to a healthy life. This report is by no means the end of our effort to bring change to the Department of Corrections. I look forward to working with Walt to turn the page and regain the public's trust in our corrections system."
