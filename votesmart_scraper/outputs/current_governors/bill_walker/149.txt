Flags Lowered in Honor of Nancy Reagan
Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: March 7, 2016
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker today ordered all Alaska state flags be lowered in honor of former First Lady of the United States Nancy Reagan, who passed away yesterday at the age of 94. This action follows a proclamation by President Barack Obama to lower all United States flags in honor of Mrs. Reagan.
"Nancy Reagan played an influential role in American policy not only as our country's First Lady, but for many years before and after. She was courageous in taking on issues like substance abuse and Alzheimer's disease research, and was the strongest supporter of her husband's career as a public servant," said Governor Walker. "Our hearts go out to the Reagan family and the American people during this time of great loss. Her memory will live on for generations to come through the great contributions she made to our country."
Per the President's proclamation and Governor Walker's order, all United States and Alaska flags should be flown at half-staff beginning immediately and remain lowered until sunset on the day of interment.
