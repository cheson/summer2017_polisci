Location: Juneau, AK

Gov. Bill Walker and Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott are calling on Alaskans to participate in a discussion about Alaska's fiscal future. The Walker/Mallott administration will kick off the conversation Fri., June 5 -- Sun., June 7 at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. "Building a Sustainable Future: Conversations with Alaskans" will bring together members of the Walker/Mallott transition team and other Alaskans starting that Friday evening through Sunday afternoon.
"Lt. Governor Byron Mallott and I want to tap the wisdom, knowledge and commitment of Alaskans to meet our current challenges and ensure we have a prosperous future," Governor Walker said. "Our fiscal forecast demands long-term focus and attention. I am confident that this event, coupled with the statewide conversations over the summer months, will bring the best ideas forward."
The weekend will feature a series of presentations and discussions on the current fiscal status of the state, the right size of government, and revenue options moving forward. All presentations will be videotaped and posted online. The public will be able to participate online. Gov. Walker's Cabinet members will be on hand to answer questions about their departments' budgets and services, and will be listening to the conversations. Legislators are invited to attend the presentations and observe the dialogue.
After the event, attendees will take information back to their communities, continue the dialogue through the summer, and report back to the Governor and his administration.
