"I congratulate ConocoPhillips on its exciting and promising Willow Discovery in NPR-A. This is just one more piece of good news we've received from Alaska's oil and gas explorers in recent months, and it demonstrates that Alaska remains an attractive place to do business and look for oil. My administration looks forward to continuing to work with ConocoPhillips and local stakeholders on developing and bringing the Willow find into production in a timely fashion. We believe that continued hydrocarbon development in NPR-A will benefit our state in terms of revenue, employment opportunities, and maintaining TAPS throughput." -- Governor Bill Walker
