Governor Walker's Statement on House's Sine Die Adjournment of Fifth Special Session
Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: July 18, 2016
Location: Juneau, AK

"Without a sustainable fiscal plan that includes restructuring of the permanent fund, the dividend program goes to $0 in less than four years. The Republican-led Senate passed the legislation that would have reduced the dividend to $1,000 this year. Senators agreed to this measure in an effort to protect future dividends for all Alaskans. By doing nothing this year, the House sets us on an even more challenging journey to a sustainable fiscal future. Without a plan, all Alaskans will lose not only their dividends but also critical services--from public safety to education and keeping roads and airports open and ready for business. I will do everything I can to keep Alaska on a path to prosperity."
