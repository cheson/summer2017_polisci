Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: June 7, 2016
Location: Anchorage, AK

"I thank members of the Senate for taking this important vote to put Alaska on the path for a sustainable future. We recognize the concern some have raised about the need for balance, which we have addressed through the remaining pieces of the New Sustainable Alaska Plan. Restructuring the Permanent Fund is the cornerstone of this plan, and a significant portion of it, but make no mistake--the work to put Alaska on a sustainable path is far from over. I applaud the Senate for taking this bold step." --Governor Bill Walker
