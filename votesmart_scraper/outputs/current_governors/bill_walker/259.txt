Governor Bill Walker today congratulated members of the Alaska House of Representatives for reaching a budget agreement early this morning and urged members of the Senate to concur.
"I thank members of the House for negotiating on a fully funded budget so that we can continue to fund services Alaskans depend on," Governor Walker said. "It is now up to the Senate to concur with work the House has begun to ensure 10,000 layoff notices are not sent out."
