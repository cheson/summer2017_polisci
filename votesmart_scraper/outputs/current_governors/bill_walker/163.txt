Press Release

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker today ordered restrictions on executive branch travel and hiring as part of the administration's ongoing efforts to reduce state spending. This action formalizes what many state departments and agencies have already informally begun to do. Travel and hiring considered essential to protect the life, health and safety of Alaskans will be among the only exceptions.
"As we work toward plugging the $3.5 billion hole in our budget, it is critical that state employees continue to take every step possible to ensure we are being good stewards of our resources," Governor Walker said. "As we worked on our fiscal plan, the comment my team and I heard most from Alaskans is that we must continue to rein in spending. Much thought and discussion have gone into each cut we have made and will make. Many agencies and departments have already implemented these cost-cutting measures. The announcement I'm making today establishes a consistent standard and process across the administration. These restrictions on hiring and travel alone won't fix the deficit, but it's an important step."
Governor Walker urged state employees to utilize video conferencing and telephonic meetings whenever possible, and asked members of boards and commissions and non-executive state agencies to follow suit.. All in-state travel requests must now be approved by the department's Commissioner and out-of-state travel requests must be approved by the Chief of Staff. When possible, reservations made before today should be canceled.
"We cannot continue with business as usual," Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott said. "Increasingly, we will have to do less with less. Some departments and agencies have already implemented furloughs as part of ongoing efforts to reduce state spending."
