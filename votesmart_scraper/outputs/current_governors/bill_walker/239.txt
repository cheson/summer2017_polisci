Press Release

Governor Bill Walker signed HB 146 and HB 158 into law today. Both bills were passed during the regular session of the 29th Alaska Legislature.
HB 146, which was sponsored by Representative Cathy Munoz of Juneau, incentivizes new development and aids in the redevelopment of deteriorated areas through municipal tax exemptions. Additionally, the bill broadens the definition of deteriorated property so entities that own multiple residential property units in a deteriorated area have the option of being collectively considered a deteriorated property.
"HB 146 encourages new development for municipalities all across Alaska," said Governor Walker. "For communities like Juneau, this will help to counter a significant housing shortage and incentivize desperately needed new development."
Also sponsored by Representative Munoz, HB 158 creates a one cent per gallon tax on certain refined fuels in order to generate revenue for the Hazardous Substance Release Prevention and Response Fund. The Senate version of the bill, SB 86, was sponsored by Senator Peter Micciche of Soldotna. While the fund was historically supported through a 5-cent per barrel surcharge on oil, recent declines in oil production have left it with a projected shortfall. HB 158 is seen as a remedy to that.
"This bill provides long term stability to Alaska's spill response efforts," said Governor Walker. "I commend Representative Munoz and Senator Micciche for their work on this important piece of legislation."
