"The action taken by Standard & Poor's to lower Alaska's credit rating is concerning and premature given that the legislature has not had time to act on a long-term fiscal plan. However, this further solidifies the need to address our state's fiscal challenges in the immediate future. As noted in S&P's release today, Alaska has significant financial assets that, if properly utilized, can help build fiscal stability for our state. I agree with S&P that the stakes are high for Alaska to enact a sustainable fiscal package, but it's important to do what is right for our state's future versus what may be politically appealing. As we approach the 2016 legislative session, I encourage every legislator and Alaskan to read the memos released by Standard & Poor's and Moody's in their entirety. I look forward to working with lawmakers to enact a complete fiscal package that protects the opportunities available to future generations of Alaskans." --Governor Bill Walker
