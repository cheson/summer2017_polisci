Governor Bill Walker and his team wrapped up his second day of high-level meetings discussing Alaska's liquefied natural gas potential with top-ranking executives in Japan, including the chief executive of Marubeni Corporation, a leading liquefied natural gas trading company, the governor of Kyoto Prefecture and former Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda.
"Alaska can point to 40 years of proven deliverability of our rich natural gas supply to the Asian market," Governor Walker said. "We have the capacity to provide decades more to millions of customers to our Pacific neighbors."
Governor Walker also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to formalize Alaska's relationship with the prefecture of Kyoto. Governor Keiji Yamada also signed the document.
"Kyoto has experienced many energy challenges since the earthquake and tsunami of 2011," Governor Keiji Yamada said. "This MOU will not only benefit our prefecture, it will greatly benefit the surrounding prefectures in Japan."
Governor Walker, Department of Natural Resources Deputy Commissioner Marty Rutherford and Alaska Gas Team General Manger Audie Setters presented briefings on Alaska's LNG potential during the Alaska Oil and Gas Opportunity Seminar. The seminar was organized by Resources Energy, Inc., and sponsored by the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, Institute of Energy Economics, Energy Resources, Inc.., and Japan Institute for Overseas Investment.
On Wednesday, Governor Walker will deliver a keynote address at the LNG Producer-Consumer Conference, and meet with the President and CEO of Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS), the world's largest corporate buyer of LNG.
