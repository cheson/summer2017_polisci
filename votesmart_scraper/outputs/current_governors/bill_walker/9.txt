Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker today called the Legislature into special session to pass the operating and capital budgets, fix Alaska's fiscal and opioid crises, and create the economic certainty the state needs. The Special Session will begin Thursday morning, May 18, at 11:00 a.m.
"I thank members of the House and Senate for taking positive steps toward solving Alaska's fiscal challenges," Governor Walker said. "However, the work is not done. Our state cannot afford to continue drawing down savings to pay for schools, roads, and public safety. Alaskans deserve a complete fiscal plan that puts an end to the economic uncertainty we have been facing. It is for those reasons that I am calling the legislature into special session, and urge everyone to work toward compromise to fix the crisis now."
Governor Walker's special session call includes the following items:
* Opioids prescription and monitoring
* Operating budget
* Mental health budget
* Capital budget
* Oil and gas tax credit reform
* Permanent Fund Protection Act
* Motor fuel tax
* Broad-based tax
Expert testimony to both houses of the legislature has made clear that any complete plan to solve Alaska's fiscal crisis must close the budget deficit this year, and include a broad-based revenue measure to connect Alaska's economy to the services government provides.
