Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: May 4, 2017
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker issued the following statement today following passage of the American Healthcare Act (AHCA) in the U.S. House of Representatives:
"This bill could be a game-changer for Alaska. Our state would be the most negatively affected if the proposed legislation is signed into law as is. Alaskans already pay the highest health care premiums in the country. Affordable health care coverage is critical to provide necessary treatment resources to address the opioid epidemic in Alaska. My team and I will continue working with members of our Congressional Delegation to ensure Alaskans are protected and covered." --Governor Bill Walker
