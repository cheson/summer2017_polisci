Governor Walker Issues Statement on Reversal of Arctic OCS Withdrawal
Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: April 28, 2017
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker issued the following statement today in response to the President signing the "America-First Offshore Energy Strategy," an executive order which re-opens areas of the outer-continental shelf in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas to potential energy exploration.
"I am pleased with the announcement that areas of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas are once again open for consideration for future energy exploration and development. Last year, our administration made clear that we supported an Offshore Leasing Plan which balances subsistence concerns with our need for economic development, and as a result, made nominations consistent with those principles to the Department of Interior. Disappointingly, our recommendations were not only excluded from the Department's plan, but those same areas were withdrawn from eligibility for inclusion in future plans. Today's executive order is an important step towards spurring additional oil production through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline." --Governor Bill Walker
