Alaska to Compete for Resiliency Funding
Press Release

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker announced today that the State of Alaska was selected as one of 40 finalists of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) National Disaster Resilience Competition (NDRC), a grant program that could provide millions of dollars to Alaskan communities to prevent future damage in disaster-impacted regions.
The NDRC is a two-phase process that will competitively award nearly $1 billion in HUD Disaster Recovery funds to eligible communities. The competition will help selected communities recover from prior disasters and improve their ability to better withstand and recover from future disasters, hazards, and shocks.
"While Alaska's hazard mitigation program does outstanding work in rural and urban communities, this program would allow us to address problems that are otherwise beyond our current funding reach," said Governor Bill Walker. "We need to evaluate how we can recover from past disasters, and help communities identify ways in which they can protect the long-term well-being and safety of their residents."
During phase one, applicants considered their disaster recovery needs, vulnerabilities, stakeholder interests, resilience, community development objectives, and investment alternatives. In phase two, applicants will consider and refine approaches to meet their needs and objectives identified in the first phase. HUD invited the top-scoring applicants from phase one to participate in phase two, and will make funding awards at the conclusion of the second phase.
NDRC expects to award projects ranging from $1 million to $500 million.
