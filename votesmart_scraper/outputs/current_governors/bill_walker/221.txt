Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker expressed his gratitude to Portland Mayor Charlie Hales and Oregon Governor Kate Brown for their part in putting a stop to the illegal protesting activities that were delaying Shell's MSV Fennica icebreaker from leaving Portland waters yesterday. The icebreaker had been sent to Portland for repairs after being damaged earlier in the month.
"On behalf of all the Alaskans and Americans who will benefit from the economic opportunities afforded to us by responsible offshore drilling in the Arctic, I wish to thank Governor Brown and Mayor Hales for their leadership. Alaska and the United States are poised to lead the world in this industry."
As of yesterday afternoon, the icebreaker is now headed back to Alaska to begin Shell's offshore drilling operations in the Chukchi Sea.
