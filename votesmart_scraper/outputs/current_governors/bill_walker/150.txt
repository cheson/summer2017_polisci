"I am pleased the Superior Court agrees I have the authority to expand federally funded Medicaid coverage to thousands of Alaskans, which will generate more than $1 billion in just the first six years and save the state more than $100 million. Working Alaskans have been able to get health care coverage since September, thanks to the hard work of Commissioner Val Davidson and her Health and Social Services team. We will continue to work with the legislature on Medicaid redesign and reform efforts." --Governor Bill Walker
