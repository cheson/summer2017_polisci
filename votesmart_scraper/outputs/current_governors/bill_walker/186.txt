Governor Bill Walker, Representative Bob Herron, and Senator Lyman Hoffman joined together to commit their support to the community of Bethel as residents cope with a structure fire and loss of a Yup'ik language immersion school. On Tuesday, a fire completely destroyed Ayaprun Elitnaurvik and essential systems like boilers, a water plant, and a large kitchen were complete losses. The fire also caused extensive damages to a boarding school that was housed in the same building.
"This is a devastating loss for the Bethel community," said Governor Walker. "I thank all of the members of the Bethel community who joined together to fight the fire, and I am proud of all the emergency personnel and volunteers who have been working together to protect Alaskans. Our thoughts go out to the entire community as they begin recovering from this tragedy."
"Like many people in Bethel, Margaret and I sent all of our children through Kilbuck and this loss is difficult," said Representative Herron. "Though in Juneau, I am very proud of how our community is coming together. Governor Walker and I met with the LKSD leadership this morning by telephone and we pledged to help and assist the school district. Tough decisions lay ahead, but supporting the Immersion teachers, students and parents is very important. Also, I am grateful that the Kuskokwim Learning Academy students have found a temporary home so quickly."
"Many Bethel residents have fond memories of the Kilbuck School," said Senator Hoffman. "I was a graduate of Kilbuck and spent all my K-12 school days in that building as did many others in the region."
Ayaprun Elitnaurvik serves 175 students and Kuskokwim Learning Academy serves 125 students from Bethel, surrounding villages, and other parts of Alaska.
