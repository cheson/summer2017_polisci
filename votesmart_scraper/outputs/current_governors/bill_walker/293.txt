Governor Bill Walker today thanked the Legislature for confirming all of his commissioner appointments.
"I appointed some of the most highly qualified, dedicated public servants in Alaska," Governor Walker said. "I have told my Cabinet members they make up my dream team, and I mean that. I am so pleased the Legislature agrees, and I thank legislators for voting to confirm all of these fine commissioners."
The Legislature during a joint session confirmed Craig Fleener as successor to the lieutenant governor; Craig Richards as Attorney General of Department of Law; Sheldon Fisher as Commissioner of Department of Administration; Chris Hladick as Commissioner of Department of Commerce Community and Economic Development; Ron Taylor as Commissioner of Department of Corrections; Sam Cotten as Commissioner of Department of Fish and Game; Valerie Davidson as Commissioner of Department of Health and Social Services; Heidi Drygas as Commissioner of Department of Labor; Brigadier General Laurel Hummel as The Adjutant General and Commissioner of Department of Military and Veterans Affairs; Mark Myers as Commissioner of Department of Natural Resources; Randy Hoffbeck as Commissioner of Department of Revenue; and Marc Luiken as Commissioner of Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.
The Governor's reappointments of Gary Folger as Commissioner of Department of Public Safety and Larry Hartig of Commissioner of Department of Environmental Conservation did not require legislative approval during this legislative session because they had been previously confirmed. Commissioner of Department of Education Mike Hanley was appointed by the Board of Education and approved by Governor Walker.
