Governor Bill Walker today revoked his proclamation to convene the House and Senate into a joint session today at 10 a.m. to vote on his appointments.
"I just wrapped up a meeting with House Speaker Mike Chenault and Senate President Kevin Meyer," Governor Walker said. "They gave me their word that each of the 89 appointments would be given an up or down vote on Sunday. I trust them."
Governor Walker said revoking the proclamation is an important step toward a positive relationship with legislative leadership.
