Governor Bill Walker released on Friday, December 5, the budget given to him by Governor Sean Parnell on Monday, December 1.

In order to meet the December 15 statutory deadline, Governor Walker plans to submit the Parnell operating budget plan--without endorsement.
The Walker team is currently working on the budget, and will take into account recommendations by the transition team.
"We will not have as many capital projects on December 15 as the outgoing administration has in its proposal," said Office of Management and Budget Director Pat Pitney. "But we anticipate changes in the amendment process. We want to carefully evaluate all capital expenditures."
The Walker administration will continue to refine its budget proposal after the December 15 deadline.
"The new budget, fully endorsed by Governor Walker, will be submitted in advance of the February 18 amended budget deadline," Pitney said. "We respect and desire full legislative deliberation. We're working to get our budget to legislators as early as possible," Pitney said.
