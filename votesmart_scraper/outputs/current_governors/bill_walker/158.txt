Governor Bill Walker announced today his selection of a Department of Corrections commissioner. Dean Williams, who served as Governor Walker's special assistant, conducted an administrative review of the department, and identified key areas for improvement in policies and procedures.

"Given his extensive experience running institutions and the insight he gained about our correctional facilities while conducting the administrative review, I have full confidence that Dean will revamp the system."
Mr. Williams spent more than 30 years working in the state's justice system. He worked for 12 years as a juvenile justice officer, five years for the Department of Law and 14 years as Division of Juvenile Justice superintendent overseeing various facilities throughout the state.
Governor Walker also thanked Walt Monegan for serving as interim commissioner.
