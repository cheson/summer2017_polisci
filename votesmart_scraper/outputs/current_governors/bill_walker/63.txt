Gov. Walker Voices Support for Sen. Murkowski's Monument Designation Reform Legislation
Statement
By: Bill Walker

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker expressed his support for legislation introduced  by Senator Lisa Murkowski today that would require greater state and local input before a national monument can be designated on federal land.
Titled the Improved National Monument Designation Process Act, the bill requires authorization from Congress; approval from state legislatures; and certification of compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act before a national monument is established.
"Alaskans should have a say when our federal lands are being locked up as a national monument. I appreciate the hard work Senator Murkowski and her colleagues have done on this issue, and I hope this legislation is seen with an open mind by Congress and the incoming administration," said Governor Walker. "We have seen too many disappointing decisions from the outgoing administration recently. Efforts to lock up Alaska's public land inhibit our ability to responsibly develop our resources."
Currently, a president can establish a national monument through the Antiquities Act. This process can provide little input for communities in the monument's region and has recently been used to circumvent Congress. Governor Walker stressed that state and local governments should have greater say in this process.
