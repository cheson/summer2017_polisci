Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: Dec. 3, 2015
Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker today ordered all Alaska state flags to be lowered in honor of the victims of yesterday's tragic shooting in San Bernardino. This action follows a proclamation by President Barack Obama to lower all United States flags in honor of those who were killed in this tragic event.
"This is a heartbreaking tragedy and today we are grieving with the community of San Bernardino," said Governor Walker. "This senseless act of violence robbed victims' families and friends of a lifetime of memories with their loved ones."
