Public Statements
Drunk Driving Victims' Remembrance Day
By: Bill Walker
Date: July 1, 2016
Location: Juneau, AK

WHEREAS, driving while impaired by alcohol is a serious criminal offense in Alaska, endangering the lives and safety of all who use the public roadways. Drunk driving unnecessarily kills thousands of people every year; and all drunk driving deaths are entirely preventable; and
WHEREAS, alcohol-impaired driving remains a commonly committed crime and a leading cause of death nationwide. Through the exercise of good judgement, personal responsibility, and a commitment by every Alaskan to never drive while under the influence of alcohol, these driving accidents can be prevented, and lives can be saved; and
WHEREAS, according to the Alaska Highway Safety Office, there have been four fatalities in four alcohol related crashes so far in 2016. In 2015 there were twenty-one fatalities in twenty-one alcohol related fatal crashes; and
WHEREAS, we remember the communities, families, and loved ones who have been affected by drunk driving, the victims whose lives have been lost, and the perpetrators whose lives are permanently altered by the consequences of the poor choice to drive while impaired; and
WHEREAS, as we enjoy summer weather, celebrations, and activities in Alaska, we can choose to do so responsibly, setting good examples for others, making the decision not to drink and drive, and to keep ourselves and our communities safe.
NOW THEREFORE, I, Bill Walker, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF ALASKA, do hereby proclaim July 3, 2016 as:
Drunk Driving Victims' Remembrance Day
in Alaska, and encourage all Alaskans to honor the victims of drunk driving accidents, and make safe decisions by not driving after consuming alcohol.
