Governor Walker Signs Legislation to Boost Local Economic Development
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: May 1, 2017
Location: Fairbanks, AK

Governor Bill Walker yesterday signed legislation making it easier for the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMVA) to designate "military facility zones" in Alaska. Military facility zones enable communities to create tax incentives for business development related to military activities and stimulate local economic activity. Senator John Coghill (R-Fairbanks) sponsored the bill; Representative Steve Thompson (R-Fairbanks) carried it in the House. Senate Bill 9 was signed at the 49th Annual Military Appreciation Banquet.
"This bill helps to build a stronger Alaska," Governor Walker said. "Our administration is always looking for ways to remove barriers and streamline government, and this bill presents an opportunity to do just that. I thank Senator Coghill and Representative Thompson for bringing this legislation forward, and look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have on our communities."
SB 9 allows DMVA to consider applications for military facility zones if requests are consistent with local zoning ordinances, streamlining the process and increasing flexibility. When previously reviewing proposed military facility zones, the department could only consider municipal or borough comprehensive plans, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.
