Governor Walker's Statement on Dismissal of Medicaid Expansion Lawsuit
Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: July 15, 2016
Location: Juneau, AK

"I am pleased the appeal on the Medicaid expansion lawsuit has been dismissed. In the first six years, Medicaid expansion will save the state more than $100 million and inject about $1 billion into the economy. Most importantly, it will save lives. To date, more than 19,000 of our friends, family members, coworkers and neighbors are receiving the coverage they need."
