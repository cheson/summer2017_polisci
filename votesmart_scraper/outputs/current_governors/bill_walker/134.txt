Press Release

Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker signed into law today SB 157, which promotes greater economic development and job growth in Alaska. Sponsored by Senator Lesil McGuire of Anchorage, the bill clarifies that restaurants and other venues featuring arcade-style amusement games may lawfully operate in Alaska. Governor Walker signed the legislation during a bill-signing ceremony at his office in Juneau.
"Creating more jobs for Alaskans and spurring economic growth are two of the highest priorities of this administration," said Governor Walker. "I applaud Senator McGuire for bringing this legislation forward, and working with local developers to bring more business opportunities to our state."
By clarifying what is permitted under the state's gambling laws, SB 157 eliminates risk for companies that want to open stores and restaurants in Alaska without legalizing traditional gambling operations. In recent years, businesses like Dave & Buster's have expressed interest in expanding to the Alaska market. This bill will provide a clear path for those developers going forward, and benefit the state and local economy.
According to Dave & Buster's developers, the restaurant could create as many as 200 construction jobs and 160 full-time jobs for Alaskans.
"Large or small, any effort to diversify our economy and put more Alaskans to work is a step in the right direction," Governor Walker said. "This bill provides greater certainty for entrepreneurs who want to invest money in our state, and tells developers that Alaska is open for business."
