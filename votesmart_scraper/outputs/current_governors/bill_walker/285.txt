Gov. Reiterates Call To Pass Medicaid Bill
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: April 24, 2015
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker today again called for legislators to pass Medicaid reform and expansion while they are in Juneau for an extended regular session. The Legislature is now in its fifth day beyond the statutory 90-day session.
"There is plenty of time to review and pass Medicaid reform and expansion legislation," Governor Walker said. "I appreciate that Medicaid expansion and reform have been the subject of 26 separate hearings this session. Now, it's time to act."
The governor's bills, HB 148 and SB 78, moved from their respective health and social services committees, and await action in the finance committees.
The Walker administration also released a set of fact sheets by topic to respond to some of the misinformation being circulated.
"As legislators grapple with reduced revenue, Medicaid reform and expansion are opportunities to bring more services to Alaskans, save the state money, and help stabilize the economy," Pat Pitney, Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
The governor's legislation would bring back a projected $146 million of Alaskans' federal tax dollars in fiscal year 2016. Every day the state fails to act, the state loses out on $400,000 in federal money. Additionally, it would reduce state spending by $6.6 million in the first year and by more than $100 million over the next six years.
"By rejecting Medicaid expansion, the legislature is choosing to spend over $6 million of state money to deny people health care," Governor Walker said. "It just doesn't make sense."
Health and Social Services Commissioner Valerie Davidson said: "We can save lives, improve the state budget, improve the economy and further reform Medicaid. Our team is ready and waiting to bring the benefits of Medicaid reform and expansion to Alaskans."
