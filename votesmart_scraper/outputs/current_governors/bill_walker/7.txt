Governor Bill Walker today welcomed U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to Alaska. Secretary Zinke is traveling the state this weekend with members of Alaska's Congressional delegation to get a first-hand look at the Last Frontier, and will meet with Governor Walker to discuss natural resource issues critical to Alaska's economy.
"I look forward to discussing with Secretary Zinke the role Alaska is poised to play in securing the nation's energy dominance," Governor Walker said. "I had three meetings with the Secretary in Washington, D.C., and look forward to continuing our productive conversations while hosting him in our beautiful state. Secretary Zinke will see, first-hand, that Alaskans are committed to responsible resource development."
