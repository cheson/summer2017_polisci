Governor Bill Walker today ordered all Alaska state flags to be lowered in honor of the service members who were killed last week in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This action follows a proclamation by President Obama to lower all United States flags in honor of the victims of this tragic shooting.
"Last week's events in Chattanooga were unspeakably tragic," said Governor Walker. "It is with no small amount of grief that I offer my condolences, thoughts, and prayers to the families, friends, and colleagues of the five brave servicemen who lost their lives to this senseless act of violence."
