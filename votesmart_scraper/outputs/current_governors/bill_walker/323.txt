As Honorary Chair, Mrs. Walker will help bring light to the importance of keeping children in safe, stable and nurturing environments.
"We are thrilled to have Mrs. Walker serve as Honorary Chair for the Alaska Children's Trust," said Trevor Storrs, Executive Director of Alaska Children's Trust.

"It is an honor to be working with the Alaska Children's Trust in this capacity," said First Lady Donna Walker.
