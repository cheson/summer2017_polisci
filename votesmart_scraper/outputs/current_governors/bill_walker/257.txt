Public Statements
Shutdown Effects on Governor's Administration
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: June 1, 2015
Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker and Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott today explained to Alaskans the effects of a partial government shutdown on services offered by the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor.
"While I am hopeful the legislature will reach an agreement to fully fund the budget, I am obligated to tell the public about how a potential government shutdown could affect services Alaskans have come to rely upon," Governor Walker said.
In the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor, constituents' requests would go unanswered, the Human Rights Commission would halt investigations into human rights complaints and candidates would not be able to complete their filings with the Division of Elections. The review of petitions filed during the period of any shutdown and the authentication and certification of business and personal documents would stop.
For example, authentication of signatures for Alaska companies doing business in foreign countries, certification of paperwork for Alaskans hoping to adopt children from other countries, and even the returning of bodies of foreign nationals who die in Alaska require authentication paperwork.
While the lieutenant governor would continue to sign regulations, the processing of public notices would be curtailed.
"This legislative impasse creates uncertainty for all Alaskans," Lt. Governor Mallott said. "I urge legislators to avail themselves of the services provided by Matt Peterson, the mediator Governor Walker has retained."
