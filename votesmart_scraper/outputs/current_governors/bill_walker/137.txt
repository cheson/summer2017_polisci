Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: May 8, 2016
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker signed HB 128 into law today, establishing August 10 of each year as Alaska Wild Salmon Day. Governor Walker signed the bill at the 2016 Juneau Maritime Festival, an annual event that celebrates Juneau's rich fishing industry with live music, food, and fun fish-themed activities for all ages.
"Nearly all Alaskans are impacted by salmon in some way -- whether through subsistence, recreational, or commercial fishing, or just sheer appreciation for Alaska's abundant wildlife," said Governor Walker. "HB 128 is intended to celebrate these uniquely Alaskan ways of life, and share our appreciation for wild Alaskan salmon with the rest of the world."
Sponsored by Representative Bryce Edgmon of Dillingham, HB 128 designates August 10 of each year as Alaska Wild Salmon Day to celebrate the enormous bounty of wild chinook, sockeye, coho, chum, and pink salmon Alaskans harvest each year. Drafters of the bill encourage Alaskans of all ages to observe the day through educational and celebratory events, projects, and activities.
"Alaska's Constitution calls for the sustainable yield of our state's natural resources, including our fish," said Governor Walker. "Alaska Wild Salmon Day will provide another opportunity to highlight the gold standard our constitution has set for sustainably managed fisheries and the world-class seafood Alaska has to offer."
