Governor Bill Walker informed President Barack Obama and his administration of Alaska's energy-rich potential in a series of briefings at the White House on Fri., Dec. 5.
Governor Walker and six other newly elected governors from Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas met in the White House with President Obama and his Cabinet members.
Governor Walker and the governors-elect had lunch with Vice President Joe Biden, followed by briefings and discussions with Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Secretary of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy.
The governors ended the day in the Oval Office with an hour-long discussion with President Obama, who expressed interest in infrastructure projects.
"It was a very substantive series of meetings," Governor Walker said. "I had the opportunity to discuss with President Obama and his Cabinet the importance and benefits of an all-Alaska gas line. President Obama seemed very receptive to the idea, and was surprised to hear that Alaska has the highest cost of energy in the nation. It is actually counterintuitive; we have so much energy and we don't use it."
Governor Walker said he is pleased to have been able to open a dialogue with the Obama administration about its desire for more infrastructure in the United States and Alaska's ability to fulfill energy needs.
"We will be able to meet that with an all-Alaska gas line," Governor Walker said. "Today's meetings opened the door for potential opportunities to expedite the process for achieving an all-Alaska gas line."
