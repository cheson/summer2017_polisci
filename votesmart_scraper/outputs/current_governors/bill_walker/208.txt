I was not quite a teenager when I had my first interaction with the federal government.
In 1963, I was awarded the janitorial contract for the Valdez post office. Every day for an hour before school, I cleaned the building. I was excited because it meant income for my family as we struggled to put food on the table.
Then a postal inspector learned the janitor was a 12-year-old boy. He said he would revoke my contract. I pointed out the bid documents never asked for my age.
I needed the work because my family needed the money, so I transferred the contract to my father's name and continued to clean.
As I stood Monday morning on the tarmac of Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., looking at Air Force One, I thought about the new responsibility I now have to a much larger family -- more than 730,000 Alaskans.
I knew I would need adequate time to tell the president Alaska's story about the great opportunities our state offers. However, our state has serious challenges. Our fiscal deficit deepens as the price of oil continues to drop. We have a pipeline that's three-quarters empty. Rural residents pay more for energy than anyone in the entire country.
The federal government owns 62 percent of land in the state. Alaskans need access to Southeast timber harvests and other resources under and on that land -- resources that lawfully belong to us -- so that we are economically self-reliant and not dependent on the federal government.
