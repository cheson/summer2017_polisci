Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker signed SB 165 today, which makes several statutory updates to improve public health and safety in Alaska. Sponsored by Senator Peter Micciche of Soldotna, the bill addresses multiple health and safety issues currently facing Alaska, including consumption of alcohol by minors, changes to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, and background checks for potential marijuana businesses.
Governor Walker signed the bill at the Rasmuson Foundation headquarters in Anchorage alongside stakeholders from the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority, Recover Alaska, Anchorage Youth Court, and others.
"This bill provides much needed changes to state statutes in order to improve the health and safety of Alaskans," said Governor Walker. "I thank Senator Peter Micciche for bringing SB 165 forward, and for working with stakeholders to include their valuable input in this legislation."
With broad public support, SB 165 includes changes to Title 4, Alaska's statutes regulating alcoholic beverages. The changes were recommended by state and local stakeholders in an effort to update the state's alcohol regulations and better address alcohol consumption by minors in Alaska.
Specifically, SB 165 makes the following updates to Alaska statute:
Restores minor in possession of alcohol as a violation punishable by a fine of $500 or $50 if the minor attends an alcohol education course and provides proof within 6 months of sentencing.
