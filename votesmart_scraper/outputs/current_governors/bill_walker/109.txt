Governor Walker's Statement on U.S. Department of the Interior's Final Regulations for Arctic Drilling
Statement
By: Bill Walker

"We will look very carefully at the regulatory package to understand the implications for companies interested in exploring in the Arctic. One risk profile does not fit all projects. Flexibility is necessary to accommodate different types of programs. After the time the Interior Department has spent on this regulatory package, I hope the administration moves to expedite Chukchi and Beaufort lease sales."
