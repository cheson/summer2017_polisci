Governor Bill Walker is pleased to share information about a federal program supporting energy efficiency in rural Alaska communities.
"Many rural Alaska communities struggle with crushing energy costs," Gov. Walker said. "Reducing consumption is often one of the easiest and most effective ways of lowering these costs."
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in December announced the Remote Alaska Communities Energy Efficiency (RACEE) competition. This initiative will make available up to $4 million to support rural energy efficiency projects through outreach, technical assistance, and project development.
To be eligible for consideration, communities must pledge to improve energy efficiency 15 percent by 2020, using 2010 as a baseline. The pledge must be signed by February 2.
This is a good-faith, nonbinding pledge, and communities are not required to have a detailed plan.
Communities that sign the pledge will receive guidance on how to reach their energy savings goal.
Communities making the pledge will also be eligible to compete for technical assistance from DOE. Up to 20 communities will receive this assistance. Those communities will be eligible to compete for up to $3.3 million to implement their energy efficiency projects.
Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott said, "Affordable energy in rural Alaska is key to the long-term health of our villages. Pulling together we can bring down the costs of energy in our communities.
