Alaska's rates of heroin and opioid abuse have dramatically increased in recent years. From 2009 to 2015, the number of heroin-related deaths in the state quadrupled. Additionally, deaths related to the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have now been documented in Alaska.
Governor Bill Walker has declared a public health crisis in order to combat the state's opioid epidemic. The disaster declaration establishes a statewide Overdose Response Program under Alaska's Chief Medical Officer and enables wide distribution of the life-saving drug, naloxone.
Along the disaster declaration, Governor Walker also signed Administrative Order 283, outlining next steps to address the growing heroin and opioid epidemic in Alaska. The administrative order directs all state departments to apply for federal grants to help fund prevention and treatment options; the elimination of illegally imported drugs; assistance with prescription drug monitoring; and development of resources to provide medical treatment in Alaska.
