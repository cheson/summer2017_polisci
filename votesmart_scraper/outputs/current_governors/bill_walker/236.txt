Gov. Walker Changes Census District Name
Press Release

Governor Bill Walker announced today the State of Alaska will rename a census district to Kusilvak Census Area.
Governor Walker sent a letter yesterday to the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau, John H. Thompson, informing him of the state's intention to officially change the name of the area in Western Alaska currently known as the Wade Hampton Census District. The census district stretches along the coast of the Bering Sea and up the Lower Yukon River, surrounding and encompassing the Village of Hooper Bay and 19 other village communities.
"This area is a strong cultural region whose First People primarily speak Yup'ik," Governor Walker said. "The original naming of this census district was completed over a century ago without the knowledge and consent of the area's residents. The current name has no connection to the culture or the history of our land or people. I will instead recognize this district as the "Kusilvak Census Area' to honor the wishes of its residents. Alaska's place names should reflect and respect the diversity of our great state."
Kusilvak is the name of a mountain range in Western Alaska, and is often referred to as the "Denali' of the Lower Yukon Delta and coastal area. The governing bodies of the Village of Hooper Bay, several state legislators from the region, and U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski all expressed support for the name change.
