It is a non partisan belief that our healthcare system demands reform. The key to this reform is empowering patients and healthcare providers; not the government. In Alaska, the first step in initiating this reform must be increasing the number of healthcare providers throughout the state. The shortage of doctors in Alaska is increasing faster than the national average and we have an obligation to end this disparity. We need to continue efforts by the state to attract healthcare workers, especially primary care doctors, to provide quality care in Alaska. This complex issue requires action that addresses immediate healthcare concerns while creating sustainable solutions for the future.

While Alaska is fortunate to have many fine health care institutions within our state, it is the shortage of health care providers that is of greatest concern. There has been some movement within our state to create incentives for health care providers to come to Alaska. The University of Alaska is also to be commended for offering opportunities to Alaskans interested in pursuing medical and other health care degrees. These efforts must continue and expand to ensure that Alaskans have access to the very best health care possible.
