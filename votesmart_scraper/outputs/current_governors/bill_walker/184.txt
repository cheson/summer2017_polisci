Governor Bill Walker today ordered all Alaska state flags to be lowered in honor of the people of France and the victims of Friday's terror attacks in Paris. This action follows a proclamation by President Barack Obama to lower all United States flags in honor of those who were killed in this tragic event.
"Friday's attacks in Paris broke the hearts of Alaska and our nation," said Governor Walker. "I call on Alaskans to join Donna and me in holding the people of France in our thoughts and prayers."
