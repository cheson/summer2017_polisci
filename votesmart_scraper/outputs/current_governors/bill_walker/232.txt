Governor Bill Walker today joined Alaskans in mourning the loss of Mike Burns, former Executive Director of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation. Burns retired from the position last month, after serving as the Corporation's head for over 10 years.
"It is with a heavy heart that I deliver my most sincere condolences to the family of Mike Burns," said Governor Walker. "Mike led the Corporation to achieve unprecedented growth during a time of great economic difficultly. I can say without a doubt that every Alaskan owes him a debt of gratitude, and that his leadership will be missed by many. Donna and I are praying for the entire Burns family, and anyone who had the great pleasure of calling Mike a friend."
In addition to his work in the financial industry, Burns was also active in numerous community, state, and civic organizations. He served three terms as chair of the University of Alaska Board of Regents, and as a member of the University of Alaska Foundation Board of Trustees. An Alaska flag will be flown over the Capitol building in Burns' honor, and presented to his family.
