Issue Position: Alaska's Sovereignty
Issue Position

I will work to restore Alaska's sovereignty. I will direct the Dept. of Law to review the lawsuit previously filed by former Gov. Walter J. Hickel challenging the federal encroachment upon Alaska's sovereignty as a State: AS 38.05.500-505.
I will ensure that Alaska is at the forefront of any challenge to the federal government's encroachment upon our State's rights. While I do not support the federalized health care plan as recently passed by Congress, I believe that Alaska should take steps to improve the health care options to our residents.
