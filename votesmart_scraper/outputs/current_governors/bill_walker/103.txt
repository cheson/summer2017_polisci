Press Release

Date: July 15, 2016
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker ordered all Alaska flags to be immediately lowered in honor of the victims of the attack in Nice, France. This order follows a directive from the White House to lower all United States flags to honor the victims of the Thursday attack.
"During what was supposed to be a time of celebration and festivities, France was attacked--for the third time in less than two years," Governor Walker said. "More than 80 people have been killed and 200 more injured, leaving their family members grappling with grief and questions. Donna and I ask Alaskans to join those around the world in prayer to end these violent attacks and to provide some measure of comfort to those in mourning."
Per President Obama's proclamation and Governor Walker's order, all United States and Alaska flags should be lowered to half-staff until sunset on Tuesday, July 19.
