Public Statements
Disaster Declared For Dalton Highway Flooding
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: April 8, 2015
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker declared a state disaster in response to flooding that has made the Dalton Highway impassable. The state will fund eligible emergency response cost, and eligible repair work, for the water overrun along the Dalton Highway.
Beginning March 13, the Sagavanirktok (Sag) River overflowed the Dalton Highway between Mile 390 and Mile 405 in multiple locations, with the overflow level as much as 30 inches higher than the road in some areas. The magnitude of the event continues to expand.
The Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (DOT&PF) has made emergency repairs, conducted emergency protective measures and created emergency drainage. Severe weather conditions have affected response efforts.
"DOT&PF did a great job handling the initial response to the flooding and minimized the impact on the roadway," Governor Walker said. "This declaration will enable the DOT&PF to call upon the additional resources that are necessary. The gravity of this situation requires the state to move quickly and restore this essential economic corridor."
The disaster declaration activates the state's public assistance program, which helps state, tribal and local governments, as well as certain private nonprofits with infrastructure damages from the disaster event.
Governor Walker verbally issued the state disaster declaration yesterday, April 7, shortly after DOT&PF's request.
