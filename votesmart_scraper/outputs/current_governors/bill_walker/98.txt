Governor Walker's Statement on BLM's National Petroleum Reserve Announcement
Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: July 25, 2016
Location: Juneau, AK

"I am pleased the Bureau of Land Management will begin its environmental review of ConocoPhillips' proposed oil and gas development of Greater Mooses Tooth-2 project. At ConocoPhillips' request, I sent a letter of support to President Obama on this project. We received a call from the White House earlier today to let us know of this announcement and to discuss the regulatory timeline for this project. With the Trans-Alaska Pipeline three-quarters empty, I am committed to working with our federal partners to spur production. I thank BLM Director Neil Kornze and his staff for meeting with me and my team today on a collaborative path forward."
