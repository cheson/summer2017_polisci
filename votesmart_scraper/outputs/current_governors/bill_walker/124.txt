Governor Bill Walker ordered all Alaska flags to be lowered today in honor of the victims of this morning's mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. This order follows directive from the White House to lower all United States flags to honor the victims of today's attacks, which is reported to be the nation's worst since September 11, 2001.
"Many of us are still in shock after this morning's attack in Orlando," said Governor Walker. "This terrible act of violence has claimed more than 50 lives, and the effects reach beyond Florida. We here in Alaska stand with our fellow Americans against this act of terrorism."
Per President Obama's proclamation and Governor Walker's order, all United States and Alaska flags should be lowered to half-staff until sunset on Thursday, June 16.
