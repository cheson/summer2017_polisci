Governor Bill Walker ordered all Alaska flags to be lowered on Monday, May 30 in honor of Memorial Day. This action coincides with a proclamation by President Barack Obama to lower all United States flags in honor of Memorial Day.
"As Alaskans enjoy another beautiful holiday weekend with friends and family, let us not forget the brave men and women who have lost their lives to keep our nation safe and secure," said Governor Walker. "Each year, Americans pay tribute on Memorial Day by remembering service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedom. Donna and I wish all Alaskans a safe and happy Memorial Day weekend, and thank the brave men and women who have served or are currently serving in our military. Let us pause on Monday to remember why Memorial Day was established."
Governor Walker signed an executive proclamation recognizing Monday, May 30, 2016 as Memorial Day in Alaska, and encouraged all Alaskans to take part in local remembrance events to honor fallen soldiers.
Memorial Day was first observed in the United States in 1868 to commemorate fallen soldiers of the Civil War. Since 1971, the last Monday in May has been officially designated as Memorial Day to honor those who have lost their lives in American wars.
Per the President's proclamation and Governor Walker's order, all flags should be flown at half-staff from sunrise until noon on Monday, May 30 in honor of Memorial Day. Additionally, the White House proclamation encourages all Americans to observe a National Moment of Remembrance at 3:00 pm local time on Memorial Day.
