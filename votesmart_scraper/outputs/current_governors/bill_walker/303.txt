Public Statements
Flags Lowered For Earthquake Remembrance Day
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: March 26, 2015
Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker this week proclaimed Friday, March 27th, 2015 as "1964 Alaskan Earthquake Remembrance Day," and ordered all state flags to be lowered to half-staff to honor those lives lost on that tragic day.
At a magnitude of 9.2, the Good Friday Earthquake is the second largest earthquake in recorded history. Its force was felt throughout Alaska and triggered massive tsunamis that reached California and Oregon. The large waves wiped out the village of Chenega and destroyed Alaska communities. More than 130 people were killed that day.
"March 27th, 1964 is a day I will never forget," Governor Walker said. "I was 12. My family and I lived in Valdez. Our small town lost more than 30 people that day. The earth shook with tremendous force, whipping large trees back and forth, and triggered a giant local tsunami that completely took out the dock. I urge all Alaskans to get their emergency plans and kits prepared, as the next big one is not a matter of "if' but "when.'"
Governor Walker ordered all state flags to be lowered to half-staff on Friday, March 27th in honor of those lives lost during the 1964 earthquake, and returned to full-staff on Saturday, March 28th.
