Governor Bill Walker and Lt. Governor Byron Mallott announced the newly appointed members of the Governor's Tribal Advisory Council today. The 11 member advisory council met with Governor Walker and Lt. Governor Mallott at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium in Anchorage to set goals and priorities for the group going forward.
"Each of these individuals brings a unique skill set and experiences that will benefit the administration as we address issues important to Alaska's tribes," said Governor Walker. "I have tasked this group with providing input on relevant topics and helping our administration to find opportunities for the state and tribes to work collaboratively."
The Governor's Tribal Advisory Council (GTAC) consists of 11 members representing tribes' interests in wildlife and fisheries, transportation, housing, subsistence, public safety, justice, language and culture, economic development, energy and natural resources, healthcare, and education. Members were nominated by their tribes and appointed by Governor Walker.
Governor Walker signed Administrative Order 227 on October 14, 2015, establishing GTAC and beginning the process by which tribal members could be nominated to the council.
"This council provides a forum for open, respectful, and informed dialogue on a full range of issues facing Alaska's tribes, and recommended actions by both the tribes and the state," said Lt. Governor Mallott. "It is critical that the Governor and Lt. Governor have direct communication with tribes to meet the unique needs of Alaska's first people."
