Governor Bill Walker today ordered all Alaska state flags to be lowered in honor of United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away today at the age of 79. This action follows a proclamation by President Barack Obama to lower all United States flags in honor of Justice Scalia.
"Justice Antonin Scalia served his country for decades to uphold the law and our nation's constitution. He was one of only nine members to the United States Supreme Court, and played a critical role in deciding countless court cases that have set the course of history for our country," said Governor Walker. "My heart goes out to the family and loved ones of Justice Scalia in this time of great loss."
Per the President's proclamation and Governor Walker's order, all United States and Alaska flags should be flown at half-staff beginning immediately and remain lowered until sunset on the day of internment.
