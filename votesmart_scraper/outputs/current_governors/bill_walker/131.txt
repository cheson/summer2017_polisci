Press Release

Location: Juneau, AK

In an effort to promote local businesses and job growth, Governor Bill Walker signed a proclamation this month naming May 2016 Buy Alaskan Month. Alaska is home to more than 69,000 small businesses, which make up 96 percent of all employers in the state. Alaska's small businesses employ more than half of the state's private workforce.
"Entrepreneurs and small business owners truly embody the Alaskan spirit of independence and self-reliance," Governor Walker said. "Whether it be creating more jobs or donating money to youth hockey, Alaska-owned businesses are at the heart of our communities and make our state thrive. When we buy in-state, those dollars continue to circulate in our economy. With Alaska's current fiscal challenge, it is absolutely critical to support and encourage local economic development."
National studies have shown that local retailers return an average 52 percent of their revenue to the local economy. Here's how:
* Spending $100 at an independent business generates $68 in local economic activity; spending $100 at a national chain store generates $48 in local economic activity.
* Each dollar spent at independent businesses returns almost 50 times more than buying from an online mega-retailer.
