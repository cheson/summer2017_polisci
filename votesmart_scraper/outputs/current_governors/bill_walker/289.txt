Governor Bill Walker today applauded the House and Senate for passing his Gas Pipeline Right-of-Way bill with unanimous support. Once signed into law, SB70 will authorize the issuance of a right-of-way lease for a natural gas pipeline through a corridor in the Denali State Park, Willow Creek, Nancy Lake, and Captain Cook State Recreation Areas.
"I want to thank the legislature today for passing this important piece of legislation," said Governor Walker. "This right-of-way is a necessary component to building a future natural gas pipeline in Alaska. By setting the wheels in motion now, we will be better prepared down the road."
SB70 allows of the leasing of a corridor that will be adequate for either the AKLNG or ASAP project. The right-of-way within the authorized area will be approximately 120 feet wide for construction and 53 feet wide for operation under the ASAP project, and approximately 180 feet wide for construction and 100 feet wide for operation under the AKLNG project. Additionally, the bill requires the corridor to be managed as parkland and recreation areas until a lease is issued, and returned to original park and recreation land upon termination of the lease.
Right-of-way leases under SB 70 must be issued by January 1, 2025 and, construction of the pipeline must begin within 10 years of the effective lease date.
