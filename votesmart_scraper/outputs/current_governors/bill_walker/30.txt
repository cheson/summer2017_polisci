Statement

Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker issued the following statement today on the Hilcorp oil leak in Cook Inlet:
"It has been less than a week since Hilcorp agreed to temporarily shut down oil and gas production as part of its response to a leaking gas supply line. Now, Hilcorp has reported a separate leaking oil line --which is significantly more harmful than natural gas. I am deeply concerned about the potential impact to the environment. This oil line has been shut in. Our Spill Prevention and Response Team has immediately responded, and is keeping me apprised of developments." -- Governor Bill Walker
