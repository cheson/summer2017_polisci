Public Statements
Changes Announced for Gasline Corporation
Press Release

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker on Tuesday announced a paradigm shift in the way the state will conduct business with Alaska's gas, emphasizing that there will be transparency in the process.
Governor Walker removed three board members from the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation--Drue Pearce, Richard Rabinow, and Al Bolea.
"I would like to thank each of these individuals for their service to the State of Alaska, and wish them well in their future endeavors," Governor Walker said.
This announcement comes two days before a scheduled AGDC Board of Directors meeting in Anchorage. At this meeting, members will be expected to sign confidentiality agreements prior to an executive session that is closed to the public.
"I am committed to a transparent government in which Alaskans are part of the conversation about our resources," Governor Walker said. "I cannot allow my Cabinet members to sign confidentiality agreements meant to keep information away from the public."
Governor Walker has instructed Department of Labor Commissioner Heidi Drygas and Department of Commerce Acting Commissioner Fred Parady, who are currently on the board, to not sign the agreement.
The AGDC Board of Directors is made up of seven members who serve at the pleasure of the governor. Those who will continue serving on the AGDC Board of Directors include Chairman John Burns and Dave Cruz.
"My goal is to accelerate our efforts to bring Alaska's gas to market, and to do so in a way that ensures Alaskans are involved and informed of the process," Governor Walker said.
Governor Walker has already initiated the process to interview and appoint three qualified Alaskans to AGDC's Board. He intends to fill those vacant seats within 30 days.
