Governor Walker Vetoes HB 132
Press Release
By: Bill Walker

Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker today vetoed HB 132, making good on a March 2 promise when the bill was introduced.
"This veto in no way means the end of discussions with legislative leadership," Governor Walker said. "We continue to have multiple meetings to ensure AKLNG is successful and remains the priority while maintaining access to a backup option."
HB 132 limits the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) from actively working on any gas line project other than the Alaska Liquefied Natural Gas (AKLNG) line. The State of Alaska is a partner in AKLNG along with TransCanada, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and BP.
"We cannot have legislation that ties Alaska's hands while we are trying to negotiate the best possible gas line deal for Alaskans," Governor Walker said. "This bill prevents the state from having an adequate backup plan should the AKLNG efforts not proceed."
Governor Walker also continues to meet with AKLNG partners to advance this project. Governor Walker has said multiple times AKLNG remains his administration's priority and having a backup option with the ASAP line will not interfere with the AKLNG project.
