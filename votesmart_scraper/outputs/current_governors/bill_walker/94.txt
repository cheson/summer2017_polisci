Governor Announces Plans to Address Implementation of Lands Into Trust
Press Release

Location: Juneau, AK

Given Attorney General Jahna Lindemuth's announcement this morning regarding not pursuing the Akiachak litigation any further, Governor Bill Walker has tasked his administration with holding meetings with those who may be impacted by the federal government taking lands into trust.
"I have tasked the Attorney General with reaching out to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, tribes, other Native interests and organizations, commercial interests doing business in Alaska, local governments and other interested stakeholders," said Governor Walker.
The purpose of the stakeholder meetings is to identify concerns and work collaboratively to resolve those concerns. This process will help the State comment on specific lands-into-trust applications and may result in additional federal regulations to better address Alaska's needs.
"I support Attorney General Lindemuth's conclusion that it doesn't make sense to use the state's limited resources pursuing this litigation that has already dragged on for ten years," Governor Walker said. "Instead, we will work collaboratively with all parties to shape solutions that improve public safety, empower local communities, and protect our resources."
"Alaska is a unique state in many ways," said Lt. Governor Byron Mallott. "We have an opportunity to establish a new set of rules that works for our particular circumstances."
