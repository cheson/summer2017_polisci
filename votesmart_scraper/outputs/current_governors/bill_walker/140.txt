Governor Walker Signs Bill Approving Royalty Oil Sale to Tesoro
Statement

Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker signed into law House Bill 373, a multi-million dollar revenue bill that passed the legislature unanimously. It formalizes the state's contract with Tesoro, a refining company.
The five-year contract allows for Tesoro to purchase from the state up to 25,000 barrels of oil per day. It will circulate $127 million in the economy as Tesoro produces up to 59,000 barrels per day at its Nikiski refinery, which employs more than 200 Alaskans.
"As we grapple with low oil prices and declining production, I'm pleased we pulled together to pass this common-sense legislation," Governor Walker said. "This monetizes our natural resources and provides an economic boost to the Southcentral region. I thank Senator Peter Micciche and Representative Dan Saddler for carrying this bill."
Department of Natural Resource officials estimate the state will receive over five years $45 million to $56 million more in revenue with this royalty volumes in-kind (RIK) contract than through a royalty volumes in-value (RIV) contract.
In RIV contracts, companies sell natural resources on the state's behalf and pay the state the value of its share. In RIK contracts, the state takes ownership of the oil and sells the natural resources itself.
