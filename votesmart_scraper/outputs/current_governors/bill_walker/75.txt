Walker-Mallott Administration Releases Fiscal Year 2018 Budget
Statement

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker's fiscal year 2018 (July 1, 2017 -- June 30, 2018) budget reduces state spending while supporting vital services and protecting the permanent fund dividend. The proposed $4.2 billion unrestricted general fund (UGF) operating budget is 23 percent lower than when Governor Walker took office two years ago. To lead by example, Governor Walker will take a one-third pay cut.
"We have reduced state spending by more than $1.7 billion, and will continue to seek efficiencies and contain costs," Governor Walker said. "We have closed dozens of state facilities across Alaska, impacting services Alaskans have grown accustomed to receiving. But Alaskans are increasingly looking for budget stability to protect Alaska's economy. We can't cut our way to prosperity. Since 2013, we have cut state spending by 44 percent. To fund services Alaskans rely on, it's critical to discuss new revenue. We look forward to working with the legislature to pass a sustainable fiscal plan during the upcoming session."
The Walker-Mallott administration's three-part fiscal plan for this year's budget is to 1) continue cutting the size of government; 2) re-plumb the state's wealth through sustainable use of the Permanent Fund Earnings Reserve to ensure the dividend program continues while providing funding for essential state services; and 3) generate new revenue through broad-based taxes.
