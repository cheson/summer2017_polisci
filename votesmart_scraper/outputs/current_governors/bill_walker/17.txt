Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker released the following statement today on the Senate's failure to hold a vote on his Cabinet appointees and nominees for state boards and commissions:
"I thank members of the House for their leadership to invite the Senate to their chambers, on two separate sessions, to hold a confirmation hearing on more than 100 Alaskans who have stepped forward to serve their state. I am disappointed that the Senate Majority has, once again, refused the House's invitation to participate in this process. I will continue to focus on resolving Alaska's fiscal crisis this session." --Governor Bill Walker
