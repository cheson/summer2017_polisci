Alaska faces obstacles to student achievement unlike those that exist in any other state in the nation. Alaska's Education Challenge is to address our student achievement gaps and increase our graduation rates by making sure that every student across our state has equal opportunities to learn and succeed.
Together, we will meet Alaska's education challenge by honoring our heritage, innovating for the future, and prioritizing for today's fiscal challenges.
Through a process of gathering public input, the State Board of Education has already identified five priorities for Alaska's public education system: Improve Student Learning, Ensure Excellent Educators, Modernize the Education System, Inspire Tribal and Community Ownership, and Promote Safety and Well-being.
