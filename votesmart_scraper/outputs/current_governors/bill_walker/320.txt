Governor Releases Amended Endorsed Budget
Press Release

Governor Bill Walker today released his budget for fiscal year 2016 (July 1, 2015 -- June 30, 2016), which he emphasized is a starting point for discussions.
"There are cuts in here, and some will be painful," Governor Walker said. "Our state right now has a $3.6 billion budget deficit, leading us to draw about $10 million every single day from savings. I want to be up-front with Alaskans throughout this process."
The fiscal year 2016 budget has more changes than the placeholder budget the Walker administration submitted in December. With the decline in state revenues, the Walker administration cut an additional $132 million from agencies' unrestricted general fund operating budgets from the December budget, while preserving Governor Walker's vision to maintain essential services and protect reserves.
"We will prioritize the delivery of services and look for ways to provide services at lower costs," said Pat Pitney, Director of Office of Management and Budget. "We will combine services where possible to gain efficiencies."
The administration focused on reducing overhead and administrative costs before reducing services, and worked hard to make sure cuts do not disproportionately impact small, outlying offices where services may be most needed.
The proposed fiscal year 2016 budget reflects a $240 million reduction in agency unrestricted general fund spending from fiscal year 2015 and eliminates more than 300 positions.
"We'll work to minimize state employee layoffs by eliminating vacant positions and reducing others through retirements, resignations and transfers," Governor Walker said. "However, we are also leading by example. I cut 11 percent of my executive office through leaner staffing and operations."
