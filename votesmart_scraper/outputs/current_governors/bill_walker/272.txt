Press Release

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker signed an Arctic policy bill into law today, taking a major step forward in defining Alaska's involvement in Arctic development. Sponsored by Representative Bob Herron of Bethel, HB 1 outlines the state's priorities for Arctic policy and spells out ways in which the state will attain those priorities.
"As the United States assumes chairmanship of the Arctic Council, it's important that Alaska establishes itself as a leader in Arctic issues," Governor Walker said. "This legislation is significant because it is the first of its kind to define Alaska's role in the rapidly-changing Arctic."
HB 1 outlines Alaska's Arctic policy priorities as promoting economic and resource development, addressing the infrastructure and response capacity gap in the Arctic region, supporting healthy communities, and strengthening a state-based agenda for science and research in the Arctic.
"Our country is an Arctic nation because of Alaska," Governor Walker said. "That is why it is absolutely critical that we have a seat at the table for Arctic development discussions. I commend Representative Herron and the co-sponsors of this bill for taking on such an important issue."
Monday's bill signing took place at the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation office in Anchorage.
"I also thank members of the Alaska Arctic Policy Commission for their two years of work in setting the stage for this bill," Governor Walker said. "Their implementation plan paved the way for this important legislation."
