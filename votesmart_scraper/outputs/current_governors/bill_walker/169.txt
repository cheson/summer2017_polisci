Governor Bill Walker thanked the Alaska Criminal Justice Commission for releasing its extensive report on justice reinvestment strategies for the state today. In the report, Commission members provide data-driven recommendations for the upcoming legislative session to protect public safety, control corrections spending, and invest the potentially vast savings from averted prison growth into probation, parole, and other community practices that cut crime and reduce recidivism..
"I thank members of the Alaska Criminal Justice Commission and the Pew Charitable Trust for taking the time to put forward this valuable information," said Governor Walker. "I look forward to reviewing the report and learning more about the research and data that went into these recommendations."
The Commission's report is responsive to a joint request from Governor Walker, former Chief Justice Dana Fabe, Senate President Kevin Meyer, House Speaker Mike Chenault, and Attorney General Craig Richards. Recommendations outlined in the report include:
* Implement evidence-based pretrial practices;
* Focus prison beds on serious and violent offenders;
* Strengthen supervision and interventions to reduce recidivism;
* Advance crime victim notification and support services; and
* Ensure oversight of the sentencing and corrections system.
"I also want to thank Senate President Kevin Meyer and House Speaker Mike Chenault for their leadership on this issue, and to Senator John Coghill and his dedicated staff for bringing this all together," Governor Walker said. "I stand with legislative leaders when I say that criminal justice reform is a priority for the state, and I applaud them for their creation of this important commission."
