Governor Orders Flags Lowered on September 11
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: Sept. 10, 2015
Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker today ordered all Alaska state flags to be lowered tomorrow in honor of Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, which is an annual recognition of the events that took place on September 11, 2001. This action follows a proclamation by President Barack Obama to lower all United States flags in honor of those who were killed on September 11, 2001.
"Fourteen years ago, our world changed forever," said Governor Walker. "The lives of 3,000 men, women and children were taken from their families and communities. I hope Alaskans will join Donna and me in taking a moment of silence tomorrow morning in remembrance of those precious souls, and to renew our commitment to the values for which America stands--freedom, service and courage."
Per the President's proclamation, and Governor Walker's order, all United States and Alaska flags should be flown at half-staff from sunrise until sunset on Friday, September 11, 2015.
