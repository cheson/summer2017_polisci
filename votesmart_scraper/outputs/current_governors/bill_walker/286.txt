Governor Bill Walker announced today the appointment of Amanda Price as a special advisor for crime policy and prevention.
"Alaska leads the nation in domestic violence and sexual assault rates, and that must change," Governor Walker said.. "Amanda is the perfect person to join our team to spearhead efforts to curb this epidemic plaguing our state. She will serve as a bridge, coordinator and liaison to holistically examine the problems of violent crime overall."
Governor Walker said appointing Price is an important step toward establishing Alaska as a state with progressive laws and techniques to hold offenders accountable and provide the highest level of victim services and support.
Price will work closely with victim service agencies and programs, as well as law enforcement, health care and legal service organizations throughout Alaska to assess challenges and make recommendations for potential statutory and regulatory changes.
Price worked as the executive director of Standing Together Against Rape and has served on a number of boards that address domestic violence, homelessness, housing development and other concerns in the Anchorage area and statewide.
