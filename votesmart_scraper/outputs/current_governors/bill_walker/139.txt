Governor Bill Walker today ordered all Alaska flags to be lowered in honor of Retired Superior Court Judge Ben Esch, who passed away on Monday after a courageous battle with leukemia. Upon moving to Alaska shortly after law school, Judge Esch had a long and fruitful career in the 49th state, and made significant contributions to the community of Nome.
"It is with sadness and gratitude that I express my condolences to the family and friends of Judge Ben Esch," said Governor Walker. "Judge Esch was a profound leader in the Nome community who brought wisdom and compassion to the superior court bench. His service to the state will never be forgotten, and his presence in the community of Nome will be greatly missed."
Judge Ben Esch was appointed to the Nome superior court in 1996, and served the community in that capacity for 17 years. Upon his retirement in 2013, Judge Esch was the longest-serving superior court judge in Nome since the court was established in 1900. During his career, he served as the Presiding Judge for the Second Judicial District for a number of years and served on the Alaska Judicial Conduct Commission. In addition to his work on the bench, Judge Esch was actively engaged in community organizations, including the Nome Youth Court and the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. He was also a long-time member and past president of the Pioneers of Alaska, Men's Igloo #1.
State flags are to be lowered to half-staff on Thursday, April 28 in honor of Judge Ben Esch. Flags should return to full-staff on Friday, April 29.
