Governor Bill Walker issued the following statement today in response to reports that Russian military aircraft were recently intercepted in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone:
"Yesterday, U.S. Air Force F-22s intercepted four Russian military aircraft--two fighter jets and two bombers--that entered the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone. They also monitored an airborne radar platform that entered the Alaskan ADIZ as well. The Russian aircraft were intercepted and visually identified near the west coast of Alaska. This is the fifth time in less than two weeks that Russian aircraft have encroached Alaskan skies. This is deeply unsettling, and underscores the immediate need for a more robust military presence in Alaska." --Governor Bill Walker
