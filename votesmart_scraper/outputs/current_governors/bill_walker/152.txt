Governor Bill Walker and liquefied natural gas (LNG) project partners ExxonMobil, BP and ConocoPhillips today announced their commitment to work together to explore options to advance the Alaska gasline project amidst current challenging fiscal times. The state and the producers are actively engaged in defining the best way to maintain AK LNG project momentum in a difficult business environment. More definitive details are expected to be available in early March.
"I am pleased to be part of the joint effort being taken by ExxonMobil, BP and ConocoPhillips towards this end," Governor Walker said.
The technical work associated with the Work Plan and Budget is on track to have the pre-FEED (front-end engineering and design) work completed in the fall of 2016.
"BP remains committed to an Alaska LNG project that includes the State of Alaska," said BP Alaska President Janet Weiss. "We will continue to work with all the parties to deliver a project with a competitive cost of supply."
"Given the economic headwinds the oil and gas industry is facing today, it makes sense to explore options for the AK LNG project," said Joe Marushack, President ConocoPhillips Alaska. "We are working collaboratively to develop alternative approaches to commercialize North Slope gas."
"ExxonMobil remains committed to commercializing Alaska's natural gas, and we are committed to working with the project participants to explore options that would continue to progress that goal," said Jim Flood, Vice President of ExxonMobil Development Company.
