Governor Walker Praises ConocoPhillips Announcement
Statement

Location: Anchorage, AK

I applaud ConocoPhillips and Doyon for their work to spur production during fiscally challenging times. This is welcome news, as it fulfills lease terms for Fiord West, which is near Alpine in the Colville River Unit. As our oil pipeline sits three-quarters empty, construction of an extended reach drilling rig will have a much-needed multiplier effect for the state's economy.
