Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker today released a statement praising the Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault's (CDVSA) decision to hire Diane Casto as Executive Director.
"I am pleased with the selection of Diane Casto as Executive Director of Alaska's Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. Diane has extensive experience working on outreach and prevention efforts, and will be an invaluable asset to CDVSA. For too many years, Alaska has been plagued with high rates of domestic violence and sexual assault. Solving these problems will require a multi-pronged approach across many departments addressing victims, perpetrators, families, and bystanders. If we do not successfully deal with prevention, we will ultimately deal with the harmful consequences of domestic violence and sexual assault. I look forward to working with Diane in her new role at CDVSA to strengthen our state's prevention efforts and help build a safer Alaska." --Governor Bill Walker
