Governor Walker has just declared a disaster in support of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough's request for state assistance regarding the erosion and threat of flood along the Matanuska River.
"I want to make sure Matanuska-Susitna Borough residents who are alongside the Matanuska River have the necessary resources to protect their homes and property, therefore I have verbally declared a disaster which means relief operations will begin immediately." said Governor Walker.
The state disaster declaration will support DOT&PF in their effort to protect critical infrastructure and also enables federal resources to assist such as those from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Department of Transportation.
