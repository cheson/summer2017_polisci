Signed Gas Agreements Made Public
Statement

Governor Bill Walker today made available the signed gas availability agreement between the state and two of its gasline project partners, BP and ConocoPhillips.
"I thank BP and ConocoPhillips for making public the signed agreement so Alaskans can fully appreciate the significance of this project milestone," Governor Walker said. "This agreement ensures that there will be gas for a gasline if either partner withdraws from the project."
The gas availability agreement is the result of months of negotiations between the state and its partners, and brings the state closer to delivering North Slope gas to the world market and lowering energy costs for Alaskans.
For the next year, the four project partners will finalize pre-FEED work on the AKLNG project--which includes a natural gas liquefaction plant, storage facilities and an export terminal at Nikiski; an 800-mile gas pipeline from the North Slope to southcentral Alaska; a gas treatment plant; and transmission lines connecting the project to gas-producing fields. The project is expected to export up to 20 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas per year.
"As we work to solve the state's fiscal problems, it is important that we continue to negotiate with partners commercially reasonable and mutually agreed terms to ensure a gasline project," Governor Walker said. "This public agreement is the assurance this project has long needed to ensure a pipeline project."
