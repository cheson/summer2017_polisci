Date: June 1, 2015
Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker today retained Matt Peterson to help resolve the legislative impasse currently holding up passage of a fully-funded budget. Peterson is an Anchorage attorney with an extensive history of conducting mediations.
"Today, because we don't have a fully-funded budget, about 10,000 notices of layoffs were mailed out--as we are morally and contractually obligated to do," Governor Walker said. "I have asked Matt Peterson to be available to step in and mediate this legislative impasse so we don't have a government shutdown. I urge the legislature to take advantage of his expertise so we can move forward."
Mr. Peterson works at Clapp, Peterson, Tiemessen, Thorsness & Johnson, LLC. He has worked for more than 30 years as a mediator and arbitrator in a range of complex cases, including civil litigation, medical and professional malpractice and business disputes. Mr. Peterson is a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and the Alaska member of the National Academy of Distinguished Neutrals. Mr. Peterson has been peer-rated by Martindale-Hubbell as one of Alaska's "Superlawyers."
"I have long respected Matt and his work, and am confident he will get the job done well and quickly," Governor Walker said. "I urge members of the legislature to accept my offer and avail themselves of Matt's services so Alaskans can get past this gridlock and shift our focus to discussing a fiscally sustainable future."
