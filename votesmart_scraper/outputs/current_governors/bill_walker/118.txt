"I am deeply disappointed that, after more than a year of conversations with Alaskans and more than 400 meetings with legislators about our fiscal problems, SB 128, a critical piece of legislation for Alaska's future, never made it to the House floor for a vote. With a $4 billion deficit, it is time we pull together as Alaskans to address this fiscal deficit now. Again, I thank members of the Senate for their leadership on this critical issue and their passage of SB 128." --Governor Bill Walker
