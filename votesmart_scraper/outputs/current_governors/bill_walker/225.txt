Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: July 29, 2015
Location: Anchorage, AK

Today Governor Bill Walker called for nominations for the annual Governor's North Star Awards for International Excellence. Since 1986, these awards have recognized Alaskan companies and organizations engaged in successful international business and activities.
Alaskan businesses, schools, and other organizations active in international arenas may nominate others or themselves in one or more categories: export of goods, export of services, foreign investment, education, the travel industry, transportation, cultural exchange, humanitarian exchange or scientific exchange.
"As Alaskans, we are geographically, economically, and socially connected to the world, and we have homegrown companies and organizations that are constantly working to strengthen those ties," said Governor Walker. "I know first-hand how important our exports and international relationships are to the state of Alaska, so it will be an honor to recognize these outstanding efforts."
Awards are presented in several categories in any given year, but are not necessarily given in all categories each year. Nominations are reviewed by the State of Alaska, The Export Council of Alaska and other related organizations.
Nominations are due on September 5, 2014, and awards will be presented later in the fall.
