Issue Position: Jobs for Alaskans
Issue Position
By: Bill Walker
Date: Jan. 1, 2014
Location: Unknown

The all-Alaska natural gas pipeline to Valdez and the resulting industry and jobs created will provide major employment for Alaskans throughout the state. How do we get the most benefit when the Supreme Court of Alaska has denied local hire preferences in the past?
My Administration will provide for incentives to employers to give a priority for hiring Alaskans. This is a legitimate legal mechanism to give local hire a priority.
Unlike other candidates, I have no intention of giving our jobs away to Canadians.
I believe in Alaskans first, not last.
