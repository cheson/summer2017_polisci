State, Japan Renew LNG Export Agreement
Press Release
By: Bill Walker

Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker announced today the State of Alaska extended its cooperation agreement with Japan-based consortium Resources Energy, Inc. (REI), to develop Cook Inlet natural gas. This agreement extension comes three months after Governor Walker met with more than 25 companies and government agencies, including the prefectures of Kyoto and Hyogo, during an international liquefied natural gas conference in Tokyo, where he told more than a thousand attendees of the Alaskan LNG opportunity.
The agreement with REI, which was extended two more years to December 14, 2017, encourages the development of Cook Inlet natural gas to provide Alaskans low-cost energy while also supplying Japanese consumers.
"The world market will certainly benefit from Alaska's rich natural gas reserves, but my number one priority is ensuring that we work toward affordable energy for Alaskan families and businesses," Governor Walker said. "Extending this agreement with REI shows Japanese consumers that Alaska is committed to exporting liquefied natural gas."
