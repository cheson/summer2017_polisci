Public Statements
Medicaid Reform And Expansion Gains Support
Press Release
By: Bill Walker

Location: Juneau, AK

Governor Bill Walker today thanked the 153 municipalities, organizations and businesses that have expressed their support for Medicaid reform and expansion in Alaska.
"I'm encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive feedback we've received on Medicaid reform and expansion," Governor Walker said. "It's clear that Alaskans think this is the right thing to do for our state. I am also grateful for the dozens of Alaskans who took time on their Saturday to testify in support of this bill."
Governor Walker introduced HB 148 and SB 78 last month to accept federal Medicaid expansion dollars and pursue reforms to ensure the state's Medicaid program is affordable over the long term.
"Groups like the Alaska Chamber, the Mat-Su Borough Assembly, Fairbanks Economic Development Corporation, the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly, and Catholic Social Services have all said Medicaid reform and expansion are good for our state," Governor Walker said. "With more and more letters coming in each day, I'm confident the Legislature will recognize the social and financial benefits of Medicaid reform and expansion in Alaska."
Governor Walker said this broad, statewide approval is proof that this is not a partisan or special-interest issue, but an Alaskan issue. Independent polls by Dave Dittman and Ivan Moore found a majority of Alaskans agree -- 60 and 65 percent of Alaskans, respectively, favor Medicaid expansion in Alaska.
If approved by the Legislature, HB 148/SB 78 would accept federal funds to provide health care to an estimated 42,000 low-income Alaskans, bring $146 million of new federal money into the state, and save the state a projected $46 million over the next six years.
