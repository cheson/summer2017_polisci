Governor Bill Walker announced his new appointments to the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation Board of Directors today. Luke Hopkins of Fairbanks will join the seven-member board, which oversees the agency's efforts to build a natural gas pipeline and liquefaction plant in Alaska. Mr. Hopkins is the former mayor of the Fairbanks North Star Borough. He will fill the seat vacated by former AGDC Board Chairman John Burns.
"I am pleased to welcome Luke Hopkins to the AGDC Board of Directors. As the mayor of the Fairbanks Borough, Luke was instrumental in creating a new municipal gas utility for the Borough, and directing major funds to develop lower cost natural gas supply for Fairbanks residents," said Governor Walker. "I also want to thank John Burns for his service to the AGDC board and the state. John is a talented attorney and I hope to utilize his skills in a different capacity of this project going forward."
"As the state transitions to play a larger role in the Alaska LNG project, it is absolutely critical that we have strong leadership in place to guide our endeavors. I also plan to work on direct communication between the Governor's office and the legislature, and I will continue to look for opportunities to include them in discussions about the project," Governor Walker said. "I look forward to working with the AGDC Board and the legislature in the coming months and years as we work to bring Alaska's natural gas to the world market."
