Public Statements
Disaster Declared For Dalton Highway Flooding
Press Release
By: Bill Walker
Date: May 22, 2015
Location: Prudhoe Bay, AK

Governor Bill Walker yesterday declared a state disaster in response to flooding within the North Slope Borough. This is the second such declaration the governor has issued in response to flooding on the Dalton Highway, but the geographic scope covered by this latest proclamation is wider.
Record-high temperatures accelerated spring snow melt in the Brooks Range. The high runoff overflowed the Sagavanirktok (Sag), Kuparuk and Colville rivers, causing flooding along portions of the Dalton Highway, Deadhorse Airport and nearby facilities.
"I issued my first disaster declaration for a flooding event along the Dalton Highway earlier this year," Governor Walker said. "While the impacted area is similar, the root cause of the flooding is different. This declaration gives DOT&PF and North Slope producers, owners and operators the authority to utilize their full resources to restore and protect this important economic corridor."
The disaster declaration will enable the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (DOT&PF) to request Federal Highway Administration emergency funds and waive some state permitting requirements that could delay emergency protective measures.
DOT&PF and North Slope operators continue flood-fighting efforts, such as road-clearing, overflow diversion work and bolstering emergency protective measures.
DOT&PF requested the state disaster declaration May 21, 2015.
