Location: Juneau, AK

In light of the state's more than $3 billion budget deficit, Governor Bill Walker introduced legislation today to implement a two-year pay freeze for non-unionized state employees. SB 31 halts salary increases from July 1, 2017 until June 30, 2019 for exempt, partially exempt, and nonunion employees in the Executive Branch, Legislative Branch, and University of Alaska.
"Until we enact a sustainable fiscal plan, we must make adjustments," Governor Walker said. "I believe in leading by example and have reduced my own salary by one-third. While it won't close the fiscal gap, this legislation is a necessary part of the solution to Alaska's fiscal crisis."
