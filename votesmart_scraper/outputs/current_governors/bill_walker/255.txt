Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker today ordered all state flags be lowered to half-staff tomorrow, Wednesday, June 3, in honor of Dutch Harbor Remembrance Day. Recognized each year on the anniversary of the 1942 Japanese attack on Alaska, Dutch Harbor Remembrance Day honors military personnel who served and died defending our country and the Aleut people who died while imprisoned.
"As a child, my dad told us stories about his serving on the front line in the Alaska Scouts in the Aleutian Campaign during World War II, and the brave soldiers who served alongside him," said Governor Walker. "I encourage all Alaskans to honor the heroic men and women who courageously fought to defend our land 73 years ago."
Governor Walker ordered all state flags to be lowered to half-staff on Wednesday, June 3, in honor of Dutch Harbor Remembrance Day, and returned to full-staff on Thursday, June 4.
