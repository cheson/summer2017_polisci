Statement
By: Bill Walker
Date: Dec. 9, 2016
Location: Anchorage, AK

Governor Bill Walker and Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott released this statement today in reaction to President Barack Obama's Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Executive Order:
"We support Tribal leaders in the Bering Straits region who worked diligently to provide economic opportunities for their community while protecting valuable resources. However, the State of Alaska is concerned about any further erosion of our ability to support much needed resource development at a time when the state is grappling with declining oil prices and production. We are concerned about the timing and lack of clarity on how this executive order will be implemented in the coming years."
