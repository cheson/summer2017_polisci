Governor Bill Walker today released a statement praising the U.S. Army's decision to keep the 4-25 Infantry Brigade Combat Team at Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson.
"I am very pleased to hear that the U.S. Army has decided to keep the 4-25 Infantry Brigade Combat Team (ABN) at Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson (JBER) into the future. Alaska has a unique and strategic geopolitical location, and the decision to keep those 5,000 soldiers at JBER is a powerful recognition of that fact. I thank our congressional delegation for their work and advocacy on behalf of our military men and women stationed at JBER and across Alaska who sacrifice of themselves to defend the values we hold so dear." --Governor Bill Walker
