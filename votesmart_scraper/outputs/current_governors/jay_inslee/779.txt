Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chair, I thank Representative Giffords, the House Leadership and the Chairman for working to pass H.R. 3585 today, which a legislative priority for the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition. H.R. 3585, Solar Technology Roadmap Act will strengthen the American solar technology industry through a coordinated research and development program and public-private partnerships.
The Solar Technology Roadmap Act will give even cloudy states like Washington a roadmap to solar technology deployment. The bill will help to ensure that federal funding for solar energy research is prioritized to commercialize new solar technologies to make this clean, renewable energy source more affordable and accessible for all Americans.
Harnessing the power of the sun is an economic opportunity for America, with the potential to help create tens of thousands of clean energy jobs in neighborhoods across the country.
The U.S. has some of the best solar resources of any industrialized nation in the world. Yet while America is currently a leader in solar technology development, other countries like Spain, Germany and China are devoting much more effort and attention to this field, putting U.S. competitiveness in this industry in jeopardy. This bill will strengthen America's solar industry and I urge its passage.
Unfortunately, due to a matter in Washington, I will be absent for the vote on final passage of this important bill. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes''.
