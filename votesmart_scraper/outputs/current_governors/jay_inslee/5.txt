Legislators today ended their second special session with no budget agreement. With nine days remaining before the end of the fiscal year, Gov. Jay Inslee called legislators into a third session to urge them to deliver a complete two-year budget by June 30 that will fully-fund education and prevent any shutdown of state services. He also rejected the notion that a short-term 30-day budget could be considered as a stopgap.
"A government shutdown and a 30-day budget are both equally reckless, equally irresponsible tactics that fail to deal with the long-term fiscal and fiduciary consequences of not doing their job, which is to produce a two-year budget for the people of the state of Washington," Inslee said.
The governor spoke with reporters to discuss the consequences of a government shutdown and the current legislators' efforts toward a budget compromise.
