GASOLINE FOR AMERICA'S SECURITY ACT OF 2005 -- (House of Representatives - October 07, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a giant missed opportunity. We had an opportunity to do something significant. Kennedy said we were going to go to the Moon in 10 years; this bill will not get us to Cleveland. And the reason is it invests in old technology. Did Kennedy challenge the country to invest in propeller plane technology? Here we are simply investing in oil fossil fuel technology, a giveaway to the oil and gas industry of millions and billions of dollars of taxpayer money.
We need a new Apollo energy project. H.R. 2828 will get us there with new technologies and fuel-efficient cars, new technologies and new productive capabilities in wind and solar and wave power and a whole slew of other things. We need new ideas, we need a new vision, not an old giveaway to oil and gas.
Mr. Speaker, this bill is one small misstep for man and one giant leap backwards for mankind, and it should be defeated.
