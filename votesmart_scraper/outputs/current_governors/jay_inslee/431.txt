Governor Jay Inslee released the following statement tonight in response to President Obama's 2014 State of the Union Address:
"Tonight the President restated his commitment to continue our nation's economic recovery, invest in the growth of the middle class and to address America's growing economic inequality. I applaud the President's commitments to expanding access to early learning, providing more Americans with better and more affordable health coverage, reforming our immigration system, increasing the minimum wage, and investing in infrastructure to create jobs. And I appreciate the President's call to action to address climate change, the paths forward on which offer our state either the unacceptable costs of inaction, or tremendous economic opportunities through leadership.
"This must be a year of action, in both Washingtons. Today I laid out a proposal that would invest in our children's education and the future of our state. My administration will continue to examine the best way to increase the minimum wage in the Evergreen State and give more Washingtonians the opportunity to share in the economic recovery. And the ongoing legislative session presents us with the opportunity for action to create jobs rebuilding our infrastructure. We will continue to pursue B&O tax relief for thousands of small businesses, and build upon the health care reforms which have already, in just four months, provided 320,000 previously-uninsured Washingtonians with access to care.
"Washingtonians, like all Americans, are an optimistic and forward-looking group. We can and must work together to ensure this future is realized."
