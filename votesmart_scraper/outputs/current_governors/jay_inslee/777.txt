Floor Speech

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, the debate we're having today is between two groups--those who believe we can improve America and those who believe we can't improve America. We believe we can improve American energy; they believe we can't. We believe we can improve health care; they believe we can't. We believe we can stop insurers from preventing us from having coverage because we have a preexisting condition; they believe we can't. We need some more Republicans and fewer Republican'ts because saying we can't improve America is not up to the standards that America was built on. We can stop insurance companies. Let's get some more of these Republican'ts to become Republicans and help us reform health care in this country.
