Gov. Jay Inslee issued this statement in response to the Insurance Commissioner's announcement of rate changes and approved health plans:
"Changes brought about largely by the Affordable Care Act are making health care costs less expensive for Washingtonians. States like Washington that are implementing the Act as written are seeing the lowest rates in decades -- projected at 1.9 percent for 2015. I only wish other states that neglected needed changes in our health care system would fully adopt the Affordable Care Act so their residents could get the same benefits as Washingtonians -- high quality affordable care."
