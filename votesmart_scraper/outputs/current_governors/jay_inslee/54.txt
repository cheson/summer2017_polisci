Oregon Governor Kate Brown, California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., Washington Governor Jay Inslee, and British Columbia Premier Christy Clark today issued the following statement on the final day of the United Nations Climate Conference in Marrakesh, MoÂ… :
"Today, as COP22 comes to a close -- two weeks after the Paris Agreement came into force -- leaders from across the globe have renewed their commitment to climate action. In California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia -- from the Mexican border to the edge of the Yukon Territory -- we stand with the international community. Our success demonstrates that taking action on climate change goes hand-in-hand with robust job creation and a thriving clean energy economy.
"We know what's at stake because we have seen the destruction firsthand -- from year-round wildfires and historic drought to devastating sea-level rise. These impacts don't respect borders or wait for the next election.
"Our resolve is strong. We will continue to take bold action to achieve the targets set in the Paris agreement. We will mobilize our resources and our people. We will join with other like-minded cities, states and regions committed to action and lead this global fight."
