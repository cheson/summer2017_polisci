Gov. Jay Inslee today issued a statement on President Donald Trump's budget proposal.
"The federal budget proposed by President Trump would be an enormous step backward for our country. It shamefully pulls the rug out from under the most vulnerable Americans - including children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities - to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
"Trump divests from critical investments in education, health care, environmental protections, research and development, workforce development and other programs that protect public health and sustain a prosperous American economy. And it reneges on the president's promises not to cut Medicaid or Social Security.
"This budget is a betrayal of American values.
"Last month Congress rejected Trump's egregious proposed budget cuts for 2017. I urge Congress to again reject Trump's budget for 2018, and I look forward to working with members of the Washington state congressional delegation to protect critical federal investments in our state."
Inslee sent a letter to the state's congressional delegation last month expressing his concerns about the president's initial budget blueprint.
