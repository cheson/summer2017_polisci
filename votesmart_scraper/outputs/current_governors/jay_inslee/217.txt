Just one day following the Obama Administration's approval of Gov. Jay Inslee's request for a Federal Emergency Declaration, a new Mobilization Center started being formed at Fairchild Air Force Base to assist with firefighting efforts in Eastern Washington.

The Mobilization Center will be a staging area for 20 large fire engines of the type specifically designed to protect threatened communities and residences, along with 10 water tankers. The Mobilization Center is being managed by a 17-person All Hazard Incident Management Team from San Diego, CA. The new fire engines are coming from Utah, Nevada and Arizona and Colorado.

"These new assets will provide an incredible assist for our firefighters throughout Eastern Washington," Inslee said. "With erratic wind conditions and extremely dry fuels, our firefighters need every available resource to manage current fires and respond to new ones. This IMT is not only bringing us much needed manpower, but much needed equipment that will greatly help our ability to protect people's homes and property."
