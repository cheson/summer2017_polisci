Unfair Airbus Competition
Floor Speech

Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, we cannot allow a great injustice to the American worker, to the American warfighter and to the American taxpayer, which would happen if a contract for the Air Force tanker goes to the Airbus contractor without taking into consideration these massive illegal subsidies that the Airbus competitor has received.
Unfair Airbus Competition
We have decided and we have determined, the U.S. Government, that Airbus has received multibillion dollars of illegal subsidies, which have allowed them to develop a tanker with which they now have to bid against an American contractor, the Boeing Company.
We are calling upon the administration to do the right thing, which is in the contracting process, and figure into the respective bids the amount of the illegal subsidies that the Airbus company has received. And they can do that by having the countervailing duty section of the U.S. Department of Trade Representative determine the amount of that illegal subsidy. When that illegal subsidy is added to the Airbus bid, the right thing will happen, and we will have American jobs.
