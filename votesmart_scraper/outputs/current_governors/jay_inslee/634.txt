Fighting to protect American jobs and ports while restoring public trust in the tax code -- Congressman Jeff Landry (R, LA-03) led a bi-partisan coalition of 34 House Members in sending a letter to the Budget Committee requesting the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) is lawfully utilized for harbor dredging.
In 1986, Congress established the HMTF -- financed through a 0.125 percent tax on cargo imported through a port or moved between two domestic ports -- to fund up to 100 percent of dredging costs at domestic ports and waterways. However, recent administrations have ignored the law -- utilizing only one-half to two-thirds of the revenue for harbor maintenance and holding the rest for increased federal spending in other areas of the budget.
The letter urges the Budget Committee to apportion all proceeds of the HMTF to sustain and dredge America's harbors.

The Honorable Paul Ryan
Chairman
U.S. House Committee on the Budget
207 Cannon House Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20515
