CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, 10 million low-income American children will get health care coverage under this bill to renew SCHIP. Some of us think that is not such a bad thing.
This legislation is especially important to my home State of Washington because it will cut in half the number of uninsured kids in Washington State. It does that by fixing a long-standing inequity that punished Washington and 10 other States because we provided coverage for kids just above the poverty line, and we fix that long-standing inequity tonight.
If you're a Member from the State of Washington, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Maryland, New Hampshire, Vermont and Tennessee, vote for this bill and you can go home telling your constituents we fixed this long-term unfairness.
I'd like to thank Chairman Dingell for including a 100 percent permanent fix in the House SCHIP bill that we passed in early August. I'm grateful that we retained that fix, and I hope we'll make sure that we do this on a permanent basis ultimately.
So we need to pass this bill tonight, extend coverage and fix that inequity.
