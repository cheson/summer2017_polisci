New Jay Inslee TV Ad: "The Day" Highlights Governor Inslee's Record on Job Creation
Press Release
By: Jay Inslee
Date: July 14, 2016
Location: Seattle, WA

The Jay Inslee campaign today released its first television ad of the 2016 campaign. The ad, "The Day," highlights Jay's focus on jobs since his first day in office as Governor.
Since the day Jay was sworn in, over 250,000 jobs have been created, we've seen the lowest unemployment rate since 2008, and Business Insider ranked Washington state the number one economy in the nation. To make college more affordable, Jay signed a bill to lower tuition for every Washington student, including for those attending community college or career and technical schools.
But Jay knows there is more to do to build a stronger economy and better future for every Washington family. That's why he supports efforts to raise the minimum wage and ensure paid sick leave for every Washington worker, and passed a transportation package that will put 200,000 people to work repairing our aging infrastructure.
