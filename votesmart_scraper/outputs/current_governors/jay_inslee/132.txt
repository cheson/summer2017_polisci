Gov. Jay Inslee released a statement today on Peter Goldmark's announcement that he will not seek re-election.
"I thank Peter for his seven years of service as Washington State Commissioner of Public Lands and his nearly 40 years of public service. I appreciate Peter's values around careful stewardship and science-based decision making. He is a dedicated land manager and protector of our natural resources.
