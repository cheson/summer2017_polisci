I was raised with a deep respect for the environment and taught that we have a responsibility to protect it, to pass it on to our children. That is why I have fought for strong, common sense laws that bridge our state's desire for jobs, environmental preservation and recreation.
That is why I have:
* Worked to pass legislation to make oil companies use the best available technology to prevent oil spills at sea
* Secured $341,000 for an Army Corps of Engineers program to address ecosystem and salmon recovery in Puget Sound Basin. The program benefits all Puget Sound Counties including Kitsap, Whatcom, Clallam, San Juan, Skagit, Island, Pierce, Thurston, Mason and Jefferson
* Supported a moratorium on oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas where little research has been done on how to prevent or react to a spill
* Authored legislation to codify protectionsIssue Position: Health
for our nation's Roadless areas
* Supported full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and Historic Preservation Fund: money used to protect and conserve our natural, historical, and recreational resources
* Authored legislation that passed in the House to include the Puget Sound's Cascadia Marine Trail in a network of nationally recognized trails that are eligible to receive federal resources
