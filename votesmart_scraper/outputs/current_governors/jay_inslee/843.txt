HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DEFICIT SPENDING -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008)
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, listening to the President last night, I had a very disturbing sense of déja 2 vu, or actually, maybe, appropriately, déja 2 voodoo.
I remember the situation where the President said we had this threat to the country, we had to respond in Iraq. He then went on to foist hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit spending in the Iraq war, without paying one single dime in a fiscally responsible way to do it.
Last night he did exactly the same thing. He attempted to foist somewhere between 200, 500, 700 billion dollars of deficit spending on the American people. When you do deficit spending, you ultimately put the cost on middle-income taxpayers in America.
This President, if he believes this crisis is so bad, needs to come to the American people and put the cost on the folks who got us into this predicament, the industry that created this crisis, not on middle-income taxpayers.
This is fiscal irresponsibility. It will not stand.
