PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. RES. 627, DEPLORING ABUSE OF PERSONS IN UNITED STATES CUSTODY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2004)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, this outrage cuts to the bone, not just because it damages our international relations, but because it damages basic tenets of American values. And when you have such a deep wound, self-inflicted, you cannot have half measures. And this resolution is weak tea when we need strong medicine; and it is inadequate, and this rule should be defeated for that reason.
Where in this resolution is there a call for the obvious need for an investigation of the private contractors who are making hundreds of thousands of dollars, who are involved in this outrage, who are outside the chain of command, who are not subject to military justice? Why will the Republican Party not join us in investigating those private contractors and putting this in this resolution? Why is there nothing in this resolution about the need for an international opening up of our system so that we can regain credibility? Why is there not in this resolution an accounting for the Iraqi people of who is in there? And lastly, where is the resignation for Donald Rumsfeld?
