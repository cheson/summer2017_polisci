How well are we ensuring that children are getting a high-quality public education? Are we doing what's needed to foster a strong business climate? How much progress are we making on reducing greenhouse gas emissions?
Gov. Jay Inslee today formally launched Results Washington, which will provide faster and easier answers to those questions and access to an unprecedented array of performance data related to his top goals.
Once fully in place, Results Washington will make it easier than ever for state leaders to spot trends and make data-driven decisions that improve quality and speed up service delivery. It will lead to better-informed budget and policy decisions. It will also make it possible for Washingtonians to see for themselves how well state government and its many partners -- such as school districts, local governments and community organizations -- deliver services and meet key performance goals.
"Taxpayers expect and deserve to see results from their government," Inslee said. "Results Washington will give us the data we need to learn from what is working, fix what's broken and direct resources to our most important priorities."
Washington has long been a national leader in adapting proven private-sector methods and tools to measure and improve state government performance. Results Washington combines the best aspects of those efforts with a significantly expanded Lean management culture throughout state government.
Results Washington will include higher-level goals than previously set to gauge how the state as a whole demonstrates progress.
"I set our standards high because it's what our children and our families deserve," Inslee said. "Even if we don't achieve all those goals right away, our efforts will bring us closer to success."
