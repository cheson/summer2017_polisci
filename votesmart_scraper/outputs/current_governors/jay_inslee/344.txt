Inslee Lifts Burn Ban in Central and Eastern WA, Urges People to Continue Using Caution
Press Release
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Sept. 3, 2014
Location: Unknown

Gov. Jay Inslee today announced he is not issuing a further extension to the burn ban he initiated last month for 20 counties east of the crest of the Cascades. The burn ban expired at noon today.
"Thanks to the hard work of our fire crews and some helpful breaks in the weather, fire hazards have decreased enough that a ban is no longer necessary," Inslee said. "What is necessary, however, is continued caution and common sense whenever engaging in burning activity."
The Department of Natural Resources burn ban continues through September 30th on DNR fire-protected state lands across the state. Campfires are allowed at state, county and municipal parks in accordance with any restrictions in place at individual parks. Permitted agricultural burning is governed by local fire departments, air agencies and the Department of Ecology and must be approved through these agencies and their existing processes.
A state of emergency went into effect on July 14 in 20 Eastern Washington counties in response to multiple wildfires threatening homes, businesses, public infrastructure and natural resources. The governor's emergency proclamation covers Adams, Asotin, Benton, Chelan, Columbia, Douglas, Ferry, Franklin, Garfield, Grant, Kittitas, Klickitat, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Stevens, Walla Walla, Whitman and Yakima counties and remains in effect.
