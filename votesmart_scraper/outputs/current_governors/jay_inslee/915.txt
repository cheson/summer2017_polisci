THE MEDIA OWNERSHIP ACT -- (Extensions of Remarks - December 19, 2007)
SPEECH OF
HON. JAY INSLEE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 19, 2007
* Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, as much of America now knows, yesterday in a split decision, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to approve new media ownership rules that in many ways are far worse for the public interest than anything previously revealed by FCC Chairman Martin.
* Prior to yesterday's vote. Chairman Martin had attempted to portray his proposal as a ``moderate compromise'' that would allow one company to own both a daily newspaper and a low-rated broadcast TV station in only the 20 largest media markets. But research from Free Press--collected in the Devil in the Details report--exposed how the loose and ambiguous ``waiver'' standards in the proposal left a giant loophole for companies to sidestep the ban in any market and for any station.
* The final rule, rewritten in the middle of the night before the hearing, retains all of the original loopholes and adds additional loopholes that appear to allow cross-ownership mergers in virtually any market.
* While I had held out hope that the FCC would delay this vote given the outpouring of public commentary opposing the rule changes, it is clear that the Chairman of the FCC is not listening. I see no other choice than to push for congressional action, and to that end, yesterday I introduced H.R. 4835, the Media Ownership Act of 2007, in the House to stop these new cross-ownership rules from going forward.
* I am pleased to have been joined by my Washington State colleague Representative DAVE REICHERT in this bipartisan effort, and it is my hope that we can move swiftly to prevent these new rules from going into effect. This effort is the companion to work being done in the Senate Commerce Committee where a bipartisan group of Senators have led the effort against these changes.
* When Chairman Martin was before the Energy and Commerce Committee earlier this month, I asked him how he could ignore the public outcry he heard when he visited Seattle, Washington, where--despite less than 5 days notice--thousands turned out and stayed until 1 a.m. on a Friday night to voice their concerns. I asked him how we could believe that he had thoughtfully considered the public's concerns, when less than 3 days later, the Chairman published an op-ed in the New York Times outlining his plan for media consolidation.
* Clearly, Chairman Martin is not listening to the American people, and now we need to step up and ensure that their voices are heard. I hope my colleagues here in Congress will join me in this eftort, and I hope this legislation moves swiftly.
