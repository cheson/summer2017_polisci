Issue Position: Making Health Care Affordable
Issue Position

Washingtonians deserve quality, affordable health care. I supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because it lowers health care costs, saves Medicare for our seniors for the long-term, expands care for children, and reduces our national debt. In addition, I worked for more than a year with my colleagues to fix the longstanding Medicare reimbursement disparity plaguing Washington doctors and hospitals.
Because of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act:
* Prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage for Washingtonians with pre-existing conditions
* Eliminates lifetime or yearly caps on coverage and the practice of an insurance company dropping a patient because the company doesn't want to pay for their care
* Closes the prescription drug "donut-hole" for seniors, which has caused many seniors to choose between food and medicine
* Allows children to stay on their parents health insurance till age 26
* Fair reimbursement for Washington state hospitals and doctors under Medicare, stopping the flood of doctors and providers leaving the state
