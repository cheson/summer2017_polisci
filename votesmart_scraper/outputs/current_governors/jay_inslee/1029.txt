TIME FOR NEW MANAGEMENT IN THE HOUSE
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, my oldest son Jack is a carpenter, and one of the reasons I am so proud of him is he is such a hard worker. It doesn't matter how hard it is raining out in Seattle, he is out there swinging the hammer.
That is one reason we should not respect the current pathetic management team of the Republican Party who is on a course to make this Congress the least productive Congress in American history, for one reason, because we don't do any work.
Of the 5 months that we have been here, we are on a track to work about 38 days. If you have an employee that out of 5 months does 38 days of work, what do you think you ought to do? Unemployment. A pink slip for the folks who are not running this Congress.
In Truman's time, we had the do-nothing Congress. This is the do-less-than-nothing Congress. If you want to know why there is no progress on Iraq, why there is no progress on energy, why there is no progress on helping the folks after Katrina, it is because the people here in this management stay home and don't do any work.
It is time to start swinging a hammer, and, to do that, it is time to get new management in this House and get Congress working for the American people again.
