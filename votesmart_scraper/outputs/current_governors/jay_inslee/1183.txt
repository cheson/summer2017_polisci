REP. JAY INSLEE (D-WA): Thank you. Unless we provide some relief to the difficulties of the dynamics of trade, the trade debate is going to be lost for those who support trade. And to that end, many of us believe that we should send trade adjustment assistance to service employees as we do now those in the manufacturing sector.
Obviously we have a lot of folks, who heretofore have not felt threatened by international trade now, do in the software sector, telecommunications, actuaries, radiologists, you name it.
Adam Smith and I have introduced a bill to do exactly that. And I would hope the administration would support this. The president's Council on Exports will make that recommendation, too, shortly, I believe.
Could you help us on that? Could you talk to your committee chairs and help push this bill? What do you think of this idea?
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
REP. INSLEE: Do I take it that we have an ally who will be arguing for the extension of trade adjustment assistance to the service sector?
SEC. SNOW: Congressman, you have an ally for the broader proposition that effective transition assistance needs to be provided. Whether it's precisely that legislation or something else, I'm not close enough to to give you a good answer.
REP. INSLEE: Thank you.
