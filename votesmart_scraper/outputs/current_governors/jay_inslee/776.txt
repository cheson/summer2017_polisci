BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and Mr. Upton for their leadership on this bill. I want to thank Mr. Markey for working with me to include language in the bill that recognizes the 17 research reactors in this country that have converted from highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium fuel. One of these reactors is in my home State at Washington State University. This reactor can be used for medical isotope production with the use of highly enriched uranium.
I would like to clarify with Mr. Markey that the purpose of section 3(a)(3) which allows reactors that are in the process of converting from highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium fuel to qualify for funds under this bill. It is my understanding that this provision should not be interpreted as giving any preferences to these reactors and that all applicants for these funds will be given full and equal consideration.
