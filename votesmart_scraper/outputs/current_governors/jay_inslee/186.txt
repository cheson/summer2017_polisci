"The global shift away from fossil fuels to a clean energy future is happening and it's happening now. States like Washington, working closely with our partner states and provinces, are helping lead the way. This is the right thing to do for the future of our children and health of our planet, and is one of the greatest economic opportunities of our generation to establish our state as a leader in a growing new industry and create thousands of jobs."
