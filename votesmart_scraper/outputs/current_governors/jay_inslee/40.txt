"The proposed legislation in Congress to repeal Obamacare is not the direction we should be going to meet our country's health care needs. It will not improve the health or well-being of millions of people who have gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act. This proposal would kick 600,000 Washingtonians off Medicaid unless the state can come up with $1.3 billion -- a burden that would be borne entirely by the state's taxpayers.
"The proposal put forth by Congressional Republicans will hurt low-income people, the elderly, people with disabilities and those who need long-term care. This means loss of coverage for people with cancer, diabetes and seniors who are already struggling with costs. These are not scare stories, these are facts.
"Congress proposes paying for its plan by giving a tax break to the wealthy and shifting unaffordable costs onto the states.
"Washington state's implementation of the Affordable Care Act has been a success and has helped so many. Our state has made tremendous strides ensuring more of our people have access to higher quality health care at lower costs. Those who have gained needed coverage through the ACA deserve better than what Congress is proposing to give them.
"I ask all members of our congressional delegation to ensure health benefits are maintained for every person who currently receives coverage through the ACA.
"We must move forward on health care, not backward. I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that Washingtonians have meaningful, affordable coverage."
