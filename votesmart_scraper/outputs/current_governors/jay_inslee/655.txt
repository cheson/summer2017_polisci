Statement
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Jan. 5, 2011
Location: Washington, DC

At noon, Rep. Jay Inslee (WA-01) of Bainbridge Island took the oath of office and was sworn in as a member of the 112th Congress. Rep. Inslee was first elected to serve Washington state's first district in 1999. This afternoon Rep. Inslee released the following statement:
"It was a great honor to have once again been asked to serve the people of Washington's first congressional district. I accept this responsibility with the utmost humility and intent to carry out my duties to the best of my abilities."
"The 112th Congress brings new opportunity and calls upon us to make a renewed commitment to build a better nation. Over the next two years our constituents demand more than a policy of "no" and a refrain of "we can't." We must work together, putting aside our political differences, to build a new America, one which upholds our values and ideals. This means building a new economic future that takes advantage of innovation, clean energy and new technology. It means a commitment to education so that our children and grandchildren are empowered with the skills to compete and thrive. It means protecting our health and environment because they are our most important resource.
"I'm committed to working with my colleagues in Congress, while standing firm for what is right. That is what Washingtonians expect and deserve."
