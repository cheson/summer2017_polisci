Gov. Jay Inslee today released a statement on guidance from the Obama administration to ensure the civil rights of transgender students.
"In Washington state, we've adopted policies to ensure our schools are a place all our children can feel safe from discrimination, harassment or assault based on their gender identity. The guidance issued today by the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice affirms that Washington is doing the right thing for our students. At a time the rights of transgender students and men and women are under attack throughout the country -- and even in our state -- I applaud the Obama administration for establishing policies that will better provide all our children an opportunity to thrive."
