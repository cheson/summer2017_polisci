U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez today announced that Washington state is one of eight states to receive grant funding to help implement paid leave programs around the country. Gov. Jay Inslee said the $247,000 grant will allow Washington state to launch the important first steps in designing the paid family leave program approved by the Legislature in 2007.
"Paid family leave is one of the most important things we can do for working families. Though our state's economy is growing, economic insecurity remains a real challenge for many of Washington's working families," Inslee said. "Workers often face no-win decisions about returning to work and sacrificing time to care for and bond with a new infant or provide medical care for an ill or aging partner or parent. They simply can't afford to take time off. Every other industrialized nation has developed an effective tool to help employers and employees with this challenge -- so can we."
