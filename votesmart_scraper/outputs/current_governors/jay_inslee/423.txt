Statement from Governor Jay Inslee who met today with US Department of Education Secretary Arne Duncan to discuss options for preserving Washington's No Child Left Behind waiver.
"Our discussion today was productive. I think there's a possibility to develop a positive path forward that has a realistic chance of success," said Inslee. "I'll be having conversations with legislators and our Superintendent of Public Instruction about our options and how we can ensure we protect the nearly $40 million that is used by districts to serve struggling students. Time is short this session so I hope we can reach resolution quickly, and I'll have more to say in the coming days."
