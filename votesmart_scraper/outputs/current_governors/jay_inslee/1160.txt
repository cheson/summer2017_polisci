CATHERINE MAY BEDELL, POLITICAL PIONEER AND MENTOR TO WOMEN -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2004)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to join my colleagues in honoring Catherine May Bedell.
In my role as a previous representative of the Fourth Congressional District, before I was freed by the voters for other duties, as we say, and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) took that noble office, I did not have the honor of knowing her personally, but I knew her by her legacy. That I think is maybe the nicest, most meaningful legacy a Member of Congress could have. That is when I was door-belling and going to thousands of homes when I was running in Yakima for the seat that she previously held. I had a lot of people, when her name came up, said, I remember her. She was really a nice lady. I really liked her. I heard that a lot.
When you think about a legacy that any of us might have here, I think that is the highest one we could have, that our names may come up when other people are door-belling. She was well loved in Yakima Valley, and we are thinking of her family today. It is an honor to represent her district as well.
Ms. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I want to say, in closing, we appreciate the time allotted to us. When a door closes, often another window opens. And to all of us, I want to say that 5 weeks ago a member of my campaign staff gave birth to a little baby girl whose name is Catherine May.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
END
