BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I visited a couple of fascinating companies. Applied Materials in Santa Clara, California, makes the world's largest photovoltaic cell because they figured out a way to do it and reduce manufacturing costs. I then drove up the road to Bloom Energy, which has developed a fuel cell that actually can convert natural gas to electricity right on site at your home or your office.
These two companies are typical of the companies that can lead to the creation of millions of new clean-energy jobs for a new clean-energy economy in the United States, but they are waiting on the other Chamber to pass a bill that will put a limit on carbon pollution. Once we put a limit on carbon pollution, companies like Applied Materials and Bloom Energy will in fact bloom and blossom because they will be on a level playing field. Let's get a cap on carbon pollution. Let's build a new clean energy economy for this country.
