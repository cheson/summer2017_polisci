Tonight marks an important milestone in our campaign to build a new economy for Washington, a campaign about building upon our state's innovative spirit and the creativity of our workers to lay the groundwork for a 21st Century economy. We will build an economy that puts the middle class first, competes with any other place in the world, and creates whole new industries and the jobs that come with it.
Whether it's jobs in clean energy, aerospace, high tech, agriculture - or any industry - I have faith in Washington workers on both sides of the Cascades. I'll be a governor who won't accept things as they are now, but will plow new ground and bring a new, independent approach to creating jobs for the people of our state.
My wife, Trudi, and I look forward to campaigning across the state in the coming weeks, and talking with middle-class families about Washington's economic future. After all, this election is all about the future. And if given the opportunity, my term as governor will be about building a better future for the people of Washington.
