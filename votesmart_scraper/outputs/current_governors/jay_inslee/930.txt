EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007
BREAK
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Chairman, this bill is about discrimination, but it is also about economic competition.
Thinking about this bill today, I was thinking about the 1964 University of Washington Huskies football team that went to the Rose Bowl. They had a slashing, tough, brutal halfback named Dave Kopay, a boyhood hero of mine. He helped them go to the Rose Bowl. Later on after he goes to the NFL, we learn he is gay. If the UW hadn't put that guy in, there are several games they would not have won.
And if software companies don't hire gay software engineers, they will not be economically competitive with the rest of the world. In America, let's get one thing real clear: All good athletes play and all good software engineers engineer and all good workers work. That's the American way. Let's pass this bill.
