The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, DHHS, has awarded the Washington Department of Corrections a five-year, $7.5 million federal grant aimed at helping inmates with children transition back into society and be successful parents. Only five awards are set to be funded nationally.
"Incarceration doesn't just impact offenders, it has deep impacts on their children too," said Gov. Jay Inslee. "Helping these parents build and maintain a bond with their child can change the courses of their lives for the better."
