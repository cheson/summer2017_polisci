"The DREAM Act represents a new future for many aspiring Washington students.
"While we've opened the doors of our colleges and universities to students from all walks of life, too many still face an insurmountable financial barrier. This bill ensures that the young men and women we've invested in at our high schools and who aspire to become productive American citizens will now have fair access to the financial support they need to turn their dreams into reality.
"This is a landmark achievement for the 2014 session. I appreciate the hard work of the legislators and students who have been working on this for so long and who helped pass this bill. I look forward to signing this bill and celebrating a big step forward for thousands of young Washingtonians."
