The NGA Center for Best Practices today announced that six states--Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Hampshire, Utah and Washington--will participate in the 2016 Policy Academy on Scaling Work-Based Learning. Work-based learning blends work experience and applied learning to develop youth and young adults' foundational and technical skills to expand their education, career and employment opportunities.
"Preparing our young people for the modern workforce is a priority all governors share," said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who is also the chair of the NGA Education and Workforce Committee. "Washington is excited to participate in this opportunity to develop strategies that will help our young people succeed."
