ABUSE OF POWER -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2005)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, Tuesday morning I gave a constituent a lift to the airport in Seattle going to the airport on my daily commute to Washington, D.C. I asked him what his feelings were, if any, about what is happening in Washington, D.C.
He said he is bothered by what he perceives as the abuse of power that is going on here in Washington, D.C. I asked him what he meant by that. It was very interesting because sometimes we do not know if people are paying attention to what is happening here, but he itemized a list of things that he was concerned about.
He was concerned about trying to do away with this checks and balance system that we have in our Federal judicial system. He was concerned about the attack on the independence of our courts. He said he was concerned about the attack on one of the checks and balances we had in the U.S. Senate in the filibuster that was so successful in keeping a stable democracy.
And he said, and this really surprised me, he said he was concerned about the abuses going on in this Chamber in trying to change the ethical rules just to protect one Member. He basically said, something smells.
Mr. Speaker, he is right; and I urge my colleagues to stop this long train of abuses of power in Washington, D.C.
