Gov. Jay Inslee today asked the Small Business Administration to make its disaster loan programs available to homeowners, renters, businesses and nonprofit organizations hurt by flooding and mudslides caused by the January 3-6 winter storm.
"The lifeblood of this community is its residents and businesses," Inslee said. "That's evident by the way local recovery groups have banded together to help their neighbors and communities. With that said -- this area needs an additional hand up to get those impacted by the storm back on their feet. The loss is tremendous, and the SBA programs would provide access to funding to help replace what was lost, and make homes livable again."
Grays Harbor County reported more than 300 homes and businesses experienced damage from the storm. The governor's request certified that at least 25 home or business owners in Grays Harbor County experienced substantial uninsured loss caused by damage from the storm. The SBA loan programs cannot duplicate benefits otherwise provided by insurance.
Under the SBA disaster loan program, renters and homeowners who experienced substantial uninsured loss may borrow up to $40,000 to repair or replace clothing, furniture, cars or appliances damaged or destroyed in the disaster. Homeowners may apply for up to $200,000 to repair or replace their primary residence to its pre-disaster condition. Qualified businesses and nonprofit organizations may apply for up to $2 million to repair or replace damaged real estate, equipment, inventory, and fixtures.
If the SBA makes the program available in Grays Harbor County, homeowners, renters, businesses and non-profits in the contiguous counties -- Jefferson, Lewis, Mason, Pacific and Thurston -- that experienced damage from the storm also will be eligible to apply.
