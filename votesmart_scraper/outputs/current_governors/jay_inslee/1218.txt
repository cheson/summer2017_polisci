War in Iraq
I opposed the unilateral pre-emptive invasion of Iraq in the name of common sense and truth. I opposed this war in the name of the preservation of international law and stronger, collective security. I opposed this war because nowhere did I see credible evidence that Iraq posed a dire threat that warranted a pre-emptive attack on another nation and its people. Further, I opposed this war because I did not believe that we made a serious effort to exhaust all possibilities before opening the door to war.
The Bush Administration and its supporters in both Congress and the media made a case for war that was factually inaccurate, and in so doing sacrificed our nation's credibility, hampered our ability to keep our nation secure, wasted hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars, raised the debt ceiling twice, and most importantly, unnecessarily risked the lives of our brave men and women in uniform.
I voted against the original legislation giving the President the option to unilaterally attack Iraq because the request was little more than a blank check based on what we now know was false intelligence. I also opposed the resolution because of the fiscally irresponsible manner in which it was paid for. To simply borrow the money from our children's future, thus adding to the already bloated federal debt, was not a proposition I could support.
I have grave concerns about the credibility and possible misrepresentation of pre-war intelligence on Iraq. It is now clear to the whole world that Iraq was not, in fact, reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. It is equally clear that Iraq did not, in fact, have the chemical and biological weapons that the administration claimed. Further, the pre-war allegation so often made by Vice President Cheney that Iraq was in cahoots with al Qaeda has yet to be proven. I am particularly concerned that intelligence was manipulated and selectively used to support decisions that were already made at the highest levels of our government.
I have taken a number of actions to hold the administration accountable for the information they presented to the American public and Congress before the invasion of Iraq. I hosted a community forum in Shoreline, Washington, to discuss whether or not Congress should investigate the pre-war intelligence and how the administration used that intelligence. More than 1,100 Washingtonians attended the event and they overwhelmingly supported an investigation by Congress into the intelligence failures. David Kay's acknowledgment that the United States' weapons inspection team found no substantial evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq only serves to highlight the need for a thorough investigation into the pre-war intelligence.
With some of my colleagues in the House, I started the Congressional "Iraq Watch" Special Orders. The purpose of "Iraq Watch" is to examine, and evaluate the United States. past and future policies with regard to Iraq. The group will continue to study the intelligence used to justify this war and encourage President Bush seek help from the international community to rebuild the war-torn nation of Iraq. I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 2625, a bill to establish an independent and bipartisan commission to investigate the administration.s use of pre-war intelligence in selling this war. I also voted for two amendments to H.R. 2417, the FY2004 Intelligence Authorization Act, offered by Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D.-Ohio) and Rep. Barbara Lee (D.-California) respectively to achieve accountability in investigating and rectifying the pre-war intelligence failures.
I submitted two amendments to H. Res. 557, a Republican drafted resolution that marked the one-year anniversary of the invasion of Iraq and commended our brave men and women in uniform. When I read the resolution, I was surprised to see that there was no mention of the rationales the administration used to authorize this war. In drafting this resolution, the Republican controlled House was attempting to rewrite history to try to absolve themselves from accountability about the false claims many of them had made regarding the nature of the threat posed by Iraq.
This resolution was presented simply as a document praising our troops, an issue that all Republicans and Democrats agree on. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R.-Texas), however, decided to politicize this resolution by adding statements about the world being a better place without Saddam Hussein controlling Iraq. DeLay.s intent was to goad Democrats into voting against our troops. I, along with many of my colleagues, refused to take his bait. Instead, I offered two amendments to the resolution. One amendment would recognize that, "the people of the United States received false information from the United States Government regarding weapons of mass destruction leading up to the war in Iraq." The other amendment declared that Congress "should conduct in an open, thorough, and comprehensive manner an investigation as to why false information relating to weapons of mass destruction was presented by the United States Government to the people of the United States prior to the war in Iraq."
As is too often the case in this Congress, the Republican controlled House Rules Committee denied the opportunity for the House to consider my amendments, or any other Democratic amendments, for that matter. I find it sad and ironic that while the President makes its case for democracy in Iraq, the Republican-run Congress denies us the basic rights of democracy here at home.
It is now clear that after more than a year of searching for weapons of mass destruction, Iraq did not have a substantial weapons program. It is also clear that Iraq did not have chemical or biological weapons. There remains to be no proof to the administration.s claim that Iraq and al Qaeda had a working relationship. However, as a result of our war against Iraq, that country has become a vacuum that has attracted terrorists from around the globe.
