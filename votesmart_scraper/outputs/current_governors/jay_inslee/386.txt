"I want to thank the Small Business Administration and Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet for the quick work in approving my request for an emergency declaration to help North Bend residents and businesses impacted by the April 25 explosion. This is an important step as North Bend works to repair damage from the explosion.
"This continues the great partnership we have with the federal government that helped speed assistance following the 530 slide and the Skagit River bridge collapse. The declaration clears the way for low-interest loans for homeowners, renters, businesses and nonprofit organizations. Beginning today, SBA will have representatives in the area. I encourage anyone impacted by the explosion to contact the SBA."
