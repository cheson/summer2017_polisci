Statement
By: Jay Inslee

Location: Unknown

"Today's alarming incident at Hanford elevates the urgency of the federal government to prioritize and fund all critical cleanup at this aging nuclear reservation. We are not aware of any nuclear waste leaking outside the AZ-101 double-shelled tank, but we expect the U.S. Department of Energy to immediately investigate and report on the source of contamination.
"This comes on the heels of last week's tunnel collapse. It is another urgent reminder that Congress needs to act, and they need to act quickly."
Yesterday, Inslee and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown sent a request to President Donald Trump for additional cleanup funding. You can view the full text of the letter here: http://governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017_05_18_WA-OR_Hanford.pdf
