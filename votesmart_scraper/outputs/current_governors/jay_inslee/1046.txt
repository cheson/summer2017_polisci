REAL SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - April 06, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Thank you. And I have a simple message. We Democrats want to strike a preemptive blow against our enemies in the Middle East. And the single, most effective preemptive blow we have is to starve them from resources with which to attack us. We know where
the money came from to finance the attack on September 11. It came from our addiction to oil that must stop.
And we now have a President who said he wants to break our addiction to oil, and we welcome his language about this. But we cannot run our cars on rhetoric. We cannot run a national energy independence program on rhetoric. We need real policies. And we are offering them. We have offered to the country the New Apollo Energy Act, H.R. 2828. That is H.R. 2828. If folks want to look at it, they are welcome to see the most comprehensive plan that will really deliver a situation where we send less money to Middle Eastern sheiks and more money to middle-American farmers. That is a policy that we will embrace, and we will be more secure than we are today.
I thank you for letting me have my few words today.
