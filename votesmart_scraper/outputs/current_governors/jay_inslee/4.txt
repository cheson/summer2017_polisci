"A substantial number of people will still be protected as a result of the stay as the Supreme Court's actions essentially narrowed the travel ban order. But we know that President Trump has made it clear that his travel ban and refugee policies were never intended to be about thoughtful national security, but instead a way of discriminating against certain people for their cultures and religious beliefs.
"As the high court considers these cases in full, I hope they will consider the president's own words, and our nation's constitutional protections against discrimination."
