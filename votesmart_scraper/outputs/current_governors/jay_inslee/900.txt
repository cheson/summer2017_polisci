FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, from time to time, we are called to, again, define what it means to be an American. And this is never more so than when security concerns threaten our commitment to liberty. And at those moments, at this moment, we need to be imbued with the spirit of 1776, a spirit against tyranny, a spirit that recognizes that the rule of law is the ultimate bulwark of liberty.
A Nation that threw off the shackles of King George should never yield to an executive who seeks to trample on the rule of law. Whether it was inconvenient, whether it was bothersome, whether it was frustrating, we should never yield to an executive who believes himself above the rule of law. We should never yield to an Executive that, instead of coming to Congress to change a law, simply decides to ignore it.
We are nothing without this commitment. We are everything with it. Stand for liberty. Pass this bill.
