Public Statements
Optimism About Clean Energy
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Dec. 10, 2009
Location: Washington, D.C.

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I hear that the former Vice President has made an assertion about the Governor who quit in Alaska, Sarah Palin. He asserted that hers is the attitude of a denier, a denier of the clear need to address global warming. But that attitude is worse than being a denier.
It is the attitude of a defeatist, because the defeatists believe that we Americans can't build electric cars. The defeatists believe we can't, in America, build solar thermal plants. The defeatists believe we can't build offshore wind turbine plants. The defeatists believe that we can't build thousands of jobs here in America, rather than allow those jobs in clean energy to go to China.
When those people like Sarah Palin, who have the attitude of defeatists, join us in a sense of optimism that we can change our economy to a green collar economy, we will build a clean energy economy that is the envy of the world. And we urge them to join us.
