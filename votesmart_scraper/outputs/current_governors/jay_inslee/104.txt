Inslee Issues State Directive For LGBTQ Inclusion And Safe Places Initiative
Press Release

Gov. Jay Inslee today issued a directive launching a Safe Place WA initiative to promote LGBTQ inclusion practices and policies throughout state government.
"We traditionally celebrate June as LGBTQ Pride Month. I believe that as public leaders and servants, though, our commitment to diversity and inclusion extends beyond a single month of recognition," reads the directive. "Every person in the state of Washington has the right to feel safe, enjoy the benefits of public services and fully participate in civic life."
Inslee's directive establishes a Safe Place WA program and a state employee resource group to develop and share best practices for creating safe and inclusive environments in state government offices, for both employees and the customers they serve.
Safe Place WA was inspired by the program launched last year by the Seattle Police Department which engages local businesses and organizations in providing safe environments for members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning/queer community to request and wait for police assistance. Safe Place WA will work to ensure public-facing state offices are recognized as safe and inclusive places for LGBTQ Washingtonians.
