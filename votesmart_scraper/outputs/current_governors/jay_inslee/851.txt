MR. HEMMER: Breaking news now from Capitol Hill -- we shared it with you 30 minutes ago -- a gang of 10 senators unveiling a compromise bill on energy. This as Congress is set to adjourn for its August break. And as Congress leaves, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline, unleaded, just below $3.90 a gallon, $3.89.
Florida Congressman Adam Putnam is here, House Republican Conference chairman; and Congressman Jay Inslee, Democrat of Washington, who's on the House Energy Committee. And gentlemen, welcome.
To you, Congressman Putnam, we've got some details now that include targeted production of domestic energy resources. Can you define that according to the Senate version?
REP. PUTNAM: Well, you know, this is breaking news, but it proves that there is overwhelming bipartisan support for an all-of- the-above strategy that includes conservation, includes renewables and includes more domestic production. But you -- you just can't get past the fact that Congress is about to go home for five weeks without having dealt with this problem, and that's the reason why Congress' approval ratings at are 9 percent.
MR. HEMMER: In a word, based on what you know from what the senators are proposing, this group of 10, would you vote for it?
REP. PUTNAM: Well, yeah. If it increases production in the United States, puts an emphasis on renewables, opens up areas that are currently closed off for exploring for oil and gas, absolutely. We need to move forward on all fronts.
MR. HEMMER: So you're on board.
