Boeing and the Washington state aerospace industry
The aerospace industry is a critical part of Washington state's economy. Jay has been working in Congress to make sure that this sector continues to be an important source of employment for families in the Pacific Northwest. Of note, he has lobbied for Washington state to be the assembly location for the new 7E7 airplane and fought the illegal subsidies that European governments provide to Airbus. He also has advocated for health care, workforce and tax policies that benefit Boeing workers and their families.
