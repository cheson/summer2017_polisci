Press Release

"My thoughts and prayers are with Wenatchee this morning. Yet again, our state is experiencing a catastrophic wildfire that has displaced families and shut down businesses, as well as risked the lives of our firefighters and emergency personnel. I'm having ongoing conversations with our state emergency management officials, and urge people in the impacted area to follow the advice of emergency personnel.
"We recognized early that this summer would bring with it another unprecedented fire season. That's why last week we proactively declared a state of emergency and statewide burn ban to last through the summer. This allows state agencies to use resources necessary to respond to the fires and assist those who have been affected.
"I urge everyone to do their part and avoid activities that could potentially start additional wildfires, including the use of fireworks."
