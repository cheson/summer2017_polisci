Inslee on the Veto of Children's Health Care Legislation
U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), who serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the State Children's Insurance Plan (SCHIP), made the following statement in response to the president's Wednesday morning veto of legislation that would increase funding for the popular health-care program for kids:
"After the administration's trail of decisions that have shown disregard for people in need, this veto was disappointing but not shocking," said Inslee.
"This president has underfunded health care to veterans who now are in working families, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that he would deny health care to children of working families as well. Either way, he is wrong."
Inslee championed and helped secure in the final legislation a key provision that would allow Washington and 10 other states to use 100 percent of federal funds under SCHIP to cover kids just above the poverty level; until now, these states were limited to just 20 percent of those funds. If enacted, it would mean an additional $40 million in federal funds next year alone for Washington state to provide health care for low-income children.
