Gov. Jay Inslee today called for a moment of silence tomorrow, March 29, at 10:37 am to honor SR 530 slide victims, those still missing and the many grieving families in the Stillaguamish Valley.
The devastating mudslide occurred last Saturday morning in the community of Oso, crossing the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River at about 10:37am.
The governor encourages all Washingtonians to join him in this moment of silence as a show of respect for those who have died and a gesture of comfort for those who grieve.
"I know that every Washingtonian holds in their heart the people of the Stillaguamish Valley and we all wish we could ease their pain," the governor said. "Tomorrow morning, we can all join together and silently send our thoughts and prayers to the families of Oso, Darrington and Arlington."
