"I'm glad to see the Senate act on transportation today. I've been pushing for a transportation investment package since my first day in office. Today's vote is solid progress and it begins the next round of negotiations. I want to thank the Senate Democrats who led the push for a clean bill. I still have concerns about strings attached to the Senate proposal that would divert funding for schools, local government and toxic clean-up and would impact Washington's ability to measurably reduce carbon emissions. As I've said before, we must move forward on transportation, education and carbon reduction this year and I look forward to working with legislators to get all three done."
