We Need Reform
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, the keepers of the status quo on health care are simply wrong. It is unacceptable for Americans to have their wage increases swallowed up by health care costs.
Our medical costs are rising three times faster than our wages. It consumes twice as much of our economy as it did just 12 years ago. The status quo is unacceptable.
Now some of my colleagues want to defend the status quo, trying to scare Americans to think that we're going to deliver bad medical care. Let me ask them this: Is the medical care at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, so bad? I don't think so.
Our bill, basically--and we are improving this bill as we speak--is going to provide the kind of care that Americans are getting at the Mayo Clinic. Because when our bill passes, it will in fact allow and inspire doctors to do what they do at the Mayo Clinic for half the price that Americans are paying for their medical care in Miami, Florida. Half the price at the Mayo Clinic for what Americans pay in medical care.
We need reform. We're going to pass it.
