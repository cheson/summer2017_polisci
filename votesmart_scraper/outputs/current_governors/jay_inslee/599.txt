Inslee Votes to Avert Economic Disaster
Statement

Location: Washington, DC

Today, Rep. Jay Inslee (WA-01) voted on the House floor in favor of the compromise proposal to end the threat of a government default crisis. Following the vote Rep. Inslee released this statement:
"My primary objective in Congress is to get our economy back on track and create jobs. Tonight I voted to avert an economic disaster.
"Unfortunately, this is a terrible and unbalanced proposal that doesn't meet the expectations the American people have for solutions to our debt problem. However, when it became clear that we could protect Medicare, social security and education while raising the debt ceiling to avoid possibly disastrous economic consequences, the right decision was to move forward.
"Our short-term economic crisis and long-term debt problem could be better addressed by bringing people together in an honest and transparent debate about how best to marry our principles with economic reality. That is why I have advocated for a balanced approach as our best option and why I voted against extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.
"From this point forward we must turn our attention toward growing the economy and creating jobs to put our fiscal house in order. I will continue to work across the aisle to accomplish this goal."
