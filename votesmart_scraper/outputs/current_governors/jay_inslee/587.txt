Inslee Calls Planned Parenthood Investigation a "Witch Hunt"
Statement
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Sept. 29, 2011
Location: Washington, DC

This week, Republican Chairman Cliff Stearns of the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee opened a far reaching inquiry into Planned Parenthood, asking in a letter for documents and financial records. Rep. Jay Inslee (WA-01), a member of the Energy and Commerce committee released the following statement in response:
"I am deeply disappointed by some of my Republican colleagues in Congress who are using their oversight powers to conduct a witch hunt against the constitutionally protected health care rights of women. Nonetheless it is extremely troubling that they have chosen to open this inquiry."
"At a time when poverty rates among women are highest than they have been for two decades, women are benefiting from the critical health services provided by Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood supplies life saving health care services including health exams, pre-natal care, and cancer screenings to more than 5 million people every year. In addition they provide much needed contraceptive services, immunizations and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment."
"What many don't know is that Planned Parenthood and their 83 affiliates already regularly undergo regular audits through Medicaid. I would suggest a far better use of the Energy and Commerce Oversight Committee's time would be investigating criminal action on Wall Street or ways to grow our economy and create jobs."
