"This week the U.S. Senate will consider the bipartisan Marketplace Fairness Act, which would provide a level playing field for Washington's small businesses to compete in the marketplace. The growth of e-commerce has been and will continue to be a boon for our state's high-tech economy. However, internet sellers should not have an unfair advantage over brick-and-mortar retail shops, which are mostly small businesses. This legislation would correct this current imbalance, and in doing so will empower our state and local governments to collect the revenues that they are owed to support education, health care, public safety, and other vital services.
"Marketplace Fairness has long been supported by a diverse coalition of businesses and organizations across Washington state, and is a top priority for the National Governors Association. I appreciate the hard work of the bill's sponsors, Senators Durbin, Enzi, and Alexander, and the support of the White House and the 74 senators who have voted to proceed with consideration. I urge the Senate to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act this week and the U.S. House to follow suit as quickly as possible."
