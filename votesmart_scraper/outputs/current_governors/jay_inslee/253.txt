Gov. Jay Inslee told legislative leaders today that he will call them into special session on Wednesday, April 29, to complete major work that will be left undone when the regular session ends this week. Inslee will invite budget negotiators to meet in his office Monday morning to give negotiators a head start before the special session begins.
"Before the Legislature convened in January, I said we must fund education through a sustainable and responsible budget, approve a transportation improvement package and make progress on fighting carbon pollution," Inslee said. "That work remains undone. A special session will allow lawmakers to focus on these priorities and I expect the work to be done within the 30-day session."
Inslee informed House and Senate leadership of his decision today. Tomorrow, the governor will issue the formal proclamation calling the session.
"It is time for all sides to compromise, and on Monday I hope to hear openness to that and acknowledgement that the House and Senate will have to move toward each other in order to get the people's work done."
The operating budget, including an education funding plan that addresses the McCleary decision, is the top priority for the special session. There are court deadlines looming and school districts will soon begin planning for the next school year.
Inslee will also ask lawmakers to finish work on a transportation improvement package, a capital construction budget and critical policy legislation.
