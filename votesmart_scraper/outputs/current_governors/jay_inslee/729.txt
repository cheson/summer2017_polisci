Government Must Enforce Pollution Laws

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, this morning the Sustainable Energy and Environment Caucus had a meeting with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson, and she told us something that I thought was encouraging, which is that the United States Federal Government has insisted that British Petroleum drill a second relief well to make sure that we've got a relief well that can ultimately stop this horrific spill in the gulf coast.
And it's encouraging because the Federal Government has to be the ultimate decider to make sure this job gets done. BP only wanted to do one well, but the President and his administration insisted that they do two wells to make sure that we get one that works.
But there's a disturbing effort now going on in the U.S. Senate to deprive the EPA of the ability to clean up the industry that is now putting pollution in the air as well. We've got to preserve the Federal Government's ability to enforce our air pollution and clean water laws. The American people deserve that. We ought to stand strong to have a sheriff in charge of this operation.
