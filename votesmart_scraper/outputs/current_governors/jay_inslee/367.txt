"We firmly support Sen. Murray's efforts to protect women's health and the integrity of the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act to end discrimination in health insurance.
"Sen. Murray is leading the national effort to restore women's access to contraceptive coverage with her bill, Protect Women's Health from Corporate Interference Act (S. 2578).
"Ending health insurance discrimination against women is a key principle of the Affordable Care Act. Allowing employers to deny contraceptive coverage to women goes against the protections we fought for. Forcing women to foot the bill for their own contraception is also an economic issue -- especially women working hourly jobs trying to make ends meet.
"The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a serious blow to women's reproductive rights when it ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby last month. The Affordable Care Act guaranteed that women have access to contraceptive coverage, but the Court ruled that a corporation's religious freedom trumped a woman's right to access this basic preventive benefit. We support Sen. Murray's efforts to right this wrong for women and will support her in any way we can."
