MILITARY COMMISSIONS ACT OF 2006 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we ought to hold this truth to be self-evident, that no President should be given the ability to hold people in detention indefinitely without review by the judicial branch.
We should never yield to al Qaeda, not one inch, not one right, not one American principle; but, today, in this bill, we yield a fundamental American principle, the principle that no executive, no President, should have the untrammeled ability to be free of checks and balances that have kept our country so free in the last 230 years. That principle of writ of habeas corpus has been fundamental, and it is destroyed in this bill.
When we learn that George Bush's policy has kept a man in detention for years who was totally innocent without trial, it was not just he who suffered. It was we who had a wound as well.
We do not care about the terrorists' displeasure here, but we do care about the principled integrity of our country, about the light of liberty that so attracts the world. It is that light that will help us win the war on terrorism, not just the light of our bombs. This is the principal weapon in our arsenal. It is the light of liberty, may it ever shine.
Reject this bill. Go back to the drawing board.
