Gov. Jay Inslee today responded to the news of today's climate agreement signed by 196 nations in Paris saying it means the world has "pushed the go button on the fight against climate change." The governor was one of three U.S. governors who attended COP21 to participate in several events and meetings emphasizing the importance of action at the sub-national level.
"This Paris agreement is a big deal. It's a big deal for the world. It's a big deal for the state of Washington. This means that the world has pushed the 'go button' on the fight against climate change. And it means we in the state of Washington, and our grandkids, have a shot at what they deserve which is trees in the forest, snow in the mountains and water in the rivers.
"And we ought to be proud of our state. We're leading with the pacific coast with California, Oregon and British Columbia in the fight against climate change. And we know we can build a clean energy economy.
"So this is something that we ought to be proud of. We're leaders in the state of Washington. We're now going to lead the fight against climate change and now we know we've got partners.
"Good day for the world. Good day for the state of Washington.
