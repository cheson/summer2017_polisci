Pelosi, Hoyer and 83 House Democrats Ask FCC to Investigate Broadcasting of Anti-Kerry Film
WASHINGTON, D.C. - The House Democratic Leadership, including Leader Nancy Pelosi, Whip Steny Hoyer, Caucus Chairman Bob Menendez, and Vice Chairman James E. Clyburn, and 81 members of the House Democratic Caucus wrote a letter to today to writing to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell to request an FCC investigation into Sinclair Broadcasting Inc.'s decision to pre-empt regular programming on its 62 affiliates across the country in order to air a 90-minute anti-Kerry attack before the November 2nd election:
"The American public, which owns the airwaves that Sinclair would use for its partisan political purposes, expects the FCC to uphold the basic principle of fairness which is at the root of our democracy. If Sinclair Broadcasting is allowed to proceed with this broadcast it is difficult to understand how equal time policies will not have been violated," wrote the 85 members of Congress.
Below are the full text of the letter and a list of signatories.

The Honorable Michael Powell
Chairman
Federal Communications Commission
445 12th Street, S.W.
Room 8-A204A
Washington, DC 20554

Dear Chairman Powell:
