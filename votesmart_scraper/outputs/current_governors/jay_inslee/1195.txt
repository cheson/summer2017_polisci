TRIBUTE TO SHIRLEY RECTOR-HON. JAY INSLEE (Extensions of Remarks - March 11, 2004)
HON. JAY INSLEE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 10, 2004
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sorrow that I rise on the House floor to mourn the passing of one of my past colleagues and personal friends. Although we all feel great loss with her passing and it is difficult to express grief for her family and all those who knew her, I would like to offer this tribute as a celebration of her many accomplishments.
Representative Shirley J. Rector was a woman of spirit and principle. As one of the first women to work at Kaiser Aluminum, she took the bull by the horns and was elected as Steelworkers Union Local 338 legislative education chair and recording secretary. Even at that time, her dedication to making the world a better place was clear.
Shirley was committed to public service. She was vice chair of the Democratic Central Committee. I am honored to have been her colleague when she served as a member of the State of Washington House of Representatives where she was instrumental in passing legislation for both the Shared and Family Leave Acts. She was also on the SIRTI Higher Education Board and was co-founder of the Women Helping Women Fund. No one who was there will ever forget her speech which electrified the House concerning family and medical care.
I am humbled by these accomplishments and I am assured that her legacy of strong involvement in government and community has touched the lives of many.
END
