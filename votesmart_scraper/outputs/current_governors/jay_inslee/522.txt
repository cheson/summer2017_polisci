Governor Jay Inslee today announced his appointments to head the departments of Transportation, Revenue and Financial Institutions as well as his choice of a new General Counsel.
Inslee appointed Lynn Peterson to serve as Secretary of the Washington State Department of Transportation. Peterson, a former highway engineer, currently serves as the Sustainable Communities and Transportation Advisor to Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber.
"We need an innovative approach to fixing a transportation network that is outdated and hampering our economic growth," said Inslee. "Lynn has the experience, creativity and leadership skills to help Washington build a transportation system for the 21st century. And we'll do that in a way that more efficiently moves people and goods and reduces carbon emissions."
Peterson helped manage several of Oregon's statewide transportation initiatives including the Willamette Valley Passenger Rail Plan, Kitzhaber's 10-year Energy Action Plan including Oregon's portion of the Electric Highway from B.C. to Baja and acceleration of commercial fleet turnover to alternative fuels, and more.
"I am honored to have served Governor Kitzhaber and the citizens of Oregon," said Peterson. "Together, we have made significant progress leveraging more investment for Oregon communities to meet their economic, social and environmental goals with less revenue. These values hold true for all citizens in the Northwest. I am pleased to be joining Governor Inslee's Cabinet to help meet his desire to efficiently and cost-effectively build safe and healthy communities everywhere in the State of Washington."
Paula Hammond, the current Secretary of WSDOT, is retiring after nearly six years as head of the department.
