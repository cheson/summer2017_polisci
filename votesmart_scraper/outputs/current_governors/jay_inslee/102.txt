Gov. Jay Inslee today released a statement in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down parts of a Texas law that would curtail access to abortion.
"The Supreme Court today affirmed the right of every woman in America to make her own decisions about her health and her body, and to be able to obtain the health services that she and her family need. This is a historic day and an important step forward for our nation.
"A woman's right to choose has been under attack across the nation, with relentless attempts to limit access, provide misinformation and harass and intimidate. Today's ruling affirms 40 years of reproductive freedom in place, and will help ensure that women in Texas, and all other states, will have access to a full range of reproductive health services.
"Unfortunately, many politicians will continue in their quest to take these health decisions away from women. I am wholeheartedly committed to the continued fight to protect Washington women's right to choose, expand access to reproductive care and family planning services and defeat ideologically driven attempts to block that access.
"I applaud this decision and will work to ensure that the right of women to choose remains strong in the state of Washington. Our work is far from over, but today is a day to be celebrated."
