"Trudi and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Chinook Nation and all Ray's friends and family.
"Ray was dedicated to preserving and commemorating the tribe's rich past while advocating for a more just future. He served as Tribal Chairman for 13 years and has been one of the tribe's most prominent leaders in efforts to gain federal recognition for the Chinook Nation. His leadership on the successful Middle Village-Station Camp project is just one example of his ability to bring people together and promote the story and culture of the Chinook Nation.
"Ray's legacy will live on in the work of the many Chinook Nation men and women who have been inspired by him and carry on his work today."
