TRIBUTE TO BOB MAIER-HON. JAY INSLEE (Extensions of Remarks - March 11, 2004)
HON. JAY INSLEE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 10, 2004
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I pay tribute today to a dedicated veteran, father, teacher, advocate, musician, and athlete. His leadership and courage touched many lives, including my own, and it is my great honor to recognize and commemorate this extraordinary man.
Robert B. Maier, was a model American citizen. He served in the U.S. Navy after graduating high school. Later, he taught American Studies and English at Mercer Island High School. A staunch advocate for public school and school employees, Bob worked in Washington State Capitol for 20 years. At the time of his death, he was chief lobbyist and director of public policy for the Washington Education Association.
Beyond these accomplishments, one of the most important things about Bob was his enthusiasm for life. Anyone could see it in the way he was always learning new things. He loved to play basketball and music. He read books and solved cross-word puzzles. He took leadership roles in his community. He was a contributor.
Bob's achievements and accomplishments speak to his tremendous love and respect for his community, friends, and family. I know he will be remembered by all those he touched. Our children are receiving a better education because of his long effort, for which we are deeply grateful.
