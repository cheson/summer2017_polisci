"Today's strong bipartisan vote in the state House of Representatives demonstrates the commitment of legislators to work together towards meeting the state's obligation to fully fund our schools. The legislative work group I convened last year worked hard to find common ground on this plan, and I thank its members for their continued efforts to gain bipartisan support. I look forward to seeing the Senate follow the House's lead and take action as soon as possible.
"We still have much work to do for our schoolchildren and their teachers. Today's vote keeps us moving in the right direction."
