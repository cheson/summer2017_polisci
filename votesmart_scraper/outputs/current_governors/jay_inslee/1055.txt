Cantwell, Larsen Lead Effort to Enhance Security Without Slowing Legitimate U.S.-Canada Commerce and Travel
Planned restrictions could hurt tourism, businesses, border communities; delegation pushes for extended deadline, greater flexibility
Wednesday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined Congressman Rick Larsen (D-WA) and the rest of Washington state's Congressional delegation to warn against potential restrictions of the proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative on legitimate travel and commerce between the United States and Canada. The Bush Administration plans to require American and Canadian citizens to present a passport or other secure identification before crossing into the United States.
"These restrictions could cut off border communities, slow tourism, and deliver a damaging blow to our economy," said Cantwell. "With the 2010 Winter Olympics coming to Vancouver, we can't bring our border to a standstill. Our economy depends on trade, tourism, and a border open to legitimate travel. National security is our top priority, but the administration must take the needs of our economy into account when it comes to new travel restrictions."
"As co-chair of Washington state's 2010 Olympics Task Force, my goal is to ensure a safe and secure border that facilitates the free flow of travel and commerce," Larsen said. "These travel restrictions could create a logistical nightmare for Washington state and slow the economic benefits we hope to gain from the 2010 Olympics."
In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Cantwell and Larsen cautioned that tightening the border without careful consideration could cause significant harm to Washington state commerce and border communities, and significantly impede travel between the U.S. and Canada during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, B.C.
To minimize the restrictions' impact, Cantwell and Larsen requested the implementation date for air and sea travel be pushed back one year, and called for secure but affordable alternative forms of identification. They also emphasized the importance of enhancing national security while ensuring a smooth transition to new restrictions for cross-border travel, and called for local public forums on proposed policy changes. The planned restrictions under WHTI would apply to Americans, Canadians, and citizens and residents of certain other Western Hemisphere countries.
[The text of the letter to Secretaries Rice and Chertoff follows below]
January 25, 2006
The Honorable Condoleezza Rice
Secretary
U.S. Department of State
Washington, DC 20520
The Honorable Michael Chertoff
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Rice and Secretary Chertoff,
As members of the Washington state Congressional Delegation, we are writing to express our concerns regarding implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) and the solutions proposed in the "Joint Vision" introduced on January 17, 2006. While we recognize that fraudulent documents and identify verification remain serious security concerns and we appreciate the commitment from both of your Departments to addressing these critical vulnerabilities, the WHTI has the potential to severely impact communities along the Northern Border by impeding legitimate cross border commerce and travel between the United States and Canada. Additionally, we are concerned that these proposals will leave Washington state ill equipped to manage increased border needs created by the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver B.C.
On December 17, 2004, President Bush signed into law the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA). As you know, section 7209 of IRTPA directs the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to work with the State Department (State) to develop and implement specific new travel regulations by 2008. This new "Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative" would require United States citizens and persons residing in specific countries within the Western Hemisphere to provide passports or other identification "sufficient to denote identity and citizenship" when traveling into the U.S. International travel by air between Canada and the U.S. has long required a passport. But travel by land and sea has traditionally required only identification in the form of a state-issued driver's license. Washington state has the largest ferry system in the nation as well as a robust tourism industry that has historically depended on fluid cross border travel. The WHTI's implementation phase must consider the adverse economic impact of new passport regulations and allow adequate time for travelers to be notified and acquire additional documentation if necessary. Extending the air and sea travel deadline by one year and applying a December 31, 2007 date for new document requirements for all travel-land, sea, and air-would still meet the IRTPA's directives while providing more time for travelers to learn of, and comply with, new regulations. It is also important to carefully consider alternative forms of identification that may serve as an acceptable alternative to a passport under the WHTI. We were encouraged by the announcement on January 17, that a new People Access Security Service (PASS) card will be established for land border crossings. However, we are concerned that this new card will not adequately meet the needs of the Northern Border as it may still be cost prohibitive for many families. Furthermore, we are concerned this proposal may not meet the needs of the Washington state tourism industry. For these reasons, we request that you provide us with more detailed information on how the PASS card proposal will address our concerns and continue to look at other possible solutions.
Also, we are uniquely concerned with the effects on commerce and travel that this proposal may have for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Vancouver B.C. We ask that you establish a feasible date for implementation of WHTI across all modes of transportation. We further request that your departments host a series of forums in Washington state so that the concerns of our constituents, as they relate to WHTI, may be heard. An effective policy that enhances security at our borders without unduly hindering cross-border travel and commerce is of vital importance. It is critical that we consider the concerns and perspective of Washington residents and businesses in this analysis.
Sincerely,
Maria Cantwell
