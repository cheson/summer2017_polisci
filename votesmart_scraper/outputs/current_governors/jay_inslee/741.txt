Public Statements
An Injustice To American Workers And Taxpayers
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee
Date: April 21, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to speak against a significant injustice to both American workers and the American taxpayer, and that is the decision by the Air Force to extend the deadline for offering bids for the Air Force's new imperative tanker, which has allowed an illegally subsidized competitor, the EADS Company, which has now taken advantage of that, to the disadvantage of American workers and the disadvantage of American taxpayers. It is inconceivable to me that we have extended this deadline to allow a competitor to offer a bid that will be illegally subsidized by European governments.
If this travesty is allowed to happen, we could lose thousands of jobs. The taxpayers would have been suffering seeing these illegal subsidies, and a great injustice will have been perpetrated.
This cannot stand. We should continue to fight this grave injustice.
