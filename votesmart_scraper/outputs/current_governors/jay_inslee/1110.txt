ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005 -- (House of Representatives - April 20, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Chairman, the best way that I can characterize this bill is that it is a Jurassic Park bill in that it is about dinosaurs, of dinosaurs, and in a sense by dinosaurs.
It depends on the hope that somehow dead dinosaurs will appear underneath the continent of the United States where they just do not exist. We consume 25 percent of the oil; we have only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. If you drill in Mt. Ranier National Park, the Arctic and Yosemite, the oil is not there; the dead dinosaurs decided to die somewhere else.
This is a doomed policy of searching for dead dinosaurs. And it is a dinosaur-like philosophy that we should decide to subsidize technology being developed in the late 1800s in 2005. We should be giving these subsidies to the nascent wind, solar, wave power, energy-efficient cars so we can build energy-efficient cars here rather than in Japan.
You do not give mother's milk to a 65-year-old person; you give it to the nascent infant industries that need it. That is not what happened to this bill, where 94 percent of the subsidy goes to an industry, the most profitable in American history; one company had $8 billion profit in the third quarter last year on your $55 a barrel oil.
That is what is going on in this bill. What we should be doing is hearing lessons from our successful past, where we showed where we increase the efficiency of our cars; that is an energy future. We need the new Apollo energy plan, a visionary high-tech plan, not a dinosaur-like plan.
