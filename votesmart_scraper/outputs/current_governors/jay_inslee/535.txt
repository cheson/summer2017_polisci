Speaking at a meeting of his Transition Committee this morning, Governor-Elect Jay Inslee named David Schumacher as Director of Washington's Office of Financial management. Schumacher will serve as the Governor's chief advisor on budget and fiscal issues.

"The Governor-Elect has given me clear direction to look for real, long-term solutions as we balance the budget and make state government more efficient."
Schumacher holds a Bachelor's Degree and Master's Degree in economics from the University of Washington. He has worked as an Economic Analyst at the Department of Revenue, Policy Analyst at OFM, and was a Ways and Means Committee staffer for eight years before being named Staff Director.
Schumacher's appointment is effective January 16th, 2013.
