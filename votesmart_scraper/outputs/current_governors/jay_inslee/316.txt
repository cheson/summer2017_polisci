"Drowsy Driving Prevention Week is an opportunity to learn about the hazards associated with driving while not fully alert. Like alcohol and marijuana, sleep loss or fatigue can impair driving skills and reaction time, creating dangerous and even deadly conditions. Traffic crashes are a leading cause of death of young people in Washington and tragically drowsy driving claims many lives and injures thousands each year. This week is an occasion to remember to talk to our children, families and communities about the dangers of driving while tired."
