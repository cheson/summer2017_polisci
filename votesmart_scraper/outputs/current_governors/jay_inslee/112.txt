Inslee Statement Regarding Announced Agreement Between State and Tribal Salmon Fisheries
Press Release
By: Jay Inslee
Date: May 26, 2016
Location: Olympia, WA

The State Department of Fish & Wildlife and tribal leaders today announced they've reached an agreement on a Puget Sound salmon fishery plan to be submitted for approval to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. The agreement ends a months-long stalemate that could have led to suspension of the 2016-17 salmon fishing season. NOAA must still approve the plan and release permits, but Gov. Jay Inslee says the agreement is welcome news.
"I applaud our state and tribal fisheries leaders for reaching an agreement that protects salmon and gives everyone the chance to benefit from our tremendous salmon resources. These fisheries are important to all Washingtonians, and the salmon and our citizens are best served when tribal and non-tribal negotiators sustainably co-manage this valuable natural resource.
