GLOBAL WARMING -- (House of Representatives - September 30, 2004)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, there are two very significant things which happened today regarding global warming. The first is that the U.S. Department of Commerce's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey, announced that they had completed the largest computer simulation of what will happen in global warming and how it will affect hurricanes. They concluded that the seas being warmed by rising atmospheric concentration of gases will result in a typical hurricane intensity increasing about an extra half step on the five-step scale.
This is not good news, Mr. Speaker, particularly since our Nation, under this administration, is not doing anything significant to deal with global warming.
In contrast, interestingly, today, Russia and their parliament indicated that it is likely they will join the Kyoto Protocol to deal with global warming. This is a difficulty for our businesses if this becomes a worldwide regime and we are not part of the international effort.
We hope tonight there will be some discussion of this. And if not, one way or another, this November, Americans will vote for a president who will decide to take some action on global warming.
