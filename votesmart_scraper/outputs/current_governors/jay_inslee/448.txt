"This week we have a chance to stop and reflect on the dangers of drowsy driving. Driving while tired can be dangerous and sometimes deadly. Every year, drowsy driving crashes result in more than 1,000 deaths and 71,000 injuries. This week is an opportunity to let our young drivers, their parents and other Washingtonians know how they can stay safe on the road and remind all of us to think twice before getting behind the wheel while tired."
