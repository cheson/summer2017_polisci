Gov. Jay Inslee released a statement today on the ruling by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that overturned part of the federal district court ruling in the Trueblood case requiring the state to complete criminal defendants' evaluations to determine competency to stand trial within seven days of a court order.
"Overturning this requirement is good news for individuals, families and communities. While a commitment to act swiftly and get individuals high-quality care as soon as possible is vital, it must be done in ways that are clinically appropriate. However, evaluations must continue to be held in a timely manner. I am pleased the Ninth Circuit Court agreed to DSHS's request and overturned this portion of the Trueblood ruling."
