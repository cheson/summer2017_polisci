"I strongly oppose the Trump Administration's reversal of federal protection for transgender students. Washington state will continue to be a place where all children can feel safe from discrimination, harassment or assault based on their gender identity. Our state's law, the Anderson-Murray Act, passed in 2006, will remain in place and is unchanged by the new federal guidance. And just last year our state Human Rights Commission did important work to put rules in place that uphold the rights of our transgender students and residents. Our schools will protect transgender students and ensure they have access to the same facilities, classes, and the opportunities as other students.

"We will continue to stand together to protect some of our most vulnerable students - we know that these young people face high rates of bullying, harassment and even violence. We have a long way to go to make sure that all our students can learn safely and free from discrimination."
