Gov. Jay Inslee today approved $150,000 in economic recovery aid to help promote the Methow Valley and Okanogan County as a tourism and visitor location following the Carlton Complex Fire. The funds will supplement current tourism and marketing spending by businesses, cities, the county and Washington Tourism Alliance to let travelers and visitors know their businesses are open and tourists are welcome.
"From the Methow Valley and Okanogan National Forest to the Grand Coulee Dam, this region boasts beautiful landscape, diverse wilderness recreation activities, and historic towns," Gov Inslee said. "This aid package will help get Okanogan's robust economy back on its feet, as its residents begin the challenging task of rebuilding and recovering."
The state Department of Commerce requested the funding in direct response to the economic losses and infrastructure damage sustained by the region as a result of the Carlton Complex wildfire.
"Visiting the Methow Valley and Okanogan County with my family last weekend, I saw firsthand that the area is very much open for business. We join with local leaders in encouraging folks to come and take advantage of the beautiful late summer weather in this spectacular corner of our state -- it's a great way for anyone to help with their recovery effort," said Commerce Director Brian Bonlender.
The aid will fund marketing campaigns to promote travel to the region, recreational and camping opportunities, and upcoming local events such as the Pateros Hydro Races and Okanogan Family Faire.
