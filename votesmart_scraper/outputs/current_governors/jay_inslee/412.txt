"Trudi and I join all Washingtonians in sending condolences to the families who lost loved ones in today's tragic mudslide. We hope for the best for those injured and the many families displaced by the mudslide.
"The situation along the Stillaguamish River is extremely dangerous. Anyone along the flood plain of the Stillaguamish between Oso and Stanwood should leave the area before dark due to risk of catastrophic flooding. I urge everyone to follow guidance from local officials who are strongly encouraging evacuation to higher ground.
"The state Emergency Operations Center is activated in support of the emergency response efforts led by local law enforcement. The Washington State Patrol and the Washington Department of Transportation are assisting in emergency response and providing aerial surveys in support of search and rescue efforts and geological assessments."
