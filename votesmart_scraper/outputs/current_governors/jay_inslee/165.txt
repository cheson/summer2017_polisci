Members of the bipartisan work group convened by Gov. Jay Inslee last year have introduced legislation (House Bill 2366; Senate Bill 6195) that outlines the next steps for addressing K-12 funding reforms. The Legislature has been steadily increasing basic education funding over the past three years and is preparing to take on some of the most difficult aspects of funding reforms relating to local levies and compensation for educators.
The bicameral, bipartisan work group members were tasked by Inslee with developing a plan to fulfill the state's constitutional obligation to adequately fund basic education. Reps. Pat Sullivan (D-Covington), Kristine Lytton (D-Anacortes), Chad Magendanz (R-Issaquah) and Norma Smith (R-Clinton) met throughout the fall with Sens. Ann Rivers (R-La Center), Doug Ericksen (R-Ferndale), Christine Rolfes (D-Bainbridge Island), Andy Billig (D-Spokane) and the governor's office. At this time all but two of the work group members are signing on to the legislation.
"I am pleased to see that the bipartisan group I convened was able to find common ground and develop a good foundation for answering the very difficult questions related to our next steps for financing K-12 education," Inslee said. "I look forward to continuing to work with the Legislature this session and beyond on this important priority."
