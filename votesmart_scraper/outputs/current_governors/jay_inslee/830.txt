Saving Our Jobs -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2009)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, unfortunately, there are still obstructionists who are attempting to obstruct this bold plan to create jobs in this country of President Barack Obama, and you will hear a lot of smoke in the next 24 hours about that. I thought it was helpful to look at some objective assessment of this bill that was performed by Christina Romer, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, an economist in the office of the Vice President. This assessment has shown that this will create or save 3.5 million jobs for Americans in the next 2 years.
All across this country, and in the Second District of Texas it has been shown that 8,800 jobs will be saved. And people have said these are somehow make-work jobs? We on this side of the aisle don't think that teachers are make-work jobs, and their jobs are going to be preserved all across the country with this bill. We don't think firefighters are make-work jobs. We don't think that construction workers are make-work jobs. And 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector, Madam Speaker.
These are honest, paycheck-every-Friday jobs that are going to help to save this economy. I hope the obstructionists will realize these are saving jobs today and tomorrow and vote for this bill.
