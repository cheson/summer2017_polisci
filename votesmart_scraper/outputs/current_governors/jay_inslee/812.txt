U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) today applauded a new directive from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that protects vulnerable habitats in national forests while permanent protections for roadless areas are developed.
On March 18, 2009, Inslee led a bi-partisan letter to Secretary Vilsack, asking for the issuance of today's directive. The letter was supported by 120 other members of Congress. For several years, Inslee has led Congressional efforts to reinstate the Roadless Area Conservation Rule.
"I applaud the Department of Interior for their thoughtful action to shield roadless areas in national forests from development," said Inslee, a member of the House Natural Resources Committee and leading advocate for roadless areas. "Development decisions in roadless areas should require Secretary-level approval to go forward, until a larger comprehensive plan is in place. There are currently many unresolved issues, and we must not let development proceed in a haphazard fashion. This timeout will give the USDA time to carefully design proper criteria for development in roadless areas."
As announced by USDA Secretary Vilsack, the directive states that for one year, no road construction or removal of timber can take place without the Secretary's approval in the over 45 million acres of National Forests protected by the Roadless Area Conservation Rule.
"I thank the Forest Service for its careful management of these areas," said Inslee, "and I look forward to working with them in the future."
