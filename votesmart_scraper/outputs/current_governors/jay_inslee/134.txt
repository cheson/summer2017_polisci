Statement From Gov. Jay Inslee on Passage of Supplemental Operating Budget
Statement
By: Jay Inslee
Date: March 29, 2016
Location: Olympia, WA

"Legislators today concluded their most important order of business -- passing a supplemental budget that keeps our books balanced and our state agencies fully open for business to serve the people of Washington. I appreciate the work of Senate and House budget negotiators to reach a good compromise that legislators were able to support on a bipartisan basis. We'll have more work to do next year on education, mental health and teacher recruitment. But supplemental budgets are largely about modest adjustments and updates to the two-year budget, and that's exactly what legislators accomplished."
