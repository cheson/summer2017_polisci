Supplemental Appropriations, Fiscal Year 2009
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to just make a point that this program has been spectacularly successful from an environmental perspective. It was originally criticized that we did not call for high enough efficiency improvement in these cars. The people have fixed this problem for us. We are seeing average increases of efficiency of 60 percent--well, well above what was required by Congress.
For one car company, 78 percent of the cars that they're buying are over 30 miles a gallon and 39 percent above 30 miles per gallon. The American people have seen spectacular improvements in efficiency and in environmental performance.
I want to thank the Speaker and Mr. Obey for essentially assuring us--I'll take it as that, almost--that we, in fact, are going to replace this money. I hope it is in the CR. It is necessary to achieve our efficiency goals.
