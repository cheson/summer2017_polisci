9/11 RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 08, 2004)
(BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT)
Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I yield 50 seconds to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee).
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, well, I have some bad news. After this 3 miles is done, there is about another 4,000 miles unfortunately that remains at risk.
I would just ask Members to consider what we just did on this floor. We just extended the time a little bit to get this debate right, and I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in doing that.
Do we know why Americans have accepted the Endangered Species Act? Because they recognize you can take just a bit more time and do it right.
On October 26, when they have this meeting to get this resolved, we hope that is going to happen. We have built bridges, we have built highways, we built the most powerful military machine in world history with the Endangered Species Act. This is not endangering us. We should not go back to the days of ignoring this problem. Defeat this amendment.
