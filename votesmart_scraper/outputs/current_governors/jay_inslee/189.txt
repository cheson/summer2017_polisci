Gov. Jay Inslee and NFIB, the state's largest and leading small-business association, are teaming up to make every Washingtonian aware of this coming Saturday's march on Main Street.
The governor has declared November 28 Small Business Saturday in an official proclamation issued last week. NFIB, together with American Express, are joining together to help promote Washington state's mom-and-pop, Main Street enterprises.
"Small Business Saturday is a great way to put the nation's Main Street businesses front and center as we enter the holiday shopping season," Inslee said. "I'm calling on every Washingtonian to visit the shops lining every Main Street in our state, which are more than just businesses. The people who run them are our neighbors and for many, the people who give our sons and daughters their first start in their working life."
