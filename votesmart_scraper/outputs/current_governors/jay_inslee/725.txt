Letter to The Honorable John A. Boehner, Minority Leader
Letter
By: Rush Holt, Jr. Jay Inslee
Date: June 16, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

This morning Rep. Jay Inslee (WA-01) and Rep. Rush Holt (NJ-12) sent a letter to Minority Leader Boehner asking him to join them and lead his caucus to support the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act, legislation Holt introduced and Inslee is cosponsoring to hold BP legally liable for damages caused by the Gulf Spill and to ensure that in the future oil companies are responsible for cleanup and damages caused by oil spills. Last week, Boehner indicated that he supports taxpayers paying for cleanup and damage costs caused by the disaster. He since has walked back from those comments, but has not specified how he would ensure BP, and not taxpayers, is on the hook for all costs.
"Several straight-forward pieces of legislation have already been introduced to ensure that the responsible party in this and any other future incident is held to account for all of the damage done by such a disaster. One bill, the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act of 2010 (H.R. 5214) would increase the liability of a responsibility party for damages for incidents including the Deepwater/BP disaster from $75 million to $10 billion. Other legislative ideas have been discussed as well, such as allowing punitive damages to be recovered against a responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act, and requiring that responsible parties set aside funds for damage payments in an escrow account, and make other efforts to expedite the approval and payment of damage claims."
The full text of the Congressman's letter is below:
June 16, 2010
The Honorable John A. Boehner
Office of the Republican Leader
H-204 U.S. Capitol Building
Washington, DC 20515
