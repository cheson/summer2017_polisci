Protecting Your Privacy
Personal privacy is under attack more today than at any time in U.S. history. The ability for corporations and government to collect detailed personal information about individuals and store that information in searchable databases is a side effect of recent technological advances. It is vitally important that personal privacy is protected and control over personal information is left up to the individual.
