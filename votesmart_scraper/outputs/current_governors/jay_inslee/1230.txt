Economy
A nation is only as strong as the people who make it run. The job force is the engine that drives a strong economy. Nowhere is that more evident than in Washington State. We have a dedicated and ingenious workforce that has given the country an example to follow. Not too long ago, our region displayed incredible job security, growth, and ingenuity. Lately, however, our region has been hit terribly hard by the national economic downturn. The result has been the second highest unemployment rate in the nation and difficult times for many Washington State families.
The federal government has a responsibility to ensure that its policies encourage job growth and discourage the outsourcing of American jobs overseas. Nationwide, more jobs have been lost over the last four years than at any time since the presidency of Herbert Hoover. We need to push policies that support the American worker, not policies that severely undercut his or her ability to find a job that pays a living wage.
I understand and have long recognized the importance of organized labor as a bellwether of social progress. Benefits that many workers across the country take for granted today began as trade union initiatives. Programs such as Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and worker's compensation, among many others, all owe their origins to the efforts of trade unions. With many of these rights under attack, I will redouble my efforts to stop them from being undermined.
