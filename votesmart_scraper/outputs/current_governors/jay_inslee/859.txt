CHOICE AND FREEDOM IN OIL ADDICTION -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, slavery in this country did not end in the 1860s. It still exists because we all are still enslaved by oil. It is an addiction. George Bush himself said we are addicted to oil. But his answer is to increase the addiction, to go back to the dealer just for one more stick of the needle. That is not a long-term energy supply response to this crisis.
Americans need a choice of new energy supplies beyond oil, which is the only way to break this addiction, which is the only way to drive down price, which is the only way to have an alternative to oil.
I had in my office yesterday the Interdale Company, building one of the first lithium ion batteries, and the A123 Battery Company; they are going to provide the battery for the GM-VOLT. We have to provide freedom from this oil addiction by having a policy that gives Americans choice of new electric cars, new algae-based biofuels. That's a vision for choice and freedom in this country. That's what we should be doing. And we will be starting today.
