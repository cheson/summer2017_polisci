Gov. Jay Inslee late yesterday asked U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to designate Snohomish County in Washington as a farm disaster area due to weather-related losses to agricultural producers. The damage was the result of a landslide that occurred on March 22, covering an area of approximately one square mile with mud and debris.
"Nothing can replace the lives lost to this terrible landslide," Gov. Inslee said. "But I am requesting this disaster declaration so that the farmers and ranchers who have suffered financial losses are at least able to take advantage of low-interest loans to help recover economically."
The declaration could provide emergency low-interest loans and other disaster assistance from USDA's Farm Service Agency to cover production and farm property losses in Snohomish County, where the slide occurred, as well as contiguous counties.
Members of Washington's congressional delegation have urged the USDA to approve the request. Led by Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, a member of the House of Representatives Agriculture Committee, the five Snohomish County senators and representatives wrote to Secretary Vilsack yesterday urging approval.
While losses caused by the mudslide are still being assessed, the area is known for its hay crops, Christmas trees, and pasture land. Animal operations include dairies, sheep farms and other livestock.
