"Unfortunately, the people of Washington state do not yet have much-needed closure to Troy Kelley's ongoing legal battles. Like everyone else, we are waiting to see what the prosecutors do next. Regardless of the outcome in court today, serious questions remain about Troy Kelley's ability to successfully fulfill his role as state auditor.
"Jan Jutte and the auditor's staff have done a commendable job these past months in his absence. Washingtonians deserve a leader focused fully on overseeing the agency's important work."
