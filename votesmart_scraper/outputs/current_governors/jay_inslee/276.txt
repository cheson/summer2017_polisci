Gov. Jay Inslee released this statement about the agreement in principle reached Friday evening between the ILWU and the PMA.

"This is great news for businesses and port workers all along the West Coast. I want to thank the ILWU and the PMA for finding an agreement in principle tonight to settle the dispute that was damaging Washington's economy. I also want to thank President Obama and Labor Secretary Perez for stepping in and helping get the parties to reach an agreement. I expect we will soon see Washington's ports once again playing their essential role in our economy."
