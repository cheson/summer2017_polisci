Inslee Statement On U.S. Supreme Court Decision On Plan B Case
Statement
By: Jay Inslee
Date: June 28, 2016
Location: Olympia, WA

Gov. Jay Inslee today released a statement on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to not hear Stormans Inc. v. Wiesman, 15-862, which affirms pharmacists must dispense Plan B and other emergency contraceptives.
"The health care that a woman in Washington receives should come down to just two parties: the patient and her health care provider. Today's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirms that principle.
"The policy established in 2007 codifies the simple idea that pharmacies in our state need to fill a prescription, whether it's for emergency contraception, blood pressure, or allergy medications. An individual pharmacist with moral objections can still have another pharmacist fill the prescription at the store, but this decision means that those objections won't deny patients access to health care in Washington.
"Too many states in our country are working hard to take health care decisions away from women, and instead putting those decisions in the hands of politicians. I'm pleased to see the Court take another stand in favor of letting Washington women make their own health care decisions."
