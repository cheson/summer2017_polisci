Location: Olympia, WA

Gov. Jay Inslee today honored 20 state agency managers who have demonstrated outstanding leadership. The 2014 Governor's Award for Leadership in Management recipients were honored at an awards luncheon at the Executive Residence.
This year's recipients were recognized for a wide range of accomplishments, including work to cut duplicative processes, respond to natural disasters and save taxpayer dollars.
"I'm consistently proud of the good work I see throughout our state agencies, and these managers are outstanding examples of how people are implementing Lean, cultivating a culture of professionalism and achieving great results," Inslee said. "I appreciate all they do and thank them for serving the people and businesses of our state with such distinction."
The Leadership in Management program was created in 1985 to recognize state government managers who demonstrate excellent performance. A selection committee composed of agency directors and executive staff chose the winners based on demonstrated performance.
