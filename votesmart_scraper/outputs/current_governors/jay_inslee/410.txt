Gov. Jay Inslee Requests Expansion of Federal Emergency Declaration for Oso Mudslide Response

Gov. Jay Inslee today requested an expansion of the federal Emergency Declaration received earlier this week.
The expansion of the ED requested today by Inslee would help government agencies and non-profits recover the costs of emergency protective measures, emergency response, and debris removal related to the Oso landslide in Snohomish County. The current ED, received from the president on Monday, March 24, provided direct federal assistance in the form of disaster teams, specialized personnel and equipment.
"No words can describe the extensive damage and devastation the landslide caused in Oso and neighboring communities," said the governor. "The state is doing all it can to assess the damage and work with our partners to obtain additional federal assistance."
The governor's request to amend the limited Emergency Declaration was sent to President Obama this afternoon through the Federal Emergency Management Agency after a preliminary determination that local and state agencies are likely to expend at least $4.5 million on measures to protect property and public health and safety.
The governor asked the president to make available financial assistance to the State, and to eligible local jurisdictions and private non-profit organizations, to cover a portion of costs for emergency protective measures, emergency response, and debris removal. Federal reimbursement of eligible costs would be at 75 percent.
In addition, State and Snohomish County officials are assembling data and information needed for the governor to request a Major Disaster Declaration from the president. This request would be to make programs available to assist individuals, households and businesses impacted by the disaster. It is expected this request will be made in the next few days.
