BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
I am particularly appreciative of what a little physical activity can do for students in their academic pursuits. We are not talking about necessarily growing Olympic champions here. We're trying to get kids who are active to help their academic performance. My dad is an old PE teacher. I have seen up front and personal the benefit of getting kids active. And this is a very reasonable means to make sure parents have information of how active their children are because we intend, in a bipartisan way, to stop a bipartisan diabetes epidemic. This is a great bill; let's pass it.
