"Yesterday it was such an honor to join Spokane's inspiring celebration where they, as many communities across the country this weekend, were celebrating the progress we've made for our LGBTQ friends and family. It was an event marked by pride, love and joy.
"This morning we wake up to see this horrific tragedy in Orlando. We are all waiting to learn more about the motivations of this man but there is no doubt that today is one of unimaginable sorrow for the LGBTQ community, the people of Florida, for our nation and for people everywhere who are sickened and shocked by such an act of hatred.
"It's difficult to even find the right words in a time like this. Trudi and I, and every Washingtonian, send our deepest condolences to the people of Orlando and Florida."
