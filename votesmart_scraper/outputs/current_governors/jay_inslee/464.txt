"I want to send my sincere congratulations to The Boeing Company and the thousands of men and women who worked so hard to design and manufacture the 787-9. Today's successful first flight of this second-generation all-composite airplane, just two years after the delivery of the first Dreamliner, is a testament to the commitment of Boeing to continuously improve upon itself and exceed the needs of its customers through the power of innovation.
"The ability to transport as many as 290 passengers as far as 8500 nautical miles in extreme comfort, while burning 20 percent less fuel will assuredly be a game-changer -- significantly improving the passenger experience while dramatically reducing the impact of air travel on our environment. With 20 customers already on board from literally all corners of the planet, the 787-9 will expand the global reach and the global impact of The Boeing Company and the Washington aerospace industry. I am proud to say this 787-9 Dreamliner was built in Washington and I look forward to seeing many more of these beautiful airplanes take their maiden flights from our great state to their new homes around the world."
