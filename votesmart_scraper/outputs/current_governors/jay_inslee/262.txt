"I applaud today's decisive Open Internet decision by Chairman Wheeler and the Federal Communications Commission. The internet is far and away the greatest economic, social and civic tool of the modern age and by their vote, the FCC has recognized that all Americans must continue to get open and equitable treatment, free of discrimination. This is a big win for Washingtonians who create, innovate or communicate on the internet."
