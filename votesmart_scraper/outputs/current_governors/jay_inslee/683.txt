Inslee, House Approve Middle Class Tax Cuts
Press Release
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Dec. 2, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

Today, Rep. Jay Inslee (WA-01) voted to pass H.R. 4853, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2010, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 234 to 188. This will extend tax cuts on all income earned up to $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families. It will not renew tax cuts for upper-bracket rates.
"This is the right thing to do for working families," said Rep. Inslee. "Under this bill, every American gets a tax cut for the money they make up to $250,000. My Republican colleagues want to hold these tax cuts hostage until we hand out millionaire bonuses. America should not negotiate with hostage takers. That's unacceptable. We should work with the bipartisan agreement we have -- extension of middle class tax cuts. Our nation can't afford to balloon the deficit by $700 billion."
The tax cuts were designed to expire at the end this year due to a sunset provision included in a little-known Republican-passed Budget Reconciliation measure. At the time that these tax cuts were originally passed, our nation had a budget surplus. However, primarily because of the budget policy decisions of the Bush administration, the budget surpluses turned into the largest deficit on record.
According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, tax cuts for the wealthy are one of the least effective ways to grow the economy and create jobs. Extension of tax cuts for high-income earners would cost taxpayers an estimated additional $700 billion dollars.
