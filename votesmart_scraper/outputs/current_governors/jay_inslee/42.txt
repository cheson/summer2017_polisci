Statement

"The despicable nationwide wave of threats and vandalism against our Jewish community hit Washington state with yesterday's threat against the Mercer Island Stroum Jewish Community Center.
"I condemn in the strongest possible terms any act of violence against any community in our state, including the threat of terrorism. It doesn't matter what faith you practice, where you come from, or who you love -- Washington is a hate-free zone.
"And whether someone calls in a threat, desecrates cemeteries, or attacks people online, the individuals responsible for these hateful acts are abhorrent and go against everything our state and country stand for.
"Last month when Muslim immigrants were blocked from entering Sea-Tac Airport, the very first family to stand in support was a Jewish family with their young children holding signs that said "let's stand together.'
"As local and federal authorities investigate last night's incident, the state of Washington stands ready to support their efforts any way we can."
