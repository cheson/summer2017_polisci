Yesterday, U.S. Representative Jay Inslee (WA-01) released the following statement about the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA):
"We should all have a real concern about the theft of intellectual property that hurts creative and innovative industries, but this bill has serious flaws. While I believe we need stronger laws protecting IP in this country, it is important that we take a considerate approach that reflects the views of various stakeholders. I look forward to continuing to work towards a solution on the important issue of combating online piracy."
