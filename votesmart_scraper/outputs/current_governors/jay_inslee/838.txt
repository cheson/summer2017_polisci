Location: Washington, DC


Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008, H.R. 7084, by unanimous consent. The legislation, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) and co-sponsored by Reps. Howard Berman (D-Calif.), Donald Manzullo (R-Ill.), John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Lamar Smith (R-Texas), passed through the House on Saturday. The Webcaster Settlement Act now moves to President George W. Bush to be signed into law.
Mr. Inslee issued the following statement in response to the bill's passage through the Senate:
"It's a true delight to pass a bill which will allow for the survival of webcasting. Internet radio is an integral part of many of my constituents' daily lives and this bill will keep it that way.
"I thank the Senate for their timely consideration of this bill. By allowing webcasters and Sound Exchange to continue negotiating past the end of this Congressional session, we are letting the involved parties find a solution that works for everyone. In this case, it's best to get Uncle Sam out of the way of progress.
"I encourage the two sides to continue their negotiations and I look forward to seeing a final settlement, as made possible by this bill. We in Congress will continue working to ensure Internet radio's survival and the prosperity of independent webcasters."
