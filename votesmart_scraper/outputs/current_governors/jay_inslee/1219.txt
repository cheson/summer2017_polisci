Issue Position

If a bank is to big to fail, it's too big. That's why I sided with the folks on Main Street to reform the way Wall Street banking works. I voted against President Bush's bank bailout, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), because I believed we needed to be providing money for small businesses and homeowners. I support legislation that will reinstate Glass-Steagall, the law that served us well after the Great Depression keeping banks in check. And that is why I voted for the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which will make Wall Street more transparent and accountable.
Wall Street reform legislation puts into place:
* Stronger oversight of big banks and large financial firms
* A Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CPA) to act as a watchdog on behalf of consumers
* New enforcement powers for the Securities and Exchange Commission to protect investors
* Regulates the previously dark over-the-counter derivatives market
* Provides tougher oversight of the credit rating agencies who played a key role in the collapse
* Includes a non-partisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) audit of the Federal Reserve
