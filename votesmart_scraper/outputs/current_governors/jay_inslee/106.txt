Gov. Jay Inslee released a statement today on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's ruling to uphold the Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet rules, commonly known as net neutrality.
"Today's ruling upholding the FCC's net neutrality policies is a significant endorsement by the federal appeals court of the value of an open and unfettered internet in the United States.
"All Americans, as a matter of principle, should enjoy equal access to the educational, social, and business power of this important technology.
"The State of Washington continues to lead the way in showing how a neutral internet empowers citizens, stimulates innovation, and creates tremendous economic opportunity."
