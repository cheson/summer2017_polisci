Growth of Green-Collar Jobs
Madam Speaker, last night President Obama again reaffirmed his commitment to a clean energy policy for America, a policy that will grow millions of new green-collar jobs in this country. And he did it by, again, reaffirming his commitment to a cap-and-trade bill in this Congress this year which will drive investments into these new jobs for the next century.
The reason he is giving so much hope for Americans is that he realizes that we want Americans building the energy-efficient, partially and fully electric cars so we can sell those cars to China, so we can make the solar cells and sell them to Korea, so we can make wind turbines and sell them to Denmark.
It is this vision of Barack Obama that is going to help grow jobs in this country. And when we pass this cap-and-trade bill, two things are going to happen: money is going to go back to the American consumers to help them buy these energy-efficient products, and we are going to create millions of new jobs.
That is a Barack Obama hope for the future, and it is going to come to pass.
