"I thank President Obama and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for their prompt approval of the state's request for additional aid for infrastructure repairs required following the tragic SR 530 slide.
"This additional presidential declaration allows local governments, tribes, and certain non-profit agencies to apply for aid to repair disaster-related damage to roads and bridges, water control facilities, buildings and equipment, utilities and parks and recreation facilities. This is in addition to the federal assistance provided to individuals, families and businesses impacted by the March 22 disaster.
"This additional disaster aid strengthens the federal and state commitment to the recovery in Snohomish County from this terrible disaster. I commend the President and his administration for their ongoing support and following through on their commitment to the people of Washington state."
