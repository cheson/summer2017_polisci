ADMINISTRATION POLICIES IN IRAQ BASED ON FAILURE AND FALSEHOOD -- (House of Representatives - June 29, 2005)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, our proud troops in Iraq last night deserved an address that showed a President committed to effectiveness and truth. The sad fact is that these administration policies are based on failure and falsehood.
The failure is that, a full 2 years after the Iraq war started, we still have less than 15 percent, less than three battalions, that this administration has effectively trained that are ready for combat operations to replace American military personnel and bring them home.
This is a spectacular record of failure. After 2 years of us here in this Chamber demanding that the President train these troops so that they can replace the American GIs and Marines, we have three battalions, and that is it; after 2 years?
This has happened because of the rose-colored glasses that this administration has worn, thinking we were going to be greeted like liberators in Paris. They were wrong. And it is based on falsehood, falsehood when the President stood right behind me and said that there was WMDs. There was not, and now he is trying to bait and switch.
