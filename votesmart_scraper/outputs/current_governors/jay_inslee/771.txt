Illegal Subsidies For Airbus
Floor Speech

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, today in the days of 10 percent unemployment, it is particularly important to be fair to the American worker. And right now, there is a gross inequity to the American worker pending in the contract to acquire a new aerial fuel tanker by the U.S. Air Force.
Right now, we know that one of the bidders, the Airbus company, has received grossly unfair multibillion dollar subsidies from the European Union countries. It is absolutely necessary for the United States Air Force to factor into this bid the illegal subsidies that Airbus consortium has received.
It is inconceivable that one agency of the U.S. Government has found illegal subsidies by this bidder, and another agency may award a bid without taking into consideration the illegal subsidies found by the WTO.
We are calling for the Air Force and the President to factor in these illegal subsidies so the American worker gets fairness. And that is what we deserve.
