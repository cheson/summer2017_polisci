"The ports of Seattle and Tacoma are taking an important step towards a collaborative, regional operating model.
"As their recently released joint economic impact study shows, these two ports are major drivers of our economy. Their activities benefit their local economies and support trade throughout the state, from advanced manufacturing to agriculture.
"While details of the joint operating model for their marine cargo terminals are still to be worked out, I am encouraged that the ports share the goal of managing their cargo facilities in the best interest of the region and the state as a whole. The Seaport Alliance is a laudable example of how competitors can come together to act in the larger public interest."
