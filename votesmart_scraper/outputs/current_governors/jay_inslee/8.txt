Inslee Statement on GOP Efforts to Sabotage and Destabilize Health Insurance Markets
Statement

"The chaos and uncertainty caused by President Trump and the Republicans in Congress with their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act are sabotaging health insurance markets across the country.
"This Administration is willfully destabilizing markets with their threats to withhold funds and refusal to enforce the parts of the ACA that ensure a viable market. Congress is destabilizing the markets with their inept dithering about repeal. It's no wonder consumers and health insurers alike are nervous.
"And now even in states like ours, where we've seen such tremendous success, insurers are questioning whether they will be able to continue serving consumers in places like Grays Harbor and Klickitat counties.
"The worst part of what Trump and the Republicans are doing is that they want to take away health care so they can hand out tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans.
"We will not allow the chaos of D.C. to hurt the ability of Washingtonians to access health care, and I appreciate the efforts of Insurance Commissioner Kreidler who is working on options to resolve this issue.
"In the meantime, I remind Washington's congressional delegation that I stand ready and willing to work on ways to improve the ACA but will continue to vigorously oppose any effort to take away Washingtonians' health care."
