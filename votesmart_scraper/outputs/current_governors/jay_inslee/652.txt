Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to support House Resolution 32, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to the tragic shooting in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their loved ones, including my friend and colleague Gabby Giffords, the Giffords staff, and all who are mourning this tragedy in Arizona and across the Nation.
The events of this weekend are difficult to comprehend. Gabby is a champion for her constituents and it was because of her devotion to them that she was outside a local grocery store the Saturday morning when she nearly lost her life. As the tragedy unfolded, she was surrounded by a group of dutiful staff and constituents, including an intern who may have saved her life, and many who so unbelievably lost their own lives or were injured.
I have gotten to know Gabby through our shared efforts to advance renewable energy policies, including our working together on the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition. She's bright and engaging, and is always bringing in fresh ideas to achieve solutions to our Nation's energy problems. My heart is with her and her husband at this moment as she fights for her recovery. If there is anyone who can pull through, I believe it will be Gabby.
It is in times like these that I believe our Nation can rise above our past and shine brighter than we have before. While it will take time to learn exactly why this has happened, I hope that as we heal, our Nation will find a way to be more compassionate, understanding and peaceful.
