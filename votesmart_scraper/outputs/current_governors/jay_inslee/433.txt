"The rising tide of productivity and prosperity isn't raising all boats. Too many hard-working men and women in Washington are falling further behind, impacting not just the prospects for those workers and their families but the prosperity of our state as well. That's why I called on legislators to join me in this conversation and I want to thank the House Majority for putting forth a common sense plan for providing a fair wage for more Washingtonians. My staff and I will carefully review the bill as we continue to talk with stakeholders and members about the best path forward to ensuring more Washingtonians share in our state's prosperity."
