In the State of the Union, President Obama challenged Americans to lead the world in innovation when he outlined a bold innovation agenda in response to this generation's "Sputnik moment."
Washingtonians should not just join this effort, we should lead it. Innovation has driven a large part of our state's economy for generations, becoming part of our DNA. In 2002, I imagined much the same challenge when I wrote about a New Apollo Clean Energy project.
We have led the innovation economy for decades, but are at risk of losing our perch as competing states embrace more aggressive business development policies. We have fallen from 5th to 11th in life sciences, rank 8th for innovative climate, and have watched as other states far exceeded our modest five percent growth in the life science industry.
It doesn't have to be this way. We still have the ingredients -- talent, capacity, and gumption -- to again lead in innovation. We are home to premier public research institutions, a national research lab, and are a center of global health research.
If the innovation jobs of tomorrow are to take root in Washington, we must harness all local, state, and federal resources, and implement policies that foster job creation and grow our economy.
Some of the options I believe we should explore include:
1. Increasing capital availability. Done right, setting aside a small sliver of funds from the Washington State Investment Board and other such investments can provide return for the beneficiaries, while driving more money into the local economy. Federal policies I am advancing, such as the Clean Energy Bank, can help leverage investments in clean energy technologies in our state.
