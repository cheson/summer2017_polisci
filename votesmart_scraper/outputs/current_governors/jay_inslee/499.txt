At a ceremony in the King County Courthouse with friends and family, Governor Jay Inslee today appointed Susan Amini to King County Superior Court, position 20.
Amini has served as a King County District Pro Tem judge since 1994 and owns her own law practice focusing on criminal defense, family law and immigration. She is considered an expert in the rights of individuals with disabilities. Amini serves as a King County Bar Association Trustee and is a member of the Washington State Trial Lawyers, MELAW and the Bellevue Rotary.
"Susan will bring both a high level of expertise as well as a valuable and unique perspective to the bench," said Inslee. "Susan believes strongly in equal access to justice, regardless of a person's economic status, education level, or disability, and she has worked tirelessly to help eliminate barriers that exist within our court system. I know she'll excel in her new role."
Amini, an Iranian-American, is the first Superior Court Judge of Middle Eastern descent in Washington state history. She is filling the seat that was slated for Scott Johnson, who unexpectedly passed away last October from a heart attack.
Amini's term begins effective May 13, 2013.
