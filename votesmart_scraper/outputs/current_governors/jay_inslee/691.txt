Introducing The Clean, Renewable Jet Fuel Act Of 2010
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Sept. 29, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

* Madam Speaker, currently, the aviation industry does not have a commercially available low-carbon fuel option nor is there a statutory requirement (like the Renewable Fuel Standard for transportation fuels or tax incentives to help bring one to market. However, low-carbon, renewable aviation biofuels have been successfully tested in flights of both military as well as civilian aircraft.
* Unfortunately, the volatility of jet fuel prices makes it difficult for renewable jet fuel to compete with lower-cost petroleum-based fuel and attract the investment necessary to build commercial-scale refineries.
* I rise today to introduce the Clean, Renewable Jet Fuel Act of 2010. This bill will establish a responsible loan program that will allow biofuel producers to climb over the economic hurdles associated with commercializing their product. The commercialization of these products will not only create jobs at these facilities it will also create jobs throughout the aviation and agriculture industry. Additionally, the fuels that will be produced will also enhance our Nation's energy security as all of the feedstocks used to make these biofuels can be grown on U.S. soil. Recently, the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, made the research development, and increased use of alternative fuels a priority for the Department of the Navy.
* These biofuels also offer a range of attractive technological and environmental aspects that will introduce efficiencies into our aviation sector that cannot be realized with current petroleum-based fuel sources.
* In the great state of Washington, interests from the private sector, universities, and major airports are already working to bring the first generation of aviation biofuels to the market, and their efforts can be greatly enhanced by this legislation. These fuels are based on plants such as camelina, jatropha, and even algae; plants that can be grown right in the Pacific Northwest. In addition to being able to grow these feedstocks in our own backyard, research on the next generation of biofuels is also creating jobs at our highly regarded research institutions. These efforts will make sure that the U.S. secures its competitive edge in this field.
* In closing, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill, and hope that we can work together to move it towards passage as soon as possible.
