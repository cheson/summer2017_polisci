Gov. Jay Inslee today returned from a nine-day trade mission to Korea and Japan where he and more than 100 delegates met with top-level business and government leaders to promote trade and collaboration on everything from aerospace and wine to emergency preparedness and climate change. Delegates held meetings throughout South Korea and Japan with primary stops in Seoul, South Korea, and Kobe, Nagoya and Tokyo in Japan. Including the Friendship Delegation led by state Senator Karen Fraser, this was the largest-ever state trade delegation.
"There is no better way to showcase Washington's innovation and entrepreneurial spirit than meeting face-to-face with our prospective partners, customers and collaborators," Inslee said. "It was clear in my meetings that our state is well known for its world-class workforce and high-quality exports. I was also encouraged by the willingness of leaders in Korea and Japan to work together on issues such as health care, workforce development and climate change. This was an incredibly productive mission."
