For the next four years, everything Washington does needs to be viewed through the lens of job creation. As governor, that will be my focus.
That means real investment in new industries. It means closing tax loopholes that don't create jobs and protecting programs that do.
The film and television industry employs nearly 10,000 people in our state, an important number on its own. Even more valuable are all the people who benefit indirectly. Film and TV production means jobs for small businesses across Washington -- caterers, florists, truck drivers, hotel operators and countless more middle-class jobs made possible or made better by money spent making movies, television and commercials in our state.
It's always fun to see a familiar location in a movie, but it is more important to see the impact production spending has on our communities. Our state should continue to encourage film and TV production, and when I'm governor I will.
