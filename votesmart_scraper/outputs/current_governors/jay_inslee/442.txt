"Union membership gives each worker a say in his or her future. I believe the Machinists should have the opportunity to exercise that right by voting on this contract proposal. I appreciate that the IAM and the company returned to the bargaining table. We've heard from some rank and file members and from leadership of the International that the agreement that emerged deserves a vote. That should happen soon as I have become increasingly concerned that we are at a perilous point in our effort to bring the 777X to Washington state."
