Public Statements
Can We Preserve An Open and Free Internet?
Statement

You would think this is a simple question. For decades, the internet has grown and prospered because everyone was working under a set of agreed rules and those rules were simple -- internet providers supply customers with a portal to the internet from which customers can exercise their choice to visit and use any websites and services they want.
Again, simple.
But a recent court decision threw out the rules of the road, and for months broadband service providers have been fighting to stop the FCC from reinstating common sense rules that protect consumers online and could bring the economic and social opportunities of broadband to millions of underserved Americans. We find ourselves at a public policy crossroad and for me the choice is clear -- we must protect consumers online while promoting investment, and to do so the FCC, in partnership with Congress, must have the authority to watch over broadband policy.
Many believe they can boost profits by controlling choice and limiting access and picking winners and losers online. This is not the way we want the internet to be.
This fight is not new for us, but now the Federal Communications Commission is voting to start the process of public comment that will determine if broadband technology can be realized by all, and if a free and open internet will continue to guide the consumer experience online.
That is why Jay today released a letter he sent to the FCC supporting and urging the FCC to continue their efforts to maintain what has made the internet so strong -- consumer choice. He was joined by 32 other members of Congress.
