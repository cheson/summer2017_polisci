PRESIDENTIAL VETO WRONG
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, when I voted to override President Bush's veto of stem cell research, I was thinking of ex-Governor Booth Gardner of Washington State. I saw Governor Gardner in the Sea-Tac Airport Monday as I was flying back here. He was flying to San Francisco for advanced treatment for Parkinson's, a disease he has been battling for some time with great courage and grace.
And yet this promising research, we have a President who decided he is not going to let Americans have because he, from his exalted realm on Pennsylvania Avenue, has taken it upon himself to dictate to Americans what our morals should be.
Let me suggest that the President who started the war in Iraq based on false information, the President that mishandled Hurricane Katrina relief, the President who has created the largest deficit in the history of the solar system, is not entitled by any law, religion, morality, ethics or common sense to dictate to the American people one sense of morality, much less any others.
It was wrong for him to deny Booth Gardner treatment, it is wrong for him to take it away from millions of Americans.
