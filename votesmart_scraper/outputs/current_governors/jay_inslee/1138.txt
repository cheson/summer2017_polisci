TRUTH ABOUT IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 30, 2004)
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I heard a very disturbing report today. While we are engaging in a very important and legitimate debate about our strategy in Iraq, one thing for sure we ought to be united on, and that is Americans ought to have access to the truth and not to be the subject of spin by their own government and should not have their own government suppressing the truth about Iraq. Things are difficult enough about Iraq without the Federal Government suppressing the truth about Iraq.
Unfortunately, that appears to be what is going on in this administration. Today in the Washington Post an article related that the USAID ordered the restriction of preventing distribution of reports by the contractor Kroll Security International which had previously shown that the number of daily attacks by insurgents in Iraq had increased significantly. In response to the news that these insurgent attacks are increasing, about 5 weeks before this election, this administration decided apparently to suppress that information and the agency ordered that this information no longer be disseminated to the American public.
This is information generated with U.S. American taxpayer dollars that this administration, 5 weeks before the election, does not want the American people to hear about.
The article in The Washington Post says: "The Kroll reports suggest a broad and intensifying campaign of insurgent violence." In response to that bad news, the agency official at USAID sent an e-mail to congressional aides stating, "This is the last Kroll report to come in. After The Washington Post story, they shut it down in order to regroup. I'll let you know when it restarts."
