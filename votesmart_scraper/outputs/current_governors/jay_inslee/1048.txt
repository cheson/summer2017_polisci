Inslee pans IRS plan to sell taxpayer data
Holds roundtable in Seattle to hear concerns firsthand
23 March 2006
U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee blasted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for contributing to the erosion of consumer privacy. In a letter to the federal agency, he criticized a proposed rule change that would allow sensitive information provided on tax filings - and even entire returns - to be sold to marketers and data-collection companies.
"In an age of security breaches and identity theft, it's more important than ever to safeguard the treasure trove of sensitive information in tax filings," Inslee wrote in the letter sent on Wednesday afternoon. "Uncle Sam should be setting the gold standard for protecting personal information, not creating a pot of gold for data brokers and other corporations."
He also hosted a roundtable meeting in Seattle, where taxpayers, privacy advocates and accountants voiced concerns about the proposed rule.
"American taxpayers deserve an opportunity to weigh in on a plan that would put their most personal and private information up for sale to marketers," said Inslee at the meeting in downtown Seattle.
