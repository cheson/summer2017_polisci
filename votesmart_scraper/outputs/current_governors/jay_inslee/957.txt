PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, this is not the United Nations of Alberto Gonzales, it is the United States of America.
In America, we do not allow Alberto Gonzales to listen to our phone conversations while we are sitting in our living room talking to our daughter anywhere in the world without judicial review, and that's what this bill does.
In America, we do not allow Alberto Gonzales to intercept our e-mail conversations to our business partners anywhere in the world without some kind of judicial review. In America, we have that concept because we understand people who can make mistakes.
I base my principle on fundamental tenet that the Americans trust the United States Constitution more than they trust Alberto Gonzales. What Benjamin Franklin said still holds true, those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty and safety. He was right then. He is right now.
Don't pass this bill. Come back and have something that allows surveillance with protections from our judicial system.
