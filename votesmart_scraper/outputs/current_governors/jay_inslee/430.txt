"It is heartening that we now have a clear path to help more Washington students pursue their college dreams. While we've opened the doors of our colleges to successful students from all walks of life, too many promising young Washingtonians aren't able to realize their full potential because the financial burden of going to college is too great. We are now poised to take action on the Dream Act and remove that barrier for our aspiring citizens. We can and must support these young men and women as the next generation of innovators, builders and entrepreneurs who will strengthen and grow Washington's economy.
"I thank Senate leaders for standing on the side of opportunity for all and look forward to working with them and those in the House who have been working on this for the past year."
