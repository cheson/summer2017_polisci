Governor Inslee's statement regarding news of additional plans approved by Commissioner Mike Kreidler for Washington's health benefit exchange
"I thank Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler for his dedicated work implementing the Washington Health Benefit Exchange and rigorous review of the plans that will be included. I am happy to hear that his office has approved ten new options for the exchange, plans that will offer more competition in the marketplace and more choices for consumers.
"I also understand not all the plans have been approved. While I had hoped they all could move forward, I understand the commissioner's concerns about protecting consumers' interests and appreciate his willingness to continue working with insurance companies to potentially include their plans in the future.
"With enrollment beginning on October 1, I want to recognize all the good work of Mike and everyone involved in setting up this ground-breaking new health care exchange. Healthy families lead to a healthier economy. With one million more Washingtonians soon gaining access to affordable health care coverage, this is a huge step forward for Washington."
