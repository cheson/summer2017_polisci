Thank you, Dean Graumlich, for the introduction.
Good afternoon! It's great to be back at the UW, a true engine of innovation for our
state.
And the reason it's such an engine for innovation is because it is powered by some
of the world's best scientists, researchers, and academics.
The UW's own Mary-Claire King just won a Lasker Award for her work in cancer
research.
The Center for Commercialization here has had a record year -- 18 NEW start-up
companies based on UW research technologies, and a bright future under the
leadership of Vikram Jandhyala.
And you have Amy Snover directing the Climate Impacts Group, making sure the
latest climate science is presented in a way that is accessible to policy makers and
helps them take the right actions.
Amy spent many hours making sure the National Climate Assessment was done right and presented well to the press and public. She also did a tremendous job in
helping the President's White House Climate Resilience Task Force dig through draft
recommendations, providing valuable feedback, and shaping forthcoming
recommendations.
