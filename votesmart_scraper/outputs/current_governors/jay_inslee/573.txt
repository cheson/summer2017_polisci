Today, U.S. Representative Jay Inslee (WA-01) released the following statement after the announcement that the Boeing Company and the Machinists union reached a contract agreement and announced that the 737MAX will be built in Washington State:
"Great things happen when people who care about our state work together for a brighter future, and this is a great thing. Boeing's decision to build the 737MAX in Washington State is the biggest manufacturing job creation opportunity in a decade and will create a projected 20,000 good-paying jobs and $5.5 billion of increased economic activity. This is fantastic news for Washington workers, the Boeing Company, its suppliers and the rest of our state's growing aerospace industry cluster.
I am especially pleased that Boeing management and the Machinists union were able to come together to reach an agreement on a four year labor contract. It is this partnership that helped Boeing land the contract to build the Air Force's NextGen Tanker, and it has now brought the 737MAX line to Washington State.
Still, while today gives Washington workers a reason to cheer, this announcement should also serve as a reminder that we must redouble our efforts to better align our workforce training programs and STEM program graduates with job opportunities in the state. In order for Washington to remain a global leader in the aerospace industry and other industries we must be able to provide companies with the skilled workforce they need to provide the world with quality products."
