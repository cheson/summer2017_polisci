Press Release
By: Jay Inslee
Date: July 13, 2016
Location: Washington, DC

The National Governors Association today announced that 46 governors have signed on to a compact regarding efforts to fight the opioid epidemic. Dr. Gary Franklin, Medical Director for the state Department of Labor & Industry, UW researcher and chair of our state Agency Medical Directors Group, will be among those presenting at the NGA meeting this week in Iowa. Gov. Inslee issued the following statement:
"Opioid addiction is harming communities, people and families in every corner of our nation and our state. About 600 people die every year in Washington state from opioid overdose.
"While governors urge Congress to step up efforts to prevent inappropriate prescribing of opioids and provide more access to treatment and recovery support programs, we are taking significant steps -- and plan to do even more -- in Washington state to educate doctors and provide treatment services to patients in pain or who may be addicted to painkillers or heroin. I am proud that our health care leaders across the state have come together to try to solve this problem. One such leader, Dr. Gary Franklin, the chair of our state Agency Medical Directors Group, has been invited by my colleagues and will present our state's leading work on this important issue at this week's NGA meeting."
