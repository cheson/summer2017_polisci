Save The Oceans
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee

Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, yesterday, the actor Sigourney Weaver showed a movie in the Capitol which was scarier than her movie The Aliens because it was fact, not fiction, and it was a movie documenting the acidification of the oceans caused by carbon dioxide that we burn that goes in the atmosphere, goes in the water, and makes the oceans acidic. This documentary showed that the waters off the Pacific coast soon will be so acidic that they can actually melt shell life.
The reason I mention this is that yesterday the EPA rolled out proposed rules to do something about these noxious gases. Some have said we shouldn't do that, but those are the same people saying we shouldn't pass a bill. They're saying we shouldn't regulate CO2 here, there, or anywhere.
I urge all of us to move forward on a bipartisan basis to stop ocean acidification by passing the energy bill we passed in the House. We hope the Senate will pass it. That's a route to do it. But, one way or another, we've got to save the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
