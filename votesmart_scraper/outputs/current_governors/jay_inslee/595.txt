Public Statements
Climate Change and Its Threat to Future Generations
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee

Location: Washington, DC

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, during our discussion of the Federal debt, we heard a lot of discussion about threats to our children's and our grandchildren's future. What we have not heard enough discussion about is another threat to our children's and our grandchildren's future, and that is the threat of climate change.
We have seen the first bitter taste of this oncoming tsunami of change with 7 inches of rain in 3 hours in Virginia, with wildfires in Texas that have been unprecedented in our Nation's history. And now our current job crisis does not give us the luxury of ignoring this long-term threat to our children's and our grandchildren's future.
I want to alert Members to a thing they can check on right now, the Climate Reality Project, which is something going on until 7 o'clock tonight--climaterealityproject.org. If people are interested in what is happening to our country today, around the country and the world, check out climaterealityproject.org. It is a bitter taste. Let's keep our eye on that ball as well.
