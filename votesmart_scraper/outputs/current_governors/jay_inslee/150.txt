"Yesterday's Supreme Court ruling on the Clean Power Plan is very troubling, surprising, and disappointing. And it inexplicably breaks with past rulings in which the high court has called for federal rules to limit the carbon pollution that is driving climate change.
"We cannot afford to wait any longer for federal action to address carbon pollution and transition to clean energy. Here in Washington state we are unfortunately already seeing the harmful impacts of climate change, and we will continue to take steps that reduce carbon and to lead the nation in clean energy. The EPA's Clean Power Plan remains a crucial tool to ensure that every state must do its part, and to empower them to do so.
"This ruling comes at a time when the international momentum for action on climate change, expressed most forcefully by December's global agreement in Paris, is increasingly irreversible. U.S. leadership has been vital to gaining meaningful commitments from the world's largest economies, and the Clean Power Plan is central to that leadership. We are confident that the sound legal and policy foundations of this rule will ultimately be upheld, and that the United States will continue its progress in building a clean energy future."
