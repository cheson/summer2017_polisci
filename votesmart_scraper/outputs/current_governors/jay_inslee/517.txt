"The state Supreme Court did the right thing today in ruling that a supermajority requirement for ordinary legislation would alter our system of government. The supermajority requirement gave a legislative minority the power to squelch ideas even when those ideas had majority support. That is inconsistent with our fundamental form of representative democracy.
"Majority rule is a foundation of our system of government. Alexander Hamilton understood this and warned that giving "the minority a negative upon the majority' would cause "tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.' James Madison understood this. And the framers of Washington's constitution had vigorous debate on the issue and were deliberate in embedding the principle of majority rule in our constitution.
"Those principles have served the people of Washington well, and I'm heartened that the state Supreme Court acted today to protect our constitution."
