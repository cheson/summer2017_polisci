Gov. Jay Inslee today signed an executive order that launches a statewide public health initiative to reduce and prevent gun-related fatalities and injuries.
The order uses the same data-driven approach that has significantly reduced motor vehicle deaths over the past two decades. The initiative will help the state understand the people and places most at risk of gun violence or suicide, determine the best approaches to reducing gun violence and work with its partners to develop strategies and actions to prevent gun violence.
"This will be a data-driven approach that helps us identify the people and places most susceptible to gun crime and suicide," Inslee said. "Gun crime is a scourge that has scarred thousands of families in every corner of our state. It's a scourge we can, should and will help prevent."
Between 2012 and 2014, an annual average of 665 people died in Washington state from firearm injuries per year, compared to 497 deaths from automobile accidents per year, according to the Department of Health Department of Vital Statistics. Approximately 80 percent of the firearm deaths were suicides.
Inslee emphasized the importance of state and local action since Congress has failed repeatedly to take even the most modest of steps.
"I've watched Congress fail for years to make any kind of progress on this issue," Inslee said. "Congress has passed laws prohibiting even basic research and data collection on gun violence in America. Yet, while Congress protects the status quo of everyday gun violence, cities, counties and states are moving forward with sensible policies to reduce firearm fatalities. As long as I'm governor, Washington will be one of those states that says "enough is enough.'"
