American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act

AMERICAN-MADE ENERGY AND GOOD JOBS ACT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, is it too much to ask for us to protect the last remaining 5 percent of the Alaskan coast? Is that too much to ask? To give to the Creator his pristine creation?
We do not put oil derricks in Yellowstone National Park. We do not put them in Zion National Park. We do not put them in Mount Rainier National Park, and we should not industrialize this precious Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
There is a pattern here. There is a pattern. Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling were just convicted of fraud on what Enron did to us. And this administration and this Congress let Enron take billions of dollars from ratepayers because they were in fact in the pockets of these energy companies.
Now we have a similar situation. I will never forget when Dick Cheney looked at us and we begged for help from him to stop Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling from taking money from ratepayers, and you know what he told us, he said you Democrats just don't understand markets.
Now I guess we just don't understand energy either. We understand that we should protect the national jewels in the crown of this country. Vote ``no'' on this bill.
