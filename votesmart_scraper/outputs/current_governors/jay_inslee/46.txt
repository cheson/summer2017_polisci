"Today's decision to uphold Judge Robart's order is a victory for Washington State and indeed the entire country. Thank you to Attorney General Ferguson and Solicitor General Noah Purcell for their diligent work on behalf of our state.
"The decision underscores the serious constitutional issues with President Trump's executive order and emphasizes what Attorney General Ferguson has said throughout this case: that no one is above the law, not even the president.
"Since the restraining order was issued, in our state we've seen a Somali man reunited with his wife, an American citizen. An Iraqi global health leader able to rejoin his colleagues at the University of Washington. And a graduate student studying HIV vaccines to return to continue his important work.
"I'm proud that Washington is a national leader in this fight. We were the first state to stand against this executive order. But all Americans need to be willing to stand and fight for our democracy, everywhere, every time, and in every way it is threatened."
