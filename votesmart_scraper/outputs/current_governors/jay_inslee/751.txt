This afternoon, Rep. Jay Inslee (D-WA) made the following statement on the house floor regarding today's upcoming vote on health care reform:
"'We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union,' that is what got America started. And when we form a more perfect union it is always a continuous, and controversial process; social security, Medicare, civil rights, at those times it was always controversial."
"But Americans are going to grow confident in this for two reasons. Number one, we know all Americans' should have a choice in health care. It shouldn't be the government's choice, it shouldn't be the insurance company's choice, it should be individual Americans choice, and that is what they will get today. Number two, we know that a nation is truly healthy only when all of its citizens have health care. Today we will have choice, today we will have health care, today we are forming a more perfect union in the tradition of this great country."
