CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 6, ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005 -- (House of Representatives - July 28, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, it is truly sad that a Nation that produced the Apollo Moon Project today will produce something with the success of the Hindenberg.
The only thing that can be guaranteed about this bill is that it will fail. It is guaranteed that it will fail to reduce our dependence on Saudi Arabian oil.
According to the Department of Energy, our dependence will rise under this bill from 58 percent to 68 percent failure. It is guaranteed to fail to deal with global warming, and the reason is you took the money that should have gone to emerging high-tech industries that need the help, the Davids, and you gave 64 percent to the Goliaths of the oil and gas industry. Guaranteed failure.
It is guaranteed to fail, to send our jobs to Japan because you took out of the bill the provision that would bring these new fuel-efficient cars to be manufactured in America where they should be. Guaranteed failure.
The only success that this bill will have is an energetic fleecing of American taxpayers. And if you can find a reason that you can take money from your taxpayers and give to the most profitable business in America at $60 a barrel oil, good luck. I cannot explain it. I do not think you will be able to either.
Vote against this bill.
