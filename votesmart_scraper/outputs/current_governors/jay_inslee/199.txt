Gov. Jay Inslee today learned that President Obama has approved part of his request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the record-breaking wildfires that spread across Eastern Washington this summer.
The president's declaration makes available the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Public Assistance Program for infrastructure damage to eight counties and the Colville Tribe. The program helps offset costs these counties and state agencies incurred to provide emergency protective measures, as well as repair and replace some disaster-damaged facilities.
"I'm thankful to the president and his team for this assistance and support," Inslee said. "Our state has faced more than our fair share of catastrophic disasters over the last year and they've taken a significant toll both emotionally and financially. This year alone -- our state has spent more than $100 million just in firefighting costs. This financial assistance will help our state as we recover from these devastating events."
