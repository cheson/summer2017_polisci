BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3397, as amended, the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010. This bill is our effort to respond to the very rapidly rising rate of prescription drug abuse in our country where 2,500 teens a day are using prescription drugs illegally for the first time. And this bill will help, we think, significantly in helping remove prescription drugs from the illicit drug pipeline by giving citizens an ability to get rid of their drugs, their prescription drugs, in a legal fashion so that communities can fashion a way to create drug take-back programs so citizens can get rid of their unnecessary and no longer useful prescription drugs.
The House has previously passed a version. We have made some improvements to the bill after it went through the Senate. I just want to note some of those improvements.
Today, when people do not have ready access to drug disposal programs, they often flush them down, and drugs ultimately end up in the waterways. In order to ensure that the drug take-back programs that we fashion under this bill are environmentally sound, it's important that the Attorney General consider the environmental impacts of take-back programs and work with the Environmental Protection Agency and communities on appropriate ways to dispose of the collected substance in an environmentally sound manner. We also have provided ways to make sure communities are engaged in designing these programs so that they meet the individual needs of specific communities.
I want to thank all the people who have worked on this bipartisan legislation, particularly Representative Stupak who is ending his congressional career having done some great work in this regard.
With that, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak).
