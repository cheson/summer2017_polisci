REGARDING AMBASSADOR JOE WILSON -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2005)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, Mark Twain once observed that mankind is the only species that feels shame or needs to. That thought crossed my mind when I was reading about this corrupt effort to punish Ambassador Joe Wilson who told the truth and blew the whistle on the administration's misinformation about the Iraq war. Apparently in the grand jury testimony Judith Miller said, ``She agreed to Libby's request to be cited in stories as a `former Hill staffer,' a rather deceptive description for the Vice President's Chief of Staff.''
Well, the Los Angeles Times got it right. It was deceptive, and there was a reason. Anyone who would participate in any way to punish an American for blowing the whistle on the President's misstatements should feel shame. Obviously, Mr. Libby did feel shame and that is why he hid from the public, or attempted to, that he was actually part of the administration that attempted to punish an American for telling the truth.
We should not wait for the grand jury. This President should root out the corruption and discharge the people responsible for these misdeeds.
