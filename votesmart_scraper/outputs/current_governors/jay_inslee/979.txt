TRIBUTE TO THE GREATER SEATTLE SERVICE LEAGUE -- (Extensions of Remarks - June 14, 2007)
* Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Greater Seattle Service League, GSSL, for their commitment to raising funds and awareness for Childhaven, a Seattle-based organization dedicated to breaking the cycle of child abuse. The organization uses scientifically-supported programs to protect and treat children through 5 years of age while simultaneously providing counseling and education to victims' families. Childhaven currently operates four Seattle-area branches to reach people around the City. Anyone who visits the Childhaven facilities will see firsthand the miracles that can be established by the caring and proven efforts at Childhaven.
* The GSSL began in 1979 as a group of recent college graduates committed to making a difference in the community; they have subsequently grown into a philanthropic force in the Seattle area. GSSL and Childhaven have been in partnership for 27 years. For the past 18 years, their yearly Hoopaholics fundraiser has allowed basketball enthusiasts to play a few games, raise money for Childhaven at the same time, and hear about the power of mentoring by committed people like Mike Pierson. Since its inception, the $300,000 that has been raised through Hoopaholics has gone toward continuing day-to-day program operations, furnishing the new Broadway Center and purchasing vans, books, furniture, and playground equipment for other branches, among other purposes. GSSL is truly a valued partner of the Childhaven Treatment Centers, and the efforts of its mentors are greatly appreciated.
