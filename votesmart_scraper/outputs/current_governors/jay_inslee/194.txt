Gov. Jay Inslee today announced new educational tools to help Washingtonians be better informed about cyber privacy, protecting personal information in the digital landscape and state government policies and practices related to data collection.
"Increasingly, businesses, government and personal transactions are happening online. I want to make sure our state agencies are taking the privacy of our customers seriously and that we're helping Washingtonians understand how to protect their privacy and personal information," Inslee said. "Just as Washington is a technology leader in so many important fields--from software development to e-commerce--we strive to set an example of "best practices' when it comes to collecting and protecting the personal information citizens provide when engaging with state government services."
