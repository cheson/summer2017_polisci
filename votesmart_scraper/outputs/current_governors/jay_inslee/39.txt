Statement

"Yesterday's act of vandalism at the Temple De Hirsch Sinai in Seattle is the latest in a wave of anti-Semitic threats against our state's Jewish community.
"We can't ignore the reality that these threats have increased in recent months. Right here in Washington -- a state known for being tolerant, open-minded and forward-thinking -- we are seeing an increase in reports of harassment, vandalism and attacks against Muslims, Sikhs, Hispanics and Latinos, African-Americans, LGBTQ individuals and other minority groups. It is the responsibility of each and every one of us to condemn any and all acts of hate and intolerance.
"I continue to stand with the Jewish community as I have stood with all Washingtonians. Regardless of one's faith, color or orientation, Washington welcomes all. "
