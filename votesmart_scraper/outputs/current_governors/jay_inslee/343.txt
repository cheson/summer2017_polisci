Gov. Jay Inslee today issued the following statement after learning his request for a Small Business Administration physical disaster declaration for Spokane County has been approved.
"Our neighbors spent a lifetime creating their homes and businesses which were erased in mere minutes by this powerful windstorm," Inslee said. "I'm pleased that they now qualify for important federal programs that will help them get back on their feet, and thank the Administration for its swift response to this important request. This has been an unusually devastating summer for Washington, which has stretched our state's ability to respond to those who need our help. Additional assistance from our federal partners is incredibly appreciated."
On July 23rd, a catastrophic windstorm in parts of Eastern Washington destroyed 53 homes and caused significant revenue losses for nearby businesses. The declaration will make low-interest disaster loans available to the affected businesses and property owners in need of financial assistance not otherwise available on reasonable terms to help repair or replace disaster-related damages.
