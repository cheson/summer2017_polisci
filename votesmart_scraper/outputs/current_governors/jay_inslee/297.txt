"Trudi and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Bill Boeing Jr. Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife, June, and everyone in the Boeing family. Bill was a tremendous champion for aerospace, having made history in Washington that has changed the course of world transportation. Bill contributed significantly to Washington's century of aerospace heritage and was a singular force in making the Museum of Flight the international visitor attraction and educational institution it is today. The name Boeing is synonymous with the storied aviation history and prosperity of Washington state. Today all Washingtonians feel the loss of one of our state's visionary leaders."
