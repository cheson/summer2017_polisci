BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.
Mr. Chairman, we, all Americans, believe in a strong national defense; and all Americans believe in a fair, level playing field in economic competition.
And in the competition for the procurement contract for the Air Force tanker to preserve national defense infrastructure, to preserve fairness, we need to amend this bill to ensure that unfair competitive advantage, illegal subsidies, in fact, are taken into consideration in this bidding process.
We have prepared an amendment that will do that, that will insist that in this bidding process that it be conducted fairly; that when any bidder, domestic or foreign, has an unfair competitive advantage, that is taken into consideration.
Now, why do we need to do this?
Well, there's 50,000 American jobs at stake, and nothing in international law compels us to provide a stimulus program for France. We are required to do this because we know American aerospace workers can compete if they have a level playing field with workers in Europe.
Our bill is, number one, fair. It applies to both domestic and foreign bidders. Number two, it's WTO compliant.
