Statement

"Today's derailment of a train carrying Bakken crude oil in the Columbia River Gorge is yet another reminder of the risks and concerns of crude-by-rail transport in our region. I join Gov. Brown in commending the swift response from Oregon's public safety and transportation officials.
"There are no reports of oil entering the Columbia River, and fortunately no reports of injuries. Along with the Department of Ecology and the Utilities and Transportation Commission, I will continue to monitor the situation and provide support to Gov. Brown in whatever way we can."
