Gov. Jay Inslee announced today that he is appointing Janet Helson to King County Superior Court. Helson is replacing Judge Kimberley Prochnau who retired after more than seven years of distinguished service on the bench.
Helson currently practices at Skellenger Bender P.S., with an emphasis on family law. She previously worked for more than 12 years at Columbia Legal Services (formerly Evergreen Legal Services) where she provided legal services to low-income clients on a range of family law, domestic violence and kinship care issues. Her experience includes serving as a law clerk for Judge Betty Fletcher in the U.S. Court of Appeals and Judge Robert Peckham in the U.S. District Court.
"Janet's record and experience shows a deep commitment to serving families and children and ensuring everyone has access to quality representation and service in our legal system," Inslee said. "She will be an outstanding addition to the bench."
Helson attended Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges and earned her Juris Doctorate at Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkely. She has volunteered on numerous state bar and legal associations including her current role on the National Family Law Advisory Council for the National Center for Lesbian Rights and formerly on the Q-Law Judicial Screening Committee.
