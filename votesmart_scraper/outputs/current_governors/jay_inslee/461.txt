Gov. Jay Inslee today launched an interactive web-based tool for Washingtonians to share feedback and ideas about the state's new Results Washington initiative. Results Washington is a performance improvement effort to make state government more efficient, effective and transparent. The online forum gives Washingtonians an easy way to learn more about this effort, offer suggestions and vote or comment on other people's ideas.
"I want to make sure we're measuring progress in the areas that people care about most -- education, the economy, environment, health and safety, and government efficiency," Inslee said. "We can only improve the things we measure -- that's why the work of the Results Washington team is so important. While we can't measure everything, I know there are priorities that Washingtonians want us to track, and that's what I'd like to hear about."
This moderated website is just one way Inslee and the Results Washington team will gather input on managing performance in state government. The online forum allows users to share, comment and vote on feedback and ideas submitted by other users. Last week the team held a one-hour Twitter town hall that attracted more than 100 participants.
