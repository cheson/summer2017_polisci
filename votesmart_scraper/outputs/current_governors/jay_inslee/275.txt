"Washington state has been called a poster-child for the need for comprehensive immigration reform. Our state's agricultural, high-tech and services industries, the strength of our economy and the quality of life of our people all require Congress to finally act. But since Congress has refused, the Obama Administration has identified reforms that will begin to help Washington businesses and families harmed by the current outdated system. These reforms must be allowed to move forward.
"Washington state took the lead in developing a multi-state amicus brief opposing Texas's lawsuit, and we will continue that leadership role going forward. We support the motion by the Department of Justice to stay the Texas judge's ruling and allow the Department of Homeland Security to do its job protecting the American people and bringing much-needed reforms to our nation's immigration system. And if a full stay is not granted, we join the DOJ in asking the court to at least stay the effect of its injunction outside of Texas, so that these reforms can move forward in Washington and other states."
