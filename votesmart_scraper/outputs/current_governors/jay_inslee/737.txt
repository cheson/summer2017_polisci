Pass A Clean Energy Bill
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee
Date: May 5, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire, and Congress got the message and passed a suite of clean waters bills that cleaned up our waters. Now, with this 5,000-barrel, maybe-plus, oil spill in the Gulf, Congress and the U.S. Senate particularly needs to get the message and pass a clean energy bill that will reduce our addiction, reduce our dependence on oil from any source. We are fully capable of doing this.
This fall, because of a bill we have already passed, the Johnson Controls company will open up a lithium ion battery production facility in Holland, Michigan, to power electric cars. I
drove the Chevy Volt and look forward to driving the Ford Focus, an all-electric car.
We can reduce our dependence on oil if the U.S. Senate will get the message, get off the dime, and pass a clean energy bill like we have in the House to reduce our dependence on oil and reduce the threat of these horrendous oil spills.
