"I applaud the bipartisan leadership of Senators Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander. Washington state is pleased that the U.S. Senate has today passed the Every Child Achieves Act with overwhelming bipartisan support. This bill is an essential step forward in reforming the federal No Child Left Behind Act. While the goals of that law are important, the punitive aspects of No Child Left Behind and the lack of state flexibility have adversely impacted Washington's schools and students, and need to be fixed. Federal elementary and secondary education programs, and early learning programs, were established to support struggling schools and students with additional federal resources. I encourage Washington's congressional delegation to move this bill to approval in the U.S. House of Representatives and on to the President's desk."
