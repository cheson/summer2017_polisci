"Today's National Climate Assessment release further illustrates the costs that we know climate change is already having on Washington state, and the unacceptable dangers posed by a future without action to reduce carbon pollution. Reduced snowpack threatens essential water resources for communities and agricultural industries in places like the Yakima Valley. Hotter, dryer forests are driving increased and more devastating wildfires in places like Cle Elum and Wenatchee. And ocean acidification threatens our historic shellfish industries and salmon fisheries in places like Shelton and Mason County. And these challenges are increasing.
"Fortunately, we have the knowledge and the tools to rise to this challenge. Washington state is uniquely positioned to lead in reducing carbon pollution, through the development of new clean energy technologies and increasing the energy efficiency of businesses and homes in our state. Last week I outlined a series of actions that our state will take together in the coming months to design a carbon-reduction and clean energy plan that will work best for Washington. And as climate change poses unique but certain threats to every region in the country, and world, I am glad to have a dedicated ally in President Barack Obama advancing his climate action plan at the federal level.
"This assessment confirms that the costs of inaction on climate change are unacceptable for our state, and our children's future. This challenge is significant, but it is matched by tremendous opportunities."
