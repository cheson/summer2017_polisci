Inslee Announces Support of Historic Energy Legislation
Press Release
By: Jay Inslee
Date: April 30, 2007
Location: Washington, DC


U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), a recognized expert in the field of clean energy, announced his support of the comprehensive energy package, entitled the "Comprehensive American Energy Security & Consumer Protection Act" (H.R. 6899), that arrived in the House of Representatives Rules Committee last night on its way to a floor vote this week. Inslee worked with other members of the Democratic Caucus last week to balance the bill between fossil fuels and clean sources of energy. The compromise bill is the House of Representatives' best opportunity to end the long-running deadlock over energy policy.
"If Congress takes no action before September 30th, the ban on off-shore drilling will expire and oil wells could spring up as close as three miles away from beaches around the country," warned Inslee, a member of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee and of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. "In the face of that threat, the Democratic leadership has taken a proactive strategy in addressing our national approach to energy. While allowing some limited drilling to expand domestic supply in states that choose to Â‘opt in,' this legislation also creates permanent protections for coastlines and greatly boosts national support for renewable energy sources."
The carefully crafted bill will lower energy costs to consumers and American taxpayers, invest in renewable energy resources to create American jobs, expand domestic energy supply and promote greater energy efficiency and conservation. Among its provisions, the Comprehensive American Energy Security & Consumer Protection Act will:
* roll back Big Oil tax breaks in a time of record oil company profits,
* establish a 15 percent national renewable electricity standard (RES),
* require oil companies to pay royalties already owed to taxpayers,
* invest in wind, solar and natural gas, 21st-century energy sources to create millions of jobs,
* responsibly open up additional offshore areas for drilling with oil companies footing the bill instead of taxpayers,
* require that many service stations install at least one "alternative fuel pump" for fuels such as natural gas or E85,
* and release oil from the government's stockpile to bring down gas prices.
After discussions about the draft legislation last week, Inslee worked closely with the House Leadership to improve the bill by encouraging policies that give equal ground to our nation's abundant renewable energy resources like cellulosic ethanol and solar power. Inslee pushed to ensure that E-85 and biofuels were supported through the legislation's mandate that gas stations owned by Big Oil provide alternative energy fuel pumps.
"Obviously, fossil fuels are the way of the past. We cannot forever use a 19th-century technology to solve 21st-century problems. But this bill comprehensively addresses the needs of today, while starting the important work of addressing the needs of tomorrow. I am happy that the Leadership recognized important first steps like including E-85 and cellulosic biofuels in our new national commitment to clean energy and breaking our addiction to fossil fuels. It creates a bridge to the coming clean energy economy."
"I believe that this compromise legislation is the beginning of a broader national energy policy that American consumers and businesses deserve," said Inslee.
"With the debut of this legislation, all members of Congress now have a clear choice: either side with American taxpayers and consumers to break our addiction to fossil fuel, or continue to give away our country and climate to Big Oil. As a long-time advocate for the clean energy of the future, my constituents know where I stand."
