Gov. Jay Inslee and chairs and councilmembers from Washington tribes met today for the 27th Annual Centennial Accord, a government-to-government meeting held every year that brings together leaders from the state and tribal governments. The accord this year was hosted by the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation.
State and tribal leaders discussed issues related to education, housing, health care, jobs, climate change and natural resources.
"Gov. Inslee is committed to making sound decisions that reflect the economic diversity and environmental integrity of all those who call this great state home," said the Honorable Brian Cladoosby, Chairman of Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and President of the Association of Washington Tribes. "There is strong history of success with Washington state and we are all fortunate to have this foundation to build a stable economy, restore and protect natural resources, and continue to build healthy communities."
"The Centennial Accord is a foundational building block of our evolving government-to-government relationship," Inslee said. "It is always an honor to meet with tribal leaders. A vibrant and thriving tribal culture is important for all Washingtonians. It is part of who we are as a state."
