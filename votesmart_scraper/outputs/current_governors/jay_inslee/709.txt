The WTO today publicly released its findings that Airbus/EADS has received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies harming American aerospace.
As the Seattle Times explained:
The report said that the subsidies were crucial to Airbus's rapid rise in the jetliner business, taking market share away from Boeing. It flatly states that Airbus's success wouldn't have been possible without $18 billion in illegal launch aid loans and $6 billion in other illegal support from Euroepan [sic] governments.
The New York Times adds:
The ruling also found that Airbus had also received subsidies that helped it develop and sell its A300, A310, A320, A330 and A340 models.
Jay has been fighting to ensure a level playing field for American workers. As he said earlier today:
"Today's announcement validates what we have been saying for quite some time, massive illegal subsidies to Airbus have distorted the market and given Airbus an unfair advantage that is costing American jobs."
"That is why I have worked with my colleagues in Congress to pass an amendment to ensure the Air Force take these illegal subsidies into account in the bidding process. 40 years of illegal subsidies have already done far too much damage. If this unfair advantage is taken into account, I know American workers and manufacturers will be able to make the best product for the best price and offer the best deal for the American taxpayer."
The amendment Jay authored passed the House by a vote of 410-8.
The Everett Herald this week agreed when it said:
Add the obviously unfair advantage illegal subsidies have given Airbus in this process, and Congress had to act. Too much is at stake -- for our fighting forces and our economy.
