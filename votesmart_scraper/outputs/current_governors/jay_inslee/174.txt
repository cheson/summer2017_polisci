Jay believes every child deserves access to education opportunities that prepare them for success -- from early learning, to K-12, to college and beyond. Expanding early learning, increasing graduation rates, eliminating the opportunity gap and helping more students go to college or obtain workforce training are Jay's top priorities.
*Since Jay took office, education funding has increased to adequately fund all-day kindergarten, smaller class sizes in K-3 and programs proven to increase graduation rates. In addition, teachers received their first state-funded cost-of-living adjustment since 2008.
*Jay has long supported early learning programs that are proven to improve student success. As governor he's been a vocal proponent of early learning and has made historic investments in early learning and expanded access to preschool for thousands of children.
*As governor, Jay was proud to advocate for and sign the DREAM Act which ensures all our aspiring high school students who want to go to college can apply for state need grants, regardless of their documentation status.
*College affordability remains a daunting challenge for most students and families. Under Jay's guidance, the 2015 biennium budget expanded financial aid for college bound students and he signed a budget that included cuts in tuition for both 2-year and 4-year college students.
