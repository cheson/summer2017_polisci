Student Aid And Fiscal Responsibility Act Of 2009
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3221) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965, and for other purposes:
* Mr. INSLEE. Madam Chair, I rise to express my support for H.R. 3221, and to express my gratitude to Chairman MILLER for including in this bill a very important section to close gaps in college degree attainment and completion.
* Section 783 of the bill, which provides for innovation in college access and completion national activities, authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to innovative programs that improve student outcomes for college bound students.
* In 2007, only 27.8 percent of college freshmen, or roughly one-fourth, went on to complete their degrees. In the highly competitive 21st century, America can little afford to fall behind in the technology curve; today, China graduates eight times as many engineering students as us, and India five times more.
* We have an abundance of bright students in this country, and by increasing the number of individuals with postsecondary degrees, any expenditure we make towards that end will be returned many times over as these graduates enter the work force and start contributing to what is already the world's largest and most advanced economy.
* In June, I introduced H.R. 3259, to establish grants for college success and completion. My bill, coauthored with Representative REICHERT, would encourage and help students from low-income and disadvantaged families attend college. This group of Americans represents the last great untapped source of American brainpower, as only 6 percent of them are expected to earn a bachelor's degree by age 24--seven and a half times smaller than the expected graduation rates of students from wealthy backgrounds.
