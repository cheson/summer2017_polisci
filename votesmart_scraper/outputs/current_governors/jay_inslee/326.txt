The petition to be filed late today follows several months of good faith negotiations between the state and federal government on a path forward, but the parties were unable to come to agreement.

I have allowed the federal government substantial time to come forward with a plan that satisfies those obligations and they have been unable to make that commitment so far."
The state's petition to the court will include requests for:
