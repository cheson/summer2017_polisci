"I want to thank the House for moving quickly this evening to pass the operating budget. My staff and I will be begin reviewing it immediately and I will sign it this weekend in time to ensure that state government will be open for business Monday morning.
"There is still work to do and I hope lawmakers will find agreement on a capital budget and that the Senate will consider the transportation budget passed by the House. Those are essential bills to help our state economy as we move out of the recession. There is no reason the remaining work can't be completed by Sunday night when I sign the operating budget."
