REQUESTING CLARIFICATION OF REPORT LANGUAGE ON ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT -- (Extensions of Remarks - November 14, 2005)
SPEECH OF
HON. JAY INSLEE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
MONDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2005
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express concern with report language that was included in the Fiscal Year 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations Conference Report (H. Rpt. 109-275). It is my hope that you can assist me in my efforts to seek clarification. The final conference report contains language directing the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to cease funding of an important independent scientific research center based in the Pacific Northwest, known as the Fish Passage Center. The language directs BPA and the Northwest Power and Conservation Council (NPCC) to transfer the functions of the Fish Passage Center in a way that ensures ``seamless continuity of activities'' without giving any direction about how this transfer should take place.
The Northwest Power Act called for the NPCC to establish a Fish and Wildlife Program. That Program has called for BPA to fund the Fish Passage Center for the past 20 years. The data and analyses the Center has provided have been invaluable to the States and tribal fishery managers of the Columbia Basin. BPA should be clear that this report language does not supersede the NW Power Act or the specific provisions in the NPCC's present Fish and Wildlife program calling for a number of key functions to be performed. I certainly would assume that BPA will ensure that the State and tribal fishery managers will have input into how the Center is reconstituted and will take actions to ensure that the fishery managers continue to receive the same independent analyses they have in the past.
