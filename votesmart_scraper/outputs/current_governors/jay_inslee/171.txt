Jay is known as a national leader on climate and clean energy and wrote a book about the economic opportunities of a clean energy future. Protecting Washington's air, land and water isn't just about jobs, however. It's also about the legacy we leave our children. Jay is fighting to protect the clean air, the beautiful waters and lush natural spaces that make Washington one of the most special places to raise a family or start a business.
*Washington is already feeling the effects of climate change, from increasingly acidic waters that threaten our shellfish industry to some of the most severe drought conditions in recent history. Jay knows that Washington is poised to lead the transition to a clean energy future and is working with business and labor leaders, health care providers, communities of color, and legislators on both sides of the aisle to reduce carbon pollution and develop clean energy technologies.
*Jay has worked to protect the beauty and natural resources that make Washington famous by passing legislation to protect our communities and waterways from the dangers of oil transport. As governor, he is helping lead efforts to enact new safety rules to protect communities around the state from significant increases in oil transport by rail.
*Washington's state parks are some of the most beautiful in the nation and help drive a thriving, multi-billion outdoor recreation industry. But funding declined sharply during the recession and our parks began to close or fall into disrepair. Jay is fighting to restore funding and support for Washington's state parks and establish partnerships that provide more children the opportunity to experience outdoor learning programs.
