"The Senate Democrats today presented a sound plan that puts our children ahead of tax breaks and moves us forward on funding education. This is a proposal that acknowledges we have significant work remaining to meet our McCleary obligation. This plan shows students, educators, parents and the court that we're serious about funding our paramount duty. I thank Senate Democrats for taking this seriously and I look forward to working with House and Senate leaders to find agreement on this critical issue."
