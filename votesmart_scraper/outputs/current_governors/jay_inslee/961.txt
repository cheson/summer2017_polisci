ATTORNEY GENERAL ALBERTO GONZALES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY RESOLUTION -- (Extensions of Remarks - August 01, 2007)
* Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today with several of my colleagues to introduce a resolution that would require that the Judiciary Committee initiate an impeachment investigation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. I have introduced this resolution only after careful consideration and exercising a great deal of caution.
* Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 66 stated, ``the powers relating to impeachments are ..... an essential check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the executive.'' The ``encroachments'' made by this Attorney General subvert several core constitutional values.
* I believe that it is clear the Attorney General was involved in the decisions to fire several U.S. Attorneys for not pursuing public corruption cases based on partisan political factors. I also believe that the Attorney General has made false or misleading statements to Congress in order to minimize his role in the warrantless surveillance program, the U.S. Attorney firings, and to otherwise obstruct congressional investigations.
* Our judicial system must operate outside of the political process in order to preserve justice. The American people deserve an independent Justice Department that is not controlled by the political strategists at the White House. Gonzales' lack of candor before Congress perverts and undermines the ability of Congress to trust assurances made by the executive branch and it also retards Congress' ability to carry out its constitutionally mandated functions.
* Based on the facts we know today, I believe that an investigation will reveal that the level of malfeasance of the Attorney General is impeachable. With the President showing no sign of replacing the Attorney General, Congress must assert itself and remove him from office. His removal is essential to preserve the strength of the Congress and to send the clear unambiguous message to future Attorneys General that the politicization of prosecutions and the U.S. Attorneys across the country is a repugnant degradation of the law.
