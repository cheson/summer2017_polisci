Preserve Medicare
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee
Date: April 13, 2011
Location: Washington, DC

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation to our generations who built America. That's why we will not allow the Republicans to terminate Medicare with extreme prejudice.
We will not allow them to turn a guarantee for seniors into a voucher program for the insurance industry. We will not allow them to turn Medicare into ``Medi-gone.'' We will not allow them to give us 6,000 reasons to vote against their hair-brained scheme because they want to put $6,000 worth of more costs on our senior citizens.
This is a noble obligation. It should not be shredded. We should reduce medical inflation, not put this burden on senior citizens. Preserve Medicare and reject the Republican scheme.
