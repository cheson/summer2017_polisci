Gov. Inslee Statement on President Obama's Immigration Speech
Statement

"Tonight President Obama outlined humane, necessary reforms to provide relief to hard-working, law-abiding Washington families and to support our state's economy, including the important agricultural sector. The plan will also increase border security and enforcement where it should be - against criminals and individuals who would pose a threat to our national security.
"I have repeatedly urged Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The president's action should not absolve Congress of its responsibility to act in the face of a broken immigration system. Washington residents and businesses have waited long enough for action."
