Press Release
By: Jay Inslee

Location: Olympia, WA

Gov. Jay Inslee issued an executive order today that brings together state agencies, local public health organizations, law enforcement, tribal governments, and other partners to act on opioids. The executive order identifies key aspects of the state's current opioid response plan that can be implemented immediately as part of a strategic statewide effort to prevent opioid use disorder and overdose deaths.
The executive order was announced at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle with more than 100 county and city leaders, medical professionals and families impacted by opioid use disorder.
"Today is a day of solidarity, a day of renewed resolution and a day of action where we stand together to say enough is enough," Inslee said. "We all have an important role to play in the statewide movement to fight one of the most devastating crises facing our communities today -- the public health crisis of opioids and heroin."
Opioid overdose deaths are now the leading cause of accidental deaths in nearly every part of the state, surpassing motor vehicle deaths and firearm-related deaths. Last year, 718 people died from opioid overdoses in Washington. In the first three months of this year, at least 188 died due to opioid overdose. While prescription opioid drug deaths have declined, heroin overdose deaths are increasing, particularly among young people.
"Opioid use disorder is a preventable and treatable chronic disease, much like diabetes or heart disease, and needs to be treated as such," Secretary of Health John Wiesman said.
Washington has already taken some important actions, developing a first-in-the-nation set of guidelines to help health care providers treat pain, launching a Statewide Opioid Response Plan, and joining a multi-state compact.
