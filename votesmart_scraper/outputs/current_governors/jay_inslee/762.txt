Public Statements
A New Economic Vision
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Jan. 20, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we know that job creation is Congress's job one, and we passed some time ago a great job creation engine for a clean energy economy in the United States. We passed that months ago in the U.S. House, and we know we have a tremendous opportunity for job creation. Building electric cars: I drove a Ford Focus all-electric car a couple of months ago. Building solar thermal plants: We now have contracts developing out in the Southwest. Building new energy-efficient windows: We heard from an entrepreneur the other day about the tremendous advances in energy efficiency.
Yet, to realize this economic vision, the U.S. Senate needs to get off the dime and pass a clean energy bill, and those who think that we should do nothing because Copenhagen didn't reach an agreement, I'll tell you what: the Chinese are not waiting. They're building solar plants. They're building electrical lithium-ion batteries. They're building new energy-efficient windows.
The U.S. Senate needs to join us and create a job-creating engine with clean energy and pass the energy bill.
