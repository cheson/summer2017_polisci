Statement from Gov. Jay Inslee regarding today's Supreme Court decision on Eyman's I-1366

"The Court today explained its decision in September to allow I-1366 to be voted upon, but has not yet taken up the primary issue of the constitutionality of the initiative. The ultimate answer to that question has enormous implications for legislators who will soon be reconvening in Olympia and facing many difficult decisions about how to find the resources to comply with this same court's multi-billion-dollar McCleary decision. I am hopeful the Court has the opportunity to bring finality to this issue as quickly as possible."
