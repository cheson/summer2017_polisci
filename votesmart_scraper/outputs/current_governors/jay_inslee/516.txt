"Washington is a national leader in the fight for marriage equality, and I'm proud that our state today joined two friend-of-the court briefs to bring that right to couples across the country. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson has done admirable work in helping to shape these briefs and in ensuring that our state continues to be a strong voice in this important campaign for civil rights."
