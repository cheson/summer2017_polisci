Inslee Pushes for Webcaster Royalty Rate Fix
Press Release

Location: Washington, DC


Today, the US House of Representatives will consider a bill to allow all webcasters to redress a long-standing wrong in their royalty rates. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), which determines royalty rates for the use of music over Internet radio services, has prevented the growth of this innovative music platform by assigning a royalty rate that is too high, endangering Internet radio. The Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008 will allow private parties to agree on a deal to correct the faulty decision of the CRB by clearing a path for private negotiations to continue while Congress is in recess allowing any and all groups to work out a settlement amongst themselves to replace the astronomically high fees set by the government with fees agreed about by all parties.

This is a bi-partisan bill, supported by both the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee. Congressman Inslee is pleased this bill has gotten the attention it deserves and hopes to see it passed by the end of the day.
* This bill does not affect the scope of performance rights or any underlying copyright law, and it does not impact broadcasters.
* This bill simply authorizes SoundExchange, on behalf of copyright owners and performers, to negotiate an alternative royalty agreement before the end of the year with any Internet radio service.
* It will benefit all webcasters, including NPR, college webcasters, small webcasters and broadcasters who put their stations on the Internet.
* Because Internet radio royalties operate under a government license, Congressional authority is required to allow any negotiated settlement to take effect.
* This is bipartisan legislation sponsored by Reps. Inslee, Berman, Smith, Conyers and Manzullo.
