Issue Position

My number one priority is creating American jobs and growing our economy. We need to move fast to invest and grow our clean energy economy, make credit available to small businesses who are the engine of our economy, and make sure Washington working families are building the next generation of airplanes for our military.
To create jobs and grow the economy I have:
* Voted to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which has created or saved 3.5 million jobs and cut taxes for 98% of Americans
* Voted to pass the HIRE Act, which created incentives for employers to hire 5.6 million unemployed Americans through June, including over 153,000 hires in Washington state, spurring investments in small business and infrastructure
* Supported legislation making $30 billion available immediately to small businesses to help them expand
* Fought to expand investments for biotechnology in health insurance reform legislation
* Protecting U.S. jobs in important Washington State industries such as aluminum, cement, and pulp and paper by negotiating the Inslee/Doyle amendment to the House-passed energy bill
