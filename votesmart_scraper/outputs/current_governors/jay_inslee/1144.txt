BEING LESS CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2004)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, sometimes I think Democrats are a little too critical of President Bush. Now, it is true that he took a huge surplus and turned it into the largest fiscal deficit in American history; that is true. It is true that he promised Americans that he would protect seniors, and the next day gave Americans the largest Medicare premium increase, essentially a tax increase, in American history, of 17 percent. It is true that he has the largest loss of jobs, over 2.5 million jobs, since Herbert Hoover.
But now some Democrats have even criticized the President for refusing to take his physical and thereby squandering $1 million of flight training when he served in the National Guard. I think we need to put that in context. If he continued to fly, he may have crashed the plane.
We need to be a little less critical of this President.
