"I've asked both sides to compromise and come to the middle and this is progress in the right direction. The budget compromise proposed today is a solid and much-needed step forward in our negotiations. House and Senate leaders have provided a reasonable and responsible budget that addresses our top challenge of increasing funding for our schools. The proposed Education Investment Act would go even further and I hope it, too, will be considered. This proposal is a good faith effort to help us finish the people's business. It significantly scales back new revenue, but preserves essential services that are necessary for keeping our kids healthy and ready to learn.
"But if we're going to finish on time, we need all sides to come together now."
