"Today's bipartisan support for the climate action bill is welcome news. We've seen the impacts of climate change already affecting some of Washington's key industries with shellfish growers moving operations due to ocean acidification and the farmers in Eastern Washington seeing reduced water supplies as a result of reduced snowpack. This is our opportunity to not only make sure we protect those important industries, but also grow new jobs in the design and manufacturing of clean energy. This bill is a collaborative, bipartisan step forward that will allow us to seize the environmental and economic opportunities of addressing climate change and preserve the legacy of stewardship we owe our children."
