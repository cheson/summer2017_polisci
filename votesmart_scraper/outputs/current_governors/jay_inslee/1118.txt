Mr. Inslee. I do. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I am sorry I haven't been able to hear your testimony. I will read it. I just want your comments on the wildland-urban interface, and I just briefly picked up that it looked like less than half of the expenditures are in the wildland-urban interface even within Federal ownership. Is that accurate and is there any changes coming in that regard, or what could you tell us about that?
Ms. Nazzaro. These are numbers that the agency reported, and we did not get behind any of the numbers to determine accuracy. I mentioned that earlier, that we did not go in and verify or validate any of the data that they gave us. It may be more appropriate for you to ask the agency how accurate they are or what direction they are moving.
Mr. Inslee. Is there anything in your report about sort of the thinking of the agency in that distribution model? In other words, they felt statutorily compelled to be at 50/50 or they were unable to do a different allocation that they wanted to, any findings in that regard?
Ms. Nazzaro. That isn't something that we pursued with them, but the overall priority has been determined to be these communities that are near, that are in the urban interface as you mention, and that has been set as a priority and certainly I would expect that they would be increasingly focusing on that area.
Mr. Inslee. Thank you.
