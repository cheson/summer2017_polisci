"It is great news to see that both the House and Senate have passed legislation with bipartisan support to ensure we continue the necessary next steps towards fully funding our schools. These bills are based on the recommendations from the bipartisan workgroup I convened last year. I appreciate all the work of prime sponsors Rep. Kristine Lytton and Sen. Ann Rivers and others who continue to work collaboratively on behalf of our state's one million school children. Legislators can get this done, and I remain confident they will send this bill to my desk."
