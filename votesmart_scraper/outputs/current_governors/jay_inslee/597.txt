Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Representative Rick Larsen today congratulated Nichols Brothers Boat Builders, located in Freeland, for winning a federal grant under the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD) Assistance to Small Shipyards program. Nichols Brothers received $519,761 for the purchase of a 25-ton and a 40-ton mobile crane. Larsen is the Ranking Member of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, which oversees MARAD and authorizes the Assistance to Small Shipyards program.
"This grant is a smart federal investment that will help Nichols Brothers increase their productivity and continue to create and support local jobs," said Larsen.
According to MARAD, Assistance to Small Shipyards grants are awarded "to help make capital and infrastructure improvements that facilitate the efficiency, cost-effectiveness and quality of domestic ship construction, conversion or repair for commercial and federal government use." Nichols Brothers was one of 13 shipyards nationwide chosen to receive a grant.
