Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I just want to relate one call from a small businessman who told me we needed health care reform so that his wife can finally start a small business of her own and be freed from the insurance industry that stopped her from getting insurance.
I would like to enter into a colloquy with Mr. Waxman.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to clarify section 1188, the generic fill provision in the bill. This section allows Medicare part D plans to waive patient's copays for generic, bioequivalent and biosimilar drugs. I believe that absent explicit approval from the patient's doctor, this inducement should only apply to those biosimilars that have been rated ``interchangeable'' by the FDA, meaning that they can be expected to produce the same clinical result in any given patient and switching medicines poses no greater risk than not switching. With respect to biosimilars that have not been rated as interchangeable, is it your intent that under this provision patients could not be switched to a non-interchangeable biosimilar drug without an explicit request by a patient and approval by their doctor?

Mr. INSLEE. Today we should pass this bill.
