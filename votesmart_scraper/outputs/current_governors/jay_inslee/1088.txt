EXPRESSING THE GRAVE DISAPPROVAL OF THE HOUSE REGARDING MAJORITY OPINION OF SUPREME COURT IN KELO V. CITY OF NEW LONDON -- (Extensions of Remarks - July 11, 2005)
SPEECH OF
HON. JAY INSLEE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
THURSDAY, JUNE 30, 2005
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, today I voice my opposition to the Supreme Court's recent decision granting local governments the power to seize private property for economic development. The Constitution protects an individual's right to own a home free of government intervention, and ensures just compensation for any property taken in the name of the greater public good, such as vitally necessary roads or water projects. The Court erred in its determination that private development interests constitute a legitimate public good. Private interests should not justify the bull-dozing of homes in a working-class neighborhood. This divided decision, Kelo v. New London, may represent an open invitation for abuse by local governments and private developers at the expense of hardworking Americans who have a right to their property. While I oppose the Supreme Court's decision, I also believe in the separation of powers and do not believe it is appropriate for Congress to seek to punish the Court for its decision. It is my hope that the Supreme Court has another opportunity to correct this bad decision, and provide greater protections for homeowners.
