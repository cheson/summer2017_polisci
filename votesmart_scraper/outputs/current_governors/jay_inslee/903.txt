"We are outraged that this decision taps European Airbus and its foreign workers to provide a tanker to our American military.

"This is a blow to the American aerospace industry, American workers and America's men and women in uniform.

"Boeing has 75 years of experience in building the tankers our military flies. Washington state's workers are second to none and so is their product.

"At a time when our economy is hurting, this is a blow not only to our state, but the more than 40 states across the country who would help build this national plane.

"We will be asking tough questions about the decision to outsource this contract. We look forward to hearing the Air Force's justification."
