IRAQ WATCH -- (House of Representatives - March 30, 2004)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. If the gentleman will yield on that point, I would like to comment on what you just said, but before I do so, I would like to make a statement of why we are here tonight.
This is months after the Iraq war started, and I just want to state the reason I am here tonight is the people who are fighting this war deserve answers of how this war started based on false information. If it takes us years to get to the bottom of how this was started, why it was started and who started it so that they can be held accountable, we are going to be here until we get those answers.
But you have put your finger on a very, very important point; and that is that the people who this administration are attacking, Mr. O'Neill, Mr. Clarke, Ambassador Wilson, the actuary of the Medicare fund, all of whom are being attacked by this administration, their statements have proven to be true in the last several weeks. One of the great ironies of this is that this administration is attacking civil servants for telling the truth.
Look at Mr. O'Neill. As you indicated, he was attacked because he had the temerity, and this was the Secretary of the Treasury, a high-level person appointed by the President of the United States on a personal basis. Mr. O'Neill said, "In the 23 months I was there, I never saw anything that I would characterize as evidence of weapons of mass destruction. There were allegations and assertions by people." That is from Mr. O'Neill's book.
He said that in January 30, 2001, before September 11, the President instructed at the National Security Council meeting, that the President directed the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, to "examine our military options" with regard to Iraq.
