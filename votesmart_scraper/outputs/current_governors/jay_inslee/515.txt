"This is a good start. The state of Washington had been pushing to get this waste out of Hanford and I'm heartened that the increased attention on these leaking tanks has prompted DOE to act.
"I do have some remaining questions and concerns. We need to make sure that this action does not jeopardize progress on the vitrification plant. I will be insistent that the full cycle of technical review and permitting is resolved so that any grouted material does not remain in the state of Washington. We also need a clear determination of which tanks hold TRU waste that can be shipped out of Washington."
