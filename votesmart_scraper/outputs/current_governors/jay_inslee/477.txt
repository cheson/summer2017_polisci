"I am pleased the Senate passed the operating budget, which keeps us on track to have a budget in place by the start of the new biennium on Monday.
"I expect the House to act quickly and pass it as well, so it can be sent to my office.
"Once I receive the budget, we will carefully but quickly review and sign it no later than Sunday.
"This budget makes important investments in education, putting $1 billion toward meeting our constitutional obligation to adequately fund basic education.
"It provides funding for more than six thousand additional teachers across our state.
"It protects programs that serve the most vulnerable and ensure public safety, as well as addresses shortfalls in some critical areas of state government, including our state parks."
