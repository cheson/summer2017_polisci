Education is the key to our economic, social and cultural success. Washingtonians have long believed that putting education first was in our best interest, that is why we have enshrined education funding protections in state law. On the federal level, I have been working to make sure resources are available for all students, young and old, and to remove barriers to achievement.
That is why I have:
* Supported an additional $205 million in emergency job funding for states to keep 2,900 teachers in Washington state schools
* Support funding for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act
* Supported Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch programs because children learn best when they are not hungry
* Supported funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
* Authored H.R. 3259, the Establishing Grants for College Access and Completion Act of 2009, to establish a competitive grant program for organizations that increase college graduation rates for under-served populations who enter and complete college, making education a realistic goal for all kids in America
