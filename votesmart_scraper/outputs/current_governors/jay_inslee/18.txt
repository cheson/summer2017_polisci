Press Release

Location: Unknown

From apples to airplanes, and much more, markets for Washington products reach far beyond our state's borders. That's why nearly 50 people from across government, businesses and industries have just wrapped a week-long trip to Guadalajara, Jalisco and Mexico City, Mexico to deepen relationships, increase trade and commerce and highlight Washington products.
"Washington is more dependent on international trade than any other U.S. state, and we have especially close economic and cultural ties with Mexico," Gov. Jay Inslee said. "This trade mission has been an excellent opportunity to strengthen this important relationship and continue to highlight our fantastic goods and products to Mexican leaders and consumers."
Delegation members included: representatives from the state departments of Agriculture and Commerce, the governor's office, and local city and county governments; business leaders from Boeing, Alaska Airlines, Microsoft, Amazon and others; education representatives from the University of Washington and Washington State University; as well as the Trade Development Alliance of Greater Seattle and Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, and the Washington State Dairy Farmers.
