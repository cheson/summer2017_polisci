DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. I want to thank Chairman Skelton for his help. A couple of amendments, one en bloc, will help advance the cause of efficiency and environmental responsibility. In this amendment we have an amendment that will encourage the DOD to look at systems to save energy in their computer networks. We have the ability to reduce our electric usage 20 to 30 percent. That helps us in our load growth.
It's a great amendment. I want to thank the Chair. Later today we will have an amendment that will assist the service to move forward to judge our global warming emissions as well, and our procurement policy. A great thing for the environment, great thing for the service as part of our universal effort to advance several causes.
I want to thank the Chair for getting both of these in there.
