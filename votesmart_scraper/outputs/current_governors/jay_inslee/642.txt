Public Statements
Protect the Clean Air Act
Floor Speech

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to warn my colleagues and the American public of a nasty little amendment in this CR. An amendment will be offered by the Republicans today to eliminate the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the clear mandates of the Clean Air Act.
The Supreme Court has ruled that the EPA owes the American public an obligation to reduce certain of these dangerous toxic gases. And yet, incredibly, the Republican Party wants to eliminate the ability to enforce that bill. Now, I think of this amendment as the dirty air act. And it is the dirty air act because if they pass it, that is what we'll get, dirty air.
Now, Americans, and I want to warn my colleagues, a poll distributed by the American Lung Association shows Americans are adamantly opposed to this amendment. They know we want clean air. They know we don't want more children's asthma. And we have got to defeat this amendment, defeat the dirty air act, keep the Clean Air Act as the law of this country.
