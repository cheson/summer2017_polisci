MICROSOFT AND THE EUROPEAN UNION -- (House of Representatives - March 24, 2004)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to express concern about the European Union's first step in a decision against Microsoft, one of the most creative engines of economic growth in American history. The reason we all ought to be concerned about this European Union decision is it essentially breaches and disturbs, if not destroys, a carefully wrought-out resolution of antitrust issues in the American judicial system.
Whatever one thinks of our judicial system, we ought to know one thing, that it is better that these matters be resolved in the American system than internationally when the international groups now could turn into a feeding frenzy, if you will, of upsetting this apple cart after we have worked for years and millions of dollars of effort to have a very carefully calibrated resolution of these antitrust issues.
We hope that our government expresses and does not acquiesce in this issue since we need to have comity and a consistent application of antitrust rules across borders. We hope that our government will take that position.
END
