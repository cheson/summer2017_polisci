"Washington lost a historic figure today with the passing of former U.S. House Speaker Tom Foley. Trudi and I extend our condolences to Heather, the entire Foley family and his friends.
"Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, prosecutor, Ambassador to Japan -- Tom Foley did all of those things in the course of his life. And at the heart of every one of those roles was a passion to serve. He served the victims of crime. He served the citizens of Spokane. He served the state of Washington. And he served this great nation of ours. He was a giant at a time when bipartisan cooperation for the good of the country was the norm, not the exception.
"He dedicated his life to making his community, his state, and his country a better place. He did it by reaching across the aisle, by bringing people together, by finding common ground. A true statesman knows how to unite people around their mutual, shared interests, while still respecting the differences among individuals. That's the example Tom set, and it's something all public servants should strive to emulate.
"It was an honor to serve with him during my time in Congress. He will be missed."
