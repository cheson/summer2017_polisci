Clean Energy Jobs
Floor Speech

Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, later this week or next week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will advance President Obama's clean energy jobs program, and we will do that by maximizing the job creation potential of renewable clean energy and energy efficiency.
I saw the enormous potential of job creation this weekend in Seattle, Washington, where I went to the MacDonald-Miller Company, a company that installs highly efficient energy efficiency heating and cooling systems, where they have found they can reduce energy usage by 12 percent simply by putting in a system that will adjust the energy depending on what the temperature is outside.
Now if we could get huge efficiency measures like that and put hundreds of people to work, like they are doing at MacDonald-Miller, we're going to find that we can grow our economy while solving global climate change as well.
The energy bill we will do will require 15 percent clean energy and 5 percent efficiency. That's a vision for the future. We're going to pass President Obama's clean energy jobs plan. That's a good thing for the U.S. economy.
