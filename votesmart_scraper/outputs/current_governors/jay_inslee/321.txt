"On behalf of nearly 7 million Washingtonians, Trudi and I send our deepest condolences to the students, staff and families of Marysville-Pilchuck High School, and particularly to the families of the young victims of today's tragedy.
"While there is much we don't know about today's shooting, I am certain law enforcement is doing all it can to provide answers. As we seek to understand what seems inexplicable, I know the families of Marysville-Pilchuck will find their friends and neighbors at their side to provide comfort and support in the coming days, weeks and months.
"The loss of life today has left us grief-stricken and anguished -- and I'm sure many young people and their parents are worried, too. Tonight, hug your children a little longer and seek comfort from loved ones. Take care of each other."
