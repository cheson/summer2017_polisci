You Can't Beat Something With Nothing
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, our current health care system--and it really is not a system--is not up to the standards of America. I want to address the issue of cost. Our wages have been going down a black hole of health care costs. Health care costs are rising two to three times faster than our wages. If we want to know why we're having trouble making ends meet, it's because our money is going into health care much faster than our wages are improving.
Now what does the other party have to solve this problem? Nothing. We are offering some suggestions on ways to have higher quality health care costs, reduce the cost, and reduce the rate of medical inflation. There is one principle that we ought to have on a bipartisan basis: you can't beat something with nothing. I am encouraging our Members across the aisle to join us to bring change to this system so we can restrain the rate on medical inflation and pass health care reform.
