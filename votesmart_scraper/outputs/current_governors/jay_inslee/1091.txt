DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, those who believe in privacy and not being dictated to by the U.S. Congress in their most private, intimate decisions should vote against this amendment.
Two friends of mine my age recently went in for prostate treatment. When you go in for prostate cancer, they tell you you have a choice of various alternatives. Some may give you a higher chance of survival, but also a higher chance of impotency.
A University of Chicago study showed that if you tell men that they have a chance of impotency that cannot be cured because you do not have access to these ED drugs, they will, 68 percent of the time, take surgery that could lessen their chances of survival. This is not recreation. These are helping men make decisions that are going to help prolong their lives. We should reject this amendment.
