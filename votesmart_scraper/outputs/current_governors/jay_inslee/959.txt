IN SUPPORT OF AMENDMENT TO H.R. 3093 REQUIRING USE OF ``ENERGY STAR'' LIGHT BULBS -- (Extensions of Remarks - August 02, 2007)
* Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I would like to commend Representative Jane Harman (D-CA) and Representative Fred Upton (R-MI) for their unfailing hard work and dedication to the issue of light bulb efficiency in the United States Congress. Their leadership in this area has greatly contributed to our national effort to prevent global climate change and reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources. Recently Ms. Harman and Mr. Upton offered an amendment to H.R. 3093, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008. This amendment prohibited funds to be used to purchase light bulbs unless the light bulb has the ``ENERGY STAR'' or ``Federal Energy Management Program'' designation. During this vote, Rollcall 738, I erroneously voted against the measure which I wholeheartedly support.
* Since indoor and outdoor lighting accounts for up to fifteen percent of energy use in the average residence, inefficient light bulbs can consume large amounts of excess energy.
* With the advent of compact fluorescent light bulbs, Americans have been given an alternative to inefficient incandescent bulbs which waste up to ninety-five percent of consumed energy as heat. These long-lasting high-efficiency fluorescent light bulbs provide equivalent illumination as incandescent light bulbs, so neither comfort nor convenience is sacrificed in this energy-saving endeavor. However, they consume up to sixty-six percent less energy, leading to major decreases in energy bills. By simply replacing the light bulbs in their homes, our constituents will be saving money in addition to energy.
* Ms. Harman and Mr. Upton have empowered Americans with an uncomplicated, affordable plan that offers only benefits to both individuals and our nation as a whole. As we look to renewable energy sources to minimize our foreign oil dependence and increase national security, each citizen can do his or her part both at home and at work with the nearly effortless action of changing a light bulb.
