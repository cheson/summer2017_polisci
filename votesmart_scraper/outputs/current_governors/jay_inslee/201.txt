Gov. Jay Inslee today received an award from the Washington Newspaper Publishers Association for his work to keep state government open, transparent and accountable.
"Transparency in government doesn't happen by default," said Inslee. "It takes a culture of transparency and leaders who are committed to openness, even when the information might not be flattering. It also takes a vibrant news media committed to keeping the public accurately informed."
As governor, Inslee has chosen not to exercise an executive privilege exemption to withhold records from public disclosure.
"I haven't seen the necessity of using such a privilege," Inslee said, "and I have no intention of changing course in the remainder of my administration."
"You do the hard work of helping explain government," Inslee told convention attendees. "We fundamentally agree that the public has a right to this information. I want people to see what we do, and our society depends on you to help make that happen."
