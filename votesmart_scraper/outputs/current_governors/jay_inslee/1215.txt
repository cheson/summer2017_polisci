On 10 June 1999, an oil pipeline ruptured in Bellingham, Wsh., resulting in the deaths of two children and one young man. Since that date, Jay has been fighting a two-pronged battle to ensure that the pipelines running under our communities are safe. He successfully has worked to ensure that the pipeline that exploded in Bellingham is water-pressure tested. He also introduced strong pipeline safety legislation in the House, and has been working to get it enacted.
