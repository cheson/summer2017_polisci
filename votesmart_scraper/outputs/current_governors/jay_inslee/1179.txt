EARTH DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2004)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to join this effort on Earth Day. I have two messages, one inspirational and one that desires, frankly, a good fight. Let me start with the inspirational message. I want to tell my colleague about a friend of mine, a Dennis Hayes, who as a young man the first Earth Day stood up and said, I am going to become personally committed to the environment of the globe. And he became, actually, the manager of the organization that conducted the first Earth Day. And Dennis Hayes is still fired with the vigor of dealing with these multiple environmental challenges, and he is working in Seattle now for the Bullet Foundation, which helps promote many great ideas and environmental agendas.
I hope other people who are of his youth become inspired on multiple environmental challenges now, politically and otherwise, and stay working as long as Dennis has, who is still working on solar cell technology and a host of other efforts to deal with our energy.
I appreciate this opportunity. We will have other opportunities next week to continue this discussion.
