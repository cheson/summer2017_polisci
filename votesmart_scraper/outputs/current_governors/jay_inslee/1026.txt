ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment neither clarifies nor modifies any provision of the Federal Power Act. Nor does it ratify any action previously taken by FERC. The amendment would merely prevent entities that engaged in fraudulent and deceptive trading practices during the western states energy crisis, as determined by FERC, from profiting by their misconduct by collecting termination fees.
