"The White House told me this morning that President Obama will visit the SR 530 slide site April 22. This will give the president the opportunity to see firsthand the devastation wrought by the slide as well as the incredible community spirit flourishing in Oso, Arlington and Darrington. The White House said the president will meet with families, first responders and recovery workers.
"From the earliest days following the slide, the president has closely monitored events in the area and shown his concerns for the victims and their families. He and his team have been important partners in the response effort, and I believe this visit will strengthen those ties as we face the tough work ahead."
