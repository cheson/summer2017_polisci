Inslee encouraged by Washington State Gains in Base Closure Proposal
13 May 2005
U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee announced today that he was encouraged by the Department of Defense (DOD) decision to keep open crucial military facilities in Washington State during DOD's base closure recommendations. Under the DOD realignment and closure proposal issued today, Washington State would actually gain positions from other areas of the country, including 1,401 positions at Naval Station Bremerton. In Inslee's district, Naval Base Bangor and the Keyport Undersea Warfare Center would keep their existing personnel and benefit from the nearby expansion in Bremerton.
Said Inslee, "The Department of Defense recognized today the tremendous value and efficiency of our military facilities in Kitsap County and the Puget Sound Area. Our strategic location near the Pacific, along with a good centralized pool of talent are attractive reasons for Washington State to remain a leader in military command and operations. I applaud the hard work of the Washington State delegation in conveying the national importance of our facilities. The Department of Defense has a tough job in selecting bases to close and realign, and today they showed great judgment on Puget Sound's role in national security. The gains in Kitsap County will bring additional good jobs to our community and affirm the importance of military workers in our region."
