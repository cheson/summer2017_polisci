"Planned Parenthood provides millions of women across the country access to a full range of affordable health care and family planning services. National extremist organizations are engaged in a concerted effort to discredit, and ultimately eliminate, an organization that so many women rely on.
"Here in Washington state, where we have long fought to protect women's access to family planning services, Planned Parenthood is on the front lines of women's health care. I stand with them in their efforts to ensure every woman needing access to safe and legal reproductive health care can get it."
