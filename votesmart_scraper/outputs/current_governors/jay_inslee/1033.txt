Dear President Bush:
For almost a year, you have denied the American public an explanation of your position on birth control. On May 26th 2005, a member of the press corps asked your then White House Press Secretary, Scott McClellan, whether or not you support the right to birth control. Since then, many of us have written four letters asking you to delineate your position and reporters have
repeatedly asked you to explicitly state your support for access to birth control. We have received no response to our letters, and Mr. McClellanYs answers to press inquiries on the subject were ambiguous at best. We are left wondering if you oppose access to birth control.
As noted in an article published by the Washington Post (Plan B Battles Embroil States 2/27/2006), whether a woman can quickly obtain birth control in America increasingly dependson where she lives. Around the country, state legislators are introducing bills that would restrict a woman's access to birth control. We are concerned that those who seek to restrict or eliminate safe, legal abortions are expanding their goals and now also seek to restrict access to emergency contraception and other forms of prescription birth control.
There are 42 million women in America who must use some method of birth control in order to avoid unintended pregnancies- many of them married. These women would like you to be clear that you support their right to contraception.
