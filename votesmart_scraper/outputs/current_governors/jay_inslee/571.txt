By Representative Jay Inslee
In a speech at the 2009 National Clean Energy Summit 2.0, President Bill Clinton said that energy efficiency is "the easiest-to-reach low-hanging fruit that will create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions." Absolutely true.
Last week, President Obama, with President Clinton alongside, announced $4 billion in federal and private green building investments as part of President Obama's Better Building Initiative, which set a national target of improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings by 20 percent by 2020. The U.S. Green Building Council has estimated that the broader Better Buildings Initiative has the potential to create up to 114,000 jobs. Energy efficiency opportunities like these create real jobs that will make our country better, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, clean our air, and save money for businesses.
It's great to see that two local initiatives have pledged their support for the Better Buildings Initiative. Excerpted from the White House release:
Green Sports Alliance
The Green Sports Alliance is currently comprised of 35 member sports teams representing over 20 million square feet of sports venues and facilities. Supporting the Better Buildings Challenge encourages professional sports teams and their venues to implement conservation projects that will result in significant financial and environmental performance.
