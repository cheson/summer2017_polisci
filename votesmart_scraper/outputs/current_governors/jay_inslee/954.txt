Statement on the Resignation of Attorney General Gonzales
U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee released the following statement on the resignation of embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales:

"In the scope of American History, this lesson should be that the attorney general owes his loyalty to the constitution and the law, not to the person who hired him.

"What we have experienced with the forced resignation of federal prosecutors was just one symptom of a politicized Department of Justice under Alberto Gonzales. Never again should the judicial process become a tool of the political operations at the White House.

"The geniuses who created the U.S. Constitution recognized that when a cabinet member's malfeasance jeopardizes basic democracy, that official should be subject to an impeachment inquiry by Congress. It is unfortunate that it took pressure from all points of the compass to obtain this obvious resolution."

A former small town prosecutor, Inslee authored an impeachment inquiry resolution into the conduct of Gonzales. In filing the resolution, he was joined by five other prosecutors; U.S. Reps. Xavier Bacerra (D-Calif.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Michael Arcuri (D-N.Y.), Ben Chandler (D-Ky.), and Dennis Moore (D-Kan.). Thirty members of the House cosponsored the resolution.
