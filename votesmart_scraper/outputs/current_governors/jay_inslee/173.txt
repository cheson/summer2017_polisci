Jay knows that Washington's people and businesses are among the most innovative and forward-looking in the world. He's making sure we're growing Washington's key industries -- agriculture, aerospace, military, life sciences, maritime, clean energy and information technology -- and creating good-paying jobs for people in every corner of our state. Unemployment has dropped steadily and economic activity is back to pre-recession levels, and Jay will continue waking up every morning thinking about how to put more people to work.
*A strong economy is an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy. Jay is fighting to make sure those who are willing to work hard are able to provide for their basic necessities -- increasing Washington's minimum wage, ensuring workers have access to paid sick leave, and funding the Working Families Tax Credit for low-income families are all important efforts he's helping lead in Olympia.
*Jay created an Office of Economic Development and Competitiveness to recruit new companies, help current companies thrive, and ensure we're creating good-paying jobs for Washington workers now and into the future.
*Jay has made workforce training and education a top priority. Our world-class workforce is what helps us attract world-class businesses. Expanding STEM opportunities in our K-12 system, training programs at community and technical colleges and apprenticeship programs help our students and workers compete for good-paying, high-skill jobs.
*Jay worked to secure bipartisan support and passage for a 16-year, $16 billion transportation package with investments in safety, maintenance, and multimodal to create jobs, give commuters more options, and strengthen our long-term economic competitiveness.
