Seattle has been confirmed as the first stop for Chinese President Xi Jinping and his delegation who will be visiting the United States next week.
Gov. Jay Inslee, who visited China in 2013 as part of a trade mission to Asia, invited President Xi to Washington State in recognition of the state's strong economic, academic and cultural ties to China. The governor wrote President Xi to say there were significant opportunities to work together on business, research and climate action.
"Over the years, Washington companies have developed strong ties with China, and hundreds of millions of citizens use products from Boeing, Microsoft, Starbucks and other Washington companies on a daily basis," Inslee wrote. "We know that our ties with the Chinese Academy of Sciences are just the beginning of a relationship that will allow the carbon pollution reduction goals the U.S. and China recently established to become a reality."
