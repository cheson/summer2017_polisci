* Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, there have been times in history where great technological challenges have been overcome by the combined efforts from both government policy and scientific innovation. We are sitting at one of those critical junctions today. Our country is taking active steps to curb our energy consumption by implementing energy efficiency policies and is also highly engaged in scientific innovation to make renewable technologies, such as solar, a sustainable part of our total energy portfolio. I am here today to discuss several promising technological advancements in solar systems that might one day help reduce our country's dependence on foreign energy sources.
* As we know, solar technologies come in several flavors. Some systems such as solar photovoltaic convert the sun's energy directly into useable electricity. Other technologies such as solar-thermal systems use the sun's energy to boil water that then turns a steam turbine which ultimately generates electricity.
* Development of solar photovoltaic systems has relied on manufacturing processes developed in the microelectronics industry, which has relied heavily on silicon as the main material component. These manufacturing methods can be slow and they yield relatively expensive solar cells. Through technological advancements in material science, new materials such as copper-indium-selenide (CIS) or copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS) have resulted in low-cost solar cells. Solar cells made with these materials can even be printed much like you would print a document with your ink-jet printer at home.
* While CIS/CIGS photovoltaic advancements are driving manufacturing costs down, further advancements in silicon solar cells are also progressing. Advancements have been possible through new techniques used in nanotechnology labs across the country. The new generation of solar cells, instead of being constructed of flat layers of material on a silicon wafer, may end up looking more like microscopic cities. These ``3D'' solar cells are showing promise as they may be able to better absorb the sun's energy and convert it to usable electricity.
* Great things are happening in the solar photovoltaic world, but important advancements in the solar thermal world are also taking place. Recently concerns about the amount of water used in generation of electricity with solar-thermal power plants were raised; these concerns can be misleading as similar amounts of cool water are needed for coal or natural gas power plants. Regardless the solar-thermal industry has responded with an innovative dry-cooling process which could reduce the water consumed to almost nothing.
* There are some that want a silver bullet to lay to rest our country's issues with foreign energy sources. While no such bullet exists, we can make real progress by encouraging development in all these promising technologies in parallel. Doing so can help States, like Washington State, achieve goals outlined in their renewable portfolio standards. On a larger scale we can move our entire country towards a clean energy source.
* I hope that my colleagues here in Congress will help me in moving relevant bills swiftly through our legislative process.
