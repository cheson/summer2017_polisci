NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment really is critical because we know one thing about America: when it sets grand goals, it is roused to great advance. When John F. Kennedy on May 9, 1961, stood right behind me and set a goal of America to go to the Moon in 10 years, the U.S. Congress did not complain that at that moment we did not have all the technologies we need to set that goal. But Kennedy knew that when America sets goals, it achieves them.
Today, we set a goal to have 15 percent of our energy from renewable sources. We know this is an achievable goal. We know that every State in the continental United States, including the Southeast, has more solar energy capacity than Germany, that today, cloudy Germany is getting massive amounts of solar energy.
The reason is that we understand that we are the people who invented the airplane, the Internet, software and mapped the human genome. And we are going to do this together. We are going to use clean coal for 80, perhaps 89, percent using our fossil fuel. Is it too much to say that we will use 11 percent for renewables, for wave, biofuels, solar, and 4 percent for efficiency?
This is a moment for America to have the same spirit of the original Apollo Project, and for the moment do not shirk and fear. Let's live our dreams. Let's live our aspirations. Let's pass this amendment.
