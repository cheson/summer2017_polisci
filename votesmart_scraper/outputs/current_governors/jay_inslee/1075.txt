COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2005 -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2005)

AMENDMENT NO. 7 OFFERED BY MR. INSLEE
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the Chair's assistance on this.
We are offering this amendment in an attempt to address an inequity in the committee's clear desire, it is the committee's clear desire to have operation and maintenance costs available as outlined in the Maritime Transportation Security Act for coverage under this grant program.
After talking with the Congressional Research Service and with the Department of Homeland Security, it is clear that, at a practical level, on the ground at our ports, these costs, including overtime compensation for State patrol officers, are not being covered, despite the committee's best efforts.
The Department of Homeland Security, however, responds to legislation passed by the Committee on Appropriations and takes a narrow view that operations and maintenance costs are not eligible to be covered.
