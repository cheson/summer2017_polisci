"Despite today's setback, I remain convinced that an agreement between the Machinists and Boeing would be in the best interest of all parties - the workers, the company and Washington state. We have submitted our state's proposal and I still hope that the company will recognize that the best way to ensure that the 777X is delivered to its customers on time and at the least cost is to build it here. I'll be talking to both sides tonight and will continue to do everything possible to secure the 777X for Washington."
