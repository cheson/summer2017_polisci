Today, U.S. Representative Jay Inslee (WA-01) released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) issued the new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, a long-delayed rule for reducing toxic air pollution, like mercury and acid gases, from power plants:
"For over 40 years, the Clean Air Act has saved lives while our economy has grown. This new rule will continue to build on those successes," said Rep. Inslee. "This rule has been in development for a long time and I'm pleased that the EPA is moving forward with the actions required by the Clean Air Act. Protections against pollution are needed to make sure the public can breathe easy and to protect our environmental legacy for future generations. This is a step in the right direction."
On June 21, 2011, Rep. Inslee, along with 106 members of Congress, signed a letter to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson supporting the proposed rule.
