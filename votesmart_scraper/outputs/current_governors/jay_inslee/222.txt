"Today's order from the Supreme Court acknowledges that significant progress has been made toward meeting the state's obligation to adequately fund basic education. But everyone understood that even with those historic investments in education, our work would not be done."
"The court today made it clear that bolder and more aggressive action is needed to support Washington's students and their teachers. The detailed plan the court demands in order to fulfill our constitutional obligation will be more complex and expensive than the significant steps we've already taken."
"I will talk today with Attorney General Ferguson, legislative leaders and others to fully analyze today's court order."
