CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4818, CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005 -- (House of Representatives - November 20, 2004)
(BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the language in this Omnibus bill that significantly restricts a woman's access to health care services. This year, 2,500 Washington State residents traveled across America to march for this right protected by the U.S. Constitution. As the 108th Congress comes to an end, I am disappointed to be faced again with an omnibus piece of legislation containing political poison pills that attack constitutional liberties.
I regret that Congress must pass this appropriations bill to keep our Government running yet simultaneously approve a bill that encroaches on a woman's right to make private medical decisions with her doctor. Embedded in this legislation is a Federal Refusal Clause which creates an impossible situation for women in my State that are protected by local pro-choice laws-laws that these citizens time after time support-which ensure women access to reproductive health information and services.
This provision would break contracts that Washington State has with Medicaid providers to prohibit the local healthcare facilities participating in Medicaid from referring patients to abortion services-even when medically necessary, even upon patient request and even though law entitles it. This provision is a blow to the right of a woman and her doctor to make private healthcare decisions and I urge my colleagues to correct this outrage.
