Inslee: Polar Bears May be Canary in the Coal Mine
U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, House Energy and Commerce Committee, and House Select Committee on Global Warming, made the following statement in response to newly released U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) studies that show that polar bears are more imperiled that previously thought.
"We knew the sea ice on which polar bears depend has been disappearing, but these studies bring new urgency to listing the polar bear on the Endangered Species List and taking bold action to save habitat by cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.
"Polar bears are some of the most magnificent creatures on earth. They also may be the canary in the coal mine. These reports should be a wake up call to members of Congress and the administration who are dragging their feet on aggressive proposals to tackle climate change."
Inslee is the leader in the House of Representatives on the proposed listing of the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act. He has testified at a three-hour public hearing at the Department of Interior in support of listing and has been the lead author of two letters to Fish and Wildlife Service from a coalition of almost 40 Members of Congress in support of the listing due to the loss of the marine mammal's sea-ice habitat. Inslee plans to continue these efforts by leading another bipartisan delegation in submitting comments to the USGIS on this new study.
