Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, the students now are at the beach and at the swimming holes, and they're not thinking about their education. But we are. And we're seeing good things. I was at the Everett School District, where they're getting 90 percent graduation rates because they're doing some good things. But we're going to have almost 3,000 teachers laid off if we don't pass this bill, in the State of Washington. That is just flat wrong.
Now, what is the debate here? The debate is that one side of the aisle believes it is more important to preserve billions of dollars of tax loopholes so that corporations can hide their money in the Bahamas and other places. They think those billions of dollars for those corporate loopholes is simply more important than almost 3,000 teachers in classrooms in the State of Washington. We disagree. The kids aren't thinking about it, but we are.
And let's be clear what the decision is today. One side of the aisle's going to be giving billions of dollars for corporate loopholes, and one side of the aisle's going to be taking care of kids. They don't want to give a dime to kids, but billions for corporate loopholes. Pass this bill.
