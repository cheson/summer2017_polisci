Rep. Inslee's Statement On EADS Bid Announcement
Statement
By: Jay Inslee
Date: April 20, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

This afternoon Rep. Jay Inslee (WA-01) released the following statement regarding the announcement that the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) would submit a bid in the competition to replace the United States Air Force's aging air-refueling tanker fleet:
"Fair competition is something we in Washington State are very comfortable with. Fair competition is what Americans expect in this process and I believe, when all the cards are laid on the table, the Boeing plane will be the superior choice for our national security, for American taxpayers, and for American workers. I will also continue my push to make sure this is a fair and transparent process, by taking into account the subsidies given to EADS -- ruled to be illegal by the World Trade Organization (WTO) -- when EADS's bid is considered by the Air Force."
