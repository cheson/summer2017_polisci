Gov. Jay Inslee issued a statement today on the Drug Enforcement Agency's decision today not to reschedule marijuana in its listing of illegal substances under the federal Controlled Substances Act.
"I am disappointed that we don't have a national standard for at least medical marijuana. Regardless, following the will of Washington state voters, we will continue to maintain a well-regulated adult-use marijuana system and continue to allow patients to have access for necessary medicinal purposes.
"A portion of revenues from the marijuana sales in our state goes toward treatment and youth prevention.
"I appreciate the DEA's focus on youth prevention and for allowing more testing centers which will provide more medical research for more informed national policy decisions.
"As states continue to legalize medical and recreational marijuana, there is more that the federal government must to do to provide states with legal certainty and empower the operation of safe systems across the country."
