"Today's historic court ruling is another big step in America's long road to justice for all. Today, we celebrate with all LGBT couples because love won the day. It's long overdue, but our country's high court has recognized the rights of all people to marry the person who they love.
"The LGBT community and others got us to this point today by making sure their voices were heard not just in elections, statehouses and courthouses, but in their neighborhoods and work places and throughout communities across this country. As we celebrate, we should pause to note that today's decision should give us confidence in our ability to address big challenges of inequality and injustice.
"And many more of those challenges still face us. Too many LGBT Americans face discrimination, harassment and are victims of violence. I was proud of our state for being the first in the nation to vote to recognize same-sex marriage, and I know that here in Washington state we will continue to lead the nation in the fight to ensure equal rights for the LGBT members of our state family, and all our residents."
