The Cone Of Silence
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, after the collapse on Wall Street and after the multiple abuses, the American people are very disappointed that one party in the Senate is filibustering so that we can't move forward to have a bipartisan Wall Street reform bill.
The Republicans' filibuster kind of reminds me of the old ``Get Smart'' show where they had the Cone of Silence. When they wanted to keep a secret so that nobody knew about the secret, they brought down the Cone of Silence. That's what the Republicans want to do about Wall Street reform. They want a Cone of Silence over the Senate so that nobody knows whose side everybody is on.
We are on the side of the American people to have aggressive Wall Street reform. The people who are over there who are filibustering are on the side of Wall Street. They want the Cone of Silence so that people won't know that they're standing up for their friends on Wall Street. That is wrong.
You know, maybe the answer ``no'' is the right answer to some things, but it isn't the right answer to Wall Street reform. End the filibuster. Get a vote. Let's tame Wall Street the way it ought to be regulated.
