"The House approved a budget last night that the Senate should quickly consider and act on. This is a budget that shows serious compromise, and meets the Senate more than half way. It significantly scales back revenue and takes numerous policy issues off the table while preserving critical human services and moving us forward on education. Senate leaders should recognize that this is a budget that can get the job done in these final days of the special session."
