BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Chair, scientists have made an amazing discovery, and that is, we are the Saudi Arabia of energy. We have the ability to power the growth of our economy by finding efficiency right in the walls and windows and doors of our homes, and this bill will unlock that incredible source of energy that is clean. If Americans want to know what we can do to avoid the problem we're seeing in the Gulf of Mexico, it's to take advantage of this bill and make our homes more efficient.
Some of the Republicans don't want to help us on this bill, but they sure had no problem giving $1 billion of subsidies to the oil companies that are responsible for the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. If they want to help us in finding a way to pay for this bill, which we are going to find, I hope they will cosponsor our bill to raise the limit of liability of the companies that are responsible for this to $10 billion so that they pay for this cost. They will need to abandon their friends in the oil industry, but help the American taxpayer, and we will get the efficiency we deserve.
