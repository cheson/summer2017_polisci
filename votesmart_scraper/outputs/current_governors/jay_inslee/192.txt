"Today Attorney General Bob Ferguson confirmed that there is no evidence to support allegations that Planned Parenthood clinics in Washington state were engaged in unlawful practices related to performing abortions or handling of fetal tissue.
"The effort by some state legislators to baselessly discredit Planned Parenthood was part of a concerted national effort to restrict access to legal medical services for millions of women. Washington has long been a state that fights to protects women's access to family planning services and we will continue to do so.
"I appreciate the Attorney General's due diligence in investigating these allegations, and continue to stand with Planned Parenthood and the millions of men and women who turn to them every year for family planning and health care services."
