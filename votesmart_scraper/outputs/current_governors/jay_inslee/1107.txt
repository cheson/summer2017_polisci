CONFERENCE REPORT ON H. CON. RES. 95, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006 -- (House of Representatives - April 28, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons the majority does not allow us or Americans to read this bill before we vote on it is because there is some little nasty surprises in it. One of those little nasty surprises buried on page 30 is a provision that allows through congressional skullduggery getting around the rules to try to drill in the Arctic that could not pass the other Chamber on an up-or-down vote.
On page 30, they essentially try to work around on a midnight deal the right for checks and balances and a filibuster in the other Chamber that could not pass under regular rules in the United States Senate.
Those who believe that we have better options than drilling in the Arctic and destroying a provision set up by Ike Eisenhower and defended by every President since should vote "no" on this budget. No matter what you think of the fiscal issue, vote "no" tonight.
Take out this legislative flea on the back of this bill and preserve the Arctic. Vote "no."
