NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2004)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, how often in the last year have we heard the phrase in this country saying we support our troops? I have heard it a lot on this floor, but those who oppose this amendment have a new slogan. We support our troops except for their constitutional rights.
The women of this country are in the streets of Baghdad and Nasiriyah and Fallujah today trying to install the concept of individual liberty and individually, constitutionally protected rights in Iraq while their Members of the U.S. Congress are trying to deny it back here in Washington, D.C.
Do not deny this amendment. Do not send the proud women in our armed services to the back streets of Baghdad. They are serving to establish liberty in Baghdad, not back-street abortions. Do not go back to those old days while we fight new battles trying to establish liberties overseas. Pass this amendment.
Mr. RYUN of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?
