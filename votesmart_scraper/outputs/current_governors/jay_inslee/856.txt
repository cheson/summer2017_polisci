COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Was this part of the secret Dick Cheney task force to come up with an opposition to have a little transparency in the speculation markets? Secrecy does its worst work in the dark, and that's what happened in the Cheney secret energy task force. And why should we allow these speculative markets to continue in the dark?
The people who support this are not a bunch of hemp smoking Communists. The Air Transport Association, the people whose industry is on the verge of disaster, realize we have to rein in this rampant speculation. These are capitalists, CEOs, accountants who know that we've got to get to the root of this speculation.
And I don't understand, when it comes to energy, my Republican colleagues are against virtually every solution. Speculation, they're against it. Opening the SPR, they're against it. Solar energy in our REC standard, they're against it. Wind in our tax bill, they're against it. Electrified cars in our CAFE, they're against it. They're the none-of-the-above caucus.
