PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5122, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 11, 2006)

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, this is the most pathetic rule since I have been here, and I am not the only one who believes this. Last weekend I was on a walk. I met an old friend of mine who told me his son, as we were speaking, was landing in Mosul, Iraq with the United States Army. And my friend and his wife were raising their grandson, a 2-year-old because this soldier is a single parent.
And while he is over there fighting with courage, this House doesn't have the courage to debate Iraq. And every single amendment that was offered that would offer a strategic vision that questions George Bush's decisions in Iraq was denied.
The Abercrombie amendment to say we should have some plan to leave by 2010, denied. The Cardin amendment to have some plan, denied.
This House basically today has said it is only going to do one thing and that America should do only one thing, and that is trust the eminent judgment of President George Bush, who is apparently infallible, unquestionable, and nothing that this U.S. Congress should challenge.
My friend begs to differ, whose son landed in Mosul. This House should challenge George Bush on Iraq. We should have a debate on it. We should not ignore it. While our soldiers have courage enough to fight, we ought to have courage enough to fight George Bush's misguided policies in Iraq.
