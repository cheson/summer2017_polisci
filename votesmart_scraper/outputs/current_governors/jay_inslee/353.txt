"Late last night representatives from the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Northwest Grain Companies reached a tentative labor agreement that brings an 18-month dispute to a welcome close. This is outstanding news for grain growers across Washington, for our grain customers overseas, and for the hundreds of ILWU workers who will now be back on the job.

"United Grain Company has been notified that state grain inspectors will resume inspections immediately.

"I thank the Pacific Northwest Grain Companies and ILWU for coming back to the table in time to ensure export shipments will allow our growers to ship their world-class grain products in time for peak harvest. And I also want to acknowledge the ongoing professionalism of Agriculture Director Bud Hover and his state grain inspectors during these difficult times. Though this has been a challenging time for everyone involved, I'm proud of their hard work and commitment to serving our growers and supporting one of Washington's top industries."
