RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD FOR AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, on May 9, 1961, John F. Kennedy stood behind me and said that the U.S. was going to put a man on the moon in 10 years. That was very ambitious, but we did it. And we're going to have a similar moment of goal setting and aspirations and vision tomorrow when we vote to adopt a renewable portfolio standard for America, where we will guarantee Americans that we will have 15 percent of our electricity coming from clean, renewable sources by the year 2020.
This is something we know we can do; States are doing it, whole nations in Europe have over 20 percent clean, renewable energy today. And we should follow the spirit of Oak Ridge, Texas, which 2 months ago became the first city in the United States to have all their electricity from clean, renewable, 100 percent biodiesel. This is something the States can do for a variety of reasons. Let's have another ``Apollo-John F. Kennedy'' moment tomorrow when we pass the renewable portfolio standard.
