Inslee Directing Ecology to Develop Regulatory Cap on Carbon Emissions

Gov. Jay Inslee today directed the state Department of Ecology to step up enforcement of existing state pollution laws and develop a regulatory cap on carbon emissions. Inslee said Washingtonians have too much at stake to wait any longer for legislative action.
"Carbon pollution and the climate change it causes pose a very real and existential threat to our state," Inslee said. "Farmers in the Yakima Valley know this. Shellfish growers on the coast know this. Firefighters battling Eastern Washington blazes know this. And children suffering from asthma know this all too well and are right to question why Washington hasn't acted to protect them."
The regulatory cap on carbon emissions would force a significant reduction in air pollution and will be the centerpiece of Inslee's strategy to make sure the state meets its statutory emission limits set by the Legislature in 2008.
The governor asked Ecology Director Maia Bellon to develop substantive emission reductions using existing authority. The process will be open and transparent and all stakeholders will have ample opportunity to express their ideas, options and concerns as the rule development process unfolds.
That process is expected to take about a year.
Unlike the legislation that Inslee proposed to the 2015 Legislature, the regulatory cap will not charge emitters for carbon pollution and therefore would not raise revenue for state operations. The other key difference is the current proposal wouldn't create a centralized market for trading of emissions credits, though emitters may be able trade amongst themselves.
