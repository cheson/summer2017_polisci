THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES RECOVERY ACT OF 2005 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, what possible reason is there for taxpayers to have to pay three, four times for the same protection of endangered species?
Under the bill as written, the taxpayer would have to pay a landowner once for the privileges of not building the casino. That landowner could then sell it to his brother. The taxpayer has to pay his brother a second time for the same project. His brother could sell it to his cousin, and the taxpayer would have to pay a third time for the same casino. This is a failure in drafting. Reject this bill.
