"I want to thank Senate Ways and Means Chairman Andy Hill for the supplemental budget proposal he put forward today.
"The proposal acknowledges the pressing need to address our constitutional obligation to basic education. While the Senate proposal does not go far enough in that regard, it's a start. I urge the House to make a more substantial investment in education -- one that does more to provide our students with the classroom tools they need and restores cost-of-living raises for our teachers.
"My budget staff and agencies are taking a close look at the Senate's budget proposal to get a better understanding of the impacts it might have on vital state services. I look forward to working with the Legislature these next few weeks in reaching a final budget agreement."
