Inslee Amendments on Renewable Energy and Drilling Safety Made Part of CLEAR Act
Press Release
By: Jay Inslee
Date: July 15, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

This morning, the House Natural Resources Committee, with the support of Rep. Jay Inslee (WA-01), passed comprehensive legislation to reform federal offshore and onshore energy leasing and their oversight agencies. H.R. 3534, The Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources (CLEAR) Act cleared the Natural Resources Committee by a vote of 27-21 and includes five amendments offered by Rep. Inslee to address renewable energy licenses and leasing, and oil and gas drilling safety.
"This bill puts in place practical, common sense regulations for the oil and gas industry to prevent dangerous and costly oil spills that threaten public safety, coastal economies, and the environment", said Rep. Inslee. "Under the Bush Administration, the Minerals Management Service, was run by industry lackeys, with no serious oversight. But after numerous hearings and investigations, we have created forward-thinking legislation to improve safety and oversight; increase transparency and accountability; and force the oil and gas industry to be better stewards of our natural resources."
The CLEAR Act includes Inslee amendments that will:
* Grandfather in solar and wind project applications that have been submitted prior to July 1st, 2010 to ensure current renewable energy projects are not needlessly delayed.
* Ensure that industry uses the best available safety technology for offshore oil and gas exploration and production and require the Secretary of the Interior to work with an independent advisory board made up of experts to determine the best available safety technology.
* Require blowout preventers meet performance standards that include quantitative risk assessments.
* Require the Secretary of the Interior to consider the availability of accident response infrastructure when designing five year oil and gas leasing plans.
* Creating jobs by encouraging the development of geothermal discoveries by allowing noncompetitive leasing on limited parcels of adjoining federal lands.
The CLEAR Act will replace the current Minerals and Management Service with the Bureau of Energy and Resource Management (BERM), to manage leasing & permitting and conduct necessary environmental studies; the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), to conduct all inspections and investigations related to health, safety and environmental regulations; and the Office of Natural Resource Revenue (ONRR), to collect all offshore and onshore oil and gas and renewable energy-related revenues.
