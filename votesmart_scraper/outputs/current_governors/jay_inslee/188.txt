In advance of the House and Senate votes on the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the National Governors Association (NGA) today announced its full endorsement of the bill. The endorsement is a unique move--one not taken in nearly 20 years--and demonstrates governors' strong bipartisan support for the legislation.
"The Every Student Succeeds Act received this historic endorsement because it underpins the work and innovation taking place in the states to increase educational opportunity for all students, and because current federal requirements are unworkable," said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, chair of the NGA Education and Workforce Committee. "Governors have been working diligently with Congress to ensure that our priorities are included in reforming federal education law. We greatly appreciate the hard work and leadership of the bill's sponsors."
