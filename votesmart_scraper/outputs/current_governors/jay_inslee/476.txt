"I'm beyond disappointed in this inaction. The failure by the Senate's Republican-led majority to act on the transportation plan stops us from making important investments in maintaining and preserving our roads and bridges and ensuring the safety the public deserves.
"It also means that Washington has lost $850 million in federal funds that would have helped us build a new I-5 bridge across the Columbia River.
"If the transportation plan had died by a negative vote, at least the public would have known the Senate tried and where their senator stands on the important question of an improved transportation system and the biggest job creating bill of the year.
"Inaction is a terrible way to deal with important issues like this.
"I appreciate all the hard work by Judy Clibborn, Tracey Eide and others that led to a successful vote in the House -- which many people didn't think was likely.
"I said on my first day in office that "no economic strategy would be complete without a transportation plan.' Six months later -- after multiple House proposals, repeated attempts to engage the Senate Majority and great work by a broad coalition of business, labor and environmentalists -- I believe that even more strongly.
"It is disappointing to hear the Senate Majority say they didn't have time to deal with this important issue that could have done so much to help Washington continue to climb out of the recession."
