Gov. Jay Inslee today responded to news that China has lifted a ban on shellfish exports that directly affected numerous Washington shellfish growers. China initiated the ban last December and Inslee immediately directed state agencies and staff to work with federal partners and Chinese officials to lift the ban as swiftly as possible.
"Today's news that China has lifted its ban on shellfish exports from the U.S. West Coast is most welcome. Our shellfish industries employ thousands of Washingtonians and contribute more than $270 million to the state's economy, in addition to providing delicious seafood to domestic and international consumers.
"I appreciate the hard work of the State Departments of Health and Natural Resources, and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Foreign Agricultural Service and U.S. Trade Representative, for all they've done to respond to this case and for effectively communicating to our international trading partners that our seafood is safe and healthy for their consumers. I also want to thank the staff in my D.C. office for working diligently on bringing resolution to this issue."
