Response to the State of the Union
February 1, 2006
U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee, member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and author of the New Apollo Energy Act (H.R. 2828), made the following statement after the president's State of the Union address on Tuesday evening:
"I was most disappointed tonight because the president paid only lip service to energy independence, even though national security was a major theme in his speech. The security of our nation depends, in large part, on ending our addiction to foreign oil.
"Ending this addiction needs more than rhetoric, it needs action. In the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy's vision got us to the moon. I'm afraid this president's modest proposals wouldn't get us to Cleveland.
"With developments like Exxon's $36.13 billion in annual profits, it's clear he needs to do more than offer a few token programs to reverse the damage his energy policies have done in the last five years."
