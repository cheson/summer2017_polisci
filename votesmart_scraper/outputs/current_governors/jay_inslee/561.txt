Inslee Calls on Public to Oppose Loosening of Media Ownership Rules

Today, U.S. Representative Jay Inslee (WA-01), a Member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, released the following statement about the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) attempt to once again loosen media cross-ownership rules:
"This proposal to change media ownership rules is no different than the last one, which was widely opposed by the public," said Rep. Inslee. "The large media mergers allowed under this proposal will result in fewer local jobs and fewer local media choices. The FCC should be focused on growing the voice of the public, not drowning us out. I intend to vigorously oppose this proposal and I encourage Washingtonians to do the same"
On December 6, 2011, Reps. Inslee, joined by U.S. Representatives Mike Doyle (PA-14) and Anna Eshoo (CA-14) and seven other Members of Congress, co-led a letter to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski urging the Commission to maintain the media cross-ownership rules, which currently prohibit a company from owning a newspaper and a television station in the same media market. In 2007, the FCC passed similar media ownership rules to those proposed today. These changes meant that one company was permitted to own both the local newspaper and a local broadcast outlet in the same area. This action came only days after the FCC held a field hearing in Seattle where over a thousand individuals attended on short notice to oppose further consolidation. In response to this action, Congressman Inslee introduced a Resolution of Disapproval to nullify the rule changes. He serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has oversight responsibilities over the FCC.
