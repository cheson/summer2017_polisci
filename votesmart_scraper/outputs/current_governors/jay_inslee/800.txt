AMERICAN CLEAN ENERGY AND SECURITY ACT
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, Americans are the most innovative and the most entrepreneurial people on the face of the Earth. That is the reason that the people want us to pass the American Clean Energy and Security bill this week. This bill will give Americans what they want: More energy independence; less pollution; and most importantly, millions of new jobs of Americans building the new businesses, putting up solar panels, putting up wind towers, and stringing new electrical wire that we need.
Now, what is this going to cost Americans? According to the Congressional Budget Office, approximately the cost of one postage stamp a day: 47 cents. Do Americans want to rid ourselves of the scourge of addiction to Saudi oil for a postage stamp a day? You bet.
Do Americans want us to limit pollution and make polluters pay so Americans can have cleaner air for the cost of a postage stamp a day? You bet.
Do Americans want 3 million new jobs in this country for the cost of a postage stamp a day? You bet.
We are going to pass this bill. Americans want it.
