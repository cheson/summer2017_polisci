"Alcoa announced today that is making deep cuts to many of its aluminum smelting operations throughout the country. Today's news is a tough blow for many hard-working Washingtonians and communities like Ferndale and Wenatchee where Alcoa employs hundreds of men and women. I'll be asking my agency directors to ensure we're doing what we can to assist impacted workers and their families during this difficult time."
