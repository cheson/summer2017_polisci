Breath Clean Air
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee
Date: March 2, 2011
Location: Washington, DC

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, one thing we share on a bipartisan basis is Republicans and Democrats like to breathe clean air. We don't want to see our kids exposed to aggravated asthma problems.
That's why it's very disappointing that the Republicans are trying to threaten a government shutdown if they don't get to pass their dirty air act. Now, their dirty air act is a bill that they want to pass, and I am not making this up. They want to pass a bill that would make it illegal for the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the provisions of the Clean Air Act that will reduce air pollution.
This is amazing to me. You want to shut down government, if you don't shut down government in enforcing pollution. Now, I always thought that the American people thought that that was a really bad idea.
I want to share my colleagues' proof of this. In polls done in 19 congressional districts recently, including the Speaker's own district in Ohio, 68 percent of Americans said that we should move forward with the EPA in this; 6 out of 10 said the Republicans' dirty air act is a really bad idea.
We need to keep the government to keep this clean air. Reject the Republicans' threat of a government shutdown.
