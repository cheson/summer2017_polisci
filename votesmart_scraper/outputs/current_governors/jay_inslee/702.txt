Inslee: Google/Verizon Policy Proposal Falls Short, FCC Must Act
Statement
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Sept. 9, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

This afternoon Congressman Jay Inslee (WA-01) released the following statement regarding the policy proposal released jointly by Google and Verizon on rules for access to the internet:
"This afternoon's announcement from Google and Verizon falls far short of the net neutrality principles necessary to protect consumers online. I'm disappointed that such esteemed leaders would put forward a policy proposal that fails to protect the very foundation of the Internet's success -- open access for all. Many of us have been warning for a number of years that broadband service providers would begin to use a lack of net neutrality regulations to prioritize their increasingly diverse business offerings and content, thereby jeopardizing open internet access. Today's announcement is one more reason that the FCC must act to reclassify broadband and protect consumers online. The American people deserve nothing less than a free and open internet where ideas and innovation are allowed to flourish, and today's proposal has made it even clearer that we cannot rely on industry alone to do just that."
Congressman Jay Inslee has represented Washington's 1st Congressional District since 1999 and serves as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Rep. Inslee is also a co-sponsor of H.R.3458 -- the Internet Freedom Preservation Act.
