Scientists, Members of Congress Object to Politicized Spotted Owl Recovery Plan
Today, 113 scientists and 23 Democratic members of Congress called on the Interior Department to scrap a controversial draft recovery plan that would reduce federally protected habitat for the northern spotted owl and start from scratch to create a new plan using sound science.
In letters to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne sent this morning, the groups say that the draft recovery plan should be completely redone because it distorts scientific studies to justify opening old-growth forests to logging and could have been politicized by Interior Department officials like disgraced Bush Administration appointee Julie MacDonald, who resigned in May.
"As scientists with backgrounds in population ecology, wildlife and endangered species management, natural resource management and forest ecosystems, we are greatly concerned that, according to scientific peer review recently conducted by owl experts and three of the nation's leading scientific societies, much of this science was ignored in the published draft recovery plan for the northern spotted owl," the scientists wrote in their letter. "Based on our understanding of the ecology of the spotted owl, we see no scientific basis for either reducing habitat protections for the owl - as currently proposed under Option 1 of the recovery plan - or departing from a conservation strategy that is rooted in the fixed reserves of the NWFP [Northwest Forest Plan] such as Option 2."
The letter authored by U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), who serves on the House Natural Resources Committee, and 22 other members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. Nick J. Rahall (D-W.V.), the chairman of the resources panel, read, "These peer reviews underscore concerns raised during a May 9 hearing before the House Natural Resources Committee. At this hearing, evidence was presented that showed the recovery plan may have been tampered with by high-ranking officials within the Administration, including former Interior Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie MacDonald who, for a time, was a member of the Â‘Washington Oversight Committee' that apparently instructed the recovery team to develop options not based on sound science."
