Investing in transportation infrastructure creates needed construction jobs today, lays the foundation for the job growth of tomorrow and keeps Washington competitive in an internationally competitive world. It is a legacy we leave future generations.
Investing in transportation creates needed construction jobs today, lays the foundation for the jobs of tomorrow and keeps Washington competitive in an internationally competitive world. Our transportation network supports over 1.5 million freight dependent jobs and produces over $130 billion in gross domestic product. As governor, I will be a unifying leader who moves our whole state forward on transportation.
As we move forward with investments in our transportation infrastructure, we must first rebuild the public trust and confidence in government's ability to be a good steward of taxpayer's dollars, by doing more with what we have. Then we must work with the legislature, coalition partners, citizens, and all geographic regions of the state to identify high priority projects and the appropriate mechanisms to fund them.
I'm laying out my transportation priorities with a focus on:
Accountability
Preservation
Freight Mobility
Safety
Transportation Choices
Sustainability
