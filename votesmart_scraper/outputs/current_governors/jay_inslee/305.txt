Gov. Jay Inslee issued the following statement today after his office received the final report of the SR 530 Landslide Commission.
"On behalf of all Washingtonians I want to thank the members and staff of SR 530 Landslide Commission for their dedication and hard work on this very important effort. I also want to thank all the residents of the Stillaguamish Valley, first responders and others involved in the tragedy of the 530 slide who helped the commission in its study even in the midst of grieving.
"We cannot undo the loss of 43 Washingtonians, but the commission's work should stand as a tribute to the community's resilience and compassion.
"I also want to thank Snohomish County Executive John Lovick who joined me in appointing the commission and whose personal leadership remains critical as the community recovers.
"The commission did its work in a thoughtful, fair, compassionate and transparent way and produced a report of important recommendations. The work of the commission will help make us all safer in the future.
"While I have just received its final report, I am pleased to say that we are already moving forward on some of the recommendations.
"The transportation investment package that I will announce in greater detail tomorrow includes $36 million for landslide mitigation measures, funding for advanced LiDAR imagery and risk analysis for priority areas.
"It also funds statewide GIS mapping and creates a Hazard Identification Institute to be the central clearinghouse for geological hazard information in Washington.
