Governor Inslee, Legislative Leaders Announce Operating Budget Agreement
Press Release
By: Jay Inslee
Date: June 27, 2015
Location: Olympia, WA

Gov. Jay Inslee and bipartisan legislative leaders said today that the proposed 2015--17 state operating budget they agreed to early Saturday is sustainable, responsible and makes important investments for Washingtonians in education and other important services.
An intensive six-hour session in the governor's office ended weeks of negotiations.
While there are still details to be ironed out, all negotiators agreed that the budget will be approved before Tuesday, June 30 at midnight when the fiscal biennium ends. Without a budget agreement, much of state government would have had to be shut down beginning Wednesday, July 1.
"It was a long process, but in the end we have agreed to a budget that moves this state forward in many important ways," Inslee said. "This budget allows us to make a major step toward meeting our obligation to Washington's children and to the state constitution to adequately fund education. And I'm particularly pleased that it also allows funding of our collective bargaining agreements and will give teachers a long-overdue and well-deserved cost of living adjustment."
Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, led negotiations for Senate Republicans.
"This budget delivers historic college tuition cuts to working families and students, and keeps job incentives that benefit every corner of the state," Schoesler said. "This agreement averts a government shutdown that would not be good for our state."
House Speaker Frank Chopp, D-Seattle, led negotiations for House Democrats.
