Gov. Jay Inslee's Statement on News of Weekend Shutdown at West Coast Ports
Statement
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Feb. 6, 2015
Location: Unknown

"I am deeply disappointed that Washington's ports will shut down this weekend. Our state depends heavily on trade and the closures, though temporary, will affect businesses across this state, from agriculture to heavy manufacturing as well as the many workers who help move goods through the ports.
"I know that the ILWU and PMA have been negotiating and I urge both sides not to let the closure dissuade them from further talks. I call on them to negotiate with renewed vigor to help Washington businesses, workers and all of us who depend on a vibrant economy."
