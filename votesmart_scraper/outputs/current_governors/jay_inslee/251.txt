Gov. Jay Inslee today signed legislation that is the result of a two-year effort to provide more information to consumers, employers, medical providers and policy makers about buying and using health care.
SB 5084 creates an all-payer claims database that provides an unprecedented level of public access to cost and quality information about health care providers and services. The database will give purchasers, providers and consumers a clearer picture of where money is being spent, and how costs compare across procedures and services, geographies, populations and other demographics. Currently, 20 other states have these databases.
"Last year there was a lot of disagreement about the All Payer Claims Database. While the information collected in the database can significantly help us improve the quality and cost of health care, there were important differences of opinion to work out. This year, the different groups came together -- my office, insurers, providers, advocates, the Washington Health Alliance, small and large businesses and local governments -- and worked constructively to resolve their issues. The people of the state are the winners. Quality and cost information are now going to be available to all of us."
