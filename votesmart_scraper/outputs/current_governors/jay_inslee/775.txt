BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. Speaker, health care is not a frivolity or a recreation; it is life itself. To a woman with early-onset breast cancer, health care is life itself. To a child with juvenile-onset diabetes, health care is life itself.
It is well that we reflect how we founded this Union. We believe that all men are endowed with certain unalienable rights, and among those are the right to life--life--liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
We pass health care to honor life not just on parchment, but in practice. We pass health care because we cherish the lives of all Americans, not just our own. This is an American step in progress. It is an American right to life.
