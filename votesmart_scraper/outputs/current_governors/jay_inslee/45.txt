"Today, the state Supreme Court ruled in favor of equality for all Washingtonians. By ruling that intolerance based on sexual orientation is unlawful, the Court affirmed that Washington state will remain a place where no one can be discriminated against because of who they love.
"I am proud that our state was one of the first to vote to recognize same sex marriage and that we continue to uphold the rights of all our residents."
