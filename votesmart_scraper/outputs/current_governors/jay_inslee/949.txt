Microsoft Ruling Could Lead to Balkanization of International Tech Standards
U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), whose 1st Congressional District is home to Microsoft, released the following statement on the software company's drubbing today in a European antitrust case:
"This is an extremely troubling decision. It has opened the prospect of the balkanization of international consistency in technology, with all the chaos that that portends. We cannot have other governments and regions of the world using antitrust laws to disadvantage American technologies."
