ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to the fiscal year Energy and Water appropriations bill which would stop Enron from once again cheating northwest consumers. I have worked with my colleagues and with Snohomish Public Utility District, SnoPUD, to ensure that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission plays fair in the case between Enron Power Marketing Inc. and SnoPUD. For too long, Enron has been harassing utilities for termination fees through the FERC administrative litigation system.
The Enron Corporation has already wronged consumers through its manipulation of the energy market during the energy crisis of 2001. It wasn't bad enough that Enron already collected an astonishing $1.8 billion through their market-manipulation schemes, including millions from SnoPUD. Today, Enron is trying to bilk another $122 million from Washington State consumers.
Enron argues that they deserve a fee for the termination of their contract for electricity that they never delivered to Snohomish Public Utility District, SnoPUD. Snohomish PUD's contention is that because the power was never delivered, and because these contracts with Enron were entered into when the company was illegally manipulating the electricity market to inflate rates, these contracts are invalid.
Mr. Chairman, my amendment to the fiscal year 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations Act would prohibit the FERC from enforcing any decision that deems a termination payment is due to Enron from SnoPUD during fiscal year 2007. It's Congress's responsibility to ensure protection for consumers like those being served by Snohomish PUD from companies like the Enron Corporation. With this amendment, Congress will be deciding to stand with Enron, or stand with ratepayers.
