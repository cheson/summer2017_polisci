Story
"I am so pleased that our efforts to work with Alcoa to keep more than 500 jobs in Washington has paid off. My office has engaged in regular discussions with the company, and I personally met with Alcoa executives in March to find solutions that would keep facilities operational. I also want to thank the Bonneville Power Administration for their work on finding a reasonable power contract.
"We have a long-standing commitment to protecting Alcoa manufacturing jobs. Last year, I signed into law an extension of tax preferences that help the company stay competitive, and earlier this month I signed into law a supplemental operating budget that provides funding for on-site worker training and skill enhancement. These efforts helped retain more than 500 jobs at Alcoa's Ferndale facility."
