Environment
I believe we have a responsibility to protect Washington's, and the nation's, clean water, clean air, wild salmon, and forests. Our environmental treasures and natural richness are a legacy that we must cherish. It is my goal to keep these treasures pristine so we may pass them on to our children and their children.
I am a member of the House Resources Committee and I have consistently voted in favor of strong conservation policies. If we do not safeguard our precious and uniquely American resources, we will have to live with the responsibility for the destruction of irreplaceable wilderness areas and wildlife communities. I am proud to have been named a "Champion of the Environment" by the League of Conservation Voters.
I have taken the lead or joined my colleagues in fighting many of the Bush Administration's environmental rollbacks. Since coming to office, President Bush and his friends in industry have been plundering our national resources at an alarming rate. From undermining the roadless rule to enacting sham clean air and forest protection laws, this administration has engaged in an unprecedented effort to undermine our environmental protections while attempting to disguise their true intentions.
