Gov. Jay Inslee today announced he's directing the state Department of Ecology to draft a new clean water rule that will preserve the state's decision-making control over how to meet federal requirements. The Clean Water Act requires states to establish standards for how clean our waters need to be and to control pollution limits for businesses and municipalities that are permitted to discharge wastewater.
"My goal all along has been to update Washington's clean water rule with one that assures the health of Washington's people, fish and economy," Inslee said. "The number one thing I hear over and over when talking with people is how critical it is that we maintain control over creation of this rule to ensure that we're protecting human health while providing businesses and local governments sensible tools to comply with the stricter standards."
"The proposed rule only regulates 96 chemicals, yet there are hundreds of toxics that come from everyday products," Inslee said. "The toxics package we sent to the Legislature would have helped us take a hard run at those to make a much more meaningful difference in making our water safer and healthier."
