INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW APOLLO ENERGY ACT -- (Extensions of Remarks - June 09, 2005)
SPEECH OF
HON. JAY INSLEE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
THURSDAY, JUNE 9, 2005
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, in April 2005, the House of Representatives once again passed an antiquated and outdated energy bill that fails to address the grave realities that our country faces today. With record high gasoline prices, we need an energy bill that diversifies our automobile fuels and encourages domestically manufactured fuel efficient vehicles.
With millions of family wage manufacturing jobs lost since 2001, we need an energy bill that takes bold action to tap into American ingenuity in order to lead the world in new clean energy technology, rather than playing catch-up to the Japanese, Danish, and Germans. Just as concerning is that our reliance on Middle Eastern oil, creates a need to establish an energy policy that allows us to end our historically objectionable policies in this area. Additionally, the science is clear that our greenhouse gas emissions are threatening to significantly change the world's climate, yet this energy bill does not even contain the words "climate change" or "global warming". The House passed Energy bill does little, or nothing, to address these mounting concerns.
That is why I, and several of my colleagues, have joined together to introduce the most innovative and comprehensive energy plan in recent decades, known as the New Apollo Energy Act. New Apollo seeks to solve America's energy crisis through technological innovation much in the same way that President Kennedy channeled the resources of the American people in the 1960's to meet the challenges of the race to the Moon.
