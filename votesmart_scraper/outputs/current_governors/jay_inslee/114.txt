Today, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), the ranking member of the Senate labor committee, introduced the Effective Apprenticeships Rebuild National Skills (EARNS) Act, bipartisan legislation to strengthen the nation's workforce development system through registered apprenticeship programs. The EARNS Act would support pre-apprenticeship programs and new or expanding registered apprenticeship programs that provide national, portable credentials, and help secure academic credit for on-the-job learning portions of an apprenticeship.
"To ensure that our workforce can truly lead in the 21st century global economy, we need our students and workers to be prepared to compete for high-skill, high-wage jobs in industries across the economy," Senator Murray said. "By strengthening and expanding registered apprenticeship programs, we can help workers get the training and experience they'll need, while they are also earning a paycheck, and provide a ladder of opportunity to reach a stable middle class life. I look forward to continuing working with Senator Hatch and others to expand registered apprenticeships to serve more students, workers, and businesses across the country."
"Registered Apprenticeships have been are an essential component in building Washington State's skilled trades and manufacturing workforce," said Governor Jay Inslee. "These unique partnerships bring employers and workers together to build customized industry training programs for high demand jobs which are critical for our state's growth and prosperity. The EARNS Act would expand awareness and access to apprenticeship opportunities, for both workers looking for viable careers, and for employers in need of a highly trained, skilled workforce. I commend Senator Murray for her efforts supporting registered apprenticeship opportunities, which will help to grow our state's workforce in key sectors."
