Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, while we consider what we can really do to reduce unemployment, I think we ought to consider something Secretary Steven Chu, the Secretary of Energy, said yesterday. He told us that China will surpass or possibly has surpassed the United States, not in the ability to do low-wage manufacturing but to do high-technology manufacturing, unless we adopt an energy policy which will jump-start a clean energy economy for the United States and start bringing those high-tech manufacturing jobs home to the United States.
First Solar, a United States company using United States technology, will be building the largest solar plant but building it in China with manufacturing there. Applied Materials, a high-tech manufacturing company, an American company, is developing plants in China.
What Mr. Chu told us, Secretary Chu, is that we need to adopt the clean energy bill now pending in the Senate. This is the ticket out of this recession. This is how we're going to decrease unemployment. We urge the Senate to get moving on this bill.
