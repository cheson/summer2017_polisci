Issue Position: Reducing the Deficit

Reducing the deficit in the short term and bringing down the national debt in the long term are critical issues that I have been working on for many years. In 2000, President Clinton left office with the nation running a surplus of $230 billion. Unfortunately the surplus was squandered and turned into a massive budget deficit after years of unpaid wars, tax cuts for the wealthy, and an unpaid prescription drug program implemented by the Bush Administration.
I have been working very hard to move the nation away from those policies. Facing the worst economic recession since the Great Depression has not made our job any easier. And just as this problem wasn't created overnight, it won't be solved overnight. Unlike many who have simply talked about the deficit and the debt, I have actually taken action in Congress:
* I voted against the TARP bank bailout bill, twice
* Fought for and won long-term changes to the Medicare reimbursement system that will reward quality of service and not quantity, saving hundreds of millions of dollars over the next 20 years. The Congressional Budget Office, the non-partisan referee of legislation, notes health insurance reform overall will reduce the debt by $1.2 trillion over 20 years
* I am supporting legislation to create a bi-partisan Debt Commission modeled after the Base Closure commission to force Congress to vote on a concrete plan to reduce the debt
* I co-sponsored an amendment to the CLEAR Act to close tax loopholes used by the oil and gas industry to avoid royalty payments to taxpayers and use that money to pay down the debt
* I voted against this year's un-paid for, off-budget supplemental "emergency" spending bill to finance the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
