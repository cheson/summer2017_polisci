"The Ex-Im Bank is a critical tool that supports hundreds of industries, thousands of companies, and hundreds of thousands of American jobs across every state. As governor, I have prioritized economic growth and the creation of good-paying jobs in Washington state. Increasing our exports is critical for our continued success. I have joined governors all around the country in urging Congress to pass a long-term reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank, and applaud Congress for taking this important step to increase job opportunities in our states and grow the national economy. I thank our state's delegation for their work on this, particularly Senators Murray and Cantwell and Reps. Larsen and Heck."
