Inslee on Boeing protest victory
U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), whose district includes part of Boeing's Everett facility and Future of Flight Aviation Center in Mukilteo, made the following statement in response the Government Accountability Office (GAO) decision to sustain Boeing's protest of the Defense Department decision to award Airbus a $40 billion dollar contract for aerial refueling tankers:
"Even though it's unusual to win a protest, I'm not surprised GAO sided with Boeing. This was the right decision - the facts were on Boeing's side.
"GAO found not just one or two mistakes; they identified seven deadly sins in the procurement process without factoring in important considerations like illegal Airbus subsidies and fuel efficiency of the planes.
"The Air Force needs to give troops the best aircraft and taxpayers the best deal. And that's the Boeing 767."
