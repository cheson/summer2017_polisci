BIPARTISAN EFFORTS NEEDED TO REDUCE FEDERAL DEFICIT -- (House of Representatives - March 25, 2004)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we need to be in a bipartisan fight against the Federal deficit. One of the tools we have in fighting the Federal deficit is called the pay-as-you-go rule, and it is a tool that works very, very well because when the pay-as-you-go rule is in effect, any Member of Congress, Democrat or Republican, if they are going to propose a new spending or a new tax cut, they are required to show how they are going to pay for it. This is common sense.
Unfortunately, my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle refuse to apply this common-sense rule that was effective during the 1990s in reducing the Federal deficit.
Now, there is one thing we ought to be able to agree on, when you are in a fight, it does not make sense to tie one hand behind yourself. And the Republicans are tying one hand behind us, and the pay-as-you-go rule is going to be the pay-as-you-gone rule. I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues are taking a dive against the Federal deficit.
