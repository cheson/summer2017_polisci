Inslee Votes Yes on Stimulus Package
Today, U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee voted in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 244-188. He issued the following statement after the vote:
"The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a bold, timely, and ambitious program to restore America's economic strength in these times of uncertainty, and I'm proud to say that tonight we have taken the first step to put it into action. The recent layoff announcements at Boeing, Microsoft, Starbucks and other companies throughout Washington State are further proof that the federal government cannot afford to be timid in tackling this problem.
"I'm particularly proud that today, we launched an important piece of the New Apollo Energy Project by investing $84 billion into clean energy programs. That federal support will go toward programs like Bonneville Power Authority to enhance our transmission capacity, toward supporting the new energy technologies at local companies like MagnaDrive, and toward the support of solar panel component manufacturers like REC Silicon in Moses Lake. The Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition will continue to work together to advance these priorities further in the future."
