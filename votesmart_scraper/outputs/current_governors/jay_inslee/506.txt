"I want to congratulate the House on producing a responsible and sustainable budget. The House proposal closely reflects the priorities I put forward two weeks ago. This budget sends a very clear message: Educating our children is more important than preserving tax breaks. The House meets our basic education obligations without making deeper cuts to vital services to our most vulnerable citizens.
"The House proposal is a great foundation as we move forward to work with the House and Senate over the next few weeks on a final budget -- a responsible solution that will address our education needs, protect vital services and leave us with a healthy reserve."
