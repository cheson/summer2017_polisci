President Barack Obama signed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) yesterday, which includes key improvements to the nation's workforce development programs.
The WIOA, sponsored by U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), streamlines existing programs, empowers local boards, increases coordination and improves outreach to disconnected youth.
Gov. Jay Inslee congratulated Murray on her legislation and thanked Obama for his support.
"Federal workforce investment programs are vital for a healthy economy and increasing job opportunities for Washingtonians," said Inslee. "I want to congratulate Senator Murray for her years of hard work on this legislation which have resulted in a major achievement that will benefit our state for years to come."
"The reforms and improvements in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will focus the system even more strongly on two crucially important goals: getting people jobs and making sure America is the premier economy in the world for businesses that need skilled workers and high productivity," said Employment Security Commissioner Dale Peinecke. "We congratulate Sen. Murray on this major achievement and thank President Obama for signing it into law."

Washington's WorkSource system is a statewide partnership of state, local and nonprofit agencies that deliver a wide array of employment and training services for job seekers and employers. The work is coordinated at the local level by Workforce Development Councils, whose boards include local leaders from business and labor.
