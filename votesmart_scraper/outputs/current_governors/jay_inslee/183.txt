"This is an opportunity to renew our commitment to fighting carbon pollution and work across borders to find creative solutions to climate action. Washington is not alone when we act on climate, and these partnerships are a way to forge ahead, share best practices and collaborate on policy that works on a local scale to effect global change."
Governor Inslee
"While national leaders continue to work on broad and necessary measures to curb global emissions, cities, states and regional partners have been building momentum together for climate action. We're at the forefront of driving innovation in clean technology, electrification of our transportation systems and efficiencies in our homes and offices. Washington state is at the leading edge of this technological revolution."
