Inslee Statement on U.S. Supreme Court Vote to Uphold the Affordable Care Act

Jay Inslee's statement on the United States Supreme Court's vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act:
"Today, in a majority ruling by Justices appointed by Presidents of both parties, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act.
What this means for Washingtonians is that insurance companies can no longer deny people coverage based on pre-existing conditions; there can be no caps on lifetime coverage; young men and women just starting out on their career paths can stay on their parents insurance until the age of 26; and prescription drugs will become more affordable with the closing of the so-called Medicare "donut hole."
The Supreme Court upheld this law despite enormous political pressure by Republican Attorneys General from around the country who tried to make this a partisan, political issue.
It is my hope that Republicans do not see today's ruling as an opportunity for further partisan bickering. Instead, we need both parties to finally come together and make this law work for the American people.
Now, with this issue settled by the Supreme Court, let's all focus on the most pressing issue we face -- getting our economy moving again by creating good-paying jobs for the middle-class."
