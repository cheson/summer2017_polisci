Governor Jay Inslee today named David W. Danner as the new chair of the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.
Danner has been the agency's Executive Director since 2005. He was previously energy and telecommunications policy advisor to Governor Gary Locke, a member of the state's Pollution Control and Shorelines Hearings boards, and an attorney in private practice.
"The Commission plays a key role in promoting the state's economy and securing our energy future," Inslee said. "Dave understands this. He has a deep understanding of the issues, strong environmental values, and a commitment to making Washington a leader in the new economy."
The UTC regulates the rates and services of the state's investor-owned electric and natural gas utilities, landline telephone companies, solid waste haulers, and private water systems, among other industries. The agency also manages the state's pipeline, railroad, and intrastate bus and trucking safety programs.
Danner will take over as chair from Jeffrey Goltz, who will continue on the three-member commission, along with Commissioner Philip Jones.
"I am honored that Governor Inslee has selected me for this position," Danner said. "This is a time of change for many of the industries we regulate, and I look forward to joining Jeff and Phil in addressing some very complex and challenging issues."
Danner is a graduate of Columbia University, and has a law degree from George Washington University and a master's degree in communications from the University of Washington.
