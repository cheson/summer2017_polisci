President Obama will speak this morning at 10:30am PST on his plan to reduce carbon pollution and prepare our country for the impacts of climate change. You can watch the speech live at whitehouse.gov/live.
"Every day Americans see the impacts of climate change in increasing droughts, wildfires, dangerous storms, ocean acidification, and more. Elected leaders have a moral obligation to take on this challenge. While Congress dithers, President Obama has put forward a smart, practical and cost effective set of policies to reduce carbon pollution and save energy costs, improve our competitiveness, and create jobs in America's clean energy future. In Washington state we are moving forward with clean tech innovation, sustainable transportation, and policies to reduce our emissions. We need a partner in the federal government, and the President's plan will lead to real results. I commend the President for his leadership and know that the states stand ready to work with him to tackle this challenge."
