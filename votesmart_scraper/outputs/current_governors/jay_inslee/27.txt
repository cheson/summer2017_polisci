Gov. Jay Inslee released a statement today on renewed congressional efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The bill under consideration, if passed, would shift $1.4 billion a year in costs to Washington or take health care away from more than 700,000 working people and their families. It would also undermine care for children and take up to $1.4 billion out of long-term care services and $380 million out of care for individuals with developmental disabilities in Washington.
"Once again, Congress is proposing a policy that would completely undermine the health care of Washingtonians. The only bipartisan aspect of this bill is that it hurts Republicans and Democrats alike.
"Congress has succeeded in making a bad bill worse. I will work with our delegation to ensure this ill-advised bill is defeated and that we protect health care for more than 700,000 working Washingtonians and their families."
