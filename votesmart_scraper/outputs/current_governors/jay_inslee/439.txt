"Through 12 negotiating sessions we made progress on finding a compromise package of statewide transportation improvements. But today it has become clear this phase of the process has run its course and we have not reached an agreement.
"We agree that transportation infrastructure is important to our state and we remain committed to finding a solution in the regular legislative session that works for everyone.
"The next step in this process will be to continue this dialogue in the legislative process."
