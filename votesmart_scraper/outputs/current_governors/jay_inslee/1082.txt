NEED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE CIA OPERATIVE LEAK -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2005)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, as the sordid tale is unfolding about the Bush administration's outing of one of our covert intelligence agents, as that unfolds, there is an aspect that I just learned about, I wanted to share with my colleagues, last week.
Last week with some Senators, we had a hearing where we listened to former CIA agents about the impact of this event on our national security system, and these four agents spoke as one. And what they said was interesting to me, because what they said was the outing was bad enough where they destroyed the covert status of one of our spies, but what is almost as bad or worse is that the President has refused to take action to deal with whoever is responsible for that wrongful act.
And to them that was a message that the President just did not honor the trust we have to keep the secrecy of our spies secret. That makes it more difficult to recruit. We are trying to recruit people for cells in London right now. How are we going to recruit them when we out, the administration outs, a spy and does not take action to deal with that?
That is as disturbing as the outing originally. The President needs to act. We need to pass House Resolution 363 to get to the bottom of this.
