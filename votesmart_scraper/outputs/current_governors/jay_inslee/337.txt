"While today's House of Representatives vote importantly provides for an extension of the Bank's authorization beyond its September 30 deadline, it still does not provide Washington exporters with the long-term certainty they need to do business. What our state and national economy really need is for Congress to pass a long-term, multi-year Ex-Im reauthorization.
"I appreciate the support that members of Washington's congressional delegation have provided for the Ex-Im Bank, in particular Senator Maria Cantwell and Congressman Denny Heck, who continue to lead the effort for long-term reauthorization. I urge Congress to pass a multi-year Ex-Im reauthorization, without delay."
