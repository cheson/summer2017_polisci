"Our roads will be safer due to the good work of those in the House and Senate who voted to strengthen Washington's DUI laws. The bill passed today is one that focuses rightly on repeat offenders with mandatory booking and jail time for second and subsequent offenders, enhanced ignition interlock requirements, increased funding to help prosecutors speed up the filing of charges, and a 24/7 sobriety program so we can electronically monitor repeat offenders.
"While this doesn't do everything we need or everything I hoped, this is an important step to saving more lives. I look forward to continuing our efforts to crack down on those who choose to endanger the lives and livelihoods of others by choosing to drive while under the influence of drugs or alcohol."
