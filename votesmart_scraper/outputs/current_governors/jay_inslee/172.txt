*Jay has been a staunch advocate for health care reform and helped oversee implementation of the Affordable Care Act in Washington state. He has spoken out against efforts to overturn this landmark policy which has successfully helped millions of people across the country access health insurance and reduced Washington's uninsured rate by nearly 40 percent.
*Jay has consistently fought to protect women's constitutional right to choose, from blocking Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood to championing increased access to family planning and reproductive-health care services for all women, including Pap smears, cancer screenings and emergency contraception.
*Jay supports marriage equality. He supported and advocated for the effort to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington and continues to speak out against efforts to repeal or challenge equal rights in Washington and other states.
