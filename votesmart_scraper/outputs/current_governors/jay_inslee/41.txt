Inslee Statement on Apparent Hate Crime Shooting in Kent
Statement

"In Kent Friday night, one of our fellow Washingtonians suffered a gunshot wound in his own driveway. By all accounts this was not a random act of violence, but a crime of hate, with the shooter targeting the victim because he was a member of the Sikh faith.
"Trudi and I are thankful the victim survived his wounds, and is expected to be released from the hospital very soon. We send our thoughts and prayers from our family and from all Washingtonians to the victim as we hope for a swift recovery from his injuries.
"This hateful incident echoes the disturbing pattern of anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic, and anti-Muslim attacks in our state, and across the country. Just last week in Kansas, a similar incident occurred with an even more tragic outcome. These acts of violence are hateful, detestable, and un-American.
"Earlier today I spoke to Jasmit Singh, one of the leaders in the local Sikh community, and let him know that Washington stands with the Sikh community and all members of our diverse state. My office stands ready to help in any way possible.
"The Kent Police Department is working with the F.B.I. on their investigation, and I encourage all residents in the area to be vigilant and cooperative as they work to bring the individual responsible to justice."
