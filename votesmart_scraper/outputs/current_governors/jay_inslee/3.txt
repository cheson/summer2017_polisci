Statement from Gov. Jay Inslee on budget to be voted on today:
"When I rolled out my budget proposal in December, I said that I would judge the success of this session on two things: whether we fully fund education and do so without cutting services that protect the health and safety of vulnerable Washingtonians and families. This budget does both.
"This is a historic budget that I believe fully funds our schools for the first time in decades and will meet our constitutional obligations. In addition, we are creating a new department of children, youth and family services, and making significant new investments in transforming our mental health system. This budget fully funds the collective bargaining agreements for hard-working state employees and protects crucial safety net services.
"As I have said, a split Legislature means compromises are necessary and neither side will get everything it wants.
"My staff and I are still reviewing the budget proposal, and I urge legislators to send it to my desk as soon as possible to ensure no further disruption to state services as we enter the final hours before today's deadline."
