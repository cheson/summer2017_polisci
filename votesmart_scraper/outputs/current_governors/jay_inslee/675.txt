House Passes Repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell
Statement
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Dec. 16, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

This afternoon, Rep. Jay Inslee (WA-01) passed legislation to repeal the military's policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell (DADT), the second time this year. DADT, enacted in 1993, prohibits people who "demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts" from serving in the armed forces of the United States. The House passed the repeal by a vote of 250-175. Following the vote Rep. Inslee released this statement:
"Discrimination in our armed forces is wrong, unfair and robs our military of some of the best and brightest. The truth is that hundreds of thousands of gay men and women have served in the United States military for decades, and they have done so with great courage and honor. We shouldn't be asking these brave men and women--who put their lives in harm's way in service to our nation--to also live a lie."
"To those who have genuine concerns about the effect this may have on the armed forces, our men and women in uniform have provided extensive input on this issue and by vast majorities they believe changing the policy will not impact military performance. The Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agree and have asked Congress to change this policy."
