Statement

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
I was just reading the doctor's report. It says, "We judge global climate change will have wide-ranging implications for U.S. national security interests over the next 20 years. Climate change could threaten domestic stability in some states, potentially contribute to intra- or less likely interstate conflicts, particularly over access to increasingly scarce water resources. We judge that economic migrants will perceive additional reasons to migrate because of harsh climates both within nations from disadvantaged to richer countries."
Now, there, I don't think you have to be an intelligence or a secret agent with classified experience to recognize a security concern of the United States. And I want to ask you about what we're doing about that. Many of us believe we should stop global warming so we can eliminate or reduce these security threats to the United States. And I want to ask how we can go about that.
I want to refer to a chart. This is a chart showing our research budgets for a variety of national enterprises. On the left is the chart for the research budget. Steph, could you hold this over here at some point? Hold up a little bit more, please. This is the research budget for the United States for our entire energy R&D research budget. You see it peaked in 1980. It's gone down since then. It's about $3 billion a year.
