"Today's House Finance Committee vote is good progress towards addressing one of the key budget issues known as the Bracken decision and I expect the Legislature to reach agreement on that in the next couple of days. However, there is still much that remains to be done and time is running out. There are less than two weeks left. If budget negotiators are able to reach key compromise agreements in the next week, we will be able to finish on time. But negotiators need to pick up the pace to make it happen."
