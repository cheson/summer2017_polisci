Inslee Statement on Congressional Budget Office Score of Republican ACA-Repeal Bill
Statement
By: Jay Inslee
Date: March 13, 2017

"Today's analysis from the nonpartisan CBO confirms our worst fears about the Republican effort in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It would actually leave our nation worse off than before the ACA was implemented. Republican leaders use words like "freedom' and "choice' to hide what they're really doing, which is ripping away one of our most important safety nets and rewinding the clock to a time before cancer patients could get coverage, all women could get preventative care and thousands could get help for opioid addiction.
"I will be personally contacting every member of Washington's congressional delegation and calling on them to reject this attack on working families and vulnerable Americans."
Last week, Gov. Jay Inslee requested a detailed analysis of the impacts the Congressional Republican proposal would have on Washington state. The governor will be discussing details later this week.
