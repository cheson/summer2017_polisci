Landmark Mining-Reform Bill Clears Committee
Today the House Natural Resources Committee, a panel on which U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) serves, approved comprehensive legislation that would reform the anachronistic law that has governed hardrock mining on public lands since 1872. It included two key provisions authored by Inslee.
"This mine-company giveaway is more obsolete than the use of canaries," said Inslee, referring to the fact that the Mining Law of 1872 has allowed gold, silver, copper and uranium to be extracted from federal land for 135 years with no royalty paid to the American people - unlike oil, gas and coal developers.
The legislation approved today, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act, H.R. 2262, would overhaul guidelines for mining these and other valuable minerals on federal lands. Most notably, it would improve environmental standards by implementing a careful permitting process and requirements for mine operation and reclamation; end the sale of public lands to developers at 1872 prices ($2.50 to $5 an acre); and, establish an eight percent gross income royalty on new mineral production and a four percent gross income royalty on existing mining operations. These royalties would help fund the estimated $30 to $70 billion needed to clean up abandoned mines.
Provisions authored by Inslee and included in the bill include one that would prohibit permits for mining near national parks if such activities would negatively impact the health or beauty of the park. It was supported by the National Parks Conservation Association, National Resources Defense Council and The Wilderness Society, among other conservation organizations. Inslee's other amendment would ensure that the payment of claim-maintenance fees by mining companies is not used to unduly restrict the use of public land.
