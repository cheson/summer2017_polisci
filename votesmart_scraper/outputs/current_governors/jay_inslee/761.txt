Clean Energy Race
Floor Speech

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, this morning America is engaged in a great race, and that is a race with China to see who will be preeminent in the creation of millions of new jobs in the new clean energy economy. The President is right: the Nation that leads the clean energy economy will lead the world economy, and he is right that we do not intend to finish second place in this race.
Now at this moment, there is something pending in the U.S. Senate to determine whether we will win this race. There is something that is absolutely fundamental to drive millions of dollars of investment to these new technologies in solar and wind and geothermal so that we will finish first in this race, and that is to put a cap on carbon pollution. Because when we put a cap on carbon pollution, we will drive investment into the jobs of tomorrow. We must remain resolute. We call on the President to remain resolute. We have to deliver a cap on carbon so we can finish number one in the jobs race.
