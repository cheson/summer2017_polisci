CLARIFICATION ON COMMENTS ON JUDICIARY NEEDED -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2005)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, some time ago the majority leader of the House, in response to the Schiavo decision, said, "The time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior." The majority leader yesterday rightfully apologized for those comments, and I think that we should respect that apology, because we are all capable of saying something that we regret that was misunderstood.
But it is most troubling that at the same time the majority leader again threatened the independence of the judiciary. He threatened them with taking away their jurisdiction, he threatened them with breaking up their districts, and he basically threatened this organ of our government that is responsible for our freedoms, for protecting our freedom of religion and protecting our freedom of speech. We have what Russia did not have, an independent judiciary; and I am most troubled that the majority leader, when it comes to their independence and our freedoms and the importance of both of those things, just does not get it.
Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that he will reconsider his comments yesterday and follow his first apology, if not with a second, with at least a clarification.
