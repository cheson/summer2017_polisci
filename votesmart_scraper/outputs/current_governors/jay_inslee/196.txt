A new Washington Life Science & Global Health Advisory Council met for the first time yesterday kicking off a concerted effort by Gov. Jay Inslee to strengthen what he says is one of the state's highest potential innovation sectors.
Gov. Jay Inslee announced the new Council last week at the Governor's Life Sciences Summit & Annual Meeting. The Council, co-chaired by Lisa Cohen, executive director of the Washington Global Health Alliance, Chris Rivera, president of the Washington Biotechnology & Biomedical Association, and Maura Little, Inslee's sector lead advisor for life sciences and global health, convened for their first meeting yesterday in Olympia.
"We have some of the most exciting, leading-edge research and development happening right here in our state -- research and development that can give our loved ones a better quality and longer span of life," Inslee said. "But our state is competing for the people and resources needed to grow this important mission-driven sector. Washington has the potential to be a global leader in global health and life sciences and over the next two years, that's my goal and that's what this advisory council will help us do."
