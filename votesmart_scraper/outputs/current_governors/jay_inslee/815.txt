Grow Clean Energy Jobs
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, Americans are an optimistic people. That was confirmed yesterday when results came out showing that Americans believe, by a 2-1 margin, that we will grow clean energy jobs by the millions when we adopt a clean energy bill in this House, and they are right.
We should be optimistic that we are going to build electric cars and sell them to the rest of the world, not just China. We ought to be optimistic that we are going to build concentrated solar energy technology and sell it to the rest of the world.
We ought to be optimistic that we are going to build the electric batteries that will fuel our cars and help make our grid more responsive.
This is the optimism that those of us have who are going to pass a clean energy bill this year to make this happen.
Here is another reason for optimism. Yesterday we reached a consensus in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. With broad swathes of the country, the south-north industrial egg, we have reached a consensus that we are going to grow jobs everywhere in this country because we are the optimists, and the optimists are going to win this clean energy debate.
