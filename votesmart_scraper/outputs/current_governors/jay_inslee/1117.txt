CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT OF 2005 -- (House of Representatives - February 17, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I heard an earlier speaker refer to class actions as a game. Try telling that to the 9-year-old son of Janet Huggins, a 39-year-old healthy Tennessee mother who took Vioxx and died in September 2004. Tell her family that the effort to protect her family is a game. This is not a game. This is flesh and blood, the ability to protect your family when something happens to you that you did not have anything to do with.
This bill is the Vioxx Protection Bill. It is the Wal-Mart Protection Bill. It is the Tyco Protection Bill. It is the Enron Protection Bill. Anyone in the State of Washington who saw what Enron did to us, stealing $1 billion, should not be voting for this bill, because this bill in many ways is the Just Say No Bill to People Who Are Injured By Rapacious Wrongdoers.
In three ways it says "just say no" to consumers who were hurt by Enron, because in the Federal courts, if you happen to be in a plaintiff's group of multiple States and the laws are a little different in the States, do you know what the Federal courts do? They throw out the class action.
Do you want to know why the Chamber of Commerce is spending $1 billion to lobby on what seems to be a procedural issue? Because they throw out class actions where there is any difference in States, meaning you will not be able to have a class action anywhere, anywhere, Federal or State.
Why is this so important? I liken this to right now you have two arms to protect Americans, the State judicial system and the Federal judicial system. This reduces by half the resources that are available to Americans to get redress when Enron steals from them or when Vioxx kills them.
