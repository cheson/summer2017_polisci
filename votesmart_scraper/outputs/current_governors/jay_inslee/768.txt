The Birthers And Deniers Are Wrong
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, the President is right to go to Copenhagen and lead the world against global warming. He is right to defeat the birthers who have tried to stop him from being President and the deniers who refuse to accept the fact of global warming. Both the birthers and the deniers refuse to accept clear, pure facts.
I just read that a former Governor of Alaska was arguing today in a newspaper that there is no such thing as global warming associated with human activity. She needs to read the National Academy of Sciences report which concludes it is a fact. She needs to read the report of NASA--the people who put the men on the Moon--that concludes this is a fact. She needs to read the NOAA reports about acidification of the ocean which shows it is a fact.
The birthers and the deniers are wrong. We should restore American leadership and make sure the jobs of the future clean energy economy are here, not just in China. The President is right; the deniers are wrong yet again.
