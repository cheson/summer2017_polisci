Governor Inslee's statement on the Obama Administration's announcement regarding new standards to reduce carbon pollution from large power plants
"I commend President Obama and EPA Administrator McCarthy for today releasing standards to reduce carbon pollution from large power plants. This Clean Air Act standard is an essential step on the road to tackling climate change.
"In Washington state, we know that climate change is one of the biggest threats to the health, safety and vitality of our communities. From a lack of water for agriculture, increasingly devastating wildfires, and rising acidification levels in the Pacific Ocean in Puget Sound - we are seeing these climate effects today. Without strong action to tackle greenhouse gas pollution at both state and federal levels, our quality of life will diminish and our economy will suffer.
"Power plants are the nation's largest source of carbon pollution, and this new standard will ensure that future power plants are cleaner, more efficient, and better for the planet. And by driving demand for cleaner and more efficient sources of energy, this rule will help to realize the enormous economic opportunities in clean energy. Washington state is and will continue to be a leader in energy efficiency and clean tech innovation, and I am glad to have the Obama Administration as a committed ally in the fight to beat climate change and lead in clean energy."
