"Thanks to House Appropriations Chairman Ross Hunter for the supplemental budget proposal he put forward today. The House budget goes further than the Senate's in addressing our constitutional basic education obligations. While I would like to see a bigger K-12 investment, it is significant that we all agree we must take additional action this year.
"I also want to commend Rep. Hunter and House Finance Chairman Reuven Carlyle for putting forward a separate plan for closing tax breaks to improve early learning and restore cost-of-living raises for our teachers. These tax breaks simply do not measure up to our education needs.
"I look forward to working with the Legislature in reaching a final budget agreement."
