Race to Grow Clean Energy Jobs
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee

Location: Washington, DC

Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, we are involved in a race today. It's a race to grow clean energy jobs, and we are in a race with the rest of the world and particularly China.
China recently announced they will be investing over $750 billion over the next 10 years to grow clean energy jobs in China. They have announced they are going to put a cap on carbon so that they can create demand for the creation of new, clean energy jobs.
What are we doing in this country? Unfortunately, the other Chamber, the U.S. Senate, has dropped the ball and isn't moving a ball to create a demand for these new clean energy jobs with a cap on carbon.
We can lose this race if we don't get off the dime and get into this race. But I want to assure folks we are going to get into this race one way or another and one way is with the Environmental Protection Agency creating a limitation on carbon so we can create the demands for these clean energy jobs so we can make clean energy electric cars in this country and sell them into China.
For those people who are going to object to the EPA regulation of carbon, you had your chance and you can't be heard to squawk. We are going to move forward on clean energy jobs.
