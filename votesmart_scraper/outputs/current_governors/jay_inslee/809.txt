BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to commend the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2009 to my colleagues.
I just want to make two or three points. First, this phenomenon of online radio is just a tremendous service for our constituents; 42 million Americans are enjoying this on at least a semiregular basis. It is growing rapidly. It is a very, very beloved service. And when it goes missing, as it did recently in my City of Seattle, a little station called OCO was sort of providing underground music to my local community and had to shut down as a result of the CRB decision, and it is much missed. We hope to get this and many other things back up when we get this settlement going.
Second, I think there is widespread agreement that the average 47 percent of revenues that the CRB decision would require simply is not sustainable for the industry. And I want to commend all parties to the discussions to try to find an appropriate way to move forward.
The third point I want to make is that keeping online radio going and healthy is not just about entertainment; it's about news, it's about public information, it's about emergency preparedness. We've got to do everything we can to give our constituents multiple sources of information. By allowing this bill to go through--and, hopefully, the parties will reach a final settlement--we're going to allow a democracy to blossom.
So I want to thank Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Smith for their cooperation in facilitating this and commend this bill to my colleagues.
