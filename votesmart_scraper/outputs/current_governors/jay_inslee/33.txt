Inslee Statement on House Budget Proposal
Statement

"When I rolled out my budget proposal in December, I was very clear that any final budget must meet two criteria: 1) Fully fund education; and 2) Protect vital state services for our most vulnerable.
"The House budget does both those things. Their proposal fully and amply funds education while protecting critical services for our families and communities.
"The budget the Senate approved last week fails on both counts. That budget calls for large property tax increases and makes minimal new investments in education while cutting services to our students, their families and vulnerable people.
"I am pleased we have two legislative budgets on the table and I look forward to working with the Senate and House over the coming weeks so we can reach agreement on a budget that fully and amply funds education and works for all Washingtonians."
