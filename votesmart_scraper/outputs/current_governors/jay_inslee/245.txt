"I applaud the Supreme Court for upholding this landmark law that is helping so many people here in Washington state and across the nation. The Affordable Care Act has helped more than 730,000 Washingtonians find affordable care, and more than 300,000 of those had been uninsured. Our uninsured rate has fallen nearly 40 percent since implementing ACA and is now at its lowest level since 1985.
"I hope that this clear and convincing decision will help put an end to the relentless and misguided efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It's working. It's constitutional. And we should thank President Obama for his foresight and hard work in getting this done."
