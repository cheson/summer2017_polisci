More than 2,000 people, most of them state employees, gathered in Tacoma this week to learn and share ways to improve government services and achieve better outcomes for Washingtonians.
"We're using lean problem solving and collaboration to help employees manage the work and to serve people better," said Gov. Jay Inslee, who spoke at the opening of the state conference. "We're using those same approaches to work on challenges in education, public health, the environment and other areas."
