ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to engage in a colloquy with Chairman Visclosky and my colleague Rush Holt. I'd like to thank the chairman for including $22 million in funding for hydropower energy at the Department of Energy.
As the chairman well knows, U.S. wave and current energy resource potential that could be credibly harnessed is about 400 TerraWatt hours per year. That's about 10 percent of our total national energy demand. Just like the wind, coal, gas, oil, geothermal, conventional hydropower, and nuclear power industries have been nurtured through Federal research and development and other industry incentives, this new renewable energy source needs support from our government to get started.
The U.S. stands poised to take advantage of many of the technological opportunities available to ocean, wave and tidal power. While the Europeans profited in the early years of wind energy development, we're poised to lead the world in marine renewable energy technology development.
