Yesterday Jay's Safe Drug Disposal Act of 2010 was voted out of the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Working closely with Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan, Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, and Rep. Jim Moran of Virginia, this legislation would allow local communities to create safe drug disposal programs to give consumers a safe and environmentally sound way to dispose of unneeded and unused pharmaceuticals, including controlled substances.
Washington state has seen the effect of prescription drug abuse first hand.
* Drug overdoses have surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of accidental deaths in Washington.
* n King County, deaths cause by prescription opiate overdoses rose from 29 in 1998 to 153 in 2008.
* About one in eight Washington 12th graders used prescription pain relievers to get high in the past 30 days.
We expect the legislation to move quickly through the full committee with bipartisan support and then to the House floor for a vote.
