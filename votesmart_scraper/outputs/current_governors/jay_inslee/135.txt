Inslee Prohibits Non-essential State-funded Travel to North Carolina
By: Jay Inslee
Date: March 29, 2016
Location: Olympia, WA

Gov. Jay Inslee today issued a memo to state agencies prohibiting non-essential state-funded travel to North Carolina in light of that state's legislation allowing discrimination against transgender men and women.
"Our nation is rightfully moving toward increased acceptance and celebration of diversity. The discriminatory policies being promoted by North Carolina is not something our state condones or supports," Inslee said.
Inslee says he appreciates the Washington State Human Rights Commission's work on recently adopted new rules affirming the rights of transgender men and women to use facilities consistent with their gender identity.
"Washington is a state where everyone should feel free to be who they are without fear of discrimination, intimidation or harassment. It's important that our state laws, policies and practices reflect the values and realities of the people we serve."
