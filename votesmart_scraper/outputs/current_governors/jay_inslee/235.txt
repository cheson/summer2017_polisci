Gov. Jay Inslee today announced that Washington has been awarded $15.6 million in AmeriCorps funding from the Corporation for National and Community Service.
These grants will support 1,433 AmeriCorps members across the state serving with 17 organizations. AmeriCorps members will tackle critical challenges in Washington, including helping in education settings, preserving the environment, assisting with disaster response and recovery, and supporting veterans and military families.
Of the total amount, $14.4 million plus $82,000 in carryover funding will be directed to Serve Washington, the governor-appointed state service commission, which in turn will award grants to 15 nonprofit organizations and public agencies across the state. Funds will engage 1,334 AmeriCorps members in service. In addition, $1.2 million is being awarded to two multi-state programs headquartered in Washington, which will add 99 AmeriCorps positions.
"National service is an essential part of the solution to many of the challenges facing our state," Inslee said. "These AmeriCorps members will meet pressing local needs as they develop civic and leadership skills to last a lifetime. I congratulate these outstanding organizations and thank all those who serve their communities through AmeriCorps."
"AmeriCorps members make a powerful impact on the toughest challenges facing our nation," said CNCS CEO Wendy Spencer. "Building on Washington's strong tradition of neighbor helping neighbor, AmeriCorps members will improve lives and strengthen communities across the state. As they serve others, AmeriCorps members will also expand opportunity for themselves, gaining skills and experience to jump-start their careers."
