Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the Boeing Co. on their first flight of the 787 Dreamliner. This successful flight marks an important milestone in the development of the 787 Dreamliner, and represents the collective efforts and hard work of everyone at the Boeing Company, particularly the dedicated Boeing employees who live in my district. The 787 Dreamliner is airplane that is not only much more efficient than any other airplane on the market, but also represents a new generation of technologically advanced commercial airplanes that will change the future of commercial aviation.
