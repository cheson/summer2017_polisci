Berman Co-authors Bipartisan Letter Urging President Bush to Increse Funding for International Affairs Programs
Washington, D.C. -

President George W. Bush
The White House

Washington, DC 20500
Dear President Bush,
We are writing to express strong, bipartisan support for an increase in the FY 07 International Affairs budget - one that builds on the sensible funding increases you have requested in recent years. This vital investment in America's fight against global terrorism and efforts to build global stability promotes economic prosperity and expresses the compassion of the American people for those in need around the world.
After the Cold War ended, the United States drastically cut resources for the International Affairs Budget, reaching historic lows. Since then, and in particular since September 11, 2001, Congress and the Administration have worked together to reinvest in these programs. Continuing our investment in the International Affairs Budget equips the United States to face its global challenges -- and its opportunities - in the 21st century and affirms the reality that what happens abroad ultimately affects our prosperity, our values, and our safety here at home.
The array of programs in the International Affairs toolkit is vast, from combating the proliferation of nuclear weapons to boosting sales of our nation's goods and services around the world through export promotion and commercial diplomacy, to investing in maternal and child health. This budget provides assistance to extend opportunity through economic development, strengthening democracies and civil societies, and responding to global challenges such as HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, hunger, illiteracy, and environmental degradation.
The International Affairs Budget spurs our outreach to the world through vigorous public diplomacy, people-to-people educational and cultural exchanges, Peace Corps volunteers, and capable, secure embassies and diplomats who provide the first line of offense for America's interests abroad. Our emergency food aid program provides relief for those suffering from famine and disaster.
As Secretary of State Rice said recently, "This time of global transformation calls for transformational diplomacy. More than ever, in today's fast-evolving international environment, America's diplomats need to have the resources to act swiftly and effectively to avert dangers and seize opportunities that allow us to tip the global balance of power toward freedom."
We stand together with renewed determination that America must remain engaged in the world and utilize all of the tools and resources that strengthen U.S. national interests -- including the International Affairs Budget. As you prepare the FY07 Federal Budget, we urge you to support substantially increased funding for international affairs programs.
