"Trudi and I send our deepest condolences to the families of the three young victims of this morning's shooting in Mukilteo and join the community in praying for the recovery of the young person taken to Harborview. These victims were just starting the new chapter of their lives as young adults. Such a loss is difficult to comprehend and we know the hearts of every Washingtonian go out to their grieving mothers and fathers.
"Details are still emerging as to how and why this happened. State troopers acted courageously to apprehend the suspect early this morning. Troopers and officers are working diligently on their investigation. I spoke with Mayor Gregerson this morning and let her know we stand ready to support the city's investigation efforts and to bring the shooter to justice. We also stand by to help support the many other young people who had to witness such a horrific act of violence."
