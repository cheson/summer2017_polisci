FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Have we forgotten what our ancestors have done in the cause of liberty? Don't we realize there are some lines we can never cross? Don't we realize we should never legitimize illegal violations of America's privacy rights, which this bill does?
This bill says if the telecommunication companies violated America's privacy willfully, knowingly, knowing it was illegal, we are giving them immunity. Where is the excuse for that? Where is the excuse for turning a Nation of laws into a Nation that will be led by a President who knows how to manipulate our fears?
We have got to know the law is our ultimate guardian of liberty, and those on this side have accused us of having a pre-9/11 mentality. Let me remind them that July 4, 1776, was pre-9/11. And heaven help us the day that those values are shucked aside at the service of fear.
Reject this bill.
