Introducing Oil Independence for a Stronger America of 2010
Floor Speech

* Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce Oil Independence for a Stronger America Act of 2010, a bipartisan bill to help transition our transportation sector from an oil-based system to one based on electricity and natural gas. This legislation is a significant investment in our shared goals to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and ramp up production of homegrown biofuels in states like Washington that can spur our economy and create American jobs. As many of you know, the U.S. has only two percent of the world's oil reserves while we consume 23 percent of the world's oil. The status quo is not in our national security interests, or economic interests. Of all the oil that is used in the United States each day, 57 percent is imported, and 70 percent of that imported oil comes from countries that do not enjoy many of the same basic freedoms as U.S. citizens. Further, this addiction costs the U.S. economy close to $1 billion per day. This imbalance of supply and demand means that the U.S. will be dependent on foreign sources of oil unless we create smart and thoughtful policies to invest in America's clean energy technologies and infrastructure.
* This bill provides the necessary framework for the United States change invigorate new American industries and kick our oil habit. To put this in perspective everyone should know that approximately one-third of the total amount of energy consumed in the United States is to fuel the 249 million vehicles that are burning gas on our highways.
* The Oil Independence for a Stronger America Act of 2010 contains language that has the goal of reducing our dependence on oil by approximately 3 billion barrels per year, a number that represents nearly all of our oil imports. This bill would:
* 1. Establish the National Energy Security Program to coordinate oil reduction efforts across all of government
* 2. Help deploy electric and natural gas vehicles though tax credits and deployment demonstration projects
* 3. Amend current federal transportation planning rules to include planning for oil savings in transportation infrastructure plans developed by states and authorize funding for projects to implement the plans
* 4. Help the U.S. advanced biofuels industry scale up to commercial levels
* 5. Support research and development in battery technologies
* In addition to strengthening America by reigning in our oil consumption the legislation also has very positive environmental benefits. Almost 1/3 of all the Green House Gas, GHG, emissions in the U.S. come from the transportation sector. Switching over 60 percent of our transportation sector to electric vehicles would cut emissions by 33 percent. This is the equivalent of taking 82 million gas burning cars off the road.
* In the great state of Washington, interests from the private and public sectors are already working to bring electric vehicles and the associated infrastructure to the 1-5 corridor. Their efforts can be greatly enhanced by this legislation. Realizing the goals of this legislation will ensure that the U.S. secures its competitive edge in this field.
* This legislation is a win-win-win for the future of the United States. We can help secure our nation's energy resources, reduce our nations greenhouse gas emissions significantly which will help mitigate issues of global climate change, and ensure that innovative transportation technologies like advanced batteries and advanced biofuels are made here in the United States. In closing, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill, and hope that we can work together to move it toward passage as soon as possible.
