Safe Drug Disposal Act Of 2009
* Madam Speaker, I am proud to announce the introduction of the Safe Drug Disposal Act of 2009. This important bill allows states the opportunity to continue their outstanding work to clean up our streets and waterways from unused pharmaceuticals, including both controlled and uncontrolled substances. It is my hope that Congress will give as much attention to this bill as it deserves.
* In 1970, the Controlled Substances Act was enacted into law under title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. This valuable act was designed to protect the American public from recreational use of controlled substances by creating a closed loop system, which restricts the movement of controlled substances to individuals designated to handle such substances. Unfortunately, as we learn more about the high risks of controlled substances on our streets and in our water ways, the Controlled Substances Act has inadvertently established a barrier between safe and unsafe disposal methods of unused or unwanted controlled substances. Without amending this law, controlled substance abuse on our streets and prescription drug pollution of our water ways will continue to rise.
* In 2007, a study conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services found that, while cocaine and methamphetamine use among young adults dropped significantly, prescription drug abuse increased. Among young adults ages 18 to 25, the level of current nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers has risen 12 percent. Further, results of a separate study of seventh through twelfth grade students released on April 21, 2005 by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America indicated that teenagers are more likely to have abused a prescription pain medication to get high than they are to have experimented with a variety of illicit drugs including ecstasy, cocaine, crack, and LSD. During this study, one in five teenagers reported using the controlled substance Vicodin without a prescription; approximately ten percent reported using the controlled substance OxyContin without a prescription; and ten percent reported having used prescription stimulants, Ritalin and/or Adderall, without a prescription.
* One reason why pharmaceutical drug diversion has increased over the last few years is the availability of unused prescription drugs. Among teenagers surveyed in the April 21, 2005 study administered by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, fifty percent indicated that prescription drugs are widely available, one-third indicated that prescription drugs were easy to purchase over the Internet, and sixty-three percent said they could easily obtain prescription opiates and painkillers from their own home. Family medicine cabinets all across America have turned into the drug dealers of today.
* It is not irresponsibility that has driven the abundance of pharmaceuticals in households across America. Americans have their hands tied when they look to dispose of unused pharmaceuticals. The choice to either throw them in the trash or flush them down the toilet is environmentally unacceptable. Recent reports indicate traces of common medicines such as acetaminophen, hormones, blood pressure medications, codeine and antibiotics in very low concentrations in 80 percent of samples taken from 139 streams across 30 states. Researchers are continuously finding diluted concentrations of pharmaceutical residues harm fish, frogs and other aquatic species in the wild and impair the workings of human cells in laboratories.
* Many Americans understand the need for appropriate disposal methods in their communities. Just last year, Local Hazardous Waste Management Program in King County, WA collected over 1,100 lbs of uncontrolled substances per month during their Safe Medicine Return Pilot program. It is programs like these that will provide a safe means of disposal to take prescription drugs off the streets and out of our water.
* I am pleased to introduce the Safe Drug Disposal Act of 2009. It is my hope that Congress will consider this important piece legislation to keep our communities and waterways free from waste pharmaceuticals.
