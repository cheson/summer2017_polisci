Don't Ask Don't Tell Repeal
Floor Speech

Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to note that the sun indeed came up in America today even after we've allowed people who are gay and lesbian to serve in our military.
We had a discussion for about 18 years, and now we have finally taken a step forward to liberty and freedom and equality again as we have so many times in American history.
Now we need to make sure that those new families that are serving in the military get their benefits like everyone else, and that's the next thing we need to work on.
Then we have to realize that the day will come when we recognize full marriage equality in this great country as another step forward just like we had yesterday. And when that great day comes, the sun will come up in the morning in America because we were continuing our quest to be a more just, more equal society.
