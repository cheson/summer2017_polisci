"This new collective bargaining agreement is welcome news for the workers and the three grain facilities that are part of the Northwest Grain Agreement. It is also great news for Washington's internationally acclaimed grain industry. I am grateful that the lockout's disruption to the marketplace was kept to a minimum and that for most of those 18 months state grain inspections continued. I understand that both sides compromised in this new agreement and I want to thank them for going back to the table to negotiate in good faith and find an agreement to bring stability to our grain export industry and allow terminal operators to remain competitive."
