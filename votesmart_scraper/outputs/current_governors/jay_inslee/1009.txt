RESTRICTING INDIAN GAMING TO HOMELANDS OF TRIBES ACT OF 2006 -- (House of Representatives - September 13, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. I think it is important to note that before we do violence to the existing situation here that there has been substantial success. In the existing relationships, we have had only three essential tribes, all of which have been done with largely local jurisdictions' approval. To do significant changes to upset that balance would erode, and I do believe this bill as currently written does erode, to a degree, tribal sovereignty in this regard. For that reason, I don't believe it is necessary at this time, and there can be and should be improvements.
It is disappointing again that democracy isn't functioning here in this body in that we are not allowed to offer amendments on the floor to a very critical issue involving tribal sovereignty. We have seen tribes abused historically in this country. I think that is happening again today where this bill is not allowed to be subject to the amendment process on the floor that it should.
But I also want to note that I believe that somehow the gaming process has not assisted folks in these tribes. I just want to attest, having seen boys and girls clubs established, in fact, first boys and girls club on a reservation in the Toledo reservation in the State of Washington, as a result of this economic activity, there are a lot of good economic activities happening in these communities. I think this bill will not foster them and we should oppose it.
