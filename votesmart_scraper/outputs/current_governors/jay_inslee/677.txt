Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, our cab driver the other day said he served in the last segregated African American unit during the Korean War. He told me there were five guys in his unit who were gay, and he thought those guys were the best because all five of those gay soldiers were on the boxing team of his unit, and they beat the stuffing out of anybody they fought.
That's who we need right now with those .50 calibers and on our bridges and in our cockpits--the best fighters America can produce. Right now, in warfare, we cannot afford the luxury of discrimination. Put those Americans to work fighting for freedom. We need them.
