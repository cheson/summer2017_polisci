Wisconsin Shenanigans
Floor Speech

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. Speaker, middle class Americans around the country are very concerned about what's going on in Wisconsin for two reasons. The first reason is that they fundamentally understand that while we all have to tighten our belts--and they've seen workers do that in Wisconsin, to give up various rights under bargaining agreements--they understand fundamentally that we can't solve this problem by attacking the middle class. And second, they understand that the shenanigans that went on last night in Wisconsin are an assault on some democratic principles that we have long enjoyed.
We have long enjoyed the right to petition our government for redress of grievances. It's right there in the grand old document that we took an oath to. And fundamentally, this is a reduction in the ability of Americans to work together, to speak with one voice to and with their government.
This will not abide. We've got to respect the middle class. We've got to respect democracy and move forward together as a country.
