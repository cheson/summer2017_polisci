Gov. Jay Inslee issued the following statement on the Congressional Budget Office's score of the American Health Care Act passed by the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month:
"The Congressional Republicans who voted for this bill are turning back the clock to when our state had double-digit uninsured rates and hundreds of thousands of Washington families and workers faced crippling uncertainty about their ability to find affordable coverage. They destroy Medicaid as we know it so they can give the wealthiest Americans a $600 billion tax giveaway. The CBO score shows the bill leaves America worse off than if we had never addressed health reform at all.
"This is a policy disaster for which Washingtonians will not stand. We won't let them take away health coverage from over 700,000 of our friends, neighbors and families. I urge the U.S. Senate to reject this measure, and instead work on improving our current policies which are helping so many people in our state and across the country."
