RECOUPING MONEY STOLEN BY ENRON -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2004)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, it is high time for the Bush administration to take action to recoup the hundreds of millions of dollars that the Enron energy trading racket stole from people in the State of Washington.
We have now heard the tapes, the smoking guns, where energy traders talk about "jamming" grandmothers in Washington State, saying "burn, baby, burn," during the brownouts, just laughing at the fact that they got away with hundreds of millions of dollars of theft.
We are calling on the administration to stop protecting the Enron energy trading racket. We will offer on the floor of the House next week an amendment to compel the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to get off the dime and get our money back from Enron.
This is a ripoff that is too obvious even for the Bush administration to ignore, and it is time for Congress to stand up on our hind legs and force this administration to take action. The people in Snohomish County deserve their hundreds of millions of dollars back, and we are going to see to it that they get it.
END
