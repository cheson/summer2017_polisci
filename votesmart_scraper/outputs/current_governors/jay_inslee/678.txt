Public Statements
Air Force Tanker
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee

Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I rise to alert my colleagues to a very important job creation issue that resides potentially in the defense authorization bill that may come to the floor.
We have the opportunity to do something right for the American worker and the American taxpayer by insisting that in the competition for the new Air Force tanker that we take into consideration the illegal subsidies that have benefited so extraordinarily the Airbus competitor for the tanker contract. It is absolutely imperative that at this moment when we are struggling to create jobs in this country that we take into consideration in this competition the fact that our competitors in Europe have received over $5 billion of illegal subsidies, and we have to insist the Pentagon take that into consideration.
For those that share my view, I hope you will join me in a letter to make sure that an amendment we passed will become part of the defense authorization bill. It is the only way to make sure that we keep these jobs in America and build a U.S. Air Force tanker.
