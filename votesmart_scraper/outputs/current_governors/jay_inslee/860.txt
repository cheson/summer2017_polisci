Inslee on accelerated re-bid of tanker contract
U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), whose Everett-area district is home to thousands of Boeing employees, made the following statement after Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced that the Pentagon would open an expedited process to re-bid a multibillion-dollar contract for Air Force aerial refueling tankers:
"This is huge not only for Washington state, but American warfighters and U.S. taxpayers as well. It gives the Defense Department another chance to select the Boeing tanker, which is the best aircraft and the best deal.
"It was gratifying to hear the defense secretary say that commonsense GAO findings need to be followed because that needs to happen if the process is to be respected.
"This is not a done deal. Members of Congress must remain aggressive, vocal and persistent to ensure that common sense rules the day, including when it comes to the issue of illegal Airbus subsidies."
On June 18, the Defense Department was given 60 days by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to re-evaluate the botched decision it made on February 29 to give the contract to Airbus over Boeing.
Gates announced today that the re-bid likely would be concluded and a new contract would be awarded before the end of this year. He also said issues regarding illegal Airbus subsidies would not be considered in the re-opened bid process.
