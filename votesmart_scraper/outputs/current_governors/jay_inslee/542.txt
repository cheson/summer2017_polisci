BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the United States Navy, who, under the leadership of Secretary Ray Mabus, is doing a fantastic job developing clean, green sources of energy for the United States Navy and, eventually, the world. The Navy is already flying the Blue Angels on biofuels, it is charging our communication equipment in Afghanistan with solar energy, and it is on a path to half of its energy coming from clean sources by 2020 and the Great Green Fleet by 2016.
In my State, we're building whole industries around this: Imperium Renewables, Targeted Growth, General Biofuels, Boeing, and Alaska Airlines.
We can power the future with clean energy. The Navy is leading the way. Washington State University is doing great work, and I know there's one great former Washington State student who's helping on this effort, and her name is Trudi.
