Inslee: Waiting and Deliberation on FCC Reclassification Is Over
Statement
By: Jay Inslee
Date: Sept. 30, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

This morning Rep. Jay Inslee (WA-01) released a statement regarding the announcement that efforts to craft bipartisan net neutrality legislation in Congress have stalled:
"Waiting and deliberation is over, the FCC must now move to reclassify broadband under Title II. Innovators and consumers can no longer wait, hoping, that the internet will remain open and free from discrimination -- they need certainty. For months I have encouraged the FCC to reinstate the rules of the road that have allowed for the explosion of innovation and economic growth on the internet. Instead, some have pointed to Congress to find a solution. Despite the efforts of Chairman Waxman, it is now clear that Congress will likely not find a bipartisan approach this year that will protect consumers and the online marketplace. The time for FCC action is now. We can't wait any longer."
