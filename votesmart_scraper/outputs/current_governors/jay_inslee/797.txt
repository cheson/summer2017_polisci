Cost Containment For Health Care Reform
Floor Speech

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, in our health care reform, our aspiration ought to be to give Americans the health care that people get at the Mayo Clinic, and nothing less. We can do this even though this sounds like a high bar because at the Mayo Clinic they provide cost-effective health care. Medicare spends about $6,700 a year in Rochester, Minnesota. In other places in the country, it is over twice that. In one town in Texas, it is $14,000 a year.
We need in our health care plan to provide quality medical care, choice of medical care, and cost-effective medical care. That's why in our bill we are going to need to insist on measures of peer profiling for physicians, critical protocols to make sure that quality happens, and reward for physicians for high quality. When we do this, patients will have the same quality as the Mayo Clinic and the same cost as the Mayo Clinic to the American taxpayer. That is a good deal. We have to make sure that cost containment is part of our health care plan.
