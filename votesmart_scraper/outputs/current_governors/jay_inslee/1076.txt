HURRICANE KATRINA -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2005)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, last weekend I went to the floor of the Astrodome to work with some of the evacuees. I have never been so inspired by people of courage and grace and great dignity.
On the way home on the flight from Houston to DC, there were 10 evacuees headed for Florida. In the middle of the flight, a young man took out a razor blade and slashed his wrists in a suicide attempt.
The pilot made the appropriate judgment. There were two MTs on board. They saved his life. Actually, it probably was not life threatening. We diverted to Nashville. We made a flight change in response to a problem.
Now this administration has to make a change in the flight plan about who and how FEMA is being run. It is a disaster in itself. We need a flight change, and this is not a matter of accountability. There are more hurricanes on the way.
FEMA's job in this disaster is not done. We do not have confidence in the people and the organization in the FEMA cockpit. It could crash again. This President needs to change FEMA, and we should be doing it in this debate today.
