Public Statements
We Need a Clean Energy Strategy
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee
Date: July 21, 2011
Location: Washington, DC

Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, as we search for a bipartisan solution to our fiscal short-term and long-term issues, I don't think we should be unmindful of what is really happening in the real world. In the real world, there are two things: One, we have a jobs crisis; and, two, we have Americans sweltering from coast to coast with unprecedented heat. And these things are connected, because if we adopt a clean energy strategy to develop clean energy sources, we can prevent our climate from continuing to change, which left unabated will leave New York City with three times the number of days with over 95 degree temperatures in the next several decades.
We need to have an energy policy that will invest in those clean energy jobs. And as we look for this bipartisan solution, let's not cut off our energy research, which is going to be successful building a new clean energy strategy for this country and building millions of new clean energy jobs and, by the way, keep us down to a climate that's habitable.
