Inslee Statement: "Senate Republicans Should Not Be Looking for a Constitutional Crisis, they Should Be Looking for an Education Solution"

"Today I convened a call with legislative leaders of both caucuses in the House and Senate to discuss next steps on the recent Supreme Court McCleary ruling. In that call I asked all four caucuses to appoint members to work in a bipartisan group to find a solution that fully funds education, complies with the court order, and removes the contempt order and sanctions that have been imposed upon the state.
"Not all of the caucuses agreed to do so.
"At the same time this morning, members of the Senate Republican caucus issued a lengthy letter about the court's ruling. It is unfortunate that those members are more focused on a legally dubious theory that attacks the court rather than on finding a productive solution to our education challenge. They should not be looking for a constitutional crisis, they should be looking for an education solution.
"I am focused on fully funding education, providing our students and educators what they need, and submitting a plan that complies with the court order. Focusing on anything else is a political distraction. I look forward to hearing from all the caucuses next week in the hopes that all the caucuses will focus on a solution to this educational challenge and contempt citation rather than on excuses for inaction."
