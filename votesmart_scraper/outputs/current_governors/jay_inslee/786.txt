* Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, today, I introduced the bipartisan Geothermal Production Expansion Act with Representative Mike Simpson, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue. Our bill will ensure that we tap into clean geothermal energy using on-the-shelf technologies.
* Geothermal energy has great potential to add clean energy to American electricity supplies. It is especially promising as a renewable resource because it is a base load power which doesn't require any fossil fuel backup.
* However, at this point in time, proven geothermal resources have at times gone undeveloped in instances involving adjoining federal lands because speculators increasingly drive up the cost of federal lands adjacent to a geothermal development site. This hurts developers who take on the upfront cost of exploration and developing a site because when an exploration proves fruitful, the developer is bid out of the market due to extremely high leasing costs for adjacent lands. In many cases, the end result is that the development is halted and no clean energy comes online.
* Already under EPACT 2005 amendments, BLM is allowed to issue three different noncompetitive leases for geothermal resources, which include: non-competitive geothermal leases to mining claim holders that have a valid operating plan (having invested capital), direct use leases and leases on parcels that do not sell at a competitive auction.
* The Geothermal Production Expansion Act is a targeted approach to the aforementioned speculation problem, simply creating a fourth category whereby the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) may issue a non-competitive geothermal lease, allowing qualified companies who hold legal rights to develop geothermal leases on certain adjoining lands.
* An added benefit, the bill will significantly accelerate the development of geothermal projects by reducing the time spent on nominating and waiting for an auction, which can add a minimum of one-to-two years to the development phase of a geothermal resource.
* This bill is a reasonable policy to ensure that developers who have invested substantial capital and made high risk investments can secure and develop geothermal discoveries. Additionally, it will help add renewable, domestically produced energy resources to the American consumers' electricity supply. I believe that this is an important issue and I hope that the House will soon consider this legislation.
