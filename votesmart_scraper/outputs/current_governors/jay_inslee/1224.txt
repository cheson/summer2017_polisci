We must ensure that working families in Washington State get a fair shake when it comes to defense contracts. Boeing is competing to build the next generation of air refueling tankers for the United States Air Force. They are up against Airbus, a European company that the World Trade Organization recently found guilty of receiving billions of dollars in illegal subsidies, allowing them to possibly undercut American workers. This is unfair and should not be allowed.
That is why I have:
* Authored an amendment that would force the Department of Defense to consider in the bidding process any unfair competition advantage. The amendment passed the House with overwhelming support, by a vote of 410-8.
* Joined with my colleagues in the House and Senate to communicate to the Department of Defense and the President that these illegal subsidies are a non-starter for the American people.
* Secured $600,000 for Edmonds Community College, for equipment for the Washington Aerospace Training and Research Center.
On a level playing field I know Washingtonians can make the best plane for the best price.
