THE NATIONAL DIABETES COORDINATOR ACT -- (Extensions of Remarks - December 19, 2007)
SPEECH OF
HON. JAY INSLEE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 19, 2007
* Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, yesterday I introduced The National Diabetes Coordinator
[Page: E2624]
Act, H.R. 4836. As some of my colleagues who have worked on issues relating to diabetes may be aware, the Federal Government spends over $80 billion per year treating diabetes and its complications.
* Since 1980, the number of Americans suffering from diabetes has doubled to more than 20 million, and that number is projected to double again by 2025.
* The serious complications stemming from diabetes--including heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, blindness, amputation and renal disease--are well documented and even more importantly, they are largely preventable with proper management and treatment.
* To that end, H.R. 4836 would establish a National Diabetes Coordinator to coordinate research and prevention activities throughout the federal government, including agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.
