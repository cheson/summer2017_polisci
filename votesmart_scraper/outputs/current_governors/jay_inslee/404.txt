Gov. Jay Inslee today said President Obama has approved the state's request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the SR 530 slide. Governor Inslee thanked President Obama for his quick approval which makes a number of programs available to assist individuals, households, and businesses impacted by the SR 530 slide on March 22. Additionally, it provides assistance to help support debris removal and emergency protective measures to prevent further destruction to life and property including barricades, sand bags and safety personnel.
"I've spoken with the President directly," Inslee said. "He cares about the individuals and businesses impacted as much as I do, and has pledged to make the federal government a strong partner to help those in Oso, Darrington, Arlington and the surrounding communities heal from this tragic event. I truly appreciate the President's quick response to this request. This disaster declaration provides much needed assistance to those deeply hurt by the slide."
Inslee made the request on Monday, March 31. The declaration brings a full complement of disaster assistance programs to the people and businesses of Snohomish County. The resulting Federal Emergency Management Agency grants will defray 75 percent of the eligible damages and costs.
