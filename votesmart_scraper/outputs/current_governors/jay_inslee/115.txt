Gov. Jay Inslee issued a statement today in response to the U.S. Department of Labor's federal standards for overtime.
"I thank the Obama Administration and the U.S. Department of Labor for their work and leadership in modernizing federal standards for overtime pay. Today's announcement is an important step in ensuring that hard-working Americans are able to provide for themselves and their families.
"While the national economy and job creation continue to grow at a healthy pace, and Washington state's economy is one of the fastest-growing in the country, too many workers have not yet felt that recovery in their own lives. Many people are working harder, they're working longer hours, and they're getting paid less in real dollars.
"That is why today's announcement is good news for the nation and for the state of Washington. This updated federal standard will provide access to overtime pay for a larger number of hard-working Washingtonians.
"My administration is committed to implementing this change for state employees, and I will be asking state agencies to explore ways to align state policy with this modernized federal standard.
"I commend President Obama, Vice President Biden, and Labor Secretary Thomas Perez for their committed support for American workers and inclusive economic growth."
