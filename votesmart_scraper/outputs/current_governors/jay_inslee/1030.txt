ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, we have a very commonsense amendment that would simply say that we will not be using funds in FERC to allow FERC to rule in favor of Enron against civil utilities and several companies around the country who signed contracts with Enron.
We know what happened in Enron. They were unable to provide electricity. As a result, there was a termination of contract.
We want to make sure that FERC would not issue a ruling while discussions are going on with the parties that would require these utilities and companies to pay Enron. So it is quite a simple amendment.
