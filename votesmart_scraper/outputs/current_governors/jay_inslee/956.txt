DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007)

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment to defund the National Security Personnel System, NSPS.
The Comptroller General of the United States, David Walker, and the staff at the Government Accounting Office, GAO has analyzed the development of NSPS. In published reports and testimony before Congress, Mr. Walker has criticized the manner in which the Department of Defense, DOD, has failed to effectively manage the design and implementation of NSPS.
On July 16, 2007 GAO released a report supporting Defense unions' contention that DOD has been underestimating the cost of implementing NSPS. According to the report, GAO found that DOD's November 2005 estimate that it will cost $158 million to implement NSPS ``does not include the full cost that the department expects to incur as a result of implementing the new system.''
