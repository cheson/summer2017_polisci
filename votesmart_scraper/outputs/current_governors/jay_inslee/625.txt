Today, Congressmen Jerrold Nadler, George Miller, Elijah Cummings, and Brad Miller, along with 29 other House colleagues, urged Attorney General Eric Holder and Iowa State Attorney General Tom Miller to do more to protect victims of improper foreclosures. The Members urged the attorneys general to consider concerns raised by a broad coalition of consumer, labor, civil rights, and other organizations about the ongoing settlement talks between state attorneys general and mortgage servicers involved in improper and unlawful activities connected to the foreclosure crisis.
"In the communities we represent, and in others across the country, the flagrant disregard for the law and predatory practices by lenders and servicers, have imposed substantial hardships on both homeowners and their neighbors," wrote the Members of Congress. "We hope that, as these talks proceed, you will work to protect the rights of those harmed by these practices, provide meaningful immediate relief to homeowners, hold lenders and servicers accountable for any unlawful practices that they engaged in, and ensure that, in the future, the practices that brought about this crisis will not reoccur."

Dear Mr. Attorney General:
We are writing to you concerning the ongoing settlement talks between state Attorneys General and mortgage servicers in cases involving improper and unlawful activities by those servicers.
In the communities we represent, and in others across the country, the flagrant disregard for the law and predatory practices by lenders and servicers, have imposed substantial hardships on both homeowners and their neighbors. We hope that, as these talks proceed, you will work to protect the rights of those harmed by these practices, provide meaningful immediate relief to homeowners, hold lenders and servicers accountable for any unlawful practices that they engaged in, and ensure that, in the future, the practices that brought about this crisis will not reoccur.
We have received the enclosed letter from a broad coalition of consumer, civil rights, and labor organizations setting out a series of concerns about a possible settlement.
We ask that you review this letter and let us know what you are doing to address the concerns raised in the letter.
Sincerely,
