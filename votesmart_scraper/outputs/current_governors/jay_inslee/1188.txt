BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Representative JAY INSLEE (Democrat, Washington): If the will of the policy-makers at that time had been to continue to focus on stopping al-Qaeda from killing Americans rather than to shift resources into the war on Iraq, would those resources have been available to chase al-Qaeda assets, the group that struck us on September 11th?
Mr. ZARATE: Congressman, this administration, the Treasury Department and I know the State Department has never lost its focus on the battle against al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups.
