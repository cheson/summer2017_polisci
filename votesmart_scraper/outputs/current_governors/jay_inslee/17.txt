Gov. Jay Inslee called legislators into a second special session to finish their job of passing a budget that fully funds education.
"Legislators need to start making the hard decisions necessary to amply fund our schools, and do so in a way that protects the safety net for vulnerable children and families," Inslee said.
The governor spoke with reporters to discuss the special session and the progress legislators have made working towards a compromise budget.
