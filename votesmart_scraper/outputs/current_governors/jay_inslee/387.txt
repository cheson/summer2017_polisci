"I was disappointed that the Federal Communications Commission chose to vote today, disregarding requests from businesses, activists and government officials to delay the vote so discussion could continue about the need for a free and open Internet. I have asked my staff to review the details of the notice of proposed rulemaking and its potential impacts to Washington. In the coming months, I will work with business, technology and community leaders as we prepare a response to the chairman's proposal. We will show why open access to the Internet is so critical to our economic development and the free marketplace of ideas."
