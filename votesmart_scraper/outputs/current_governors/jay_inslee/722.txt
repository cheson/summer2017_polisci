Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we now are at a critical juncture to determine whether or not we will respond to a terrible problem in the oceans, and that is not just the oil spill in the gulf; it is the acidification of the oceans now caused by carbon dioxide that comes from the oil and gas industry and some other fossil fuel industries.
I would suggest Members may want to take a look at a new report. It was in Science magazine, published 2 days ago by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is their conclusion: ``The world's oceans are virtually choking on rising greenhouse gases, destroying marine ecosystems and breaking down the food chain, irreversible changes that have not occurred for several million years.''
We have a chance to restrict and restrain this pollutant, carbon dioxide, in a bill now pending in the U.S. Senate. We hope that in conversations with the President next week we come out with a firm, clear cap on carbon dioxide so we can stop what will otherwise be irreversible changes in our oceans.
