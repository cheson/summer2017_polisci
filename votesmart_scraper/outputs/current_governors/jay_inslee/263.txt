"The governor is very concerned about the apparent federal investigation involving the state auditor. We hope that the auditor will work with authorities and to the greatest extent possible -- and as soon as possible -- be open with the public. The voters, local governments, lawmakers and our administration need to have complete confidence in Mr. Kelley's ability to carry out the very important duties of state auditor. The auditor should recuse himself from any official action involving this investigation. Washingtonians need to be assured that the auditor's office will be able to continue its work without distraction or disruption by this investigation."
