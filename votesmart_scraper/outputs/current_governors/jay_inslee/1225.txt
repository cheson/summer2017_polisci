Issue Position: Internet Freedom
Issue Position

Location: Unknown

The Internet, arguably the fastest world-changing invention since the Gutenberg printing press, has become the core of our social and business lives. Net neutrality, the guiding principle under which the Internet has operated since its inception and allows all data to be treated equally, may be lost.
Freedom of expression, innovation and choice drive our economy. Because of the Internets open platform, entrepreneurs have started small businesses, innovators have created online services, and webcasters have produced a diversity of news-information sources. We must make sure that winners and losers are decided by the marketplace, and not your Internet service provider.
To protect Internet freedom I have:
* Co-sponsored the Internet Freedom and Preservation Act
* Supported the Federal Communications Commission's efforts to find a way forward to protect and preserve Internet freedom through "reclassification" of broadband services
* Worked to raise awareness on issues of technology and media consolidation
