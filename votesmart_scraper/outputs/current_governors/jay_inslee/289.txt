Press Release
By: Jay Inslee Charlie Baker Maggie Hassan
Date: Jan. 29, 2015
Location: Boston, MA

Governors Jay Inslee (D-WA), Charlie Baker (R-MA) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) announced what's at stake for their respective states over the outcome of the 2015 Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots.
Win or lose, Baker agreed to donate Boston cream pie cupcakes from the Koffee Kup Bakery in Springfield, Massachusetts, to a Washington state food pantry. Hassan and the North Country Smokehouse in Claremont, New Hampshire, will donate New Hampshire bacon, win or lose. Inslee and Seattle-based Ivar's Chowder will donate 1,000 cups of clam chowder to food pantries in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire. To make the game especially "soup-er," Ivar's will donate the chowder, win or lose.
"If there's one thing we know it's that the Hawks will fight to the end for this win," Governor Inslee said. "Washington's 8 million 12s will be with them in full force to cheer our team to victory and are looking forward to celebrating another Super Bowl win."
"New England may have been hit by a historic blizzard this week, but nothing can ice our team who has another Super Bowl Championship to win this Sunday," said Governor Baker. "Our Boston cream pie cupcakes were a lucky wager against the Ravens and Colts, and I hope they will lead us to victory again on Sunday."
"The New England Patriots and Granite State agriculture are cherished New Hampshire traditions, and I can't wait to join all of New England on Sunday in cheering the Patriots on to another Super Bowl victory," Governor Hassan said. "I cannot think of a better way to demonstrate New Hampshire's Patriots pride than by donating to a Washington food pantry for those in need."
