WE NEED A BOLD ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I appreciate some of my Republican colleagues' discussion of some alternative energy, but it hasn't been an ``all of the above'' voting history for them; it has been a ``none of the above'' voting history when it comes to the vast sources of energy.
We know America is a bold country, not a timid country. But an energy policy that revolves around exclusively offshore drilling is a timid policy. The large swaths of energy we need are not off the coast, they are in the sunshine falling on our land, the wind blowing in the Midwest, the geothermal below our feet, the wave and tidal power; these are the vast swaths of energy.
Yesterday, right around this building, I drove a plug-in electric hybrid car. That is the future, using electricity driven by the sun. And I wish my Republican colleagues would just take a look at the USA Today newspaper yesterday that talked about the enormous strides being made in solar energy. We need a bold policy that can truly get us out of this pickle. That's one based on energy sources, not the timidity of the Republican Party.
