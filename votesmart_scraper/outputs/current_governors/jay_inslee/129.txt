Statement
By: Jay Inslee

Location: Olympia, WA

Gov. Jay Inslee today signed SB 6328 that strengthens protections for minors against the sale and use of e-cigarettes and vapor products. Inslee was joined by health advocates, legislators and supporters at the Foundation for Healthy Generations' Science of HOPE conference.
"Through our Healthiest Next Generation initiative, we are working to ensure our kids' healthy future. The bill I signed today is a part of that effort. These new rules will help keep e-cigarettes and vaping products out of the hands, mouths and lungs of children and youth," Inslee said. "Once again, Washington leads the way in innovative approaches, especially with regard to internet and distributor sales and the focus on youth substance use prevention."
SB 6328 will bring statewide regulation and enforcement to a nearly unregulated industry, and includes several provisions of legislation originally proposed by Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson.
