Gov. Jay Inslee on Friday will depart for an historic international conference aimed at strengthening global commitments to combat climate change and reduce carbon pollution.
"Much of the momentum we're seeing around climate action has started in our cities, states and provinces where leaders are finding innovative and creative solutions to reducing carbon pollution," Inslee said. "Washington is one of those states on the leading edge of the transition away from fossil fuels and towards a clean energy economy. This is a tremendous opportunity to find new ways of partnering with other subnationals, and help promote the efforts of President Obama to bolster our country's role in the fight against climate change and ensure other countries are also doing their part."
