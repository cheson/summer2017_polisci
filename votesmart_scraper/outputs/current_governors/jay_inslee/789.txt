People Like Health Care Reform
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, at my townhall meetings, I was amazed at how much consensus there was about health care reform. People liked health care reform.
What they didn't like were things that are not actually in the bill. Because of the massive disinformation campaign on this bill, people didn't like things that weren't there.
There were more hallucinations about this from opponents of this bill than there were when Timothy Leary was doing business in Haight-Ashbury in the late 1960s. Take this hallucination that this bill is going to insure illegal immigrants. You look at page 132, it says, ``For purposes of this division, the term `affordable credit individual' means, subject to subsection (b), an individual who is lawfully present in a State in the United States.''
Look at page 143, ``Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States.''
Now, the President was challenged during his joint address to the U.S. Congress. I will tell you what, if there was a deception, it wasn't by the President of the United States.
And it is time for us to call out those people who spread hallucinations, phantoms, boogeymen. People want health care and this reform. We are going to pass it.
