"I could not be more proud and excited to see the U.S. Supreme Court take a long overdue stand for equality, fairness and family. Marriage is for two people in love and it is past time for our country to not just recognize that, but honor it. Washington state is a leader in marriage equality and today's ruling means the benefits and recognition of marriage offered to couples here in our state will be offered equally across our nation."
