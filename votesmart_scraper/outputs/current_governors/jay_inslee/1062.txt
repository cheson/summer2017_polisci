REVERSE MORTGAGES TO HELP AMERICA'S SENIORS ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 14, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I very much compliment the prime sponsor (Mr. Matheson) for this bill. This bill really does unlock a secret to very significant cash available to our seniors. This limit that we now have that is going to be removed by this bill really has no particular reason for its existence, and what we are finding is that there is a tremendous demand for these reverse mortgages because it could unlock something like $64 billion of equity that seniors have. Seniors are equity-rich but cash-poor in a lot of circumstances.
We are also finding that seniors are using these reverse mortgages in new ways, to help their grandchildren with their college education, for their recreation, as well as the obvious reasons, for health care and assisted-living facilities and the like. So this has tremendous opportunity.
I hope this is a first step in a continued program to make these mortgages more available. I am working on a bill I hope at some point will pass that will also go to a unified limitation in the dollar amount, the cap that now exists and limits the amount of equity that our seniors can get out of their homes.
Right now, some people can get access to $300,000 plus, but some are limited to under $170,000. So we hope this is a first step in a continued effort to making these reverse mortgages more available. I think seniors will be universally happy with this.
Again, I commend the prime sponsor of this, Mr. Matheson, for his leadership.
