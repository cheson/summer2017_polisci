Gov. Jay Inslee today released the following statement applauding Puget Sound Energy's announced settlement with the Sierra Club regarding closure of the two oldest units at Colstrip Generating Station in Montana.
"I applaud the settlement announced today between Puget Sound Energy and the Sierra Club regarding the future of the older coal-fired units at the Colstrip power plant in Montana. The settlement reflects the market realities in the power sector and will allow PSE to responsibly manage their risks, protect their ratepayers, and reduce pollution. I am grateful to Kimberly Harris, PSE's president and CEO, for her leadership on this. This agreement is consistent with the legislation I signed earlier this year and puts us on a path that is good for Washington ratepayers and good for clean air."
