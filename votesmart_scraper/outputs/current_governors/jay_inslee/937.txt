REP. JAY INSLEE (D-WA): Thank you. I'd like to address -- we had some previous discussion about white spaces, and I just want to -- I just was reading an article today I thought was kind of interesting in one of the Hill documents here pointing out there's been some discussion about interference. And it was pointing out that Dell, HP and Philips are major retailers of high-definition sets, which would meaning if there was going to be an interference from white spaces that they'd be undercutting their own business model, if you will. And I thought it was an interesting comment because I think it indicates at least three major players whose business model would be damaged if there was interference want to see movement forward to continue testing and continue to develop our white spaces solution, and I hope that will be the direction that we move.
There's also been a suggestion that that become auctioned and that we allow folks to camp on spectrum, and I don't think that that's the most useful use of this spectrum. I hope that we're moving forward with continued testing in this regard to maximize use of this. I keep talking to folks who are ready at the gate to start access to these new technologies. I hope we're moving in that direction. Look forward to discussion of that today. Thank you.
