A new $5 million federal grant awarded to Washington today will expand technology job opportunities for women, minorities, veterans and others in the state. The U.S. Department of Labor announced today that Washington state will receive the grant as part of the federal American Apprenticeship Initiative.
The state Department of Labor & Industries will administer the grant that's expected to provide training and jobs for up to 1,000 people, 600 of them in the technology industry.
More than half of the funds -- $3.5 million -- will go to the Washington Technology Industry Association (WTIA) to create an apprenticeship program in the information technology industry. The initiative will be carried out through an innovative partnership between the state, WTIA, and technology companies including Microsoft, F5 and AT&T.
"Technology companies in Washington are struggling to fill their growing number of vacant, skilled positions," said Gov. Jay Inslee. "Our state is known internationally as a technological leader. This grant puts us in a position to continue to lead the way while providing high-paying jobs for people who live in our communities. I am increasingly concerned with the lack of opportunity and security for our working families and can't think of a better time to create opportunities for living wage jobs in our state."
