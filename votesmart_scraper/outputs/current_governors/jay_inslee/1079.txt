COMMENTS BY A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS -- (Extensions of Remarks - July 29, 2005)
SPEECH OF
HON. JAY INSLEE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
THURSDAY, JULY 28, 2005
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, too often, violence claims innocent lives in our world. We have seen suffering on our own soil, and all over the world in places like Indonesia, Israel, Palestine, Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, and recently, England. Amid this instability, for a Representative in the United States Congress to even hypothetically suggest that the United States would destroy Mecca, a holy site of one of the world's major religions, serves only to exacerbate the impression that U.S. actions in the Muslim world are part of a religious struggle--certainly a step backwards in national security. Sadly, such statements also perpetuate the unfortunate misunderstanding that an entire religion is responsible for the actions of a minority of religious extremists. These reckless comments do not reflect American values, and irresponsibly put American security at risk.
