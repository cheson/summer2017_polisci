Gov. Jay Inslee today signed an executive order to help promote hiring of people with disabilities within state government and the private sector. Currently, only 36 percent of working-age people in Washington with disabilities are employed.
"Every person deserves the chance to live a full and dignified life, and that includes having the opportunity to work," Inslee said. "Earlier this morning, I signed an Executive Order aimed at increasing opportunities within state government for those who have disabilities. Our state has a vested interest in working to reduce discrimination in hiring and promoting a diverse workforce that is reflective of the diversity of our population."
Executive Order 13-02 includes several directives including a Disability Employment Challenge that establishes a goal of five percent of Washington state government's workforce being comprised of persons living with a disability. A Disability Employment Task Force is established to help state agencies with the recruitment and retention of persons with disabilities.
The Governor signed the executive order at the start of a one-day institute hosted by the National Governors Association focusing on employment issues for those with disabilities. He was joined by a dozen supporters including Rep. Cyrus Habib who has agreed to help the Governor in working with the state agencies and private-sector businesses to establish and share best practices.
Inslee's executive order goes into effect immediately.
