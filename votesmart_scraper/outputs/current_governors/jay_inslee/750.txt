Forming A More Perfect Union
Floor Speech
By: Jay Inslee
Date: March 21, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union''--that is what got America started. And when we form a more perfect union, it is always a continuous and controversial process. Social Security, Medicare, civil rights, at those times it was always controversial.
But Americans are going to grow confident in this for two reasons. Number 1, we know that all Americans should have a choice in health care. It shouldn't be the government's choice. It shouldn't be the insurance company's choice. It should be individual Americans' choice, and that is what they will get today.
Number 2, we know that a nation is truly healthy only when all of its citizens have health care.
Today, we will have choice. Today, we will have health care. Today, we are forming a more perfect union in the tradition of this great country.
