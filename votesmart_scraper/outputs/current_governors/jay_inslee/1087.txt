COLLAPSE OF A COVER-UP -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2005)
(Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, in the last 48 hours we have witnessed the sad collapse of a cover-up. On September 29, 2003, Press Secretary Scott McClellan said that he had spoken with the deputy chief of staff of the White House and it was simply not true that he had anything to do with the disclosure of the identity of a CIA agent. He characterized it as ``totally ridiculous.'' And again on October 10, 2003, he said the White House had nothing to do with this terrible disclosure.
The President was then asked on June 10, 2004, whether he would stand by the promise to the American people to fire someone responsible for this disclosure, and he answered with a simple ``yes.''
The American people do not want sensitivity training after this sad disclosure of a CIA agent. They need full accountability. The jig is up. The deputy chief of staff needs to come in front of Congress and answer questions about this. And this is not just a matter of a simple violation of Federal law. It is a sad violation of democracy to try to punish a truth-teller, Joe Wilson, who blew the whistle on the ``yellow cake'' false statement made by the President. We know that that is wrong because Mr. McClellan said this is not the way the White House operates. We beg to differ.
