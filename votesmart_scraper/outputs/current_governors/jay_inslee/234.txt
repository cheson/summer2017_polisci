"Today's announcement from Senate leaders about an agreement on student testing is great news and allows the Legislature to move forward on wrapping up its work for this year.
"The testing fix means nearly 2,000 high school students will graduate this year and no longer have to fear that their college plans are in jeopardy. Those students and their families can thank Senate Democrats for insisting this was taken care of. The agreement includes a two-year suspension of the state's end-of-course biology requirement, bringing short-term clarity to an issue that will need further work in the future.
"The Senate is now poised to act on the remaining pieces of the budget. I appreciate the work of Senate Republican leaders in agreeing to a compromise that clears the path for final legislative action."
