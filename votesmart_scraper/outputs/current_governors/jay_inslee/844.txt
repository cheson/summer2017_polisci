PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7060, RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the importance of this bill, the American job creation bill, and how this bill relates to another bill we are working on. By doing that, I just want to share something I saw in Colorado about 3 weeks ago.
I was in Golden, Colorado, at the National Renewable Energy Lab. At that National Renewable Energy Lab I saw a functioning system of powering our cars with solar energy.
It was a photovoltaic cell about 400 square feet mounted on a little pod that basically would run two cars, two electric plug-in cars for a day, just by charging them for about 6 to 8 hours. So you plug them in, they run 40 miles on all electricity, and then they could go another 250 miles on gasoline. Basically what it showed was a vision for this country using home-grown solar power and home-grown electric cars.
This bill is absolutely imperative to make sure that we get that solar energy located in the United States. So these industries like Ausra Solar Thermal Power, like Nanosolar in Palo Alto with photovoltaic power, so we keep building those businesses right here in the United States. And the renewable tax credits are imperative in this bill.
But I want to point out how this dovetails with another bill that is under consideration today in the House, and that is a bill we will have to try to stimulate job creation.
