POLAR BEAR PROTECTION -- (Extensions of Remarks - April 09, 2008)
SPEECH OF
HON. JAY INSLEE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 9, 2008
* Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I rise to show my dismay that it has been 3 months since the Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service, FWS, missed an important deadline to determine whether they would give the polar bear protections under the Endangered Species Act.
* Naysayers argue that the polar bear population is not at risk, but the studies show that an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears worldwide are threatened with ``losing their habitat over the next 50 years'' because of global warming and melting sea ice.
* The U.S. Geological Survey, USGS, predicts that without action, ``11 of the 19 subpopulations will be extinct by the middle of this century, with an additional three subpopulations vanishing shortly thereafter.''
* That same USGS study showed that Arctic melting is occurring faster than any scientific models have previously predicted.
* Incredibly, at the same time we are seeing these sobering scientific reports, the Department of Interior has moved forward with leasing oil and gas exploration rights for almost 30 million acres of the Polar Bear Seas. Just off the northwest coast of Alaska, this environmentally sensitive area is home to about 16,000 polar bears.
* This is not the time for drilling in prime polar bear habitat. It is the time for protecting polar bears and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act. FWS should act today to list the polar bear as a threatened, or even an endangered, species.
