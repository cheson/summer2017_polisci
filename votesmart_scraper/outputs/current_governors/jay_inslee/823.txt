Inslee Clean Energy Service Corps Is Signed Into Law
Just in time for Earth Day, the Inslee Clean Energy Service Corps was signed into law today by President Barack Obama as part of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. The Clean Energy Service Corps will give training and skills in the clean energy industry to disadvantaged young Americans while improving the efficiency of low-income housing and other public facilities. U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) previously introduced the program in a stand-alone bill, H.R. 1394, the Clean Energy Service Corps Act, which was co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.).
The Clean Energy Service Corps will be an incredible learning experience for thousands of young people in disadvantaged communities throughout the country, said Inslee, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. As a key component of the New Apollo Energy Project, the Clean Energy Service Corps will build our nation's green-collar workforce and help to improve our national lands and infrastructure and make thousands of homes and businesses energy efficient.

Our dependence on finite fossil fuels and their impact on our environment will be one of the foremost challenges we face in the 21st Century, said Sarbanes. By adopting an aggressive strategy to conserve and develop alternative sources of energy, we can meet economic, national security, and environmental policy objectives in one fell swoop. Let's harness the unlimited energy of idealistic and service-oriented Americans to put our nation on a stronger and more sustainable path.
Advocates for green-collar jobs and climate action are excited about the passage of the Clean Energy Service Corps.
