"I mourn with all Washingtonians tonight for the Seattle Pacific University student who died in today's tragic shooting. There are others still struggling with injuries and we need to keep them, their families and all SPU students in our hearts and prayers.

"There is much we don't yet know about today's shooting. But tonight it is clear that amidst the heartbreak, SPU has shown that it is a community that lives by its mission to serve others. There were students who put themselves in real danger to protect classmates from further violence and to aid and comfort the victims. Those selfless and brave acts should remind us of the indomitable spirit of young people.

"To see gun violence erupt at a place of higher education shocks all of us. Our schools should be safe havens. And so should our homes, our streets and our workplaces. We need to do more to prevent violence throughout our state."
