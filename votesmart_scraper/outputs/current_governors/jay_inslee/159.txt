"Today's ruling is not unexpected and ensures the Legislature can continue focusing on the necessary priorities of this year's short session relating to McCleary, the state's teacher shortage and funding for mental health and wildfires. I appreciate the Court's expeditious review of the case so legislators aren't distracted by the uncertainty of the initiative's impact."
