Gov. Jay Inslee's Statement on Today's House Passage of Bills to Increase the State Minimum Wage, Enact Paid Sick and Safe Leave

"Today the House passed two modest, measured and much-needed bills to give an economic lift to thousands of Washington's lowest-wage workers. I've always believed that a person who is willing and able to work hard for 40 hours a week should be able to provide the most basic needs for themselves and their families. Washington's economy is recovering, but it is leaving behind an increasing number of low- and middle-income workers. An increase in the state minimum wage and paid sick and safe leave for all workers are good steps toward restoring a degree of economic security for those who need it most.
"I hope the Senate will act on these bills and follow the House's leadership in building an economy that works for all Washingtonians."
