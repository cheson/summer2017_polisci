ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS PACKAGING
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, it has come to my attention that a number of companies in the outdoor industry have begun taking steps to reduce the amount of packaging that accompany their products. I commend the companies for their efforts to reduce waste and minimize their environmental footprint.
These businesses have taken meaningful steps toward the preservation of our planet, and they set a vital example for businesses throughout America. Over the past year, a coalition of outdoor industry companies worked together to create policies for the reduction of consumer waste. I was pleased to learn that they have successfully followed through with these policies, utilizing higher levels of recycled material and reducing the amount of packaging used in production.
As these companies demonstrate, a reduction in waste can be accomplished through a variety of innovative practices. In order to cut down on the use of new materials, one footwear company redesigned their shoeboxes to use 100 percent post-recycled content. A family-owned business that sells camping equipment began packaging mattresses in completely degradable plastic bags. Another travel accessories company completely overhauled their packaging program, eliminating about 15 tons of packaging waste.
These companies are a beacon of environmental awareness and responsible stewardship. They provide an example to all American businesses involved in manufacturing, which must begin to see the reduction of consumer waste as an essential step in protecting our environment. As members of Congress, it is our responsibility to encourage every industry to begin making such environmentally conscious choices as these.
