Gov. Jay Inslee late yesterday learned the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied his request for the Individual Assistance Program to help families impacted by the summer wildfire season. Had the program been approved, impacted communities would have had access to assistance with the repairs of homes and aid for things like rental assistance and replacement of household items. The fires destroyed 146 homes and damaged another 476. Nearly two-thirds were uninsured or underinsured.
"This is very disappointing news. This is the second time in as many years that we've been denied Individual Assistance following a major fire," Inslee said. "We have homeowners that have lost everything. Despite the decision, I'm committed to helping our fellow Washingtonians and ensuring they get as much help and assistance as possible. It's my priority to get these communities on the road to recovery."
"Last year I led the 19-state bipartisan Western Governors Association in calling for a reevaluation of these criteria. As our state works to support affected communities, I will continue to fight for greater federal support for disaster recovery, particularly as our state encounters hotter, drier and increasingly devastating fire seasons."
