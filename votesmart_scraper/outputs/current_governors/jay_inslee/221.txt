Gov. Jay Inslee announced today that President Obama's Administration approved his request for a federal Emergency Declaration in response to the multiple wildfires burning across Eastern Washington.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency declaration means additional resources are on their way from the federal government to supplement state and local response efforts in areas affected by the wildfires, which began on Aug. 13.
"This declaration is welcome news for the communities on the front lines battling the wildfires," Inslee said. "With the high danger the firefighters are experiencing it is crucial we maintain our communications and power equipment and I appreciate the quick review of our request from our federal partners."
The emergency declaration will provide the state with assistance in several areas:
Assistance and resources to ensure that transmitters and other equipment that provide the backbone for local emergency communications remain operational;
Emergency power generation resources for critical local government facilities involved in response efforts;
An Erosion Threat Assessment Reduction Team to provide scientific assessment of burned areas to address immediate threats to public health and safety and provide necessary information to prevent further damage in burned areas.
Expense reimbursements were not approved at this time.
Inslee requested assistance from the federal government on Aug. 19 with 11 counties and several tribes affected or threatened by fires. The state is now battling 16 large fires consuming nearly 400,000 acres across Eastern Washington. More than 100 homes have been destroyed with more than 5,000 homes still threatened.
