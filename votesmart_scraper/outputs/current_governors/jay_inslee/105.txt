Gov. Jay Inslee today released a statement on the Air Force announcement that Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane is one of five finalists under consideration to host Boeing KC-46A aircraft.
"It is great news that Fairchild Air Force Base has been selected as a finalist. This is an acknowledgement of Fairchild's continued future mission capacity and the result of hard work from our Congressional delegation, military, business and community leaders across the Spokane community and the state of Washington.
"My administration has regularly engaged with the U.S. Department of Defense and the Air Force over the past three years to ensure they are aware of the efforts we are putting forth to address potential concerns, and we will continue to work on issues around compatible land use and promote Fairchild as the best place for this next site selection."
