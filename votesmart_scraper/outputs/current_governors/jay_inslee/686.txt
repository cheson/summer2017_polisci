On December 2nd in Seattle, a conference entitled "MexicoNow" will be held by a number of international corporations and Mexican businesses to encourage aerospace companies to move their operations to Mexico. Rep. Jay Inslee (WA-01), released the following statement regarding the upcoming conference:
"First I would like to welcome these international firms and consultants to Seattle. I think you will find your visit to the Emerald City an enjoyable one, so much so you will decide to stay.
Aerospace businesses already know that Washington State is the best place to operate their business. I should know because I have been working hand in hand with the aerospace industry for many years. Just this year I authored an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill, which passed the House 410-8, which would ensure a fair playing field for Washington aerospace in the competition to build the next generation air refueling tanker for the United States Air Force. Washington State has so much to offer the aerospace industry, including:
* A well educated, well trained and extremely experienced workforce that is the envy of the world. The biggest cost driver in the aerospace industry is failing to get the job done right the first time. Our workers ensure this doesn't happen saving companies billions in cost overruns, accidents, and lack manufacturing. Everett Washington is now home to one of the most advanced aerospace manufacturing training facilities in the world, Washington Aerospace Training and Research Center.
* A culture of innovation that has spawned the world most successful technology firms and is leading the way in the next generation of innovation including bio-tech and clean energy. This innovation spills into other industries giving Washington based firms a clear competitive advantage. In fact the Kauffman Foundation, an entrepreneurial advocacy group, and the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a technology think tank, just released their findings that Washington State is 2nd best prepared state in the nation to compete in a global, innovation-based economy.
* An aerospace friendly system of tax incentives which currently 222 of the 550 aerospace companies in Washington State take advantage of.
* Established facilities and research institutions. Washington State has been in the aerospace industry for more than half a century. We have the infrastructure and facilities to accommodate the smallest to largest firms. In addition, Washington State businesses have access to some of the best educational and research institutions in the world located at Washington State University, University of Washington, and the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Lab.
* Safe, dependable and cheap electricity. Washington State's electric grid is well established and delivering high volumes of electricity to businesses for a century. Our power comes from a variety of sources and Washington State utilities are leading the world towards the implementation of clean energy including wind, solar, and tidal.
* A vibrant cultural base that provides business owners, entrepreneurs, executives and employees a safe and exciting place to live. From downtown Seattle, home of four professional sports franchises, to the ski slopes of the Cascades and the water of the Puget Sound, to world class wineries and a music scene that has inspired generations, Washington State provides every activity and cultural amenities a business could desire."
