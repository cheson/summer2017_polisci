"I am disappointed to hear Boeing's plans to move research and technology jobs out of Washington state and establish research centers around the country. For nearly a century, Washington has been the place where new discoveries in aerospace have been made and I am certain that will continue. Today's news continues Boeing's strategy of diversifying its workforce. This demonstrates why we are working so hard to ensure the 777X and its carbon fiber wing are designed and built in our state. We will continue to do all that we can to convince the company that Washington continues to be the best place in the world to not only build commercial airplanes, but design them and dream up new ideas that will make human flight--in all its forms--safer, faster, and more efficient."
