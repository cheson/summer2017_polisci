Gov. John Kasich will propose new approaches for Ohio's welfare programs in the budget he unveils Monday, targeting teens and young adults as part of an effort to intervene at an early age to stop poverty.
The changes would require individual counties, which administer the assistance programs across the state, to designate a lead entity that will be responsible for coordinating help -- assistance programs and job training efforts -- and matching them to clients.
Individual clients would be able to one-stop shop with a caseworker who could connect them with assistance programs and job training needed to get them work.
The initial efforts would target people aged 16 to 24 with the idea of intervening before they get stuck in a cycle of poverty. Those clients would also have to take some personal responsibility, participating in job training and be willing to help themselves.
The goal is to expand the approach to all Ohioans on public assistance by July 1, 2016.
Kasich has hinted that he intended to revamp the state's welfare approach. In a speech to the Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies on Thursday, he addressed tax changes he hopes will lead to more jobs, and he outlined his goals for public assistance.
"In our social service delivery system, there is no coordination," Kasich said. "Here I get my food stamps. Here I get my child care. Here I get this. Here I get that. And I spend most of my time standing in line and not being treated.
