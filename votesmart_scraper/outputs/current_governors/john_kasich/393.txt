The Ohio House of Representatives has passed House Bill 1 (Duffey). Gov. John Kasich's JobsOhio program will now move to the Ohio Senate for debate.
"Passage of H.B. 1 is a huge step in the right direction for our state, and I appreciate the careful attention that Speaker Batchelder and the members of the House have given to this legislation throughout this crucial process. The sooner we can breathe new life into Ohio's development efforts and better focus on job-creation initiatives, the sooner we can begin reviving Ohio's economy and creating jobs. The bill now goes to the Senate where I know that equal support for it exists, and I look forward to quick passage of the bill there as well," said Kasich.
