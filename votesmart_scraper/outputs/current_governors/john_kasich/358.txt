Rob Nichols, press secretary for Gov. John R. Kasich, issued the following statement regarding the Ohio Senate Republicans' proposed budget plan released earlier today:
―Congratulations are in order to President Niehaus, Chairman Widener and to Senate Republicans on their budget proposal, and the governor applauds their commitment to filling Ohio's unprecedented $8 billion budget gap without increasing taxes on Ohioans. While we will continue to be engaged with the Senate on various aspects of their proposal, it is evident that we share the same destination--fiscal stability without a tax increase. Senate Republicans have proven to be great partners in this budget process, and together with the House, we're going to pass a budget that will help create jobs and get Ohio back on track.‖
