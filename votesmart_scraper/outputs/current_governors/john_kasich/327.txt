Following the Senate's passage of House Bill 487 (Amstutz), Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement:
"With today's action in the Senate, and previous work in the House to pass House Bill 487, Ohio is taking another important step toward operating a more efficient and responsive state government. Some of the bill's reforms are more targeted while others are clearly more sweeping, but together they have a significant, positive impact in improving how Ohio manages the taxpayers' resources and the initiatives that serve them. I appreciate the efforts of President Niehaus, Speaker Batchelder, Chairman Amstutz, Chairman Widener and all my partners in the Legislature who share a vision of giving taxpayers better value and more effectively delivering government services to those that need them. There are some pieces of HB 487 that I believe require more discussion, and we will continue to work with members of the House and Senate as the bill moves through conference committee, but I'm hopeful we will find common ground soon so we can quickly set in motion these fundamental reforms."
