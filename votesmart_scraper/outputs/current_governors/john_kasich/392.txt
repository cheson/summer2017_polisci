Location: Columbus, OH

Gov. John R. Kasich today issued a resolution commemorating February as Black History Month and asked Ohioans to live up to the ideals of freedom, equality and justice.
"African-Americans have played significant roles in the history of Ohio's economic, cultural, spiritual and political development while working to maintain and promote culture and history," Kasich states in the resolution. "Black History Month is a time for all Ohioans to remember the lessons and teachings of those who helped build our nation."
Black History Month was first recognized 35 years ago by an act of Congress to honor the contributions of African-Americans throughout America's history.
Additionally, Kasich announced the appointment of Lynn Stevens as Director of Minority Affairs. Stevens is responsible for minority outreach and will act as a liaison to Ohio's minority communities.
Stevens most recently served 11 years as the community relations coordinator for Senator George Voinovich. Prior to that, she served as a caseworker for Congressman Steve Chabot (R-OH). She is most proud of her role on the Ohio Bicentennial Commission's African-American Advisory Council, which held a series of events in 2003 and 2004 to highlight the contributions of African-Americans to Ohio's history. She is a graduate of the University of Cincinnati where she received a bachelor's degree in international affairs and a master's degree in political science.
