Press Release

Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich signed House Bill 36 (Kozlowski), legislation that provides immediate relief to school districts by increasing the number of calamity days from three to five. Additionally, HB 36 provides schools the flexibility to make up snow days by lengthening remaining school days in the 2010-2011 school year by 30-minute increments. Joining Kasich for the bill-signing ceremony were bill co-sponsors Rep. Casey Kozlowski and Rep. John Carey, and Senator Tim Grendell.
"It makes all the sense in the world. I have been for this all along. I appreciate the work of young Casey here, John Carey and Tim Grendell in terms of moving this through. This was on the leadership agenda from the beginning and we got it doneWe'll go back to five calamity days, we'll give the schools districts more options, and of course student safety is a prioritybut in addition to that, the great bottom line is more sled riding," said Kasich during today's ceremony.
HB 36 received overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.
