Noise is money -- words from Gov. John Kasich as he spoke to a crowd of more than 300 inside a new hangar at the Wilmington Air Park.
WLWT's Karin Johnson speaks with Governor John Kasich on June 26, 2014.
"I think people are more hopeful. Is it coming as quickly as we would like? No, of course it isn't," Kasich said.
But Kasich says the 105-square-foot aircraft maintenance hangar is a sign Wilmington Air Park is starting to rebuild itself.
It's leased by Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, which provides maintenance, repair and overhaul services at the site.
"They have the capability now to service the biggest planes in the world, including the 747, so I think this is really terrific," Kasich said.
And it's creating 259 jobs.
"The beauty of those 259 jobs is that hopefully everyone will be tied to a local resident who has a family who will be able to provide for that family. Those are the types of jobs that we want at this air park, those are aircraft maintenance and repair jobs," Wilmington Mayor Randy Riley said.
Five years ago, an economic storm devastated the area when DHL pulled out of the air park, which left about 8,000 people without jobs.
The city is now up more than 1,000 jobs restored, in addition to the thousand it has retained.
The expansion of the hangar brings more hope.
AMES said in the past it's been limited due to capacity constraints. Now it's hoping to attract larger fleet operations and eventually add even more jobs.
Three years from now, the company hopes employment at the air park will exceed 640 positions.
