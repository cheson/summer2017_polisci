Today Governor John R. Kasich ordered that all flags be flown at half-staff from sunrise until sunset on Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, Sunday, Dec. 7, 2014, in honor of those who gave their lives in service to our nation.
From the governor's Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day resolution: "It is important to remember and honor our servicemen and women and civilians who lost their lives during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, "a date which will live in infamy.' Every American owes a debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid to the brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom."
