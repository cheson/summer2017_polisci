Statement
By: John Kasich
Date: June 8, 2011
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich issued the following statement upon commuting the sentence of Shawn Hawkins to life in prison without the possibility of parole:
"There is no doubt that the defendant played a significant, material role in this heinous crime, but precise details of that role are frustratingly unclear to the point that Ohio shouldn't deliver the ultimate penalty in this case. Therefore, I am ordering that he spend the rest of his life in prison and have no chance of ever getting out. As someone who has experienced sudden and tragic loss, I know the pain that comes with losing loved ones. My prayers go out to the families of Diamond Marteen and Terrance Richard in the hope that they may find peace."
