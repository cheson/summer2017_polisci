Today Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement after the credit rating agency Moody's announced that it has improved Ohio's credit outlook to stable from negative:

Today's announcement marks the first time since February 2007 that all three rating agencies--Moody's, Fitch, and S&P--have given Ohio an AA+ rating with a stable outlook. Over the past year, we've eliminated an $8 billion budget shortfall and implemented policies that foster a jobs-friendly environment and manage taxpayer dollars in a responsible way. It's great to know that these efforts to make Ohio's economy stronger are getting noticed."
