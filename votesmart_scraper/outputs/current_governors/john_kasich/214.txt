Ohio Gov. John Kasich asked how Marion's Tri-Rivers Career Center stacks up to similar programs in the state during his visit Saturday.
"I'm trying to figure out the whole system's doing," he said. "This may be good, and great, but how about in this part of the state, how did they do?"
Kasich and Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor toured Tri-Rivers and the Robotics & Advanced Manufacturing Technology Education Collaborative as part of their "Get Out the Vote" initiative.
There are 49 career centers/joint vocational schools in Ohio. TRCC Superintendent Chuck Speelman and communications director Ellen Messenger said each school has different strengths, though Tri-Rivers' may be the strongest robotics program.
"We're really moving at the speed of business," Messenger said.
The governor said schools like TRCC can help students who do not want to continue education in a traditional setting.
"You really want to convince the education community, and mothers and fathers, that this is really a great place -- this kind of a place is a great place to go," he said.
"We want to make sure every kid in the state of Ohio has this kind of opportunity," Taylor said.
Kasich suggested that students in RAMTEC programs should get high school credit for their work in manufacturing facilities.
"We need to get kids interested in what they're doing," he said.
"What excites me about this facility...it appears that kids are excited as well. Kids are really excited. And when kids get excited about education, what can be better than that?"
Kasich and Taylor encouraged voters to support their local and statewide Republican candidates at a speech after the tour.
