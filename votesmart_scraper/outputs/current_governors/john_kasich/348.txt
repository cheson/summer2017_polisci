Gov. John R. Kasich announced today that the Ohio Department of Development has approved $10 million in tax credits and more than $2 million in grants for workforce training and new equipment intended to help create 1,100 new jobs and retain 1,700 existing jobs at Chrysler's Toledo Assembly Complex. The incentives would support Chrysler's potential $365 million investment at the facility.
"These incentives are part of my Administration's efforts to help create needed new jobs in the Toledo area. Chrysler is a major asset to Toledo and Ohio and we're doing everything we can to make the case that Ohio is the right place for the company to continue to invest and grow. I'm hopeful that we're making progress and that Chrysler and other major manufacturers will see that Ohio is the place to be," said Kasich.
The incentives approved today by the Department of Development for Chrysler's potential investment come on the heels of the company's $72 million investment at its Toledo Machining Plant in Perrysburg Township announced last week. That investment was supported by more than $4.1 million in state incentives, including more than $3.3 million in tax credits and $850,000 in grants for workforce training, machinery and equipment. That investment at Toledo Machining will retain 640 jobs.
Altogether, these collaborative efforts between Ohio and Chrysler would support more than 3,400 new or existing jobs for Ohioans.
