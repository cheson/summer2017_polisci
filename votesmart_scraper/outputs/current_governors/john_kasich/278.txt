BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
DAVID GREGORY: Good morning. The Obamacare fix is on, but will it work? The latest developments: the end of November is the timeline the administration is targeting to have the Obamacare website running smoothly. The latest report is 700,000 applications filed but no one will say how many actually enrolled. Health and Human Services Secretary Sebelius is now expected to testify this week before Congress as some Republicans continue to call for her ouster. And even Democrats are urging change. 10 Senators are calling for open enrollment to be extended beyond the current end day of March 2014.
We wanted to help you understand some of the impacts of the President's health care plan around the country. We'll talk to the CEO of Florida's largest health insurer-- cancelling 300,000 of its policies this week-- in just a minute.
First, I want to turn to Democratic Governor Steven Beshear of Kentucky, and Republican Governor John Kasich of neighboring Ohio. Governors, welcome both. I wanted to talk to you and take this out of Washington because, in Kentucky, you set up your own health care exchange; in Ohio, Governor Kasich, you declined to do so, and so the federal government has come in to do that. So let me start with you. The president said there's no excuse for this terrible rollout of Obamacare through the-- the-- the website. Are you as frustrated with how all of this has started? Governor Kasich?
GOV. JOHN KASICH: David, is that to me?
DAVID GREGORY: Yes.
