Today the Ohio General Assembly gave its final approval to House Bill 1 (Duffey), legislation creating JobsOhio. Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement following passage of the bill:
"House Bill 1 sets the groundwork for a stronger, more prosperous Ohio. I am incredibly appreciative of the work Speaker Batchelder, President Niehaus, Rep. Duffey, Sen. Wagoner and many others have done to pass this crucial legislation in a bipartisan manner. I am heartened by the House and Senate Democrats who had the wisdom and courage to understand that Ohio needs a new approach to job creation and voted to support passage of House Bill 1. Ohio must embrace new, innovative job-creation methods, and with JobsOhio we will be able to pursue economic opportunities otherwise unattainable through our outdated development structure. I look forward to signing House Bill 1 and am excited to work with Director Kvamme to build a new job-creating organization to bring the best business minds together to restore Ohio as a national and world economic leader."
