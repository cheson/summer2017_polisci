Press Release
By: John Kasich
Date: Aug. 2, 2014
Location: Columbus, OH

Gov. John R. Kasich has declared a state emergency for Lucas and Wood counties after city of Toledo officials found evidence of an algae contaminant in the public water system and advised residents not to drink the water.
This declaration allows state government to maximize the use of its resources to support local authorities in addressing this situation. The state Emergency Operation Center (EOC) was activated earlier today.
State and local officials are working together to arrange for drinking water to be shipped into the affected areas. These are the recommendations that have been issued:
 Do not drink the water. Alternative water should be used for drinking, making infant formula, making ice, brushing teeth and preparing food.  Do not boil the water. Boiling the water will not destroy the toxins.
 Do not let pets or livestock drink the water.
 Do not let children bath in the water.
 Hand washing is allowed.
 Showering is allowed for adults.
The contaminant Microcystin is a product of blue-green algae and is naturally found in Ohio lakes, ponds and slow-moving streams. The health effects could result in numbness and dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abnormal liver function, skin irritation or rashes. Contact your veterinarian immediately if pets or livestock show illness.
