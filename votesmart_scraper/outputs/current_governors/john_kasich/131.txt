BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." So after nearly doubling America's national debt, President Obama will soon leave behind a massive fiscal mess for the next occupant of the Oval Office. Earlier today 2016 Republican presidential candidate Ohio Governor John Kasich laid out his plans to balance the federal budget and stop robbing our kids in just eight years, and he joins us in our Washington studio. How are you, governor? Good to see you.
KASICH: Sean, hi.
HANNITY: I want to remind people, you were the house budget committee chair. You balanced the budget. You left us a surplus. True?
KASICH: Paid down debt.
HANNITY: Paid down the debt.
KASICH: Grew jobs.
HANNITY: Grew jobs. All right, as governor you took on a debt of $8 billion, and now you have a surplus --
KASICH: It's $2 billion. And we're up about 347,000 jobs.
