Kasich Signs Charter School Reform Bill
Statement
By: John Kasich
Date: Nov. 1, 2015
Location: Columbus, OH

Ohio now has new tools to dramatically increase oversight and accountability for all charter schools and their sponsors, thanks to House Bill 2 signed today by Governor John R. Kasich.
"While we are proud of Ohio's high-performing charter schools, there are too many that haven't been serving our kids with the quality they deserve," Kasich said. "Making sure that our kids aren't stuck in failing schools has been a priority and this bill will profoundly benefit our children."
"I commend our legislative leaders and members of both parties for their work to ensure that this bill has the teeth needed to hold charter schools accountable," Kasich said.
