Public Statements
Kasich Joins Legislators to Begin JobsOhio Legislative Process
Press Release
By: John Kasich
Date: Jan. 20, 2011
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John Kasich, Rep. Mike Duffey (R-Worthington), and Senate President Tom Niehaus (R- New Richmond) started the process to create JobsOhio, a new, private sector jobs-creation agency to replace Ohio's outdated state-run economic development program and help revive Ohio's economic development efforts.
Appearing at Tarrier Steel in south Columbus, a nearly century-old family-run steel fabrication business where Kasich unveiled the idea for JobsOhio in August, Kasich called on the legislature to quickly enact the measure so it can go to work helping to revive Ohio's economy and to create jobs.
"Jim Rhodes created the Department of Development to organize "Rhodes' Raiders" in a more effective way, and it worked for a number of decades, but we're to the point now where the Department, in many ways, has lost its focus. As a result of having too many things stuffed into that department, it clearly hasn't been as effective or efficient as we would like. What we're doing here is taking that original model and letting loose our entrepreneurs to use their skills to end the siege Ohio is under. Everyday there's another company approaching us to say another state is bidding to get them in. JobsOhio is an organization that is going to move at the speed of business and move at the speed needed in order for Ohio to be a job creator," said Kasich.
Highlights of the legislation include:
* Details of the governance and leadership of JobsOhio, which will be overseen by a 9-member board that includes the governor, who will be the chair. Board members will be appointed by the governor and serve four year terms. A chief investment officer appointed by the board will run the corporation.
