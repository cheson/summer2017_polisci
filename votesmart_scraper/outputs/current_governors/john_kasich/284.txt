Location: Columbus, OH

Today Judge Paul Herbert of the Franklin County Municipal Court held the first court hearing in Ohio to expunge the criminal record of a victim of human trafficking. The expungement was made possible through provisions included in House Bill 262 (Fedor), signed by Governor John R. Kasich in June 2012. After the hearing, Gov. Kasich released the following statement:
"Victims of human trafficking don't deserve to be treated as criminals, but deserve our compassion and support so they can retake control of their lives, put the past behind them and begin getting their lives back on track. Ohio is leading the way and Judge Herbert is leading the way and it's great to see our hard work beginning to change lives like this."
