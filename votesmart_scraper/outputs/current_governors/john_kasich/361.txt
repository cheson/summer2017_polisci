Kasich Applauds House Passage of the Budget
Statement
By: John Kasich
Date: May 5, 2011
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich issued the following statement praising the Ohio House of Representatives for its passage of the state budget for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 (HB 153), which fills Ohio's unprecedented $8 billion budget gap without a tax increase:
―We're doing what folks didn't think anyone could do--fill a massive $8 billion budget gap without raising taxes and while preserving the $800 million income tax cut. We're building a great win for Ohio not just because this returns stability to the state's finances but because it also helps create the jobs-friendly environment we need. Speaker Batchelder, Chairman Amstutz and their team deserve the recognition and thanks of the entire state because they again demonstrated the commitment and courage to take on stubborn problems--as well as the status quo--and I'm proud to be their partner. As the work now shifts to the Senate I look forward to continuing the constructive partnership that President Niehaus and Chairman Widener and I have built. Together, we're going to get this thing done and lift up Ohio.‖
