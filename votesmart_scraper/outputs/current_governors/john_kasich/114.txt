Statement

Location: Columbus, OH

Today Governor John R. Kasich issued the following statement in response to the latest monthly jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor which recognized Ohio as a national leader in job creation for the month of October, with a gain of 36,300 private sector jobs.
"Our efforts to make Ohio more attractive to job creators are paying off, and it's great to be recognized as one of the top states for jobs growth. Most important, the nearly 380,000 private sector jobs Ohioans have added are helping families get stronger, more hopeful and more secure. While our economy is stronger today and more diversified, we still have more work to do to reach our full potential, and we must continue to find new ways to make even more progress."
