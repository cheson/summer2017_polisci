Kasich Signs Teach For America Legislation
Press Release
By: John Kasich
Date: April 27, 2011
Location: Columbus, OH

Delivering on a promise made in his State of the State address, today Gov. John R. Kasich signed House Bill 21 (Combs), legislation that will open Ohio's classrooms to Teach For
America. The bill received strong bipartisan support in the General Assembly. Joining Kasich for the bill signing were House Education Committee Chairman Rep. Gerald Stebelton, Senate bill sponsor Sen. Gary Cates and several Teach For America teachers and alumni.
For years, Teach For America has been recruiting smart and motivated Ohio college graduates to
teach in districts across the country, often the poorest areas. However, these enthusiastic young people were forced to leave our state in order to pursue their ambition. HB 21 will reverse this trend by directing the State Board of Education to issue resident educator licenses to participants in the Teach For America program.
During today's bill signing Kasich said, "I have been aware of Teach For America for a long time.
These are very dedicated people. Some of the best and brightest that we have who want to dedicate their lives to improve the lives of our studentsÂ…Today is a landmark day for Ohio and education, and I'm so thrilled to be a part of it...The message to all those students out there, that when you wake up in the morning and got a sense that you have a purpose to change the lives of young people: We're inviting you into Ohio."
Teach For America is a national organization established in 1990 that recruits and trains top college graduates who commit to spend two years teaching in urban and rural public schools. HB 21 will allow Ohio to be added to the list of 31 states plus the District of Columbia that currently have Teach For America teachers in their classrooms.
