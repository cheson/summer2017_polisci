BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching this special edition of The Factor: Election 2016.
Ohio Governor John Kasich came out swinging in this week's Republican debate saying those on top of the GOP polls don't have what it takes to be president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job. I have watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave our senior citizens out in the cold. I have heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 people here from this country out of this country, splitting families. I have heard about tax schemes that don't add up that put our kids in a deeper hole than they are today. We need somebody who can lead.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: Donald Trump took that as an attack on his own candidacy and responded with some thoughts about his own -- about Governor Kasich.
