Today Governor John R. Kasich issued the following statement in response to the latest monthly jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor that shows Ohio has created 400,700 new private sector jobs since Kasich took office.
"Creating more than 400,000 private sector jobs over the past five years is a tremendous milestone, and I couldn't be happier for the families across this state who are now more secure and more hopeful. What we're doing is working. By lowering taxes, improving workforce training and focusing on diversifying our economy, together we have built a stronger Ohio. We still have more to do to reach our full potential and we will.
