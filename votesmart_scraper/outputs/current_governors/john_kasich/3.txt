Press Release
By: John Kasich
Date: March 31, 2017
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich signed the 2018-2019 Transportation Budget Bill (Sub. H.B. 26) into law, continuing Ohio's progress on improving its highway infrastructure while taking steps to position the state as a leader in the future of transportation: self-driving cars and drones.
"Ohio ranks high among all states for the quality and maintenance of our highway infrastructure and we did it without ever having to raise the gas tax," said Kasich. "We're determined to maintain the competitive edge we have with our highways, while also positioning our state for the industries of tomorrow with self-driving cars and drones."
Over the past seven years, at the same time many states have fallen behind in highway repairs and improvements, Ohio has invested an unprecedented $14 billion on nearly 7,000 projects -- an increase of $3 billion. Ohio's new transportation budget continues that progress by investing in 43 major projects, 446 bridge projects, 615 pavement projects and 356 safety projects over the next two years
The transportation budget also makes investments in the Transportation Research Center in central Ohio to expand capabilities for self-driving research and creates smart highways where new technologies can be safely tested in real-life traffic situations, including sections of Interstate 90 in northeast Ohio, Interstate 270 in Columbus and U.S. 33 near the Transportation Research Center.
Funding will also help Ohio stay on the leading edge of developing drone technology and its ongoing efforts with the Air Force to fly unmanned aircraft beyond the line of visual sight.
