Ohio has the most improved business climate in the nation according to the annual survey of CEOs by Chief Executive Magazine. Ohio moved up 13 places this year to 22 from 35. Ohio continues to steadily improve, rising from 44 in 2010.
In response to the news, Gov. John R. Kasich issued the following statement:
"It's great for Ohio workers when the nation's CEOs see Ohio more and more as one of
the best places in the country to do business. It's incredibly gratifying to see all of our
hard work continue to pay off like that. We're achieving what we set out to do: get Ohio
back on track by creating a jobs-friendly climate. We're not there yet and we've got a lot of work still to do, but we're making real progress and it's great news for Ohio's
families."
