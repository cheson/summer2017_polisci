Gov. John Kasich is preparing a top-to-bottom overhaul of the state's energy policies affecting everything from shale gas to power plants and energy efficiency.
The governor and his top policy mavens gave a preview to about 50 of the region's heaviest energy users, energy producers and companies involved in energy efficiency technologies Tuesday at the Greater Cleveland Partnership in downtown Cleveland.
"It's a pretty comprehensive energy program, which we have never really had before," Kasich said in an interview following the discussion.
The effort will require myriad tweaks to existing state law, and the administration is already working with key lawmakers to prepare a package of legislation that will makes changes in 10 key areas.
"It's comprehensive. It's good. And it starts us to really have an energy policy. It will be introduced in March, the middle of next month," Kasich said, with passage by June 30.
First among the 10-part package of reforms is shale gas.
The administration is preparing new rules that govern everything from well construction to mandatory disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing of shale, new payments that gas and oil producers will have to make to local governments.
