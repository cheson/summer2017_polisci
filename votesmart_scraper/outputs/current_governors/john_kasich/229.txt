Gov. John Kasich visited Fayette County Tuesday on one of his latest campaign stops, touting his administration's economic accomplishments in Ohio and stressing the importance of agriculture to the state's future.
Although raised just outside of Pittsburgh, Kasich told a crowd of more than 200 people at the family farm of State Sen. Bob Peterson (R-Sabina) that he has developed a great affinity for farmers and for the agricultural industry over the years.
"Farming isI think it's a value system," said Kasich, a Republican. "You reap what you sow. It's about faithfaith in the fact that the good Lord through our hard work will give us bountiful harvests. You have to have faith. You go through the good years, you go through the bad years. And you just keep going and then you get old and say, "Who's going to take over the business?' You just hope and pray that somebody in that family, some son or daughter, is going to decide they want this life."
Kasich received a loud round of applause from those in attendance when he spoke of his administration's role in repealing Ohio's estate tax effective Jan. 1, 2013. Prior to its repeal, opponents of the estate tax, also known to many as the "death tax," asserted that the tax often forced families to sell land or equipment to meet the tax burden upon the death of their parents, a situation that hindered the ability to keep farms viable for future generations.
Proponents of the estate tax warned against the negative impact eliminating it would have on local governments because the tax funneled about $250 million a year to local governments and $60 million to state coffers.
