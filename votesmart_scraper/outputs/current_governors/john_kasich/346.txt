"Ohio's hunters and anglers are committed to the conservation of wildlife and wild places, ensuring that these natural resources are here to be enjoyed by all, today and in the future," said Kasich.
He noted the generosity of sportsmen and women who donate the wild game they harvest. A total of 125,150 pounds of venison was donated during last year's deer season to local food banks, which translated into approximately 500,600 healthy, good tasting meals for less fortunate Ohioans.
In his video address, Kasich touted how Ohio's trophy bucks are drawing to the state hunters from all corners of the country. He also enthusiastically promoted Ohio's outstanding steelhead fishery, which attracts anglers from across Ohio, 19 states, and Canada.
Kasich emphasized that Ohio's 1.5 million sportsmen generate nearly $2 billion every year in hunting
and fishing-related sales that have a direct impact on Ohio's economy.
"Pursuit of wild game, especially Ohio's trophy bucks and wild turkeys, helps support our state's economy, generating more than $859 million a year. Fall fishing for crappie, walleye and bass keep anglers casting. From bait to boats, fishing contributes more than $1.1 billion to Ohio," said Kasich.
