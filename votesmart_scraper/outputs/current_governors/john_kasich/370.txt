Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich praised the General Assembly for its passage of House Bill 21 (Combs), legislation directing the State Board of Education to issue resident educator licenses to applicants assigned to teach in Ohio as participants in the Teach for America program. In his State of the State address, Kasich promised to bring Teach for America to Ohio, and today he issued the following statement in support of the bill's passage:
"Bringing Teach for America to Ohio is great for our children, and I applaud the General Assembly for working together in a bipartisan manner to get House Bill 21 passed so quickly. The best college students in the country are recruited to teach in the poorest school districts, and Teach for America has proven itself to be a very effective program. I am thrilled Ohio will now have the opportunity to bring these energetic and passionate teachers into our classrooms."
