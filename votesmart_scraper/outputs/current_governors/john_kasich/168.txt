Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich issued the following statement in response to today's grand opening of a new, $50 million Nestlé Research & Development Center in Solon.
"Ohio is proud of the relationship it has with Nestlé and its decision to continue to grow in our state deserves celebration. Two years ago, Nestlé leaders and I had the opportunity to sit down together and talk about how the company and Ohio could work and grow together, and today is the realization of that shared vision. Nestlé is a great company and a global leader creating great products we enjoy every day. Nestlé's new facility will strengthen that tradition. We look forward to working with Nestlé as it expands its presence in our state, invests in Solon and adds 250 great jobs for Ohioans."
