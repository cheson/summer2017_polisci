Though he didn't mention them by name, Kasich derided the policies of his rivals Donald Trump and Ted Cruz as "amateur hour" responses that were the result of their inexperience, and said he is the candidate who will confront the threat of terrorism and repair partisan divisions at home.
"We're fighting for the future of our children," Kasich said. "This is not the time to play around or to play politics.  This is a time for leadership"
In his fiery introduction, [former Gov. Tommy] Thompson pushed back against the idea that a vote for Kasich helped Trump, saying it's Kasich who will do best in a general election against former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.
"Since (Kasich) is the only candidate that definitely will win  a vote for Donald Trump and Sen. Cruz is a vote for Hillary Clinton," Thompson said.
