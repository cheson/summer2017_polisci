In an effort to maximize growth in the shale gas region, Ohio entered into a three-year agreement today with West Virginia and Pennsylvania to collaborate on areas critical to the success of the growing industry. The agreement was signed at the Tri-State Shale Summit in Morgantown, West Virginia.
"The issues and opportunities facing our growing oil and gas industry do not recognize state lines, making it essential that we work together to help ensure the continued growth we expect to see," said Ohio Lt. Governor Mary Taylor who represented the state and signed the agreement. "We are seeing tremendous and continued growth in this industry and we know that can be strengthened by partnering on key areas."
