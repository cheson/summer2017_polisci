Monday, in highly personal and religious terms, Governor John Kasich spoke out against Ohio's heroin crisis.
Appearing before the state's top opiate experts, Kasich said the time to save lives is now.
The governor told the Ohio Judicial Symposium on Opiate Addiction, "Look, this is what I believe. If you don't want to believe it, that's up to you. We are all made in the image of God and we were all created for a purpose."
For many in the room, Kasich believes that purpose is to save lives and to keep Ohio kids away from heroin.
As he put it, "What could be better than that? Tell me what could be a better job than being in the position to save lives?"
Kasich's Democratic opponent Ed FitzGerald has criticized the governor for not doing enough about Ohio's heroin epidemic.
But Kasich supporters argue the governor began his fight against heroin even before he was sworn in as governor.
