Attend one of Gov. John Kasich's speeches and you'll likely get a history lesson on Ohio's economy in the past, present and future.
Kasich has a vision of what Ohio can become -- a place where the tax and regulatory environment help support and encourage new energy, biotechnology, information technology and other emerging industries alongside the state's mainstay manufacturing and agricultural base.
It's the innovation, Kasich told an audience of business people recently, that's going to help to drive young people to stay or relocate to Ohio.
"These are the things that will keep young people here," he said. "... What really gets young people pumped up is the ability to see the future through the jobs that they do. That's what we have to drive in Ohio. And that means we must have an environment in Ohio that attracts that. We have to have an environment in Ohio that really encourages entrepreneurship and small businesses, because small businesses drive change."
