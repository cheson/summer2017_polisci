Today Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement upon final passage of education legislation associated with his Mid-Biennium Review.
"Getting Ohio back on track means making sure that Ohio's kids, as well as Ohio's workers, are prepared for the challenges of a changing world. It's just as important for third graders to be able to read as it is for incumbent workers to be able to upgrade their skills so their employers can stay competitive and they can keep their jobs to support their families. Addressing the full arc of Ohio's education, training and workforce development needs in an interconnected way helps us align our resources more strategically to help produce better results--better prepared students, better training for workers, and a better workforce for job creators. The partnership with Sen. Lehner and Rep. Stebelton was essential to passing this bill, as was the leadership of Senate President Niehaus and Speaker Batchelder. There's much more work to be done, but this bill is a huge step forward and progress on which we can build to start producing needed results for Ohioans."
