Today Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement in response to the announcement that Abbott, a Fortune 100 company with nearly $40 billion in sales, will build a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Tipp City, Ohio. Through the project, which is contingent upon approvals of state and local incentives, Abbott is expected to invest $270 million and create 240 jobs during the project window.
"This announcement by Abbott is huge for our state, and I'm thrilled Ohio will be home to this new facility. By winning the project, Ohio continues to prove to the country that we're a force to be reckoned with when it comes to economic growth. We're building a jobs-friendly environment and job creators are responding.
"I'm really proud of my team and the team at JobsOhio for working collaboratively with Abbott and local partners to make this happen. The decision means more than 200 families will have a better future, and to me, that's what it's all about."
