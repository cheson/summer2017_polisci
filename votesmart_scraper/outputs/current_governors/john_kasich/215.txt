Governor Statement on Ebola Response Activities in Ohio
Statement
By: John Kasich
Date: Oct. 15, 2014
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich issued the following statement in response to news that a Dallas health care worker who tested positive for Ebola virus had recently traveled to Ohio:
"I have been fully briefed on the federal, state and local activities that are underway and have directed state health officials to aggressively respond to the situation and provide local health officials every resource and support they need. Every effort must be taken to identify those at risk, monitor their health and avoid further risk.
"Ohio has a sophisticated state and local public health network that has been preparing for this possibility for several months and those plans are now being activated. The Department of Health's epidemiologists are on-site in Summit County to support local efforts and are in ongoing communication with the CDC to make sure we have the most up-to-date information.
"The risk to people who have had no direct contact with the nurse remains very low, but everyone is seeking to apply the lessons from Dallas and we are responding aggressively to this situation, with a priority on public communication that is open, timely and accurate. We will continue to provide as much information as soon as possible and provide local health care providers the resources they need to keep Ohioans safe."
