Today Governor John R. Kasich and Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor
issued a resolution recognizing the 70th anniversary of D-Day, encouraging all Ohioans to honor and thank the veterans of D-Day.
"The American military service members who took part in these landings faced extreme danger from artillery, machine gun and rifle fire as well as heavy seas," Kasich and Taylor shared, "Yet they all did their duty and prevailed over the enemy to establish a firm foothold in France that could not be turned back."
