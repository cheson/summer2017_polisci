Press Release

Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich signed Senate Bill 4, legislation requiring the Auditor of State to conduct four performance audits of state agencies each biennium. Kasich was joined by Auditor of State David Yost, bill sponsors Sen. Tim Schaffer (SB 4) and Rep. Peter Stautberg (HB 2), chairman of the House Finance Committee Ron Amstutz, and former sponsor of HB 2 and current chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Todd Snitchler.
Performance audits are proven tools for assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of operations to identify areas for improvement and cost savings.
"I look at the Auditor's Office as a great resource. I'm sure that he will have reports that will say that my cabinet, the government that we're currently running, could be made more efficient. What do I think about it? I absolutely know that that's a fact. So we welcome thisÂ…I think the ability to have openness makes a lot of sense when it comes to managing this government," said Kasich at today's bill-signing ceremony.
With SB 4 auditors will measure an agency's performance as compared to similar organizations and industry benchmarks and offer recommendations for cost savings and operational improvements. When utilized correctly, performance audits provide a roadmap to make educated decisions about how to spend -- and save -- limited tax dollars.
