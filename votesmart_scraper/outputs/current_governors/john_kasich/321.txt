Kasich Praises Legislature for Passage of Energy Policy Legislation
Statement
By: John Kasich
Date: May 24, 2012
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement in response to the General Assembly's adoption of Ohio's 21st Century Energy Policy, Senate Bill 315 (Jones):
"I'm so excited about what this legislation accomplishes and what it means for Ohio's future. Starting with the Energy Summit last September, the passage of Ohio's 21st Century Energy Policy has been a collaborative effort. Because we were able to come together and look at energy consumption and production from every angle--from shale gas to waste heat to workforce training to alternative fuels and renewables--we've accomplished something truly unprecedented. I applaud Sen. Jones, Rep. Stautberg and the entire General Assembly for reaching across the aisle to make this energy policy a priority. We'll be better stewards of our environment because of it, and our kids and grandkids will thank us for it."
