Today Governor John R. Kasich and Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor issued a resolution recognizing November 11, 2015 as Veterans Day and encouraged all Ohioans to join in recognizing the men and women who have courageously served our nation.
"We live in a land of unparalleled liberty and opportunity, and veterans remind us of the price that has been paid for our freedoms by the courage and valor of generations of American military men and women. We owe each and every veteran a debt of gratitude for their selfless service to our nation -- a debt which can never be fully repaid," said Kasich and Taylor.
