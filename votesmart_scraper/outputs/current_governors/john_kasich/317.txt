Today Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement upon final passage of the Cleveland Plan.
"It's been an honor to work with Mayor Frank Jackson to help him get the tools he needs to lift up Cleveland's school children and give them the educational experience they deserve. A lot of folks said this couldn't be done, but when people of good faith recognize a problem and come together to fix it, you can't hold them back. Ohio's educational, political and business leaders set aside self-interest and came together to serve some of the most vulnerable children in our state. Members of the Legislature from the House and the Senate and both sides of the political aisle came together and showed true leadership, wisdom and compassion. It's the kind of cooperation that Ohioans expect from their leaders and I hope it's an example we can all follow more and more."
