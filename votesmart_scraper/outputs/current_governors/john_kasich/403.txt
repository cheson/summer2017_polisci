While Ohio's problems are daunting, I believe they are fixable -- but only by creating a business environment that rewards investment and increases wages. With forward-thinking, solutions- oriented leadership, we can transform Ohio into a model of job creation and economic vitality that other states will want to follow. To succeed we must:
* lower taxes -- Create a tax climate that allows Ohio to compete with other states to attract new businesses, foster job creation, and keep our precious, existing jobs here
* make government more efficient and effective -- Skinny-down state bureaucracy to ensure taxpayers are getting their money's worth, and reform state government into a 21st century partner with Ohio's job creators -- not one that punishes business with outdated or unnecessary regulation;
* transform our education system -- Help our kids achieve, compete and succeed to meet the workforce demands of tomorrow's economy
* end the influence of special interests -- Build common-sense solutions to our problems and kick out those who, for too long, have kept us from fixing all that is wrong in our state
