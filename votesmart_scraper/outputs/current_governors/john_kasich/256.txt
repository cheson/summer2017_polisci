Location: Columbus, OH

Today Governor John R. Kasich announced that he has commuted the death sentence of Arthur Tyler to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Tyler was convicted in Cuyahoga County in 1986 for the murder of 74-year-old Sander Leach. Kasich issued the following statement:
"After carefully reviewing the case record with my legal counsel and studying the
recommendations of the Parole Board, I've decided to commute Arthur Tyler's sentence
to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The questions that continue around this case are fundamental and the irregularities in the court proceedings are troubling. Arthur Tyler's crime against Sander Leach and his family was heinous and this commutation in no way diminishes that and I pray that Mr. Leach's family can find peace and healing."
