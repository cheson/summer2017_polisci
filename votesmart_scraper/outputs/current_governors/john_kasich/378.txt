Kasich Unveils the Jobs Budget
Press Release
By: John Kasich
Date: March 15, 2011
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich unveiled The Jobs Budget -- a groundbreaking proposal that closes an $8 billion projected budget gap through significant government reforms and carefully-considered spending reductions. Keeping his promise to close this shortfall without raising taxes on Ohioans, Gov. Kasich's Jobs Budget preserves the $800 million, two-year income tax cut that went into effect on January 1 and provides $34 million in job-creating tax incentives.
"The budget proposal I am unveiling today allows Ohioans to take an important step forward together toward regaining our footing, getting our state back on track, and creating the jobs-friendly environment necessary to get folks working again," said Kasich. "Together we will embrace a new direction and together we will take a better, higher path that lifts the hopes and opportunities of every Ohioan, from every walk of life and from every corner of our great state."
At 6 p.m. on Tuesday evening, Gov. Kasich will lead an Ohio Town Hall Meeting at the Capitol Theater in Columbus, together with Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor and cabinet members, to present the Jobs Budget to Ohioans. The live audience will include members of the General Assembly, executive office holders, budget stakeholders, members of the public, and media. Following the presentations, questions will be taken from the theater audience as well as via Facebook and Twitter.
Ohioans not attending the Town Hall Meeting in Columbus may participate by watching the live webcast at www.OhioChannel.org and submitting their questions online.
To submit questions via Twitter, viewers should tweet their question with the hashtag #FixOhio. Questions may also be submitted on Facebook at www.facebook.com/JohnRKasich.
