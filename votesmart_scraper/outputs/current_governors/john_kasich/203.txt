Ohio Governor John Kasich is heading to Arizona and possibly Idaho this week in a campaign to encourage states to seek a federal balanced-budget amendment.
Kasich, a Republican who was the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee chairman when the federal budget was balanced in 1997, said he wants to encourage resolutions calling for a convention to consider an amendment.
"This is not a complicated thing," Kasich told reporters today in Columbus. "If the government continues on this path of spending money that they don't have, over time, systems will melt down, people will be hurt and our children will be put behind the eight ball."
Twenty-four of the 34 states needed to call a convention to consider the amendment have acted, according to the website of the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force in Virginia. The group said it's targeting 12 states next year.
Arizona is one of three where the House of Representatives passed a resolution during the 2013-14 session that the senate didn't act upon, the group said.
Unlike the federal government, most states are required to have balanced budgets.
Kasich, who is in his second gubernatorial term and is a potential presidential candidate in 2016, encouraged the Ohio legislature to pass a resolution last year.
