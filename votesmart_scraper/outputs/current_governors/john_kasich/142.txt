CHUCK TODD:
And joining me now from Mackinac Island in Michigan is the governor of Ohio, John Kasich. Governor Kasich, welcome back to Meet the Press.
GOV. JOHN KASICH:
I've always loved being on Meet the Press.
CHUCK TODD:
Well, let me ask you a quick--
GOV. JOHN KASICH:
Many years.
CHUCK TODD:
Yes. Yes, sir. Let me ask you, you didn't get the greatest reception from some of your home state papers following the debate this week. Cincinnati Enquirer: "Where was John Kasich in the CNN debate?" Columbus Dispatch: "Debate shows Kasich can be overlooked." And Chrissie Thompson in The Enquirer wrote this: "Kasich is a threat in New Hampshire but candidates aren't visibly worried about him on the national stage." What do you say to that?
GOV. JOHN KASICH:
Look, I mean, the fact is that I, in the debate, you know, which was kind of like a demolition derby, I did fine in being able to tell people who I am. But, you know, we all want more time. We all want to be in a position where we get more time. And one thing I don't want to do is be jumping in, saying, "Hey, what about me?" You know, that's not the way to do it.
And by the way, the way this whole business works is state by state, not on the basis of what they think about you in Nebraska. And by the way, if they're not worried about me then I've got to try to figure out why they're all trashing me behind the scenes.
So, look, we're doing fine. You know, there were so many doubts about whether I would get on the stage, whether I could raise the money. Our campaign is extremely healthy and we continue to rise. And I'm very pleased with where we are right now.
CHUCK TODD:
Right after the debate, day after the debate, you were talking to a group of supporters and you said this when it comes to immigrants working in this country.
(BEGIN TAPE)
JOHN KASICH:
A lot of them do jobs that they're willing to do, and that's why in the hotel you leave a little tip.
(END TAPE)
CHUCK TODD:
Now, some groups took offense to your whole story here, feeling as if you were stereotyping Latino immigrants. Do you understand why they're offended?
GOV. JOHN KASICH:
Yes. I would also tell you that the head of the Hispanic Chamber said he appreciated my comments. And as you know, Chuck, having followed me through this race, I've had a very reasonable position on immigration. I've always said that Hispanics are such a critical part of the fabric of the United States.
They occupy jobs from top to bottom. They're so critical to our country. They're God fearing and they're hard working. And if I need to clarify what I meant by that, I'm more than glad to do it. And that means that they hold very important positions.
I've got a friend right now who's a doctor. He's a doctor in oncology, you know. I mean, that shows you how crazy it can get in this business. But to be clear, I believe that, from top to bottom, Hispanics play a critical role in America, not only today, but going forward.
CHUCK TODD:
And finally, I know you're not a big fan of addressing Donald Trump issues. But let me ask the question this way when it comes to the president's faith. Number one, should it matter what a president's faith is?
GOV. JOHN KASICH:
Well, look, I don't know about that, Chuck. I mean, I'd have to think about what that means. But I believe the president, in fact, is a Christian. If he wasn't a believer, that would be his business. But he is, I believe he is. Secondly, I don't agree with him. I think he tends towards redistribution, taking from those at the top and, you know, kind of the Robin Hood effect. I don't buy that. And secondly, I think he thinks America should lead from behind on foreign policy, and I don't buy that.
But let me suggest, and I've said this earlier today: We need to respect our basic institutions, whether it's the presidency, whether it's our teachers, whether it's our ministers, or rabbis. We need to have great respect or the country begins to come undone. And so, you know, I may not agree with the president, but I respect the office, and I respect the fact that he is the president of the United States. And hopefully, I'm going to be.
CHUCK TODD:
Would you ever have a problem with a Muslim becoming president?
GOV. JOHN KASICH:
You know, I mean, that's such a hypothetical question. The answer is, at the end of the day, you've got to go through the rigors, and people will look at everything. But, for me, the most important thing about being president is you have leadership skills, you know what you're doing, and you can help fix this country and raise this country. Those are the qualifications that matter to me.
CHUCK TODD:
All right, Governor John Kasich. Be safe on the campaign trail. I'll look forward to having you on again, sir.
GOV. JOHN KASICH:
Thank you.
