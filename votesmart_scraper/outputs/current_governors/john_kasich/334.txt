Gov. John R. Kasich and Representative Lynn Wachtmann (R-Napoleon) today announced that they've reached agreement on House Bill 473, legislation that brings Ohio into compliance with the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. The bill provides tough protections for Lake Erie and its tributary streams, complies with or exceeds the Compact, and is consistent with actions taken by other Great Lakes states and provinces named in the Compact.
"I'm very pleased we've reached an agreement on this legislation. I want to thank Rep. Wachtmann for hearing our concerns and working with us to get to this point," said Kasich. "Lake Erie is one of Ohio's most valuable resources and I've always believed that we must protect it. I'm confident we've now reached a point where Ohio can be both a good steward of the environment and a friend of job creators who rely on the lake. I look forward to signing HB 473, and urge the Legislature to act quickly."
"I want to thank Governor Kasich and his administration for his willingness to continue working on this important piece of legislation," Wachtmann said. "The bill offers more than adequate stream protection and, in fact, withdrawals from most rivers have decreased in the last few years.
"Some have used scare tactics to prevent this bill from becoming a reality but I am confident that common sense has ultimately prevailed. This bill accomplishes two notable goals: it ensures that job creators have appropriate access to the Lake but also ensures that we are being environmentally-conscious by further protecting Lake Erie and its surroundings. I am truly proud of what we have been able to do in this bill."
