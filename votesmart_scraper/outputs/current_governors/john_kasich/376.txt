The Honorable Barack Obama
President of the United States
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20500
Dear President Obama:
The geopolitical upheaval in the Middle East is once again increasing energy costs in world markets, which directly impacts the costs of energy supplies in the United States. Faced with uncertainty over energy prices, employers are being forced to reassess planned investments during a precarious time for our nation's extended economic recovery.
The uncertainties caused by international events that are well beyond the Administration's control are further compounded by the unreasonably aggressive regulatory agenda being pursued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As the stewards of our states' natural resources, we share the broad goals of the EPA to protect our air and water. However, we wish to express our strong concerns over the contents and timing of many of the recently adopted and pending regulations, which together could seriously impact energy supply, reliability, and affordability for the residents, small businesses, and manufacturers in our states and across the country.
