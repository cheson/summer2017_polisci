Today Governor John R. Kasich issued the following statement in response to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announcing approximately 700 new jobs and retooling their north plant:
"An announcement of new jobs coming to Ohio is always exciting, but I am particularly thrilled to hear that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is going to expand the capacity of Wrangler production in Toledo and add about 700 new jobs there. Wrangler and Toledo have become close to synonymous in recent years. To see those links further strengthened is proof of our new agility in bringing jobs and business growth to Ohio."
