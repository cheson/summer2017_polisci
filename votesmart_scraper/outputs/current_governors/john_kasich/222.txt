Ohio Gov. John Kasich stopped by Fairfield County Republican Headquarters on Tuesday afternoon to encourage county Republicans to get out the vote and support the Republican ticket.
"Listen, I know we are doing pretty good right now," Kasich said. "But I remember what Woody Hayes used to say when the team was up. He used to tell the team to go out and get a couple more touchdowns. That's what we need to do. Pick up a campaign sign and put a bumper sticker on your car. We in this state need to send a message to the nation that it can work."
Fairfield County Republican Executive Chairman Jeff Fix said having the governor in town was a boost to the local party and the get-out-the-vote effort.
"Whenever you have someone here from one of the state's major offices, it helps energize your base," Fix said.
During his address to the overflow meeting room crowd, Kasich said his administration was able to increase employment, take a deficit to a $1.5 billion surplus and give $1.6 billion more to the schools across the state.
He said his goals were to bring vocational education back to the seventh-grade classrooms, deal with the drug addiction problem in the state, lower taxes and increase job opportunities.
