Today Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement on the most recent jobs report.
"It's so encouraging that Ohioans are getting back to work. Things are heading in the right direction and that's great to see, but we're far from being out of the woods. Headwinds from Washington don't help and I remain concerned about our future progress. The best thing that can happen is for Ohio to continue pursuing the jobs-friendly policies that are tearing down barriers to job creation and for Washington to learn from our progress."
