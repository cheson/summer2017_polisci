Today Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement on Rep.Milkovich's vote on the Education & Workforce bill.
"Ohio's success relies on the implementation of an education system that incorporates the skills needed for a productive future and the jobs environment to utilize them. From the kids in our schools to the adults in our workforce, we have a responsibility to provide the education needed to thrive in our evolving global economy. That's why I'm so proud of the historic reforms within the Education & Workforce legislation passed by the Ohio legislature this week. Rep. Zack Milkovich recognized the key to addressing our challenges relies on compromise and bipartisanship, and thanks to his support and leaders on both sides of the aisle, we made significant progress that will positively impact Summit County and beyond. Together, we're making historic reforms that will mean real results for all Ohioans.
