Statement

Location: Columbus, OH

Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement on House Bill 473, legislation that brings Ohio into compliance with the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact:
"Ohio has something few states have--access to Lake Erie, an invaluable natural and economic asset. Over the past year we have brought together the best ideas from the General Assembly, local communities, environmental advocates and business leaders to craft a bill that moves Ohio into compliance with the Great Lakes Compact, and provides strong protections for Lake Erie and its watershed. It meets federal obligations and supports Ohio's need to boost job creation. I appreciate Rep. Wachtmann's commitment to reaching a final agreement. It has been a long road since last July, but we worked out our differences constructively and Lake Erie is the winner for it."
