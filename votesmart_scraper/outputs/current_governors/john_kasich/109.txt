By: John Kasich
Date: Dec. 28, 2015
Location: Columbus, Ohio

Today Governor John R. Kasich issued the following statement in response to this afternoon's grand jury decision in Cuyahoga County:

"Tamir Rice's death was a heartbreaking tragedy and I understand how this decision will leave many people asking themselves if justice was served. We all lose, however, if we give in to anger and frustration and let it divide us. We have made progress to improve the way communities and police work together in our state, and we're beginning to see a path to positive change so everyone shares in the safety and success they deserve. When we are strong enough together to turn frustration into progress we take another step up the higher path."
