Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich named Asim Z. Haque, a member of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) since 2013 and the current vice chair, to serve as chairman of the commission. Haque will succeed Andre Porter, who recently announced his decision to step down as chairman on May 20 to accept a position in the private sector.
"Throughout his three years of service on the PUCO, Commissioner Haque has demonstrated an exceptional command of the issues and challenges facing Ohio's energy markets. No one is better prepared to apply that level of expertise and independent judgment to the role of chairman," Gov. Kasich said.
"I am honored by the governor's confidence in my ability to lead the commission, and I look forward to working with my fellow commissioners and the talented PUCO staff to foster energy policies that further strengthen Ohio's job growth with affordable, reliable power," Haque said.
Haque was first appointed to the PUCO by Gov. Kasich in June 2013 to complete three years of an unexpired term and recently reappointed by the governor to a full five-year term. His term will expire in April 2021 and the appointment is subject to the advice and consent of the Ohio Senate.
Haque holds a bachelor of arts degree in chemistry and political science from Case Western Reserve University and a juris doctorate from The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. He and his family reside in Columbus.
