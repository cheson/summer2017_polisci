Kasich Praises Legislature for Passage of EPA Omnibus Bill
Statement
By: John Kasich
Date: May 24, 2012
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement in response to the General Assembly's adoption of the EPA omnibus bill, Senate Bill 294 (Schaffer):
"I believe very strongly that encouraging job creation and protecting Mother Nature are not mutually exclusive. By working together to enact common sense regulations, Ohio can have both a jobs-friendly environment and a clean environment--and that's what we're achieving through Senate Bill 294. Senator Schaffer and Chairmen Hall and Hite have worked with my office, as well as representatives of the environmental and business communities, to streamline the regulatory process, meeting the needs of job creators without jeopardizing the environment. I look forward to signing this bill and implementing changes that will have a positive impact on all Ohioans and our environment."
