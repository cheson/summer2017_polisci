Statement

Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich released the following statement in response to the General Assembly's adoption of House Bill 487 (Amstutz):
"We started the Mid-Biennium Review process several months ago in order to improve the way government operates so it can be a better steward of taxpayers' resources. It's been hard work and addressed a wide array of detailed and complex issues, but the end result is increased efficiency and increased commonsense. There are some changes the General Assembly has made that we're still reviewing, but overall I'm very pleased with the result and I appreciate President Niehaus, Speaker Batchelder, and Chairmen Amstutz and Widener, for their hard work on this legislation. Together we are transforming Ohio government to more responsibly use taxpayers' resources to serve Ohioans."
