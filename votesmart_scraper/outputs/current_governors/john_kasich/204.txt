Today Governor John R. Kasich released the following statement on the passing of former Ohio Republican Party Chairman Robert T. Bennett.
"I was saddened to learn of the loss of Bob Bennett. Chairman Bennett was a giant of Ohio and national politics. He was a passionate but level-headed advocate for his ideas, a gifted leader and someone who earned the respect of his Democratic opponents even as he was beating them. He worked hard for his party and state and helped launch the careers of a generation of Ohio elected officials. My thoughts and prayers go out to his children and family at this difficult time."
