Kasich Vetoes HB 231, Calls for Improvements to Protect Great Lakes
Statement
By: John Kasich
Date: July 15, 2011
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Governor John R. Kasich vetoed HB 231, legislation related to Ohio's participation in the Great Lakes Compact, an agreement between the eight Great Lakes states and two Canadian provinces to provide for management of Great Lakes water. In vetoing the bill Kasich issued the following statement:
"Lake Erie is an incredible resource that demands our vigilant stewardship to maximize its environmental, recreational and commercial potential for Ohioans. The Great Lakes Compact ensures that Great Lakes states and provinces work together to protect the lakes and the water resources in the basin, and Ohio's legislation is intended to further Ohio's compliance with the compact. While most of HB 231 fulfills Ohio's obligations without concern and helps meet the needs of Ohio's industrial, energy and agricultural water users, portions of it must be improved. Namely, Ohio's legislation lacks clear standards for conservation and withdrawals and does not allow for sufficient evaluation and monitoring of withdrawals or usage. I look forward to working with the General Assembly to make the necessary improvements to the legislation."
