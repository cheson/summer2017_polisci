GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH:
Good to be with you, Chuck.
CHUCK TODD:
All right, I've got to start with the elephant in the room, here, Donald Trump. Is he consuming this campaign right now?
GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH:
You know, Chuck, it's really funny. It just doesn't seem to bother me. You know, and in regard to the issue of women, you know, I mean, look. I had strong women in my family, I've had, you know, I have strong women in my administration and my campaign manager is a woman. And I've always found that whenever women touch anything, they always make it a little bit better. And so it's unfortunate what's happened here. But I just don't, it's up to me to tell people about me and not be worrying about somebody else--
CHUCK TODD:
I understand that. But the Republican party, at some point, at what point does what Trump's doing damage the entire party?
GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH:
See, I don't kind of look at it that way. I think, at the end of the day, you have a nominee. And the nominee is the person that reflects the views of the Republican party. And all the things that go on in these primaries are just simply things that are, you know, they go on today, but they're forgotten tomorrow.
So, you know, take a look at the Democrat side. I mean, you've got, you know, Bernie Sanders out there. He's hard left. He's basically a redistributionist. Does he define the Democratic party? I mean, at the end of the day he won't. It'll be the nominee. Now, if he's the nominee, which would be great, because I think we would probably win 49 out of the 50 states, then it's a different situation.
But I don't have people coming up to me saying, "Oh, well you're a Republican, therefore you think this or that." I think the way I want to think. And you know what? I actually have a right to kind of define what I think the Republican party is, Chuck.
CHUCK TODD:
All right. Well, let's go to your debate performance. Time Magazine, you could be the GOP's "Pope Francis" candidate, an interesting way to describe you. Do you take that as a compliment?
GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH:
Well, I love the pope. I think he's-- look, who am I to criticize the pope? I think he's wrong on the economics about redistribution of wealth, because I think free enterprise has lifted more people out of poverty than any system known to man. But, you know, his inclusiveness, his wanting to say that we should focus on the "do's" that the Lord wants us to do rather than the "don'ts."
I agreement with all that. And I like it. And look, I think he's sensitive to the environment. So am I. You know, the Lord gave us the environment. We're not here to worship it, but we are here to manage it. So I'd like to meet the pope. But I don't know if I'm going to be able to do that, Chuck. To me, that's a compliment. Sure.
CHUCK TODD:
You brought up the environment. He's somebody who believes that climate change is manmade and that man needs to do something about it. Do you agree with him?
GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH:
Well, I think that man absolutely affects the environment. But as to whether, you know, what the impact is, the overall impact, I think that's a legitimate debate. But what I do think is, you know, in my state of Ohio, you know, we preciously take care of Lake Erie. We've reduced emissions by 30% over the last ten years. We believe in alternative energy. So of course we have to be sensitive to it. But we don't want to destroy people's jobs based on some theory that's not proven.
CHUCK TODD:
What do you say to conservative activist Erik Erickson, who did not invite you? And he really is pretty disparaging about you as a potential nominee.
GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH:
You know, I don't know that I've ever met him. You know, I was sort of chuckling this morning. I wasn't invited to this event, but I don't know why anybody would be mad at me who's never met me, that I can think of. But look, if he calls me and tells me what he's upset about, I'm sure we can talk it out. Because from time to time, you know, people are going to get upset with you. But, you know, I don't hold anything against him. And look, I'm up in New York and I'm meeting with a lot of potential donors, and I'm headed to New Hampshire, in fact, tomorrow.
CHUCK TODD:
Right. Well, that's a state that I imagine you're going to spend a lot of time in. John Kasich, governor of Ohio, big performance on Thursday night. Thanks for coming on for a quick check-in here on Meet the Press.
GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH:
Thanks, Chuck. Thank you very much.
