Location: Columbus, OH

Gov. John R. Kasich issued the following statement today congratulating Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder, House Finance Chairman Ron Amstutz and members of the House Republican Caucus on the introduction of their FY2012-13 budget proposal:
â€•I congratulate Speaker Batchelder, Chairman Amstutz and the House Republican team on their budget proposal and applaud their commitment to filling Ohio's $8 billion budget gap without raising taxes. I began working with the Speaker, as well as with Senate Republicans, even before the election to discuss our shared principles for solving Ohio's unprecedented budget crisis and I'm proud of the work we're accomplishing as partners. There will, of course, be different ideas on which route to take, but we share the same destination--fiscal stability without a tax increase. Together we're going to get there, to create jobs and to get Ohio back on track.
