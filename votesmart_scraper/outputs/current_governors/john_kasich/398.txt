Dear Fellow State Employees:
We all have been given different gifts and talents in life, and a gift that you and I share is the gift of service. It is our privilege to serve our fellow Ohioans as employees of state government.
I believe that public service is a noble calling and, like many of you, I have spent most of my life in pursuit of that calling. Now we are being called to apply our gifts as public servants to transform our state from a place that has, of late, struggled, to a place in which every Ohioan can realize their Godgiven potential.
Our state and our fellow citizens have faced difficult times lately. Too many of our neighbors are out of work. Too many of the most vulnerable among us are suffering. Too many of our cities and towns have seen families and businesses leave for greener pastures.
This must end.
We are going to help Ohio get back on track and we are going to do it by working together. As I said in my inaugural speech, which is attached, I believe very strongly that our only shot at success is to harness the combined energy, commitment, creativity and hard work of people from every corner of Ohio.
Like any organization, state government has, over time, slowly become too bureaucratic. Together we'll recharge it, reform it, modernize it and, yes, in some cases, make it smaller.
Our most important goal as the employees of the people of this great state is to help revive the economy so our neighbors can get back on their feet. We are up to the challenge because we are Ohioans. Together we can do it.
Sincerely,
John Kasich
Governor of Ohio
