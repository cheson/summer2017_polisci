Kasich Applauds Passage of Senate Bill 5
Statement
By: John Kasich
Date: March 30, 2011
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich congratulated the General Assembly for its work on Senate Bill 5, legislation that reforms Ohio's collective bargaining laws and gives local governments new tools to control their costs so they can begin reducing taxes. Kasich released the following statement:
―With some of the highest taxes in the country, Ohio is struggling to create a climate that is attractive to the businesses that create jobs. Helping local governments reduce their costs so they can begin lightening Ohio's tax burden helps us compete better against states that are far friendlier to job-creators. Senate Bill 5 gives local governments and schools powerful tools to reduce their costs so they can refocus resources on key priorities--like public safety and classroom instruction--while at the same time preserving government workers' right to unionize and collectively bargain. Re-leveling the playing field for taxpayers gives them the respect they deserve from the elected officials and government workers that serve them.‖
