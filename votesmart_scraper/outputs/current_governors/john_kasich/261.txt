Today Gov. John R. Kasich called on the Legislature to quickly approve new proposals to keep Ohio's economic recovery moving ahead by cutting tax rates for all Ohio taxpayers, providing special tax relief for low- and middle-income Ohioans, improving K-12 education, job training and higher education, and providing new help for Ohioans with mental illness and addiction.
"We know what works: balanced budgets, tax cuts, better education and training, and a helping hand so everyone can benefit from a stronger Ohio. We've got to keep building on these ideas because they're lifting our state, and with the continued partnership of the Legislature we'll keep that progress going for Ohioans," said Kasich.
