Press Release
By: John Kasich
Date: May 4, 2011
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich encouraged Ohioans of all faiths to join together in prayer by issuing a resolution designating Thursday, May 5, 2011 as an official Day of Prayer in Ohio. The designation coincides with the National Day of Prayer observed across America on this same day.
"Prayer has been a significant part of my life for many years. I turn to prayer as a source of guidance, comfort and inspiration, and no matter our beliefs, prayer can serve as a strong pillar of support in our lives. During moments of great joy or great despair, people of all different faiths look beyond themselves to offer thanks or search for hope. On this Day of Prayer, I hope we each take a few moments for private reflection to offer penitence, give thanks for the freedoms we enjoy, and strive to find ways to do more for our neighbors, our state, and our country," said Kasich.
The National Day of Prayer was created in 1952 and is observed annually on the first Thursday of May. On this day, people of all faiths are invited to pray for the nation.
