Gov. John R. Kasich is a strong supporter of the right to bear arms and was endorsed by the National Rifle Association where he received an "A' in his reelection last year for his support of the Second Amendment and for enacting sensible legislation to defend this basic, constitutional right.
Removing Burdensome Restrictions for Law-Abiding Concealed Carry Licensees: John Kasich enacted legislation protecting Ohio's concealed carry laws, including protecting the privacy of permit holders, allowing for reciprocity licenses with other states, reasonably expanding where permit holders can carry their firearms, and aligning Ohio's policies with generally-accepted practices in other states.
Upholding Ohio's Outdoors Traditions: In addition to having a $3.6 billion annual economic impact in Ohio, hunting and fishing are parts of Ohio's long tradition of enjoying our natural places. John Kasich upheld this heritage by enacting legislation that removes restrictions on licensing requirements for hunters and by creating new policies to expand hunting rights in Ohio.
