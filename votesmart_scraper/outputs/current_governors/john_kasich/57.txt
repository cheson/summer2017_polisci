Location: Columbus, OH

Today Governor John R. Kasich issued the following statement in response to Chief Executive Magazine's 2016 business survey of CEOs that showed Ohio had the most improved business climate in the nation -- jumping 12 spots to number 10 overall. Since 2010, Ohio has moved up 34 places.
"The fact that the nation's CEOs now see Ohio as a top ten state in which to do business is solid recognition of the jobs-friendly business climate we have worked so hard to create here. This is also a salute to JobsOhio, our more agile and effective economic development engine. It's clear our formula is working: cutting taxes, fiscal responsibility, building a skilled workforce and common sense regulations," Kasich said.
