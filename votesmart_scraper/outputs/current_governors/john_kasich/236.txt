Ohio employers are likely to receive $1 billion in refunds on their workers' compensation premiums -- the state's second rebate since the 1990s.
The $1 billion in refunds would follow an identical amount the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation returned to employers last year, as better-than-expected returns have sent assets ballooning above expenses.
Employers, ranging from schools to construction companies to marketing firms to homeowners who employ a maid, are required to pay premiums to the bureau to cover expenses if workers are injured on the job.
Under the proposal from Gov. John Kasich's administration, each private employer would receive a refund equal to 60 percent of premiums paid from July 2012 to June 2013.
Even with the refund, the BWC's assets would still remain above their target levels -- a "cushion," as Kasich called it.
"They've earned a lot of money. I'm wondering who is doing their investing. Maybe I ought to hire them myself," Kasich joked after announcing the proposal. Still, "I like the cushion ... because who the heck knows what's going to happen with the market and this economy over the next year. There's so much uncertainty."
Employers aren't used to getting money back from the government, said Kasich, a Republican.
