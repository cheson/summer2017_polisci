Location: Columbus, OH

Today Governor John R. Kasich called on North Korea to immediately release Otto Warmbier, the college student from Cincinnati who was detained there on January 2. North Korea recently sentenced Warmbier to 15 years of hard labor.
"North Korea should immediately release Otto Warmbier and let him return to his family here in Ohio. His detention was completely unjustified and the sentence North Korea imposed on him is an affront to concepts of justice. Continuing to hold him only further alienates North Korea from the international community. I urge the Obama Administration to redouble its efforts to secure his release and ask all Ohioans to continue to lift up Otto and his family in prayer in support of his swift, safe return."
