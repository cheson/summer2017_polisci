Governor John R. Kasich today named Sarah Morrison as administrator and CEO of the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, tapping her to lead an agency with more than 1,800 employees and serving more than 250,000 Ohio employers. She has served in that position in an interim capacity since the bureau's former administrator and CEO, Steve Buehrer, stepped down last month.
"Sarah has been an important part of the BWC leadership team that helped drive our state's workplace injury rate below the national average and provided Ohio businesses with $4.3 billion in rate cuts, rebates and credits. I am confident she will build on that record of achievement and continue BWC's work to strengthen Ohio's business environment," Kasich said.
Morrison was BWC's chief legal officer since first joining the bureau in November 2012 after 15 years in private law practice. She holds a bachelor's degree in political science from The Ohio State University and a law degree from the Capital University Law School. She was named an Ohio Rising Star by Law & Politics magazine and was a recipient of the Columbus Business First "40 Under 40 Award" in 2005.
