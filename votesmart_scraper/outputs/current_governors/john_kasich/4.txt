Kasich Sets New Execution Schedule In Response To Federal Court Order
Press Release
By: John Kasich
Date: Feb. 10, 2017
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Governor John R. Kasich issued a revised schedule for eight upcoming executions. This revised schedule is in response to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit's pending review of a challenge to Ohio's execution procedures brought by death row inmates. The Court is not expected to issue its ruling in the case before the next scheduled execution on February 15. The February 15 execution would be that of Ronald Phillips who was sentenced to death in 1993 for the rape and murder of his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter, Sheila Marie Evans.
On January 26, a magistrate for the United States District Court of the Southern District of Ohio stayed the first three scheduled executions in response to the challenge filed by Ohio death row inmates. While Ohio is confident its appeal will ultimately be successful given the United State Supreme Court decision in Glossip v. Gross, the appellate court's scheduling will not allow the matter to be resolved in time to allow the state to move forward with its current execution dates. Accordingly, these delays are necessary to allow the judicial process to come to a full resolution, and ensure that the state can move forward with the executions.
The eight inmates who currently have executions scheduled for 2017 have been rescheduled as follows:
The execution of Ronald Phillips has been moved from February 15, 2017 to May 10, 2017.
The execution of Gary Otte has been moved from March 15, 2017 to June, 13, 2017. Otte was convicted in Cuyahoga County for the 1992 robbery and murder of 61 year-old Robert Wasikowski and 45 year-old Sharon Kostura at their respective apartments in Parma, OH.
The execution of Raymond Tibbetts has been moved from April 12, 2017 to July 26, 2017. Tibbetts was convicted in Hamilton County for the 1997 murder of his wife Judith Crawford and the couple's 67 year-old landlord Fred Hicks.
The execution of Alva Campbell, Jr. has been moved from May 10, 2017 to September 13, 2017. Campbell was convicted in Franklin County for the 1997 murder of Charles Dials. Campbell had taken Dials hostage after assaulting a court officer and fleeing during an appearance before a judge on aggravated robbery charges.
The execution of William Montgomery has been moved from June 13, 2017 to October 18, 2017. Montgomery was convicted in Lucas County for the 1986 murder Debra Ogle and Cynthia Tincher.
