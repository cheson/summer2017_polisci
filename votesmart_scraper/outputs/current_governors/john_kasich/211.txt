Gov. John Kasich released the following statement after being declared the winner in this year's gubernatorial election:
"Ohio's made a lot of progress in the past four years because we had the courage to come together to solve tough problems. The result is that Ohio is getting stronger every day. Though the challenges may change in the next four years, we know how to tackle them head on--don't be afraid to make tough choices, come together to solve problems, keep government small, manage responsibly and have the determination to lift up our neighbors. I'm proud of what we've all accomplished--and will accomplish--and grateful for the chance to play a role in it. My family, our team of volunteers, our supporters, our staff and, most important, the people of Ohio--thank you for being there to support me and thank you for all you do every day for our great state."
