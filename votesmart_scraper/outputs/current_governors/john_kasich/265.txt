Kasich Extends Energy Emergency Declaration to Expedite Heating Propane Shipments
Press Release
By: John Kasich
Date: Feb. 14, 2014
Location: Columbus, OH

Today Gov. John R. Kasich extended Ohio's energy emergency declaration through March 1 so that shipments of propane gas can continue to be expedited and help ease tight propane supplies brought on by the recent extreme cold weather. Kasich issued his original declaration on January 18, 2014, allowing commercial motor vehicles transporting propane to more quickly deliver supplies.
At the request of Kasich and other Midwestern governors, the federal government issued a similar declaration expediting interstate shipments. Propane gas is a common home-heating fuel used in rural Ohio and delivered to both suppliers and homes by truck.
