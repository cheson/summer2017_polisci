GOVERNOR KASICH: Thank you, Mr. President, and Mr. Speaker. Thank you members of the General Assembly, members of the Cabinet, the people of Medina, and, of course, my dear wife Karen, and my daughters Emma and Reese. Thanks for coming, girls. We love you. We love you.
(Applause)
We know Medina is the hometown of our great House Speaker, Bill Batchelder. This is his last year in the Legislature, and Keith and I are going to miss working with him. And Keith, thank you for your leadership and everything you've done in the last year.
You know, Bill, over the period of the next year, there's going to be a lot of celebrations of your greatness in serving the people of this state. No question. This Speaker, by the way, has been the most consistent and hard-working supporter of the Highway Patrol, and I want to be the first one to kick off this next year of celebration of Bill Batchelder. In honor of that support, I'm proud to announce that we are renaming the Medina Highway Patrol Post for you.
(Applause)
Speaker Batchelder, congratulations, and thank you for your service.
(Applause)
