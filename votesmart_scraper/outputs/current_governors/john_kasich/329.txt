Gov. John R. Kasich today issued the following statement in response to the Ohio Senate's passage of Senate Bill 315 (Jones):
"I applaud my colleagues in the Senate, especially President Niehaus, Chairwoman Jones and the members of the Energy and Public Utilities Committee, for embracing a new approach to energy that will move Ohio into the 21st Century, and they deserve Ohio's thanks. Where Washington has failed to act, Ohio has a great opportunity to be leader in our country by crafting a comprehensive energy policy with the goal of making energy more affordable and Ohio more energy independent.
"The policy improvements made in this bill are significant, including revising renewable energy standards to now include waste heat, protecting our townships and counties by formalizing Road Use Maintenance Agreements (RUMAs), adopting chemical disclosure standards for fracking wells, and improving Ohio's underground injection program.
"I appreciate the senators from both sides of the aisle who worked with us to ensure Ohio approaches energy production and consumption in a safe and responsible way, while also giving families and job creators access to more affordable energy. I urge the House of Representatives to follow the lead of their counterparts in the Senate and move quickly to pass this legislation so we can begin implementing these improvements as soon as possible."
