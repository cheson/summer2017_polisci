5th Republican Presidential Debate
Debate
By: Jeb Bush Donald Trump John Kasich Rand Paul Chris Christie Ted Cruz Marco Rubio Ben Carson Carly Fiorina
Date: Dec. 15, 2015
Location: Las Vegas, NV

Nine Republican candidates participated in Tuesday's 2016 presidential debate in Las Vegas: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former tech executive Carly Fiorina, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, and Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.).
The debate began with CNN's Wolf Blitzer introducing each candidate and explaining the rules.
BLITZER: These nine Republicans are positioned on stage based on their ranking in the recent polls, so let's begin right now. I'd like to invite each candidate to introduce himself or herself to our audience. You'll have one minute.
First to you, Senator Paul.
PAUL: The question is, how do we keep America safe from terrorism? Trump says we ought to close that Internet thing. The question really is, what does he mean by that? Like they do in North Korea? Like they do in China?
Rubio says we should collect all Americans' records all of the time. The Constitution says otherwise. I think they're both wrong. I think we defeat terrorism by showing them that we do not fear them. I think if we ban certain religions, if we censor the Internet, I think that at that point the terrorists will have won. Regime change hasn't won. Toppling secular dictators in the Middle East has only led to chaos and the rise of radical Islam. I think if we want to defeat terrorism, I think if we truly are sincere about defeating terrorism, we need to quit arming the allies of ISIS. If we want to defeat terrorism, the boots on the ground -- the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots on the ground.
