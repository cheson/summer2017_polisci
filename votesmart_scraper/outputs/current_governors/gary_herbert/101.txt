Retailers are gearing up for the holidays and they are counting on big sales to end the year. Encouraging Utahns to buy locally this holiday shopping season, Gov. Gary R. Herbert has declared Saturday, Nov. 28, 2015 as "Small Business Saturday in Utah."
"This day provides an ideal opportunity to support our local, independent businesses during their most critical time of the year," said Gov. Herbert. "I often speak with local business owners and they have told me that they rely on increased sales to grow their businesses and create new jobs. I hope you will join me by shopping at local businesses, not only on Small Business Saturday but throughout the year."
