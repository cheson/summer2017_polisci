Press Release

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert toured areas of rural Utah recovering from floods that resulted from heavy rains last week.
"The amount of water that hit this community in such a short time was remarkable," said Gov. Herbert. "However, it's even more remarkable the way the community has come together to clean up the mess, and I'm confident they will be back on their feet very soon."
The governor toured a trailer park in Carbonville with Carbon County Commissioner Casey Hopes. The park sits adjacent to the Price River. The governor also visited Wellington where he met with Mayor Joan Powell and walked with homeowners through a neighborhood still working to clean up the damage.
