Today Governor Gary R. Herbert signed a proclamation convening the Utah Legislature into Special Session to address six legislative issues on June 20, 2012, at 3:00 p.m.

"I have called the Legislature into Special Session on their June interim day to address a number of pressing legislative items. One vital economic development matter needing timely resolution is the number of liquor licenses available statewide. We also need to address the Office of Education's technical error and shortfall of $25 million," said the Governor. "By addressing these issues now, we will provide a more efficient legislative process, greater certainty in the marketplace and assurances to schools and parents that our children are the priority."

Other items included on the Special Session call are: Technical amendments to the nursing accreditation laws, addressing the manner in which the Attorney General's Office can retain outside counsel and experts, considering removing an opinion question from the November ballot, and the Senate consenting to a number of the Governor's appointments.
