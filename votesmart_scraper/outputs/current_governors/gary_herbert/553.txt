Health system reform is critical to the future of Utah and the United States. It is also critical to both Utah and the United States that the destructive healthcare bill passed by Congress and signed by President Obama be repealed. Much of it is outside the powers delegated to the federal government by the Constitution. It is also a potential budget buster for states, not to mention the disastrous consequences for the federal budget deficit.

The cost to Utah taxpayers from the new federal healthcare reform is jarring. For example, Utah's Medicaid costs are expected to go up $157 Million annually by the time Obamacare is fully implemented. Approximately 110,000 Utahns will be newly enrolled in Medicaid, expanding the number of people on this public assistance program by half. Growing the rolls of those reliant upon government is not a strategy for lasting prosperity, it is a pathway to greater dependency, fiscal catastrophe, and reduced liberty.
The reforms undertaken by Utah are based on expanding the market for health insurance beyond the employer-provided benefit model. Utah's Health Exchange is a Utah-unique solution to providing a marketplace for individuals who do not fit within the regular (and often outdated) business provided insurance model.
