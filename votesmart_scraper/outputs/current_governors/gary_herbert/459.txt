"There is no debate over whether the state should support expanded services. I have agreed that we should provide services throughout the week to taxpayers, so I made sure certain services like the Driver License Division and DMV were accessible on Fridays. More services than ever are also available 24/7 online.
"The only issue here was that the Legislature failed to pay for it; there was no funding for this bill. But there is a $790,000 price tag for turning on the lights and opening the doors an additional day. Regardless of the override, they are still going to have to pay for the expanded Friday services.
