Statement

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

As the nation marks ten years since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Governor Gary R. Herbert has issued a declaration on the "Day of Service and Remembrance in Utah," as well as the following statement:

"This Sunday, we will mark the 10-year anniversary of one of the darkest days in our nation's history: September 11, 2001. On that day, the lives of nearly 3,000 innocent individuals were taken in barbarous terrorist attacks.

"We honor the lives and memories of those who perished at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, and on Flight 93. We offer our continued condolences and support to those who lost family, friends, and loved ones on that terrible day.

"We honor the first responders, military personnel, and ordinary citizens who selflessly sought to assist in rescue and recovery efforts, often at risk to their own lives or well-being.

"We honor the service of the men and women of our Armed Forces who have fought to protect our homeland and our liberties in the War on Terror. The six Utah servicemen who have been killed in Afghanistan in the past two months offer a solemn reminder that our brave military personnel are still in harm's way as they fight the enemies of freedom.

"As we observe the anniversary of 9/11, let us honor the memory of those lost by rededicating ourselves to the spirit of unity which prevailed in our country after the attacks. Let us provide acts of service to our fellow citizens and our communities to further strengthen what the terrorists sought, and failed, to destroy: The enduring spirit of the American people."
