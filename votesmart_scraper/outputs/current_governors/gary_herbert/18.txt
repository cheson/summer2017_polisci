Governor Gary R. Herbert encouraged Utahns to donate to the homeless on their tax forms during a visit to Palmer Court on Tuesday, where he met with families who were once homeless.
During his visit, the governor highlighted the importance of combating homelessness by donating to organized programs that strive to alleviate the hardships of homelessness through critical services and resources.
"Amidst the ongoing issues with homelessness in our state, we cannot forget the very successful programs and services that are making a real difference for Utah families," Gov. Herbert said. "Here at Palmer Court, there are 320 people living in their own apartments who used to be on the streets and in shelter, including 75 children. Our service providers are doing incredible work, and donating to the Pamela Atkinson Homeless Trust Fund on your tax form is the best way to support them."
The governor recognized Pamela Atkinson Homeless Trust Fund as being the most direct and reliable method to donate to families and individuals experiencing homelessness. He encouraged Utahns to donate just $3 on their state tax form this year. The trust fund enables Utahns to receive non-tax deductible donations from individuals and businesses on their state tax form.
As a state that prides itself in being the best place to live, to work, and to raise a family, Utah is fortunate to have willing partners who are helping resolve the complex issue of homelessness. By donating $3 to the Pamela Atkinson Homeless Trust Fund on individual state tax forms, Utahns can easily take a proactive role in aiding their more vulnerable neighbors.
