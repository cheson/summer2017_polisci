Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Governor Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement in response to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's naming of Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate:

"It is folly to think we can spend our way out of a budget crisis. Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan underscores Romney's commitment to turn around the nation's economy and get America working again. Not only is Ryan an experienced conservative and a nice complement to Romney, he has demonstrated leadership on reigning in federal deficit spending. This Republican team is exactly what the nation needs to get our fiscal house in order and restore economic health."
