Statement

Today Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement in response to the federal budget proposed by Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI).
"I applaud the budget released today by Congressman Ryan. Its emphasis on empowering states with tools to succeed is very encouraging. This budget gives states maximum flexibility in areas like Medicaid, food stamps, and TANF, so states can determine the optimal way to provide services to our unique populations. I also like its focus on energy development and opening public lands for increased energy production, which is critical for states like Utah, where access to public lands has been severely restricted for far too long. If our country is going to get serious about energy independence, we must use the newest technologies to develop all of our energy resources in environmentally sensitive and responsible ways, while protecting our beautiful vistas and venues."
