Gov. Gary R. Herbert announced that the state's successful work-based learning model in which students train with industry leaders will be replicated into the life sciences field on Tuesday.
The Medical Innovations Pathways Program (MIP) prepares high school and college students for careers in life sciences through concurrent enrollment courses made possible by a unique partnership between industry, education leaders and government. This is the state's third pathways program.
"Innovative approaches and partnerships between education, industry and other community partners are key to bettering our education system," Gov. Herbert said. "It is my hope that this strong collaboration will continue to help pathways programs flourish for years to come."
Utah's pathway programs allow students the opportunity to train and certify in various fields through hands-on experience and create a talent pipeline into growing industries. The MIP program will be implemented in Granite School District this semester and will be introduced next year in Davis and Canyons school districts.
The life sciences field is growing at a rate of more than four percent each year and it pays an average salary of $64,000 annually. There are 1,074 life sciences companies in Utah that employ nearly 34,000 people.
Currently, there are pathways programs for aerospace manufacturing and the diesel technician field. The successful Utah Aerospace Pathways (UAP) program launched in September 2015 was expanded into southern Utah last April and the Diesel Technician Pathway Program was introduced in February 2016.
