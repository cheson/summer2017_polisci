Gov. Herbert Statement on Pres. Obama's Immigration Announcement
Statement

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement in response to President Barack Obama's immigration policy announcement today:
"I am disturbed the president would take such divisive and unilateral action. The American system of government was designed to have laws created by the legislative branch, and those laws faithfully executed by the chief executive. We operate within that system in Utah and expect the same at the federal level. All Americans, regardless of their political affiliation, should be concerned about Pres. Obama's blatant disregard of his oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Our broken immigration system compromises our national security and hampers our economy. However, the issue must be addressed by Congress. I am afraid the president's action tonight will only poison the well and make resolution of the matter more difficult."
