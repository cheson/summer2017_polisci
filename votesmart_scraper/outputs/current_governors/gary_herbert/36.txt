Gov. Gary R. Herbert has signed all eight bills passed by the Utah State Legislature during the July special session.
Effective immediately, the Division of Facilities Construction and Management (DFCM) can begin work on a new 10,000-seat arena at the Utah State Fairpark to be completed by July 2017. The arena will be constructed using funds from state and local governments, as well as private sector donations.
"The State Fair is a great example of Utahns from every part of our state coming together-rural and urban, Republican and Democrat," Gov. Herbert said. "I appreciate the partnership between local governments and the private sector that has made this facility possible. Many wonderful community events will take place here in the years to come."
The governor also signed HB 3003, which enhances penalties for operating drones in flight restriction areas during wildfires and allows law enforcement officers to neutralize drones in certain cases. The law became necessary after drones interfered with fire suppression efforts this summer on multiple occasions.
"Public safety has always been my top priority and this new law will allow us to more effectively fight wildfires," Gov. Herbert said. "We are not going to tolerate reckless drone interference during wildfire season. With this law, Utah has taken the necessary precautions to protect our emergency management personnel and prevent additional interference that compromises public safety."
