Gov. Herbert Declares October Domestic Violence Awareness Month
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Oct. 1, 2014
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary Herbert has declared October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month in Utah to join the national observation in support of this serious problem.

"I firmly believe that to have a strong viable state, we must have strong, viable families," said Gov. Herbert. "Domestic violence in any form is a serious threat to families and our society. We cannot and will not tolerate this crime, nor will we remain indifferent. We must do everything in our power to end the devastating cycle of abusive behavior."

Domestic violence violates an individual's privacy, dignity, security, and humanity due to the systematic use of physical, emotional, sexual, psychological, and economic control or abuse. It affects the lives of thousands of children, women and men in all communities in Utah, regardless of their socio-economic, cultural and ethnic backgrounds.

According to the Utah Domestic Violence Coalition, last year, at least 23 people in Utah lost their lives as a result of domestic violence and 1,304 children, 1,528 women and 30 men sought safety from Utah's 16 domestic violence shelters.

During October, increased public awareness and community education initiatives will help residents learn about resources, services and support available to victims and perpetrators of domestic violence, as well as how to build and strengthen healthy relationships.
