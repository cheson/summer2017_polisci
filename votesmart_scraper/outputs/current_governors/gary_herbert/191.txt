Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert has declared Feb. 22-28, 2015 eating disorders awareness week to educate Utah residents about eating disorders and increase understanding of the serious mental and health conditions.
"Eating disorders are a serious public health concern and should not be ignored," said Gov. Herbert. "Many of our citizens suffer from these complex mental health conditions. I hope we will all use this opportunity to increase our knowledge of the harmful effects of eating disorders, as well as how to prevent them."
More than 20 million women and 10 million men in the United States suffer from eating disorders at some time in their lives, with countless additional people who live with these conditions not being reported.
Eating disorders are complex and devastating mental health conditions, characterized by abnormal eating behaviors, which can cause serious consequences for health, productivity and relationships.
Gov. Herbert encourages Utah health organizations and health care professionals to educate Utah residents about eating disorders, so people may recognize symptoms, and seek treatment and support to cultivate healthy eating habits and save lives.
