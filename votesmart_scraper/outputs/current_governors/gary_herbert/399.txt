Press Release

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Today the Utah Governor's Office was notified by the Utah office of the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the completion of its environmental impact statement (EIS) for Gasco Energy Incorporated's Uinta Basin Natural Gas Development Project. The project, located on 206,826 gas-producing acres in Uintah and Duchesne counties, includes 1,298 new gas wells on 575 well pads over a period of 15 years.

"I am encouraged that the Final EIS has been published and the final decision will be published within a month," said Governor Gary R. Herbert. "This project has been a long time coming and subject to exhaustive environmental review. The Uinta Basin is Utah's richest area for oil and gas and this project will bring needed new jobs and new revenue to the region-and to the State."

The total surface disturbance for the Gasco Energy project is 3,604 acres, about two percent of the total project area.

While today's announcement regarding the final EIS is not a decision, it marks progress in a lengthy process. Following a 30-day waiting period, a final decision is expected. The Record of Decision (ROD) and conditions will be released April 16, 2012.
