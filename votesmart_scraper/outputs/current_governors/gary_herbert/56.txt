Mitt Romney Endorses Gov. Herbert's Re-Election
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: May 16, 2016
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Former Republican Presidential Nominee Mitt Romney has endorsed Gov. Gary Herbert's bid for re-election.
"I know these last eight years have been extremely challenging for our country," said Gov. Romney. "Our national economy remains sluggish and it seems our country is drifting off course more and more every day. But in Utah, the story is remarkably different.
"Under the leadership of Governor Gary Herbert, Utah is showing the rest of the country how conservative principles help businesses grow and families prosper. Utah has kept taxes low--the lowest they've been in 20 years. Working with business--not against it--unemployment in Utah has dropped to one of the lowest rates in the nation and businesses small and large have created over 219,000 jobs.
"Our strong economy has allowed us to invest in education like never before: an unprecedented $1.8 billion over the past five years. That's a record Gary Herbert can be proud of and that's a record Utah can be proud of. I encourage you to vote to keep Utah strong. Vote to re-elect Governor Gary Herbert."
The Utah Republican Primary is June 28, though 20 of the state's 29 counties are voting by mail and received ballots earlier this month. Ballots must be postmarked by June 27.
