Governor Kicks Off Rural Jobs Tour
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Oct. 11, 2011
Location: Grouse Creek, UT

From the only remaining one-room school house in the state, Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert kicked off his four-day Rural Jobs Tour today at Grouse Creek School. Grouse Creek presently has 17 students, from kindergarten through the tenth grade.

"I'm here to listen and learn," said the Governor. "One thing government doesn't do very well is listen. I am here to listen and determine the things government can do-or not do-to insure local economic success and opportunity."

Tomorrow, the Governor will participate in the first ever statewide broadcast to all Utah high schools. In addition to taking questions from students in three different schools, the Governor will focus his message on the importance of getting a good post-secondary education in order to secure a good job. He will also ask students to take the utahfutures.org "Reality Check" and encourage students to align their education with the needs of Utah's businesses and industry.

"We need to make sure students are studying a curriculum that aligns with the needs of the marketplace," the Governor said. "The world is not going to wait for us. We need to make sure our students are prepared to accept the challenge."

UEN BACKGROUND:
Every weekday the Utah Education Network delivers hundreds of classes and meetings to public education, higher education and government via Interactive Video Conferencing (IVC). Based on the 180-day public school year, UEN provides about 45,000 events annually at a cost of less the $50.00 per event and less than $4.00 per student. However, the thousands of students and staff who use the system are not charged fees for this service. Similarly, schools, colleges and government institutions are provided with this service at no charge. As of October 2010, the UEN IVC system includes 745 interconnected classrooms and meeting rooms and 203 high quality desktop installations throughout the state.
