Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert has appointed Stan Lockhart to the Utah State Board of Education. Lockhart will fill the seat left vacant when Mark Openshaw perished in a plane crash last month.
"Losing Mark Openshaw was a tragedy and we will certainly miss his voice on the State Board of Education," said Gov. Gary R. Herbert. "I am confident Stan Lockhart is uniquely qualified to step in and make a positive difference from day one. His broad experience in business and technology combined with his understanding of our education system will be a benefit to students throughout our state."
Lockhart is the government affairs manager at IM Flash Technologies, a joint venture between Intel and Micron Technology, Inc. He is involved with the STEM Action Center and serves on the Boards of Directors at The Leonardo and Thanksgiving Point. He is also involved with Boy Scouts of America and the Utah Alliance of Boys and Girls Clubs.
"Just the day before the accident, I spoke with Mark at length about education policy," said Lockhart. "He was very dedicated to the students, teachers, administrators and the public. I hope to be able to live up to the high standard set by my good friend and I'm honored for the opportunity to serve."
Lockhart served 13 years on the Utah Manufacturers Association Board of Directors, ten years on the Utah Technology Council Board of Trustees and six years on the Utah State Council on Workforce Services. He is past president of the Utah Energy Users Association and served on the Rocky Mountain Power Customer Advisory Board.
Subject to confirmation by the Utah Senate, Lockhart's term will expire Dec. 31, 2016.
