Governor to Testify before Congress on Building an Educated Workforce
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Feb. 4, 2013
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert is scheduled to be in Washington, D.C., tomorrow to testify before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The Governor's invitation was a result of his aggressive approach to align education outcomes with employer needs and the State's goal to achieve a college degree or post-secondary certificate for 66% of all working-age Utahns by the year 2020. In his 2013 State of the State address, the Governor called upon members of the State Legislature to unite behind this goal so Utah will achieve education excellence.
"For the sake of Utah's future economic strength, the alignment of educational outcomes with marketplace demands is not just important; it's essential," said Governor Herbert. "We invest in areas that meaningfully improve outcomes and our future economy will reflect it."
"Utah's education dollars are being optimized. In a majority of all measurable tests, Utah exceeds the national average or is on par," said Governor Herbert. "With that said, improving all of these scores is imperative to the success of our 66% by 2020 plan."
