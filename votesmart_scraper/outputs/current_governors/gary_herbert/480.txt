Utah's Governor Defends Utah's Solutions in Nation's Capital
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 1, 2011
Location: Washington, DC

Following a weekend of meetings in the nation's capital with the National Governors Association (NGA), Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert was defending Utah's solutions for health care and wilderness issues today before two House committees in Washington, D.C.

"In Utah, we began our health system reform efforts five years ago, long before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act arrived on the scene," Governor Herbert said. "The lessons we've learned in our experiments in health system reform can serve as a guide to other states as they begin their own reform efforts."

Later in the day, the Governor expressed concerns that federal action has unwound more than a decade's worth of work on wilderness issues. He said, "I recognize that the relationship between the states and the federal government is a partnership. But unfortunately, we are here today because the partnership between the states and federal government was recently ignored by an action of the United States Department of the Interior."

At 9:45 a.m. EST, Governor Herbert appeared with Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The subject of their remarks was "The Consequences of Obamacare: Impact on Medicaid and State Health Care Reform."

Then at 2:00 p.m. EST, Governor Herbert joined Idaho Governor Butch Otter before the House Committee on Natural Resources to address "The Impact of the Administration's Wild Lands Order on Jobs and Economic Growth."
