Utah Troops Allowed to Carry Weapons at Military Facilities
Press Release

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Approximately one year ago, Utah state policy was changed to accommodate the carrying of weapons by soldiers at National Guard facilities in accordance with state law. In response to the recent attack of military facilities in Chattanooga, Tenn., Gov. Gary R. Herbert has directed General Jeff Burton, adjutant general of the Utah National Guard, to explore additional ways to protect our men and women serving in the Armed Forces.
"Unfortunately, there are those in our society who specifically target military personnel when seeking to do harm," said Gov. Herbert. "We must do everything in our power to protect these men and women, and I am pleased that Utah has an existing policy in place that allows the members of our National Guard to be properly armed."
