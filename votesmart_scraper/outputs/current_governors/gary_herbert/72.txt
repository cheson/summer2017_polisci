Gov. Herbert Statement on Local Enforcement for Local Lands Act
Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 16, 2016
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement in response to the Utah Congressional delegation's introduction of H.R. 4751 Local Enforcement for Local Lands Act:
"I have long been a proponent of shifting federal powers and functions to state and local governments, where they rightfully belong. The Local Enforcement for Local Lands Act does just that. It will provide block grants to states and allows local law enforcement to take the appropriate lead role in enforcing the law. I strongly urge Congress to pass this legislation."
