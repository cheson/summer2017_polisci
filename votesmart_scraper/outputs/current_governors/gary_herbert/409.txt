Today Governor Gary R. Herbert appointed Dan McCay to represent Utah House District 52 and Craig Frank to represent Utah House District 57. The appointments were recommended by party delegates in their respective districts.

Dan McCay will replace former Representative Carl Wimmer, who resigned effective January 9, 2012. Craig Frank will replace former Representative Holly Richardson, who resigned effective January 6, 2012.

"As both a successful businessman and a longtime political activist, Dan McCay is well suited to ably represent his new constituents in southern Salt Lake County." said Governor Herbert.

"Having already served in the House, Craig Frank will hit the ground running, advocating for those issues which are of greatest import for his constituents in northern Utah County," the Governor continued.

"I expect both of these men will contribute greatly to the work of the Legislature in providing the responsible and responsive government Utahns expect and deserve."
