Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement today regarding the employment summary released by the Utah Department of Workforce Services this morning:

"It's very good news. Today's employment numbers demonstrate we are certainly moving in the right direction with good momentum. The steady monthly decline of Utah's unemployment rate, coupled with steady monthly job growth, affirms that what we are doing in Utah is working. But our work is not done. We still have too many Utahns who are seeking jobs or underemployed. My focus as Governor is singular: jobs, jobs, jobs. We are pushing hard to meet Utah's goal of 100,000 jobs in 1,000 days. I am certainly encouraged when I see that, for the first time since October 15, 2011, our four week average for unemployment claims is below 2,000.

"As both Goldman Sachs' announcement (http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/53615975-79/goldman-office-employees-lake.html.csp) and Business Facilities Magazine (http://businessfacilities.com/special-report/2011-state-of-the-year/) this week also affirmed, Utah is the hotspot for business, and that means jobs. We will continue the State's aggressive pursuit of economic development and policies that stimulate job growth, like investing in public education outcomes that meet employer needs, common sense business regulations, low taxes, and a stable environment."
