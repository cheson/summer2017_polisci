Today Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert made a statement to allay community concerns regarding the Office of Ethnic Affairs (OEA) within the Utah Department of Community and Culture (DCC).

The Governor said, "I am sensitive to the fact that Utah is increasingly diverse. We have over 100 languages spoken in this state, and that impacts our schools, agencies and communities. I am committed to continuing meaningful dialogue and outreach with our ethnic communities. We must actively listen to all cultures, all people, regardless of race or background. With input from a variety of constituents, I'm considering ways to improve how Utah conducts ethnic affairs."

A legislative appropriations subcommittee recently advanced a proposal to eliminate all funding for OEA, creating concern among ethnic minority community groups.
