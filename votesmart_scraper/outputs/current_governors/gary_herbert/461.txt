"America will never forget the tragedies of September 11, 2001, and we honor the many lives lost and families who have sacrificed since. However, it is good to know Osama bin Laden, the icon of Al-Qaeda, can commit no more terrorist acts himself. While the United States must remain vigilant, I am pleased to see an end to this chapter of the War on Terror. This is a victory for America, and for freedom and liberty throughout the world."
