Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: May 13, 2016
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement regarding the directive issued today by President Barack Obama:
"Today's action by President Obama is one of the most egregious examples of federal overreach I have ever witnessed. Schools are the domain of state and local government, not our nation's president. Unfortunately, this is exactly what I have come to expect from the Obama administration. If we have to fight this order, we will not hesitate to do so."
