Press Release

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

After meeting with individuals who are experiencing homelessness today, Gov. Gary R. Herbert encouraged Utahns to donate to the Pamela Atkinson Homeless Trust Fund on their Utah income tax form.
"In every part of our state, we have individuals and families experiencing homelessness - some for a single night, and some for weeks or months," said Gov. Herbert. "Donating to the trust fund provides support directly to the services they need most, like emergency shelter, healthcare and food. Utahns are known for helping their neighbors, and that's exactly who these people are - our neighbors."
Gov. Herbert visited with some of those neighbors at the Fourth Street Clinic - one of the many service-providers that receive funds from the Pamela Atkinson Homeless Trust Fund. The clinic provides health screenings, immunizations, mental health and substance abuse services, dental and eye care, pharmacy and other services.
By donating to the Pamela Atkinson Homeless Trust Fund on their 2015 tax form this tax season, Utahns are supporting statewide efforts focused on delivering critical services for our vulnerable homeless population. All donations to the fund go directly to service organizations statewide that provide vital care and assistance to individuals and families experiencing homelessness.
The homeless trust fund is leveraged with other state funding to provide the maximum impact for the following services statewide:
Emergency services - temporary shelters, soup kitchens, day centers and outreach services
Supportive services - varying levels of case management used to help more people move into stable in housing
Housing services - rapid reÂ­housing, transitional housing, rental assistance, onsite case management and security
