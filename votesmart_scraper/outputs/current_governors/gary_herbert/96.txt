Utah has the sixth fastest growth rate in the nation among states at 1.75 percent according to estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau yesterday.
Utah's estimated population was reported as 2,995,919 as of July 1, 2015, but experts agree that the state reached the three millionth population milestone this October if not sooner. The Beehive State ranks No. 31 in total population up from No. 33 last year, passing both Arkansas and Mississippi. Utah added 51,421 residents between July 1, 2014 and July 1, 2015.
"Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau confirms that Utah's quality of life and sound economic opportunities continue to attract people from around the world," Gov. Herbert said. "Most importantly, we continue to create opportunities for our children, so they can pursue their dreams here in Utah."
