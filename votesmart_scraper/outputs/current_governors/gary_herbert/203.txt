By: Gary Herbert
Date: Jan. 27, 2015
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert released this statement following the announcement made by the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints regarding the issues of non-discrimination and religious freedom:
"The statement made by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today is an additional and important step to help us find common ground on these important issues. It will be helpful in our effort to resolve these difficult and emotional matters. I firmly believe that, in order to protect the personally held values of people on all sides, any advancement of non-discrimination legislation should be coupled with legislation to safeguard protections to religious freedom. I am confident that, as elected officials, we can work together with religious, business and civic leaders as well as the LGBT community to craft policies that treat all people with dignity and respect."
