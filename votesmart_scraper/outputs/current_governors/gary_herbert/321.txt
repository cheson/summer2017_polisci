Job growth in Utah continued its steady climb during April and unemployment declined yet again, according to figures released today by the Utah Department of Workforce Services.
Utah's job growth in April was 3.5 percent, more than double the national average. Unemployment in Utah fell during the same period from 4.9 percent to 4.7 percent, more than 2 1/2 percent less than the national average and the state's lowest unemployment rate since November 2008.
"As April's numbers show, Utah's economy is continuing to trend in a very positive direction," said Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert. "We are fully out of the recession and, unlike Washington, are showing the nation what a real economic recovery looks like.
"Utah has emerged as one of the top economic performing states in the country," the Governor added. "Still, we are not satisfied. We will continue to do all we can to promote policies that fuel job growth in the private sector, which is the main engine that powers economic success."
Since April 2012, 43,000 jobs have been added to Utah's economy. The largest job gain was in the trade, transportation and utilities sector (11,000 jobs), but nine of 11 industry groups in Utah have posted employment gains over the past year.
"The unemployment rate last month was a full percentage point lower than it was in
April 2012, illustrating Utah's continued economic growth," said Juliette Tennert, chief economist at the Governor's Office of Management and Budget.
