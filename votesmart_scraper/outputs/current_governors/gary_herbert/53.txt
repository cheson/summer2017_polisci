The Utah Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), the state's 2,700-member chapter of the world's largest organization of law enforcement officers, has endorsed Gov. Gary Herbert's reelection campaign.
"Utah's law enforcement officers are our local heroes, and I am humbled and honored to have their endorsement," Gov. Herbert said. "These men and women put their lives on the line every day and we will continue to support them in their efforts to protect and serve our community."
The Utah FOP is a nonpartisan group that supports issues critical to police officers and the law enforcement profession.
"The FOP is focusing efforts on the wellness of police officers and Gov. Herbert is a strong advocate for those issues that affect us on a day to day basis," Utah FOP President Brent Jex said in a statement.
"FOP is proud to endorse a man who has supported our profession and worked to foster public support for law enforcement," Utah FOP Vice President David Edwards said.
