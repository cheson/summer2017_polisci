Dear Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan:
Thank you for your service to our country. Please allow us to offer our thoughts about the pending vote on the
American Health Care Act. Americans want personalized, patient-centered healthcare that treats them as
individuals not a statistic, and that demands we repeal Obamacare, replace it, and reform the system.
We support the Repeal of Obamacare
Obamacare is collapsing. If we do nothing, people will lose access to health care coverage. As it stands now, one-third of the counties nationwide have only a single insurance carrier. Americans in these areas have essentially no choices, while they watch their premiums rise dramatically. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 28 million Americans will lose coverage over the next decade if changes are not made to the Affordable Care Act.
As the Affordable Care Act continues to deteriorate, and as insurance premiums skyrocket across the nation,
opposition to this failed policy grows. Governor Mark Dayton (D-MN) said, "the Affordable Care Act is no longer
affordable". Similarly, Bill Clinton called ObamaCare, "...the craziest thing in the world.", adding that people "wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half." The President and Congress must act now to repeal the Affordable Care Act to protect the citizens we serve in the states.
