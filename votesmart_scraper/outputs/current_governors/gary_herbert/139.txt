Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper and Utah Gov. Gary Herbert today asked Congress to negotiate a long-term solution that would complete the new Regional VA Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado.
"Congress must find a path forward that creates a long-term funding solution to complete the medical center and restore the public's trust in the VA's ability to serve our country's veterans," according to the letter. "Halting the construction of the hospital will put at risk the investment already made on behalf of taxpayers in the facility while the need for the services continues to grow. A long-term solution is necessary."
The new Regional VA Medical Center will be essential to the Rocky Mountain region's ability to provide access to the very best in medical and behavioral health care to the hundreds of thousands of veterans living in the Rocky Mountain region. The needs of a growing number of veterans in our region is only increasing and the new regional medical center will ensure we are keeping faith with the commitment we have made to serve them.
