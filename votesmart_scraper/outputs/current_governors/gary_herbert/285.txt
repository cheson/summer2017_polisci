Utah's unemployment rate dropped again over December, now measuring 4.1 percent, far below the national average of 6.7 percent. The Utah economy added 22,500 jobs over the last year, and is on track for continued steady growth through 2014.
"When I came into office, Utah's unemployment rate was above eight percent, and now we've cut that by nearly half," said Governor Gary R. Herbert. "We've seen a remarkable turnaround in our state as we continue to add jobs and welcome new businesses, and all signs point to the same positive trend throughout the coming year."
Nine of Utah's 10 measured private sector industries added jobs throughout 2013, with the largest gains in Education and Health, Trade Transportation and Utilities, and Leisure and Hospitality.
