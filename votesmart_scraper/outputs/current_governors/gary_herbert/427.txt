Today Governor Gary R. Herbert announced Utah plans to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with other states to encourage the production of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) by automobile manufacturers in the United States.

"Utah is the sixth-largest producer of natural gas in the country. We also have a sophisticated network of compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) filling stations. Using more natural gas vehicles (NGVs) in our state fleet not only benefits Utah's economy, it benefits our air quality," said Governor Herbert. "My hope is that, by teaming up with our sister states, we will leverage purchasing power and encourage the domestic production of NGVs."

The MOU calls for a joint, multi-state request for proposal (RFP) for the purchase of NGVs for state fleets. As part of the joint RFP process, each state commits to buy a specific number of NGVs in accordance with state needs and appropriated funds. The MOU has already been signed by Colorado, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming. Other states have indicated an interest in also becoming party to the MOU in the future.
