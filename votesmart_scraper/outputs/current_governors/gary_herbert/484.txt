Location: Salt Lake City, UT

In an effort to bring business and jobs to Utah, Utah Governor Gary Herbert is on Wall Street today, reminding top tier financial institutions that Utah is one of the best places to invest and grow. The Governor is scheduled to meet in New York City with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and General Electric, as well as senior and managing editors and reporters of the Wall Street Journal.

"My message to every firm, to every reporter, to anyone who wants to plant business seeds in fertile soil," said Governor Herbert, "is Utah is poised to lead the nation as the best performing economy and be recognized as a premier global business destination. We are focused on keeping taxes low, reducing meaningless regulation and increasing international exports. Forbes ranked us as the number one place to do business for very good reasons, and I'm intent to tell the world what those reasons are."

"It's extremely competitive out there right now. Capital is looking for the right place to go and grow. One critical component of my job is to sell Utah to the world and to share our story in a meaningful way," the Governor said.
