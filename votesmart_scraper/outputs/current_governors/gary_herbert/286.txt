Statement

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

The announcement that the Department of Justice will recognize same-sex marriages performed in Utah comes as no surprise and is consistent with previous direction to state agencies. State agencies have always been directed to comply with federal law when providing federal services and will continue to do so. State agencies are directed and will continue to comply with state laws when providing state services. Adherence to the rule of law, both federal and state as those laws govern respectively, is an unbending principle of this administration.
