In his role as commander in chief of the Utah National Guard, Governor Gary R. Herbert announced today his selection for the new adjutant general of the Utah National Guard, Brigadier General Jefferson S. Burton, a 30-year military veteran and current Assistant Adjutant General. "This decision is one of the most important I have had the privilege and responsibility to make," said Governor Herbert. "With his commitment, experience and character, General Burton is tremendously qualified to lead the Utah National Guard and I am confident he will serve our country, state and the thousands of airman and soldiers with honor and integrity." General Burton will serve a six-year term overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Utah National Guard, which includes 7,000 airman and soldiers based in more than two dozen communities throughout the state. This includes recruiting, training and equipping personnel for service in Utah, in other areas of the country and around the world. "It's an honor to serve with those who are so willing to sacrifice so much for our country," said General Burton. "I hope to continue the great work of Major General Tarbet, in not only managing the affairs of the Guard, but helping members, their families and civilian employers handle the effects and challenges of deployments." Burton will replace Major General Brian L. Tarbet who is completing his second term as adjutant general and will retire this fall. Tarbet will be the third longest-serving adjutant general in the 118-year history of the Utah National Guard.
