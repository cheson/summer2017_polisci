During a visit to Utah State University Eastern, Gov. Gary R. Herbert wrapped up a discussion with student leaders with a living history lesson.
The governor honored Thurman Stevens, a former U.S. Air Force master sergeant and veteran of the Korean War, with the Korean Ambassador for Peace Medal. The medal is an expression of the Republic of Korea's appreciation to members of the U.S. military who served in the Korean War between June 1950 and July 1953.
"This afternoon I salute retired Staff Sgt. Thurman Stevens and all of Utah's Korean War veterans for their meritorious service," said Gov. Hebert. "It is my privilege to present you with the Korean Ambassador for Peace Medal."
Stevens was given a standing ovation by the group of about 30 student leaders and faculty who attended the question and answer period, which was part of the governor's scheduled events in rural Utah today.
The Korean War had a major impact on Utah as some 17,000 Utahns served in the Korean War and 141 Utahns died in combat during the war.
