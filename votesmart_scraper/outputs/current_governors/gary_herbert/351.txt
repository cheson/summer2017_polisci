I was happy to unveil the PACE Plan -- which stands for preparing young learners, access for all students, completion of certificates and degrees and economic alignment -- yesterday. This plan will help us continue to build upon the strides we've made toward improving education in Utah and is aimed at achieving a goal of 66% of Utahns holding some form of post-secondary degree by 2020.
