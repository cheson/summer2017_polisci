Gov. Herbert signed SB 296 Antidiscrimination and Religious Freedom Amendments into law Thursday night during a public ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.
SB 296 addresses LGBT discrimination and religious freedoms.
"I have no doubt that the eyes of the nation are upon us as we have shown a way to resolve a somewhat contentious issue in a very satisfactory manner," said Gov. Herbert. "I do believe that what we have done here will become a model for the rest of the country of how they, too, can resolve these issues in their own respective states, as we find the right balance necessary to discourage discrimination while protecting religious liberty."
Many Utahns came together to help pass this bill, including a vast array of religious and LGBT community leaders.
