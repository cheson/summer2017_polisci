The numbers are in, and they show that Utah's population has continued to grow steadily over the past decade.

"The census findings show what all of us here in the Beehive State have long recognized - Utah continues to increase its population," Governor Gary R. Herbert said. "Even in challenging economic times across the nation, people have continued to recognize Utah as a great place to live and do business."

"The impact of that growth means many things for the state, not the least of which is a fourth seat in the U.S. House of Representatives," the Governor said. "Utah was on the cusp of receiving a new congressional seat 10 years ago, and many of us felt we merited it at that time. This year, the census numbers are clear. Utah will have more representation in the U.S Congress."

Highlights from the 2010 Census include:
* As of April 1, 2010, there were 2,763,885 people living in Utah. This is an increase of 23.8% from the 2000 Census.
* Utah was the nation's third fastest growing state over the past decade, behind only Nevada and Arizona.
* Utah grew at a rate of 29.6% from 1990 to 2000. The overall population of the United States is 308,745,538.

"Utah's share of the nation's overall population is increasing," said Mike Mower, State Planning Coordinator in the Governor's Office of Planning & Budget (GOPB). Currently Utahns comprise .90% of the national headcount. This is up from 2000 when it was .79% of the overall U.S. population.

The State's numerical increase over the 2000 Census was 530,716. This is the equivalent of adding 145.2 Utahns a day over the past decade, said Juliette Tennert, State Demographer in GOPB. This is a population increase that is the equivalent of adding a county the size of Utah County to the state over the past decade, or a city the size of South Jordan each year.

Census numbers for individual counties will be released beginning in March 2011.
Additional details from the census will be released on a rolling basis thru 2013. In addition to determining apportionment, census results are also used in determining funding for a wide array of government programs and services including transportation, health care, and education.
