Governor Takes Action on 2013 Bills
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 22, 2013
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Today Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert took action on bills recently passed by the 2013 Utah State Legislature. He signed several bills into law and vetoed HB76S1 Concealed Weapon Carry Amendments.
"The right to bear arms... is a fundamental right which must be jealously protected," wrote the Governor in his letter to House Speaker Rebecca Lockhart and Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, where he stated his reasons for disapproving the bill. He continued, "HB 76S1 does not, however, impose a restriction on the right to bear arms. Rather, it removes an existing provision of Utah law that those who carry a concealed weapon obtain a permit. Utah's permitting system has been in place for decades, and in its current form for more than 15 years. In that time, it has become a national model."
"As a gun owner and concealed firearm permit holder, I understand the value of the permit, both to firearm owners and to the public at large," Governor Herbert wrote. "As a State, we must exercise extreme care that we not impose undue burdens on the right to bear arms, but I have yet to receive any credible evidence that Utah's current permit process constitutes a hardship."
