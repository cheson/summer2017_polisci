Utah's economic growth continued through May, according to newly released jobs data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Utah added 28,800 jobs in May, maintaining a 2.4% growth rate - which is more than 1.5 times the national growth rate. Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert said this data confirms the success of Utah's economic policies.

"A low tax burden, steady regulation, and an educated workforce are consistently proven as the best components for economic growth," Herbert said. "And these latest numbers prove that Utah is steadily growing out of the recession."

These job growth numbers help explain why the U.S. Chamber's Enterprising States report ranked Utah as No. 2 for top future boom states, No. 2 for business birth rate, and No. 2 for export growth.

"Utah is the best place for business - period," Herbert said. "However, our unemployment rate is still too high for comfort. These numbers and accolades are wonderful for our great state. But I won't rest until every Utahn who wants a job, has a job."
