Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: July 3, 2013
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Governor Gary R. Herbert was ranked third in the nation for job creation among United States governors according to a new study by The Business Journals.
"This recognition is noteworthy - but not because of me. It's another indicator of what is right with Utah," said the Governor. "We work hard to create a diverse economy, we work hard to be business-friendly, and we work well with strong industries like Technology and Software Development, Life Sciences, Energy, and Finance."
Private sector jobs in Utah have increased by 2.61 percent annually since Governor Herbert took office in August 2009. The total number of jobs has jumped from 964,000 to 1,062,800 over the same time period. Unemployment in Utah, now at 4.6 percent, continues to decline.
