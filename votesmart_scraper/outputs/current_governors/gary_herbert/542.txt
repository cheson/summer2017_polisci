Governor Herbert Launches Newly Revised Recovery Website
Press Release

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Utah's newly revised website, recovery.utah.gov, will allow Utahns to be even more informed about the receipt and use of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding awarded to state agencies.
"Utah is committed to accountable, responsible and transparent use of taxpayer dollars, whether they are collected at the local, state or federal level," said Governor Gary R. Herbert. "Today's launch of the new Recovery website raises the bar yet again for government transparency in Utah."
The site is designed to answer three major questions surrounding federal Recovery Act funds awarded to the State of Utah:
(1) What State agencies have been awarded ARRA funding, and for what programs?
(2) How are State agencies using ARRA awards?
(3) What parts of Utah are benefiting from ARRA awards to State agencies?
The website features an interactive map that displays state agency use of ARRA awards by geographic regions. The map, as well as other detailed information regarding ARRA awards to state agencies, is fed by real data directly updated monthly by state agencies through an innovative reporting system. The system enables agencies to directly report actual project expenditures to the public. This new system provides increased reliability and accuracy in reporting, keeping Utahns continually informed of how and where tax dollars are being spent.
The newly designed site partners with transparent.utah.gov, which was launched by Governor Herbert in 2008 to provide transaction-level information specific to ARRA awards.
