Utah's consensus revenue numbers were released today in cooperation with leaders from the Governor's Office of Management and Budget and the legislature.
"The revised revenue numbers released today show how a vibrant, growing and well-diversified economy is the best way to support our funding priorities," Gov. Herbert said. "I look forward to working with the legislature to assure that the majority of our surplus goes to supporting student learning and achievement."
The new consensus estimates provide a total of $375 million for additional ongoing appropriations, $88 million higher than the December estimates. In addition, $13 million is available for one-time appropriations, $12 million higher than December estimates.
