Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Nov. 10, 2011
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

In honor of Veterans Day tomorrow, the Governor's Office released the content of a candid conversation with Governor Gary R. Herbert about his past military service, his appreciation for those in uniform, and his commitment to ensure the State appropriately supports and honors veterans, not only on Veterans Day, but every day. "We cannot tell them thank you enough," the Governor said. "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
The Governor indicated the most difficult part of his job is calling the families of fallen soldiers. "I have been buoyed up many times by the families who say that their son or daughter was doing what they loved. They loved our country."
"I have a great appreciation for those who have served in the military," the Governor said. After describing his own service in the Utah National Guard, he referenced his father and grandfather's time in uniform. "We have had some of that history in our own family and it was nice for me to be able to at least have a little part of that tradition carried forward."
The complete content of the Governor's conversation about veterans and his own military service can be found on the Governor's blog: http://blog.governor.utah.gov/
Governor Herbert will participate in public events honoring veterans tomorrow, including a. ceremony in the Capitol Gold Room with Japanese-American veterans recently awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, a ceremony in the Capitol rotunda with Utah's Department of Veterans Affairs, and at Taylorsville's unveiling of the first phase of a new veterans memorial.
