By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 5, 2015
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Marty Carpenter, spokesman for Gov. Gary R. Herbert, issued the following statement in response to the House Business and Labor Committee vote on Healthy Utah:
"Healthy Utah is the best plan for taxpayers and the most practical alternative to Medicaid expansion. There is sharp contrast in terms of cost and coverage between the plans supported by the House committee and the Senate. The governor looks forward to working with the Legislature on a solution that best protects the interests of the Utah taxpayer and provides necessary coverage for Utahns in need."
