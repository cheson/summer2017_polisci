Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Oct. 12, 2011
Location: Blanding, UT

Governor Gary R. Herbert addressed high school students across the State of Utah today from the Utah State University extension in Blanding. In this first-ever broadcast of its kind, the Governor focused on the importance of post-secondary education.

"Education will open your minds and expand your horizons. It will help you discover your aptitudes and your interests," the Governor said. "Education will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to support yourselves and your future families. Education will provide you with a solid foundation for success in whatever you choose to pursue in your lives."

The Governor also accepted questions from students at four Utah high schools: Orem, Rich, Murray, and Emery. Topics ranged from the Governor's own high school experience to the need for better school counselors. Governor Herbert addressed the later by directing students to utahfutures.org, an online resource for school and career guidance. Students who register on the site in the next ten days and take the Governor's "Reality Check Challenge" assessment, are automatically entered into a drawing for one of a five Utah Educational savings plan accounts ranging from $1,000 to $100.
