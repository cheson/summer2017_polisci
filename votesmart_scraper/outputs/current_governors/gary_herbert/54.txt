Statement

Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement today regarding a multi-state lawsuit over the recent Department of Education and Department of Justice directive:
"This is another example of President Obama issuing a one-size-fits-all mandate when states and individual schools could best address the issue. Every Utah student should feel safe and be treated with dignity and respect. Local schools can and should work directly with parents and students to find appropriate, individualized solutions. It is unfortunate that the president has chosen to politicize our schools with such an extreme example of federal overreach. I look forward to working with other states to resolve this conflict in a way that respects the privacy of all Utah children."
