Public Statements
2015 State of the State Address
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Jan. 28, 2015
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Speaker Hughes, President Niederhauser, members of the Legislature, Lt. Governor and Mrs. Cox, Utah's First Lady, my wife Jeanette, and my fellow Utahns
I am pleased to join with you to report on the state of our state, though I do so with a heavy heart because of the recent loss of former House Speaker Becky Lockhart. She will be remembered as a talented legislator, a strong leader and as a dedicated public servant who made history as the first woman to preside over the Utah House of Representatives.
Our state is a better place because of her work in this chamber. On behalf of all Utahns, I express my condolences to her family, including her husband, Stan, and her daughter Hannah who are here with us tonight.
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. During that conflict, millions of Americans served and 407,000 gave their lives to defend our freedoms and safeguard the torch of liberty.
Today, we call these veterans "America's Greatest Generation." They weathered the Great Depression and fought and won the most consequential war the world has ever seen.
One of them is Casey Kunimura of North Ogden. He and other Americans of Japanese heritage served in the most decorated U.S. military unit in history, the Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team.
We are privileged this evening to have with us Master Sergeant Kunimura and his wife Dorothy.
Our World War II generation met the challenges of their time. While many served abroad, Utahns on the home front bought war bonds, planted victory gardens, and donated materials needed for the war effort. Everyone worked and sacrificed together to secure victory.
