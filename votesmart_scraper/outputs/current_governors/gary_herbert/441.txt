Governor Meets with Bond Rating Agencies in NYC Today
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Sept. 9, 2011
Location: New York City, NY

Today Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert met with the three major bond rating agencies in New York City. The courtesy stops were part of the Governor's larger focus on economic and business development, ensuring Utah is known as fertile ground for capital investment and job growth.

Following the meetings, the Governor said, "I am completely confident that Utah will continue to maintain our AAA rating. Wall Street appreciates that, in Utah, we're good stewards of taxpayer resources, we don't borrow or use federal funds to cover ongoing expenses, and we don't abuse our bonding authority to bankroll projects we can't afford long term. Utah is-and will continue to be-one of the safest places for investors."

To conclude the trip, the Governor has meetings scheduled in Washington, D.C., early next week with federal administrators and Utah's congressional delegation to push back on federal agency efforts to thwart state innovation and Utah solutions tailored to the state's unique needs.
