Hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee - "The Consequences of Obamacare: Impact on Medicaid and State Health Care Reform"
Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 1, 2011
Location: Washington, DC

Good morning. I am Gary R. Herbert, Governor of the State of Utah.
I would like to thank Congressman Upton and the other members of the committee for your invitation to testify.
Let me begin by stating that I am a firm believer in the principles of Federalism embodied in the 10th Amendment.
States are not powerless agents of federal authority. I believe that -- as Governor of the great State of Utah -- I should take every opportunity to assert the rightful authority of our state to
advance Utah solutions to Utah problems.
A balance of powers between the states and the federal government is not only right and proper, but essential if we are ever to find solutions to the complex problems we face.
Justice Louis Brandeis famously described states as laboratories which can engage in "Â…novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."
In Utah, we began our health system reform efforts five years ago, long before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act arrived on the scene. The lessons we've learned in our novel experiments in health system reform can serve as a guide to other states as they begin their own reform efforts. In fact, we have already been contacted by officials in numerous other states asking us to share our experiences with them.
The federal government has taken the opposite approach. The federal government decreed the one-size-fits-all law of the land, and has left to the states the details of how to shoehorn the Affordable Care Act's voluminous dictates and mandates into their agencies and budgets.
