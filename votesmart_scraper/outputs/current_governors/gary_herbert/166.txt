Gov. Gary Herbert joined Shoshone Tribal Chairman Jason Walker to dedicate a site commemorating Native American settlements at the Galena Preserve on Friday.
The site hosts a monument which consists of stone pedestals containing the tribal seals and stories of the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation, the Navajo Nation, the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation, the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, the San Juan Southern Paiute, the Ute Indian Tribe, the Ute Mountain Ute tribe and the Skull Valley Band of Goshute.
"This monument will stand as an enduring testament to the proud heritage of Utah's tribes," said Gov. Herbert. "Working together -- collaborating in good faith -- we can ensure that Utah's tribes and Native people will continue to stand strong and proud just like this monument."
One of Gov. Herbert's first acts as governor was to direct the state to execute a conservation easement to ensure protection for the 250 acres of the Galena Preserve. Now all who visit the land and use the trails can learn more about Utah's eight federally-recognized tribes.
The archeological site in the Galena Preserve is estimated to be more than 3,000 years old. The land along the Jordan River has been used by Native people for thousands of years for hunting, fishing, gathering, agriculture and dwelling.
