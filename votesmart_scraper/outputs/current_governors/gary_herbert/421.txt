The State of Utah has completed filing a series of Notices of Intent (NOI) to initiate litigation under the Quiet Title Act for 18,784 roads in 22 rural Utah counties. The NOIs were filed with the U.S. Department of Interior in anticipation of filing suit in federal court, as required by law.

"We have worked closely with the counties to protect title on these roads and rights of way for a number of years, but the federal government's inaction has forced us to litigate," said Governor Gary R. Herbert. "We will continue to use every tool available to us, including negotiation and lawsuits, to quickly and permanently get title to our roads. We are intent to defend our rights, and this filing will force the federal government to respond."

This filing marks a major milestone in the work of the Public Lands Policy Coordination Office (PLPCO), the Attorney General's Office, the counties, and the Utah Association of Counties to assert the State's rights with respect to accessing public lands under the provisions of R.S. 2477.

Of the 18,784 included in the filing, 2,190 are Class B roads, and 16,594 are Class D roads.

The State previously filed R.S. 2477 lawsuits over 94 roads in Garfield County on November 14, and 710 roads in Kane County on November 10 and lawsuits in Juab, Emery and San Juan Counties several years ago.
