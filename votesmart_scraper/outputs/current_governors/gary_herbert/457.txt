Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert issued a statement about today's action in U.S. District Court where Judge Clark Waddoups issued a temporary restraining order preventing Utah's 2011 HB497 from taking effect.

"Utah's Attorney General and State Legislature worked hard to craft a bill that would withstand constitutional scrutiny," the Governor said. "Utah will have ample opportunity in court to demonstrate this bill is on solid footing. Until then, we will adhere to the Court's temporary restraining order."

The temporary restraining order is in place until the Court has an opportunity to receive briefing and argument on the ACLU's motion for preliminary injunction. In effect, the State of Utah cannot enforce the law until July 14 when the Court will hear argument on whether the Court should issue a preliminary injunction preventing the law from having any effect while the case is pending.

The Court made no ruling on the Constitutionality of the bill. The Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety has been notified that the law cannot be enforced right now.
