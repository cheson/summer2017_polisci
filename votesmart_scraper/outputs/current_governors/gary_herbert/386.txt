To honor those who have served the nation in the armed forces and particularly those who have given their all, Governor Gary R. Herbert today called on Utahns statewide to fly the nation's flag for Memorial Day.
"The freedoms we enjoy are not free. They were paid for with the blood of those in bygone battles, both at home and abroad, and are paid for by the sacrifice of those in uniform today," said the Governor. "I wholeheartedly encourage Utahns statewide to fly the colors of our nation this Memorial Day in gratitude for the noble service rendered by so many who defend our country, and most especially for those who have rendered the ultimate sacrifice to ensure we remain free. Let us demonstrate the honor and respect due. Let us never forget the price paid on our behalf."
In recognition of Memorial Day, the Governor authorized the lowering of the flag of the United States of America at state facilities on Monday, May 28, 2012. The Governor is also scheduled to pay tribute to veterans and fallen soldiers tomorrow at a ceremony at the Veterans Memorial Cemetery, Utah State Veterans Memorial Park, 17111 South Camp Williams Road, in Bluffdale at 10:00 a.m. The ceremony will be hosted by the Utah Dept. of Veterans Affairs.
