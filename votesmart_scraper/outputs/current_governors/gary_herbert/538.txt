Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Prominent Utahn Ted Wilson has accepted Governor Gary R. Herbert's invitation to join the Governor's staff as a senior advisor on environmental matters.
Among Wilson's duties will be heading the newly created Governor's Balanced Resource Council, which will prioritize and recommend action on a number of issues, such as public lands policy, water and air quality issues, and other areas impacting Utah's natural resources.
"We are bringing people together from diverse backgrounds and points of view to find solutions to the issues facing Utah," Governor Herbert said. "It is time to put an end to the paralysis that comes from constant bickering and to make substantial policy decisions on these important matters."
Several people have agreed to volunteer their time as council members, including State Representative Mike Noel, San Juan County Commissioner Lynn Stevens, and Pat Shea and Kathleen Clarke, former directors of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively.
"This group will provide a wealth of knowledge, experience and perspective to the council," the Governor said. "This unique partnership will establish sound processes to address matters that have sat stagnant for too long."
Other members include the following members of the Governor's Cabinet: Leonard Blackham, executive director of the Department of Agriculture; Amanda Smith, executive director of the Department of Environmental Quality; Michael Styler, executive director of the Department of
Natural Resources; Dianne Nielsen, the Governor's energy policy coordinator; and John Harja, the state's public lands policy coordinator.
