Gov. Gary R. Herbert will reach out to military veterans as part of "Call Your Military Hero Day," tomorrow. The governor encourages all Utahns to take the time to do the same.
Thurs., July 3, 2014, was designated as "Call Your Military Hero Day" during this past legislative session. The resolution urges Utah's citizens to reach out to military veterans and active duty military personnel to establish and strengthen bonds of friendship.
"As we get ready to celebrate our nation's birth on July 4th, we have a great opportunity to connect with the men and women who sacrifice for the freedoms we enjoy," said Gov. Herbert. "I urge all Utahns to reach out and thank our veterans and those currently serving for their selfless service."
In Utah there are currently 9,000 veterans who served in World War II, 14,000 in Korea, over 45,000 in Vietnam, over 50,000 in Iraq or Afghanistan and over 30,000 during the Cold War.
"Utah is a very patriotic state, and over 150,000 veterans and thousands more guardsmen, reservists and active duty personnel call our great state home," said Gary R. Harter, executive director for the Utah Department of Veterans and Military Affairs. "It is good for us to reach out to them to say thanks and remember they are the ones who protect and serve us."
The governor has made a significant effort to boost employment opportunities for veterans. The Utah unemployment rate for veterans has decreased by 2.5 percent over the past year, falling from 7.2 percent in 2013 to 4.7 percent in 2014. There are over 7,400 veterans using their educational benefits at academic institutions across Utah.
