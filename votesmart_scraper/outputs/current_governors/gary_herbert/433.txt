Utah's online voter registration program, voter.utah.gov, was recognized as a top government-to-citizen website by the Center for Digital Government. Online Voter Registration is one of hundreds of services available online via Utah.Gov, the official website for the state of Utah.

"Voter registration is one of the most beneficial services the State of Utah can offer online," said Governor Gary Herbert. "It makes political participation easier and saves the taxpayer dollars. This award is another honor that demonstrates Utah leads out in connecting government to its citizens."

To increase voter participation, Utah's Lt. Governor Greg Bell, in conjunction with the county clerks, implemented an online voter registration program that launched in June 2010. Registration is quick and simple. At voter.utah.gov you can register to vote, or update your address and party affiliation information. Driver license applicants are connected directly to the online service. The site also integrates social media upon completion; new voters can share with their Twitter followers or Facebook friends a link back to the voter registration page. So far over 18,000 voters have used the site.

"We are honored to receive a Digital Government Achievement Award," said Lt. Governor Greg Bell. "As increasing voter participation has been a top initiative of our office, we are pleased to be recognized for our efforts. We simplified the process so that we can get citizens to the polls, while providing a large cost saving mechanism to state and local governments."

The state of Utah is proud to offer this valuable service to the public as part of the many award-winning services. To find a complete list of awards please visit utah.gov/awards.
