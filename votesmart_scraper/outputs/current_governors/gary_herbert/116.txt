In honor of the lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001 and as a tribute to the heroes who came to our country's aid, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert has authorized the lowering of the flag of the United States of America and the great State of Utah at all state facilities, Friday, Sept. 11, 2015 in observance of "Patriot's Day."
"Tomorrow we will pause to remember the lives lost, the families who survived and the thousands of police, fire and military emergency and construction workers who courageously responded 14 years ago," Gov. Herbert said. "As we observe the anniversary of 9/11, let us rededicate ourselves to the principles of freedom and recommit ourselves to uplift, help and strengthen others."
