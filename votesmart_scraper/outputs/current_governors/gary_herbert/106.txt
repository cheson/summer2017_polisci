Utah posted the highest job growth rate in the nation for private and total job growth for the eighth consecutive month. According to the rankings released this month, Utah posted private sector growth at 4.4 percent and total sector job growth at 3.9 percent for the month of September.
"Great things are happening in Utah," said Gov. Herbert. "The state's fundamentals are strong and our future is bright. Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced Utah is the "most fundamentally sound state' in the nation. In addition, Utah was given an A+ grade in financial literacy for our public schools. Our productive, prepared, and skilled labor force explains why we have such a fundamentally sound economy."
