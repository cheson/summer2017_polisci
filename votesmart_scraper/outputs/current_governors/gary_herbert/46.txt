After serving 18 years in state government and nearly 10 years as a member of Gov. Herbert's Cabinet, Kim Hood is retiring on July 1, 2016.
"I thank Gov. Herbert for his leadership and for giving me this opportunity," Hood said. "Defining the culture of the department by institutionalizing its mission, vision and values is among my greatest achievements. The department is on solid ground and has an incredible workforce of professionals. It was my pleasure to act as their leader."
Hood's achievements include creating a shared services operations model as well as a shared services center for budget and accounting. She implemented a program throughout the department to identify risks and opportunities to the department's overarching goals. The Department of Administrative Services made significant improvement under Hood's leadership in terms of efficiency and effectiveness of operations, developing the workforce, customer satisfaction, and cyber and emergency preparedness.
"Kim's exceptional leadership will be missed in state government," Gov. Herbert said. "I have always appreciated her ability to deliver high-quality and cost-effective results to the people of Utah."
The governor has appointed Kenneth A. Hansen to serve as interim executive director. He brings more than 35 years of experience in state government to this new role. He has been serving as the DAS deputy executive director for the past year. Prior to that, he served as the director of the Division of Administrative Rules.
"I appreciate Gov. Herbert giving me this opportunity and I look forward to serving the employees of the department, the department's customers, and the citizens of the state as interim executive director," Hansen said.
