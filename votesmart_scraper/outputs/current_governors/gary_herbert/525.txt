Statement

Date: March 4, 2010
Location: Topeka, KS

Governors Mark Parkinson of Kansas, John Baldacci of Maine, Chet Culver of Iowa, Chris Gregoire of Washington, Gary Herbert of Utah, Ted Kulongoski of Oregon and Jodi Rell from Connecticut issued the following statement regarding Boeing's announcement that it will use its 767 platform in their bid for the Air Force tanker contract:
"We applaud Boeing for choosing the 767 platform for its proposal for the Air Force's next mid-air refueling tanker.
"The 767 is a proven model, built at facilities with the world's best workforce, and is more efficient than any model that will be proposed by its competitors. This announcement confirms what the members of the U.S. Tanker 2010 Coalition have been saying - the Boeing proposal will give our men and women in the military the best tankers at the fairest price to the taxpayer, and will create the most jobs here in America.
"Boeing has a history of delivering to the Air Force top quality tankers with incredibly long useful lives. At this time, when we need jobs in this country so badly, buying tankers from a proven vendor that will create or retain over 40,000 America jobs simply makes sense."
The U.S. Tanker 2010 coalition is a bi-partisan effort of elected officials, business and labor organizations committed to ensuring the bid selected is the one that can produce the best product for the Air Force, will create the most American jobs and wisely spends taxpayer dollars.
