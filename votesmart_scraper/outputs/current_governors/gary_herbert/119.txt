Location: Salt Lake City, UT

A story in the August 29, 2015 edition of the Salt Lake Tribune indicated that unnamed state lawmakers had proposed raising the sales tax on food in order to finance the Utah Cares Plus alternative to Medicaid expansion. The idea has never been mentioned or considered in the Group of Six discussions.
"Raising the sales tax on food to pay for this program is a non-starter," Gov. Gary R. Herbert said. "At no point in time has this idea ever been discussed, and I would vigorously oppose any efforts to consider its implementation."
