Gov. Gary R. Herbert has appointed Kate A. Toomey to fill a vacancy on the Utah Court of Appeals.
"I have full confidence in Judge Toomey's ability to uphold the highest principles of justice and serve the people with dedication and integrity," said Gov. Herbert. "Having served on the bench for over seven years, Judge Toomey is experienced, respected and will add exceptional value to the Court of Appeals."
Toomey currently serves as a judge on the Third Judicial District Court for Tooele, Salt Lake and Summit Counties, and was appointed to the bench in January 2007. Prior to serving on the bench, Toomey cultivated opportunities for appellate practice and training at the Utah State Bar by serving as deputy counsel in the Office of Professional Conduct (2000-06), and assistant counsel in the Office of Professional Conduct (1996-2000). She also served as an assistant public defender for the Maryland Public Defender's Office and as a judicial clerk for the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.
"I am honored by the governor's appointment, and by his confidence in me," said Toomey. "I look forward to continuing to serve the people of Utah."
Currently, Toomey serves on the Grand Jury Panel of Judges, the Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on Professionalism, the Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on the Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Board of District Court Judges.
Subject to Senate confirmation, Toomey will fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Judge B. Carolyn McHugh on March 17, 2014.
