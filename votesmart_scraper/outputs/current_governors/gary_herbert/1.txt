Wasatch Resource Recovery Groundbreaking

Yesterday, Governor Gary R. Herbert participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for Utah's first anaerobic digestion facility for processing food waste. Using the latest technologies available, the facility will begin turning our garbage into clean, renewable energy for Utah's communities by fall of 2018.
Once the facility opens, Wasatch Resource Recovery will process materials from across the Wasatch Front, ranging from food and beverages to manufacturing waste. Instead of heading to landfills, these expired items will be sent to this plant, which will convert the materials into clean energy.
This North Salt Lake center comes as the result of an exciting public-private partnership between ALPRO Energy & Water and the South Davis Sewer District, with a full endorsement and significant support of the Governor's Office of Energy Development (OED).
At the ceremony, Governor Herbert commended Wasatch Resource Recovery's founders on their dedication to innovation, Utah's future, and the environment. He then ceremonially broke ground on the building site along with North Salt Lake Mayor Leonard Arave, Senator Todd Weiler, Bruce Alder, developer of the project and owner of Alder Construction, Dal Waymant, manager of the South Davis Sewer District, and Dr. Laura Nelson, executive director of OED. Numerous other city council members and lawmakers also participated in the event, lending their support to this exciting new project.
