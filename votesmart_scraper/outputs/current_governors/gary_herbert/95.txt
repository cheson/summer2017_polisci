Â­Jon Cox, spokesman for Gov. Gary R. Herbert, issued the following statement in response to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in the Planned Parenthood lawsuit:
"The governor is confident that once the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals has the opportunity to look closely at the legal issues in this case, like Judge Waddoups, they will reach the same decision and agree that it is contrary to the public's best interest to remove the governor's discretion to make contract decisions on behalf of the state."
