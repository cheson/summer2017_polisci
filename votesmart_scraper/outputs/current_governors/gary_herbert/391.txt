Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Today, Governor Gary R. Herbert hosted a summit of Intermountain West governors, dubbed the Rocky Mountain Roundtable. Governor Herbert hosted Governor Butch Otter of Idaho and Governor Matt Mead of Wyoming at the Governor's Mansion. Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada joined the discussion via telephone.
"Intermountain West states share many of the same concerns and opportunities," said Governor Herbert. "The Rocky Mountain Roundtable has given us an opportunity to have an open discussion to learn from one another, and find areas where we can move forward with cooperative efforts and a common voice."
"Rocky Mountain states are leading the nation in finding solutions to many of the problems faced by the entire country," said Governor Mead. "Meetings between the governors allow us to identify things each state is doing well, where each state can improve, and what we can do better collectively."
"I like to think there is great virtue in western thinking, but it does not always translate on the national scene," said Governor Otter. "If I can put my voice together with those of my fellow governors - and join our voices with those of our respective federal delegations - we can create a chorus that cannot be ignored."
The meeting covered a range of topics of concern to Intermountain West states, including: public lands, natural resource development, energy generation and transmission, economic development, water rights, federal regulations, endangered species, invasive species, technology innovation, and the Western Governors Association.
