Governor Joins Local Boy Scouts to Fight Hunger
Press Release

Gov. Gary Herbert joined the Utah Food Bank and Boy Scouts of America to kick off the 29th annual Scouting For Food drive. Scouting for Food is an annual event in which more than 55,000 Utah Boy Scouts go door-to-door to collect food items for the Utah Food Bank.
"Hunger is a problem that affects everyone, not just the homeless," said Gov. Herbert. "These individuals and families are our friends, neighbors, and people we care about."
Gov. Herbert signed a declaration for Scouting for Food Day in Utah and donated the first box of food to the drive.
He was joined by Utah National Guard Adjutant General Jefferson Burton, Eagle Scout Lincoln Feist and local Cub Scouts from troop 3020.
The governor reminded Utahns that now is a crucial time to donate food because supplies are dwindling and food banks and other relief agencies may experience shortages of food during warmer months.
"Utah is known for being a charitable state, but sometimes we forget to be generous after the winter holiday season ends," he said. "People are still hungry once the weather warms up. Your contributions will make a difference."
