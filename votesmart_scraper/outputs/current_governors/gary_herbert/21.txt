Governor Gary R. Herbert and First Lady Jeanette Herbert witnessed the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States, and issued the following statement:
Jeanette and I were honored to watch as the President and Vice President took their oaths of office this afternoon and swore to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States and the freedoms we hold sacred.
I was proud of the stunning musical performance from Utah's own Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and I am grateful for the service provided by the Utah Highway Patrol throughout the Inauguration.
The peaceful and dignified transition of the enormous power that we the people entrust in our president is a hallmark of our democracy. I have some modest appreciation for how humbling it can be to assume the helm of the executive functions of government. I therefore offer my heartfelt prayers for the success of this new administration. I pray that they will have an extra measure of guidance in their decisionmaking.
It is in our best interest that we pull together, set aside differences and work to see that this, the greatest nation on earth, continues to enjoy protection and prosperity. I look forward to working with the new administration and wish them every success as they labor on behalf of the American people. We here in Utah, stand ready, willing, and able to assist.
