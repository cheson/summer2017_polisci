Governor Terry McAuliffe issued Executive Order #59 today declaring a state of emergency in order to allow for a state response to prevent gasoline shortages following the temporary shutdown of Colonial Pipeline's main lines in Shelby County, Alabama.
"This Executive Order will enable Virginia to prevent any potential disruption to gasoline supplies as a result of the temporary shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline," Governor McAuliffe said. "This is a proactive step to protect Virginia citizens and businesses by ensuring that companies can bring in the gasoline supplies they need to offset any shortages that may arise as a result of this event."
Executive Order #59 waives certain state and federal regulations limiting the number of hours motor fuel carrier drivers can drive per week. This flexibility allows truck drivers to alleviate potential supply shortages caused by the temporary shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline.
