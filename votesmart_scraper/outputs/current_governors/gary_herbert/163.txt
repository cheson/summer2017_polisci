On the final day of the bill signing period, Gov. Gary R. Herbert took action on the remaining 16 bills, signing eight, vetoing five and allowing three to go into law without his signature. In total, 528 bills were passed during the 2015 General Legislative Session of which 495 required action by the governor.
"I believe it is more productive to work on bills with the Legislature during the session so the bills that come to my desk are more likely to be signed into law," said Gov. Herbert. "Overall, I am very pleased with the results of this session. Working together for the good of the people of our state is the Utah way."
Among the bills vetoed by the governor is HB385, Memorial Highway Designation. This bill would have designated a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 15 in honor of former House Speaker, the late Becky Lockhart. The entirety of I-15 in Utah is currently designated as Veterans Memorial Highway.
"This afternoon, I received a phone call from Stan Lockhart who requested I veto the bill and I have opted to honor his wishes," said Gov. Herbert. "While I am disappointed by the controversy that seemed to diminish the Legislature's recognition of Speaker Lockhart, I am committed to working with lawmakers and the Lockhart family to find an appropriate memorial to honor the memory of this historic leader."
The governor also vetoed three line items in SB3, Appropriations Adjustments. The legislation authorizing these expenses was not enacted.
