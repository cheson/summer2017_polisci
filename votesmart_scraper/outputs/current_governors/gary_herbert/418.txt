Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert has issued the following message to all Utahns this holiday season:

"This is one of my favorite times of year. The music, the lights, the food-all evoke sentimental feelings and treasured memories. Perhaps most of all, it is a wonderful season for perspective.

"To paraphrase the sage and beloved Dr. Seuss, the holiday season is not ultimately about presents, ribbons, and tags; it is not about packages, boxes, or bags. The holiday season is about family and friends, gathering together to celebrate the traditions that define us and strengthen the bonds that unite us. Most importantly, it is a time to extend ourselves to others, especially those who are in need, those who may be forgotten, or those who find themselves alone during this time of gathering.

"Whatever one's religious or cultural beliefs, my prayer for all Utahns and our nation is that we reach out to those who need our friendship and love, that we extend a kind hand and lift up one another. May we all reflect on those things which are truly important and be grateful for the abundance we enjoy. To again borrow from Dr. Seuss, may our hearts grow 'three sizes.'

"On behalf my wife, Jeanette, and the entire Herbert family, I extend my warmest wishes to all Utahns for a Merry Christmas, a joyful holiday season and a prosperous new year."
