Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed an additional 86 bills today, bringing the total number of bills the governor has taken action on from the 2015 General Legislative Session to 397. The Legislature passed 528 bills this session, 495 of which require action by the governor.
Among those signed are three veteran-related bills: SCR 6, Concurrent Resolution Supporting Vietnam Veterans; HB 275, Highway Designation Amendments; and SB 214, Veterans Court. The bills recognize, honor and support the men and women who served in Vietnam.
"We can't thank our veterans enough," said Gov. Herbert. "We want to honor our brave Utah men and women in uniform who fought so bravely in the Vietnam War. They have returned with honor and now have some challenges. We want to help them with treatment and rehabilitation."
The Gov. also signed three Native American-related bills during a special ceremony today: SB90, Utah Navajo Royalties Amendments; SCR2, Concurrent Resolution Regarding Navajo Water Rights Settlement; and HB33, American Indian-Alaskan Native Education Amendments, which establishes a commission comprised of state and tribal leaders to formulate a statewide Native education plan to increase educational outcomes of our Native students.
"All too often, our Native American students lag behind their counterparts in education attainment," said Gov. Herbert. "HB33 represents a positive first step to closing that achievement gap and ensuring that our Native students have the education and training they need to succeed."
