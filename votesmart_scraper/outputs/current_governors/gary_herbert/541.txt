Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Sept. 24, 2009
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Governor Gary R. Herbert will meet this Friday with local officials and residents about a draft agreement for the management of groundwater in the Snake Valley area.
"This is an issue of critical importance to all Utahns - particularly the residents in this part of the State," Governor Herbert said. "It is vital that we listen to them and fully understand their points of view when determining whether to sign the proposed agreement with the State of Nevada."
The Governor will attend the first meeting of the newly appointed Snake Valley Aquifer Advisory Council tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. at the Border Inn near Garrison, Utah. The Council was created during the 2009 legislative session by HB120, sponsored by Rep. Brad Winn.
Governor Herbert will then travel to Delta, where he will visit with the presidents and boards of several area irrigation companies and then participate in a community meeting with area residents at 5:30 p.m. The hour-long meeting will take place at the Millard County Fair Building in Delta.
The proposed Snake Valley agreement establishes a cooperative relationship between Utah and Nevada regarding the allocation and management of groundwater resources in the Snake Valley, which straddles the state line.
