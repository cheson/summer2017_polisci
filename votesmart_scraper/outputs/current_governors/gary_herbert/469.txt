Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: April 7, 2011
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Governor Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement regarding today's Lonnie Johnson hearing:

"I am outraged that a convicted child sex offender, currently facing another round of accusations, could be released without being tried for current charges. That is not justice. When it comes to the safety of our children, there is no margin for legal contortions or equivocation. We owe it to our children to make sure it never happens again. It's outrageous for both the victims and the accused that Mr. Johnson won't get his day in court."
