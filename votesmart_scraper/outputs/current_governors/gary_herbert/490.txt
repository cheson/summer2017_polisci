Press Release

Date: Jan. 31, 2011
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Just after 8 a.m. this morning Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert signed the official certificate appointing Holly Richardson of Pleasant Grove to fill the seat for House District 57. Surrounded by her family in the Gold Room of the Utah State Capitol, Richardson said she was excited to begin her service in the Utah House of Representatives.

"I know Holly to be a hard worker and a strong voice for conservative values," said Governor Herbert. "She will represent her district well." Before signing official documents, the Governor took time to tell the Richardson family of a recent visit with Chinese dignitaries where those visiting officials told him he has many freedoms. The Governor encouraged the more than 20 family members, all dressed in black and pink, to appreciate the freedoms they have.

Per Utah State Code, Richardson was nominated by Republican delegates in House District 57 in caucus last Saturday.
