Date: April 2, 2014
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

The Governor's Mansion will glow blue Wed. night, April 2, in support for World Autism Awareness Day.
"Jeanette and I extend our love to those individuals and families who face the difficult challenges associated with autism," said Gov. Herbert. "Increased awareness and research will give light to new technologies and advancements. Together we advocate for change that will improve lives."
Autism is one of the fastest growing developmental disabilities in the United States, affecting one in 68 American children. A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study reports that Utah's autism rate is even higher--affecting one in 54 Utah children, a rate down from one in 47 in 2008.
Non-profit organizations, like Autism Speaks, have made great strides in advocating for those affected by autism. Gov. Herbert recognizes continued developmental research and community support are crucial for innovation in treatments and therapies.
The governor will hold a ceremonial bill signing of S.B. 57 (Autism Services Amendments) and H.B. 88 (Autism Program Amendments) in the Capitol Gold Room on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. Media are welcome to attend.
