Governor Gary R. Herbert honored Utah's fallen soldiers and their families Friday during a special tribute at the State Capitol.
"Of all my duties as Governor, I would be hard-pressed to name another more significant than honoring those whose sacrifices have helped make our freedoms possible, as well as to salute their families" said Gov. Herbert. "America and our great state of Utah are far better for their service and sacrifice. May we always remember and honor those who we celebrate today."
Utah lost 18 soldiers due to accidents, illnesses and suicides in 2014. There were no combat-related deaths last year.
Maj. Gen. Jefferson Burton and Dept. of Veterans and Military Affairs Executive Director Gary Harter joined Gov. Herbert. The event was coordinated by Rep. Justin Fawson.
