Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 27, 2015
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed an additional 50 bills into law bringing the total number of bills the governor has taken action on from the 2015 General Legislative Session to 252. That total now includes two bills signed during the session that were omitted from previous counts. The Legislature passed 528 bills this session, 495 of which require action by the governor.
Among the bills signed by the governor today is HB 199, Pilot Program for Assistance for Children. This bill directs the Department of Health to apply for a Medicaid waiver to cover the cost of care for children with serious disabilities and complex medical conditions.
"Families facing challenges associated with serious disabilities and medical conditions should be able to access the care they need without going bankrupt," said Gov. Herbert. "Utahns believe in helping those in need and this bill should provide some much needed relief."
The governor also signed SB 65, In-state Tuition for Families of Fallen Public Safety Officers. This bill grants in-state tuition rates to the surviving family members of a police officer or firefighter killed in the line of duty.
"It is appropriate for our state to offer in-state tuition to those who have lost a parent in the line of duty," said Gov. Herbert. "Education is critical to the economic future of these children and this policy will help them contribute to the economic strength of our state."
