Governor's Response to Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals Ruling
Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: June 25, 2014
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

In response to the decision issued on the state's appeal to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, Gov. Gary R. Herbert released the following statement:
"I am disappointed with the decision from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in regards to same-sex marriage. I believe states have the right to determine their laws regarding marriage. I am grateful the Court issued a stay to allow time to analyze the decision and our options. But as I have always said, all Utahns deserve clarity and finality regarding same-sex marriage and that will only come from the Supreme Court."
The governor will be available for a brief media availability at 1:45 p.m. at the Utah State Capitol in the Gold Room.
