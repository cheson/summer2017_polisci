Press Release

Date: Sept. 11, 2014
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

On the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Gov. Gary Herbert visited the National September 11 Memorial and Museum in New York City to honor the victims and heroes lost that day.
"It is an honor to be here on this special day. I am grateful for the opportunity to pay my respects and to do so on behalf of the people of Utah," said the governor. "This is hallowed ground. Though we continue to fight against terrorists and those who are enemies of freedom today, we all benefit from the love, patriotism and spirit of community that were strengthened in the aftermath."
The governor laid a wreath by the Survivor Tree at the memorial. The tree survived the attacks after spending a month buried in rubble. While in Washington, D.C. yesterday, the governor visited the Pentagon Memorial where he laid a wreath in honor of those who were lost on Sept. 11, 2001.
