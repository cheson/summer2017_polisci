In response to the U. S. Supreme Court's decision to hear the same-sex marriage case from the 6th Circuit that upheld bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement:
"As I have said all along, I believe states should have the right to determine their own laws regarding marriage and I am pleased the U.S. Supreme Supreme Court has decided to hear the same-sex marriage case. The people of Utah, and people across the country, deserve certainty and finality with respect to the law. In this case, that finality can only come from the nation's highest court."
"As this case progresses, I once again encourage all Utahns - regardless of their personal views on this matter - to treat each other with respect."
