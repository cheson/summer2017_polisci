The holiday shopping season is set to begin and retailers are counting on big sales to end the year. To recognize and support small businesses in Utah, Gov. Gary R. Herbert has declared Nov. 29 "Small Business Saturday." This is part of a nationwide effort to encourage holiday shoppers to buy locally in their own communities.
"Small businesses are critical to Utah's economy," said Gov. Herbert. "They create jobs, fuel additional business and generate revenue in communities throughout our state. I am proud Utah is one of the most small-business-friendly states in our country. Having operated my own real estate firm, I appreciate our entrepreneurs and invite all Utahns to shop at local businesses not only on Small Business Saturday but throughout the year."
Founded in 2010, Small Business Saturday helps neighborhood stores, restaurants and other local businesses to rally residents to celebrate the small businesses in their communities.
According to the Utah Small Business Administration, two-thirds of all Utah employees work for small businesses. By shopping and doing business in their own neighborhoods, Utahns support businessmen and women who are their neighbors and friends, further strengthening our economy.
