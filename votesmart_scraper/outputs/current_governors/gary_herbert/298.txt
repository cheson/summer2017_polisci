Press Release

Date: Oct. 15, 2013
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Today Governor Gary R. Herbert announced the creation of the Clean Air Action Team (CAAT). This group of diverse individuals will gather research, work with the public and recommend practical and effective strategies to improve Utah's air quality. Members of the CAAT come from the legislature, healthcare community, industry, local businesses, advocacy groups, and research institutions, representing various perspectives on air quality.
"The Action Team's recommendations will cover the gamut - everything from regulation, legislation, education, research and transportation," said the Governor. "I want to assure you that no possible solution will be left unturned."
Clean air is essential for our health, economy and quality of life. Utah's air quality, while largely impacted by topography and seasonal factors, is everyone's responsibility. To that end, the Clean Air Action Team will review and recommend regulatory or statutory remedies to policymakers to improve Utah's air quality statewide.
