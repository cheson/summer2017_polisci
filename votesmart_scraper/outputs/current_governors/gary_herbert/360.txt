Gov. Gary Herbert has made energy production one of his top priorities, saying innovation and initiative are the keys to energy independence.
Today, Gov. Mitt Romney introduced an energy plan that would call for states to play a larger role in energy resource development and would achieve North American energy independence by 2020.
"States must play an significant role in unleashing America's energy potential," said Gov. Herbert. "Gov. Romney's plan to achieve North American energy independence by 2020 is the perfect combination of bold leadership from the federal government coupled with increased local control."
Utah is ahead of the game when it comes to developing its energy resource. Gov. Herbert has laid out a 10-year energy plan to ensure Utah's continued access to its own low-cost energy sources. Utah energy prices are currently 31 percent below the national average. The Governor has set the goal for the state to produce 25 percent more electrical energy than it consumes by 2020.
The plan also calls for expanded, responsible development of Utah's energy resources, including traditional fuels, alternative fuels, and renewable fuels. Cutting through the red tape for permitting energy production on public lands is also key to achieving energy independence.
"As governor of an energy-producing state, I understand the importance of responsibly developing our energy resources," said Gov. Herbert. "I applaud Gov. Romney for making this important issue a top priority."
