Gov. Herbert and Mrs. Herbert visit with JetBlue founder and Utah son David Neeleman at the Azul Airlines facility in São Paulo. Neeleman founded Azul Airlines just six years ago, and it is already the third-largest airline in Brazil.
Gov. Herbert is in Brazil with Utah business leaders to deliver a simple message: Utah is open for business. The governor will be on the trade mission through early next week and will make stops in both São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
The governor, along with the Governor's Office of Economic Development, is meeting with local dignitaries and government officials to find opportunities for Utah businesses to enter and expand into Latin America's most powerful economy.
He will also participate in one-on-one meetings with Brazilian companies looking to partner with Utah and present a tourism seminar to cultivate Brazilian investment in the State.
"Utah is the nation's most pro-business state and home to more than 12,000 native Brazilians and 30,000 fluent Portuguese speakers," said Gov. Herbert. "Utah's unique business environment is like a tailor-made suit for Brazilian business."
Today, the governor met with with JetBlue founder and Utah son David Neeleman at the Azul Airlines facility in São Paulo. Neeleman founded Azul Airlines just six years ago, and it is already the third-largest airline in Brazil. He will advise members of the trade mission on entering into the Brazilian market and the logistical aspects of Brazilian business.
Tomorrow, Gov. Herbert and the Office of Tourism will host a seminar highlighting Utah's iconic Mighty Five national parks and world famous ski resorts, to increase travel to the State by Brazil's rapidly expanding middle class.
