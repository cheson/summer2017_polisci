Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement regarding the passing of former Utah Gov. Norman H. Bangerter:
"Gov. Bangerter was first and foremost a friend and a mentor to me. He was a great leader who accomplished great things on behalf of our state. I always appreciated his forthright and no-nonsense leadership and his willingness to make the tough decisions.
"That leadership was on display as recently as this past Thurs. when Gov. Bangerter spoke to the leadership of the Utah Highway Patrol, our Honorary Colonels, and many other civic and legislative leaders at the Governor's Mansion. As that evening concluded, I told Gov. Bangerter I valued his counsel and that I wanted him to call me at any time and give me his input. He assured me he would. His sudden passing is a shock to me and the state. We will all miss him.
"The First Lady and I extend our deepest condolences to members of the Bangerter family, and express gratitude on behalf of all Utahns for his service to the state as governor, as a legislator and as Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives."
