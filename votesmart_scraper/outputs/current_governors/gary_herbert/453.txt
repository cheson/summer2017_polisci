According to a report released today by the Department of the Interior, Utah's economy benefits more than any other state from tourism and recreational activities on Interior-managed land. The report states that more than 20,000 jobs and $1.7 billion in economic output in 2010 were supported by Utah's federal lands.
"I've always said we have a beautiful state, with stunning views and vistas. Our scenery alone makes Utah a highly desirable place to visit," the Governor said. "One of the key reasons Utah is leading the nation out of the recession is the diversity of our economy. Outdoor recreation is one of our seven key economic clusters or areas of focus. This report confirms that the multiple use of our public lands is beneficial in many ways."
