Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 24, 2015
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed 42 bills today, bringing the total number of bills signed from the 2015 General Legislative Session to 144.
Among those signed were HB 378, White Collar Crime Registry and HB 415, Regulation of Electronic Cigarettes. HB 378 authorizes the attorney general to develop and operate a Utah White Collar Crime Offender registry, which will be made available to the public.
"Whether a criminal wears a white collar or a blue collar, I am a strong supporter of protecting the consumer and the public from fraud and predatory practices," said Gov. Herbert. "This bill helps us do that and I'm proud to sign it."
HB 415 places state restrictions on the selling or distribution of electronic cigarette products. It allows the Dept. of Health to determine product quality, nicotine content, and packaging and labeling standards.
"Electronic cigarettes contain nicotine and other harmful, addictive substances," said Gov. Herbert. "As marketing and sales of e-cigarettes increase, taxation and regulations similar to those imposed on traditional tobacco products should be enforced to protect public health."
