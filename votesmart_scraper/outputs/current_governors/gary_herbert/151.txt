Gov. Gary R. Herbert has declared May 17-23, 2015 Utah Energy Development Week to recognize the state's energy development and critical energy resources.
"Energy is among the top issues of our time," said Gov. Herbert. "We need diverse, affordable and reliable energy resources that continue to expand with Utah's growing population and economy. This week provides an opportunity to recognize people and businesses that advance our energy development and to engage with them in important energy resource discussions."
Utah is privileged to host both the annual meeting of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission and the fourth annual Governor's Utah Energy Development Summit this week. The commission and summit position Utah at the heart of the national energy policy discussion and advance the dialogue on critical issues facing the nation.
The state of Utah is fortunate to be home to vast and diverse energy resources which not only include a variety of conventional and alternative resources but also opportunities for energy efficiency and conservation. The energy industry in Utah alone creates $21 billion in economic activity, representing a significant, and by its very nature, foundational piece of Utah's broader economy.
Utah recognizes the importance of the energy industry and applauds the contributions of skilled workers in the field who extract and deliver energy resources as well as the efforts of regulators and other professionals in ensuring safe, reliable, adequate and reasonably priced utility services.
