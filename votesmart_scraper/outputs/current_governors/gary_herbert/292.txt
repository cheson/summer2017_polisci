New figures released today by the Dept. of Workforce Services show Utah's unemployment rate dropped to 4.3 percent, that figure is significantly lower than the national average and ranks Utah fourth lowest among all states. Utah's private sector job growth remains second in the nation, with nearly all private sector industries showing year-over growth.
"We continue to head in the right direction with unemployment dropping again this month," said Governor Gary R. Herbert. "I am particularly encouraged by our job growth in the private sector."
Utah added approximately 27,900 jobs to the economy compared to November 2012, growing at a rate of 2.2 percent. Nearly all sectors of the economy are growing, with government being the most notable exception.
"As Utahns, we have a lot to be grateful for, but I continue to be mindful of those who want to work but can't find a job," said the Governor. "Particularly during this holiday season, I encourage everyone who is able, to find someone in need and do what they can to help."
"Utah's private sector job growth and low unemployment rate continue to be among the best in the nation," said Chief Economist Juliette Tennert. "We still have one more month of data to come in for 2013 but we've posted consistently encouraging numbers."
The biggest gains were in trade, transportation and utilities, leisure and hospitality and education and health services.
