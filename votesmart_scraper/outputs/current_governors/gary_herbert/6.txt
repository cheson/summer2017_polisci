Gov. Gary R. Herbert has ordered the flags of the United States of America and the state of Utah to be flown at half-staff at all state office buildings from sunrise until noon on Mon. May 29, 2017, in honor of Memorial Day and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces who gave their lives in the service of our country.
Gov. Herbert issued the following statement:
On this Memorial Day Jeanette and I salute the women and men who have bravely worn the uniform of this great nation throughout its history, and revere with humility those who have given their lives in the defense of our freedoms. While these heroes may be gone from our physical presence, we cannot ever forget their outstanding valor and sacrifice. Their sacred memory must always remain with us, and our gratitude for them must always endure.
Utahns should make necessary arrangements to lower the flags until noon, and then raise them to full staff for the remainder of the day on Monday. Individuals, businesses and other organizations are encouraged to join in this tribute for the customary forenoon period.
In addition to the half-staff order, President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe Memorial Day 2017 as a day of prayer for permanent peace. This proclamation has been archived here.
