Governor Announces Special Session Date
Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Aug. 31, 2011
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert announced today that the Special Legislative Session to address redistricting will begin Monday, October 3. Based on past experience and legislative input, this session may take multiple days.
"I applaud the Legislature, particularly Redistricting Committee Co-chairs Senator Ralph Okerlund and Representative Kenneth Sumsion, for including the public in a meaningful way and soliciting input in their statewide redistricting effort. This is a challenging process, but good process leads to good outcomes," said the Governor. "Based on population growth and shifting demographics, Utah has gained an additional congressional seat and of necessity boundaries will change. When the final bill hits my desk, I will evaluate it for fairness and balance, for an outcome that validates both rural and urban, and that yields the best results for the entire State of Utah."
Specific content of the Special Session call letter will be made available when finalized.
