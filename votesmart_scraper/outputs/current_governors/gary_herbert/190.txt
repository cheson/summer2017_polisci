Gov. Gary Herbert has declared Feb. 22-28, 2015 Eating Disorders Awareness Week in Utah to educate residents about eating disorders and increase their understanding of these potentially life-threatening conditions.
"Eating disorders are a serious public health concern and should not be ignored," said Gov. Herbert. "Many of our citizens suffer from these complex mental health conditions. I hope we will all use this opportunity to increase our knowledge of the harmful effects of eating disorders, as well as how to prevent them."
More than 20 million women and 10 million men in the United States suffer from eating disorders at some point during their lives, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. Many of these cases are never reported.
Gov. Herbert encourages Utah health organizations and health care professionals to educate residents about eating disorders, so they can recognize symptoms and seek treatment for themselves or for those they know who may be struggling with eating disorders.
