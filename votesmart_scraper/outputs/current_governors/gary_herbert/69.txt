Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 22, 2016
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert has authorized the lowering of the flag of the United States of America and the flag of the state of Utah to honor the victims of the terrorist attack in Brussels, Belgium.
"Jeanette and I, along with the three million residents of Utah are absolutely heartbroken to learn of this terrible tragedy. We are again reminded that the world we live in is a dangerous place, a place where the War on Terror has never ceased. We join with the rest of the world at this time in mourning for the people of Belgium.
"It is not uncommon for innocent victims to be targeted in these terrorist attacks, but seldom do we see people of faith who have forsaken everything--family, friends, school and careers--in order to share a message of hope and love with the world also fall victim. To the Norby, Empey and Wells families, please know that the state of Utah is united in prayer at this time for the health and well-being of your missionaries. As Utahns, we stand together with our fellow Americans and those around the world in our resolve to put an end to these acts of terror."
The flags will be flown at half-staff beginning immediately, Tuesday, March 22, 2016 until sunset on Saturday, March 26, 2016.
