"I am encouraged to see the economic numbers verify what we see in the marketplace--steady improvement and recovery. But jobs squarely remain our primary focus. There are still far too many Utahns who are unemployed or underemployed. Our concerted effort must be recruiting and growing sustainable jobs with our business-friendly environment, exceptionally skilled workforce, and unparalleled quality of life.

"We have seen nearly 24,000 new jobs created this past year in Utah. All but two economic sectors are experiencing consistent creation of new jobs, and that is clearly great news for all Utahns. There have been nearly 8,000 new jobs created over the past year in the professional and business services sector alone.

"We are also pleased with the growth in the energy sector as we understand the State's economic health is inseparably linked to the future of energy."
