Date: May 5, 2016
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert has authorized the lowering of the flag of the United States of America and the flag of the state of Utah to honor former Utah Sen. Bob Bennett who passed away Wednesday.
"Our prayers are with the Bennett family today as we mourn the passing of former Sen. Bob Bennett. Bob was a tremendous public servant who faithfully represented our state. A born leader, his passion for public policy came early in life and guided his lifetime of service and civic involvement. I will remember Bob as someone who was always quick to take on an assignment and slow to take the credit once he accomplished it. Above all, he was a man of integrity who loved his family and the people he served. Jeanette and I extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Joyce and their six children."
The flags will be flown at half-staff from sunrise until sunset on the day of his funeral, Saturday, May 14, 2016.
