Governor Calls Utah's Economy "Largely Resilient"
Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Feb. 25, 2013
Location: Washington, DC

Today Utah's top state economists issued this quarter's revised state revenue forecast. The outlook is for the same level of employment and wage growth, with a bump in one-time revenue and a modest decrease in ongoing revenue.
In response to today's announcement, Governor Herbert issued the following statement:
"Utah's fundamentals are strong, as evidenced by continued state economic growth. Unemployment is down, wages are up and the local economy is growing, but nevertheless Washington, D.C., is having a chilling effect on our state's recovery. We would be seeing even greater growth were it not for the backdrop of federal uncertainty and a fragile national economic recovery. It's good news that the state economy is largely resilient, but we are not immune to national economic dynamics. Despite federal uncertainty, what IS certain is my top budget priority-education. That does not and will not change."
