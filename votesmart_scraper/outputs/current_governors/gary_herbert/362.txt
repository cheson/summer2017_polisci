Date: Aug. 14, 2012
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Each year, Utah Governor Gary Herbert hosts the Governor's Gala to thank constituents for their support. This year's event will be held September 22 at the Grand America Hotel in downtown Salt Lake City.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will join Gov. Herbert and speak at the gala. The governors have worked together as active participants in the National Governors Association.
"Gov. Christie doesn't pull any punches; he calls it like he sees it and I'm sure we're all in for a treat," said Gov. Herbert. "Both Gov. Christie and I believe a strong economy is essential to a high quality of life, and that states can solve problems better than the federal government. I admire the work he's doing in his state and I look forward to hosting him at our gala."
The Republican National Committee announced earlier today that Gov. Christie will be the keynote speaker at the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla. later this month.
