Utah's unemployment rate is tied for second-lowest in the nation, holding steady at 3.6 percent, according to the latest figures from the Dept. of Workforce Services. The strong jobs report comes on the heels of news of a $166 million budget surplus in FY2014.
"Combined with our revenue surplus for this fiscal year, another strong jobs report is continued evidence that our conservative fiscal policies work," said Gov. Gary R. Herbert. "We continue to see job growth across the board as more and more businesses see Utah as a great place to invest and grow."
Utah's job growth is the second highest in the nation at 3.5 percent, trailing only energy-rich North Dakota. Utah also ranks third in private sector job growth at 3.6 percent, trailing only North Dakota and Texas.
All of Utah's private sector industries are growing, with the economy adding 44,700 jobs in the past 12 months. The fastest growing sectors are Construction, which saw an increase of 11.2 percent and Information, which grew by 7.3 percent.
