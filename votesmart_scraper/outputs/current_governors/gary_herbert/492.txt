Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert recently joined 32 other governors and governors-elect in a letter to President Obama and Congress, requesting states control healthcare policy and budgets.

"Only two years from the certification deadline and we are still waiting for clear federal guidelines," Governor Herbert explained. "One thing is clear-the federal package fails to recognize vast differences between states. Utah knows best what is best for Utah."

In the GOP governors' letter to federal officials, Utah cited the overall cost to implement the Patient Protections and Affordable Care Act Medicaid provisions, totaling $1.2 billion in state general funds over ten years. The governors requested immediate action to insure states have the flexibility to control programs and make budget decisions.

"The uncertainty of Washington's non-solutions only exacerbates Utah's budget challenge and keeps us from finding real solutions," the Governor said. "Utah was well on its way to implementing comprehensive, meaningful health system reform. But since the Affordable Care Act passed, Utah has to slog through the mire of federal confusion."

"What we need is not a one-size-fits-all federal solution that hurts states and our economies," Governor Herbert explained. "We need healthcare reform that encourages state innovation and recognizes the vital roles states play."
