Gov. Herbert and other top Utah elected officials have charged the Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice (CCJJ) with developing a comprehensive set of data-driven recommendations to increase public safety, while limiting expected growth of the state's prison budget. The commission will submit recommendations to the governor and Legislature in November for consideration in the 2015 legislative session.
"We're calling on the foremost experts on public safety to create a new roadmap for our criminal justice system," said Gov. Herbert. "The prison gates must be a permanent exit from the system, not just a revolving door. Just like every other area of government, we need to ensure we are getting the best possible results for each taxpayer dollar."
