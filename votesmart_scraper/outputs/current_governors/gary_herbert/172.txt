Public Statements
Gov. Herbert Signs 55 Bills
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 23, 2015
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed 55 bills today, bringing the total number of bills signed to 102 of the total 528 bills passed during the 2015 General Legislative Session.
Among the group of bills signed today is HB11, Death Penalty Procedure Amendments. This bill establishes the firing squad as a secondary method for executions, in the event the drugs necessary for lethal injection cannot be obtained. Lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in Utah.
"Those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state," said Marty Carpenter, spokesman for Gov. Herbert. "We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued. However, when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant, enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch."
In total, 34 states use capital punishment. All those states use lethal injection as the primary method of execution. Eight states have electrocution as a secondary method for execution, four use the gas chamber, three use hanging and two use the firing squad.
