The education of Utah's children, whether in public, private, or home school, has always been a priority during my service as Governor. Our next generation depends on our ability to provide the best education choices and services that this state can offer.
Utah is one of the most educated states, per capita, in the nation. We must continue to foster a love of learning in order to ensure a bright future for our children.
Teachers are the backbone of our system, and I appreciate their efforts in the classroom. They know how to make more with less, which is a tribute to their dedication.
I believe education functions best when managed at the local level. We know what is best for Utah, not the federal government. With the federal government's ever-encroaching hand, we must retain our right to control how and where our state's money is spent. Innovation should be rewarded, not stifled.
Evidence suggests that spending money on education is not enough. There must be accountability within our system in order for it to function properly. Losing control of our education system, to the federal government is not an option.
I receive many questions surrounding Common Core. As a state, we have agreed to higher benchmarks in the areas of science and math. Currently, no federal funding is attached to this program. We remain committed to dictating our processes, curriculum, and control of our education system in the state of Utah. Should Common Core become a more invasive intrusion of the federal government, we will reassess our participation in this program.
