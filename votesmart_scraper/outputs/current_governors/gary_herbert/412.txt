Governor Appoints V. Lowry Snow to Utah House
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Jan. 11, 2012
Location: Saint George, UT

Earlier this morning, in front of a St. George audience at the "What's Up Down South" Washington County Economic Summit, Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert signed the official letter to appoint V. Lowry Snow to Utah House District 74. The appointment comes at the recommendation of the Washington County Republican Party delegates who selected Snow to replace David Clark by a large margin. Clark resigned last month to run for Utah's Second Congressional District.
"Lowry's diverse legal experience and economic development background make him an ideal candidate for this position," the Governor said. "I believe he will be an outstanding addition to the Utah House and an excellent representative of his Southern Utah constituents."
Snow is a founding partner of the St. George-based law firm Snow Jensen & Reece. He has worked as an attorney in real estate, civil litigation, business and land use planning. He has served as president of the Utah State Bar, as well as a board member of the Southern Utah Community Legal Center.
Snow is also a member of the Governor's Office of Economic Development board, the Washington County Economic Development Council and an Economic Development Corporation of Utah trustee.
