Utahns are invited to the State Capitol on Monday, Jan. 3 to participate in the inauguration of Governor Gary R. Herbert and Lt. Governor Greg Bell.

The ceremony, hosted by the Utah National Guard, will begin at noon in the Capitol Rotunda and will include a 19-gun salute and flyover by the Guard.

In his inaugural address, Governor Herbert will discuss Utah's "Legacy of Leadership" and outline his vision for the State.
"I am honored and humbled for the opportunity to stand under the dome of our majestic Capitol and once again take the oath of office as Utah's 17th Governor," Governor Herbert said. "I invite all Utahns to participate in this event, whether they attend in person or watch it on television or online."

There is no cost to attend the event, and seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Guests should arrive at the Capitol early, however, as seating is limited. Standing room will also be available throughout the building.

For those unable to attend, the entire inaugural ceremony will be broadcast live on KUED Channel 7 and streamed at www.utah.gov.
