Governor Denounces BLM's Tar Sands and Oil Shale Acreage Reduction
Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Feb. 3, 2012
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

In response to today's announcement from the Bureau of Land Management to severely restrict available acreage for oil shale and tar sands leasing in Utah, Governor Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement:
"I see absolutely no benefit. This nonsensical, bass-ackwards, peek-a-boo policy is nothing more than political posturing by over-reaching federal bureaucrats. How about they seek our input, we comment on it first and THEN they make a decision? With no science and no data, and with a wave of their federal bureaucratic magic wand, they just take the bulk of the acreage off the market, stifle innovation, and demonstrate, yet again, that this administration is patently hostile toward even the possible development of much needed energy resources."
