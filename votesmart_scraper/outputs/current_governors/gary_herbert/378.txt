Today, Governor Gary R. Herbert released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court ruling on Arizona's Immigration Law:
"Today's ruling acknowledges that the state has a role to play in identifying people within its borders who are here illegally. The Supreme Court has validated this portion of the Arizona law and by doing so has validated the core part of Utah's HB 497 passed in 2011," said Governor Herbert. "The bill requires that an officer verify the immigration status of a person arrested for a felony or a class A misdemeanor who is unable to provide documents showing identity and cannot otherwise be identified. It also permits an officer to verify the status of persons booked for class B or C misdemeanors under certain circumstances."
