Governor Orders Flags Lowered for September 11
Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Sept. 7, 2012
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

In honor of the lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001, and as a tribute to the heroes who came to their country's aid, Governor Gary R. Herbert has ordered all flags on state-owned facilities to be flown at half-staff on Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2012.

The Governor issued the following statement:

"Utahns will never forget one of our nation's darkest days, or the tragic loss of nearly 3,000 innocent lives. We will always remember the selfless first responders, military personnel and citizens who aided in rescue, recovery and rebuilding. We will forever honor the men and women in our Armed Forces who defend our homeland in the war on terror. In tribute to both the fallen and the survivors, let us remain dedicated to principles of freedom, and may we serve our fellow citizens and community, strengthening what the terrorists sought-and failed-to destroy: The enduring spirit of the American people."

Under two separate acts of Congress, Sept. 11 is designated as Patriot Day and as a National Day of Service and Remembrance. In recognition of the Day of Service and Remembrance, the Governor and his staff are holding a canned food drive, starting Sept. 11, then donating to and volunteering at the Utah Food Bank later this month.
