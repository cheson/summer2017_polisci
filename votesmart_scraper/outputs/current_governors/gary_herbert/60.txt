Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement on the passing of former Sen. Bob Bennett:
"Our prayers are with the Bennett family today as we mourn the passing of former Sen. Bob Bennett. Bob was a tremendous public servant who faithfully represented our state. A born leader, his passion for public policy came early in life and guided his lifetime of service and civic involvement. I will remember Bob as someone who was always quick to take on an assignment and slow to take the credit once he accomplished it. Above all, he was a man of integrity who loved his family and the people he served. Jeanette and I extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Joyce and their six children."
