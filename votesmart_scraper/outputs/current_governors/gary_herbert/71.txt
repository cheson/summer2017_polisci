Press Release

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert and First Lady Jeanette Herbert will light the governor's mansion blue on Monday to raise awareness for the Down Syndrome community and cognitive research.
"Lending our support to the 'Light the Way' initiative not only raises awareness, but also helps give those living with Down Syndrome opportunities to be self reliant and live independently," First Lady Jeanette Herbert said.
The 'Light the Way' initiative will add support to the efforts of other non-profit foundations to increase awareness and funding for Down Syndrome research. This year more than 28 states are participating in the initiative on March 21, 2016, spearheaded by New Jersey First Lady Mary Pat Christie.
March 21 is Down Syndrome Day. It is particularly meaningful because Down Syndrome results from the presence of three copies of chromosome 21. Down Syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder, affecting over 400,000 Americans. It occurs in approximately one in every 700 births. Between 2006 and 2010, approximately 1.2 of every 1,000 babies was born with Down Syndrome.
