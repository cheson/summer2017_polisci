Tonight the Governor's Mansion will glow blue in support for World Autism Awareness Day.
"Jeanette and I extend our love to those individuals and families who face the difficult challenges associated with autism," said Governor Herbert. "Added awareness and research will give light to new technologies and advancements. Together we advocate for change that will improve lives."
Autism is one of the fastest growing developmental disabilities in the United States, affecting one in 88 American children. Recently, non-profit organizations like Autism Speaks have made great strides in advocating for those affected by autism. Governor Herbert recognizes that continued developmental research and community support are crucial for innovation in treatments and therapies.
