Gov. Gary R. Herbert sat down with elementary students Monday for a web coding tutorial to kick off Computer Science Education Week in Utah.
The tutorial, called "Hour of Code," is an initiative to introduce students to computer science. Sponsored by the nonprofit group Code.org, anyone can register for the free, one-hour tutorial online.
"High quality computer science education is foundational for our schools," Gov. Herbert said. "It drives innovation, gives our students confidence and prepares them for high-paying jobs in the changing marketplace."
