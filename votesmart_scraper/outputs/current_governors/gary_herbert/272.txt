The latest jobs report released today shows Utah's economy added 35,800 jobs over the past 12 months, increasing the job growth rate from 2.5 percent to 2.8 percent. Despite the slight increase in unemployment to 4.1 percent, the overall job creation numbers indicate previously frustrated workers are once again optimistic about finding a job and are looking to return to the work force.
"Today's jobs report is further evidence that our economy continues to grow stronger," said Gov. Gary R. Herbert. "With each new month of strong job growth and low unemployment, Utah further solidifies its position as the nation's premier economy."
Utah's economy continues to outperform the nation as a whole. The U.S. unemployment rate is 6.7 percent, 2.6 points higher than the Beehive State. Utah's job growth rate is also 1.2 points better than the national rate of 1.6 percent.
