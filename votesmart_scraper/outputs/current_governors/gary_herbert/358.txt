Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert has been named to the National Governors Association (NGA) Education and Workforce Committee by NGA Chair, Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, and NGA Vice Chair, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin.

"It is an honor to serve on the NGA Education and Workforce Committee," said Governor Herbert. "Because of their economic impact, education and workforce development are priority issues for the State of Utah. We are striving to align educational outcomes with employer needs more than ever before, and that starts with greater flexibility on federal education policies that affect states."

Governor Herbert was also recently tagged for the NGA's Executive Committee.

The Education and Workforce Committee addresses education (including early childhood, elementary and secondary education, and higher education), as well workforce development and labor. Members of the committee ensure the governors' views are represented in the shaping of federal policy.

Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy will serve as chair of the committee, and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad will serve as vice chair. Other members include Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Guam Gov. Eddie Calvo, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue, Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.
