Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert has issued the following statement about the situation in San Juan County with Recapture Canyon:
"I understand there has been a great deal of frustration with the amount of time it has taken for the Bureau of Land Management to issue a decision on Recapture Canyon. My office is working closely with the new BLM director, Neil Kornze, and Utah BLM director, Juan Palma, to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible. I appreciate the concerns of county officials and others. I will continue to work with all parties involved to finally bring a resolution to this matter. In the meantime, I encourage everyone to uphold the law and not do anything that could disrupt public safety."
