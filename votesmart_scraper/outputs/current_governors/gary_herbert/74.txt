Governor's statement on Clean Power Plan
Statement

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement regarding the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan:
"In the wake of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to stay implementation of the Clean Power Plan, I have suspended formal state efforts to comply with the rule. This includes postponing scheduled stakeholder meetings to develop Utah's initial submittal to the EPA until the rule's future becomes more clear.
"Utah is among 27 states challenging the Clean Power Plan in court, and many of those states are also hitting the pause button on compliance efforts. It is important to utilize limited state resources efficiently, and it does not make sense to dedicate significant staff time or taxpayer dollars to comply with a rule that may not survive judicial scrutiny. The state remains committed to an energy future that is affordable, reliable and cleaner."
