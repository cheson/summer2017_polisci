Governor Pushing to Make Utah More Business-Friendly
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: April 5, 2011
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Governor Gary R. Herbert wants to tune up state rules and regulations which impact Utah businesses, so he has ordered a review by senior staff and agency heads. Part of that review includes seeking input from the public. "This review is a key part of making certain Utah continues to be one of the nation's most friendly states in which to do business," Governor Herbert said.
"In my State of the State address, I asked each member of my Cabinet to review existing business regulations and determine which should be kept, which should be modified, and which should be eliminated," the Governor said. "I am also requesting input from the public as a part of this process." Any individual or business with a concern or a comment about a state rule or regulation is requested to send it to stateregulationreview@utah.gov before May 1, 2011.
As of March 1, 2011, there were 1,975 state administrative rules in effect. Many of those impact the way business is conducted. Rules are as diverse as telephone fraud prevention, water treatment plant operating regulations, and rental car licensing. Current Utah administrative rules are available online at http://www.rules.utah.gov/publicat/code.htm.
The Governor has tasked Mike Mower, Deputy Chief of Staff; Ken Hansen, Director of the Division of Administrative Rules; Thad Levar, Deputy Director of the Department of Commerce; Brad Johnson, Deputy Director of the Department of Environmental Quality; and Hunter Finch from the Governor's Office of Planning & Budget, with coordinating the state business regulation review. A final report is expected this fall.
