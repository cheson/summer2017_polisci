Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement:
"In Utah, we take very seriously our goal to lead the nation as the best performing economy and our reputation as the most business-friendly state. We also pride ourselves on our willingness to embrace innovation and have proactively eliminated outdated and unnecessary regulations. While we have to uphold the law on the books, there are times our laws must adapt to changes in the marketplace.
