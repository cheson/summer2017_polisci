Location: Boston, MA

Governors Mark Parkinson of Kansas, Jodi Rell from Connecticut, Pat Quinn of Illinois, John Baldacci of Maine, Jay Nixon of Missouri, Ted Kulongoski of Oregon, Gary Herbert of Utah and Chris Gregoire of Washington issued the following statement regarding the Boeing Company's submission of its bid for the U.S. Air Force refueling contract:
"With Boeing's bid formally submitted today, it's now time to move quickly to replace America's aging refueling tanker fleet. Our military cannot afford any further delay. We need a next generation tanker now to replace our existing 50-year-old fleet.
"As members of the U.S. Tanker 2010 Coalition, we are confident that Boeing's tanker proposal is the best choice and the best value to meet the needs of the modern warfighter. Boeing's airplane is the only one ready to move into immediate production. Their proposal is the only one that will create more than 50,000 American jobs at a time when our nation needs them most.
"We respectfully urge the leadership at the Pentagon to finish the procurement process and move forward on this critical investment in our national security. America's workers are the finest in the world and stand ready to build the finest aircraft in the world, as they have done for the past 60 years. We believe that with a fair, transparent competition, our skilled workers and an American-built plane is the smartest choice."
