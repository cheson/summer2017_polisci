Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 7, 2016
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert has authorized the lowering of the flag of the United States of America and the flag of the state of Utah as a sign of respect for former First Lady Nancy Reagan.
"Jeanette and I express our deepest sympathies to the Reagan family on the passing of former First Lady Nancy Reagan. Mrs. Reagan was an extraordinary woman who served our nation with grace and dignity. We often speak about the tremendous leadership of President Reagan, but none of that would have been possible without Nancy. She was his equal in every way. While we will mourn her passing, we take comfort in knowing that she is once again reunited with her beloved husband and best friend."
The flag will continue to be flown at half-staff until sunset on the date of interment.
