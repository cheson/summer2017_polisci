Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement in reaction to the news that former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney will not run for president in 2016:
"I have been a strong supporter of Gov. Romney all along and I believe he would have been a great president. His highly successful business career, his outstanding work with the 2002 Olympic Winter Games and his ability to work across the aisle as governor of Massachusetts, clearly demonstrate skill and talent that would have greatly benefitted our nation. I certainly respect his decision and I am sure he will continue to be an influential conservative voice on important issues. I believe the Republican party has a very strong field of potential candidates--particularly among the governors-- and I like our chances to take back the White House in 2016."
