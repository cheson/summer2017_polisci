Date: July 7, 2015
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert urges Utahns statewide to reduce vehicle emissions and improve Utah's air quality in July by participating in the 2015 Clear the Air Challenge.
"Utahns recognize the air quality challenges presented by our unique topography and they are looking for ways they can make a difference," said Gov. Herbert. "The Clear the Air Challenge has caused thousands of Utahns to evaluate their transportation choices, and I encourage businesses and individuals to see what a difference they can make."
Utahns can take the challenge by driving less and driving smart - choosing alternative methods of transportation using TravelWise strategies such as cycling, carpooling, public transit or trip changing and tracking the results. Participants are eligible for weekly and grand prize drawings by meeting straightforward, achievable travel goals. To sign up, visit www.cleartheairchallenge.org.
In 2014, more than 8,500 participating Utahns eliminated nearly 1.9 million miles traveled and 169,035 single occupant vehicle trips, making it the most successful Clear the Air Challenge to date.
