Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement following the Prison Relocation Commission's recommendation of a new prison site:
"The Prison Relocation Commission has undergone a deliberative process, and I will carefully evaluate their recommendations. Our primary focus in reforming our corrections system must be public safety and reducing recidivism among offenders. In our representative form of government, it is important for all Utahns to have a voice in this decision. Therefore, I will call the full legislature into a special session to vote on the proposal upon reviewing the final report."
Two members of the executive branch served as members of the Prison Relocation Commission: Rollin Cook, executive director of the Utah Department of Corrections, and Ron Gordon, executive director of the Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice.
