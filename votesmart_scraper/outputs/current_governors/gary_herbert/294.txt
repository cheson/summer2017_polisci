Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Governor Gary R. Herbert issued an executive order today calling for an analysis of Veteran employment among state agencies and prompting department heads to find ways to hire more veterans.
"Our veterans have freely given their time, sweat and blood to serve this great state and nation," Gov. Herbert said. "Each and every veteran deserves an opportunity to continue that service through employment opportunities here at home. The State of Utah will serve as a model employer for our veterans."
The attached executive order directs the Departments of Human Resource Management, Workforce Services and Veterans and Military Affairs to create a veteran employment profile of each state agency. The Governor is directing his cabinet to identify ways to increase or maintain employment of the more than 160,000 veterans, National Guard Members, Reservists and other military personnel who call Utah home.
