Governor Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Court's ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act:
"I have long believed that marriage is a state's rights issue. I support and will continue to defend Utah's constitutional definition of marriage as the legal union between a man and a woman. I also believe that discrimination has no place in society. I hope we can find a path that protects all from discrimination while defending the sanctity of traditional marriage."
