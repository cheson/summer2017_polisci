Gov. Gary R. Herbert, issued the following statement in response to inclement weather and dangerous driving conditions:
"With severe weather conditions on Utah roads, I encourage employers to consider flexible work arrangements this evening and tomorrow morning as employees plan for their commutes. I have ordered all cabinet members to use their discretion to ensure as many employees as possible are dismissed early in order to complete their commute home before sundown.
"I express appreciation to our Utah Department of Transportation, Department of Public Safety, and all other road crews and public safety employees. On behalf of three million Utah residents, we thank you for the difficult, underappreciated, and often unseen work you do to protect motorists across the state."
