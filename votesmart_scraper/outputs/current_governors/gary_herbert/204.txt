Utah's economy continues to grow stronger, posting a healthy 3.9 percent job growth rate that pushed unemployment down to 3.5 percent, according to new data released today.
"Utah's economy is firing on all cylinders and it's great to see all sectors of our economy growing and adding jobs," said Gov. Gary R. Herbert. "As we head into the Legislative session, we must continue to make the decisions that will enhance the long term strength of our state economy and improve the quality of life for all Utahns."
At the height of the Great Recession, approximately 114,000 Utahns were unemployed. Today, that number has fallen to fewer than 50,000. An estimated 50,700 jobs were added over the past 12 months. Utah's unemployment rate is 2.2 points lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.6 percent.
