Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: July 8, 2015
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert has named Jon Cox to his senior staff as director of communication. Cox will take over for Marty Carpenter who is leaving the administration to begin working on the governor's re-election campaign.
"Having served admirably in the House of Representatives, Jon has a strong understanding of the broad spectrum of issues facing our state and the goals we have as an administration," said Gov. Herbert. "He will be a significant asset to our staff as we communicate the success of our state to the public and craft strategies to enhance our enviable quality of life."
Cox will immediately resign his seat in the Utah House of Representatives where he has served as the elected representative of District 58 since 2013. During his legislative service, he spearheaded initiatives important to economic development in rural Utah. As the only full-time teacher in the Legislature, Cox was also a valued voice on educational issues.
"I am excited to join the Herbert administration at a time when our state continues to experience unprecedented economic growth," Cox said. "As the governor prepares to take the reins of the National Governors Association later this month, Utah has a unique opportunity to share with the rest of the nation our success story."
Cox will serve as primary spokesman for the Herbert administration. Prior to joining the administration, he worked as a history instructor at Snow College and a staff member for former U.S. Senator Bob Bennett. He previously served as a county commissioner in Sanpete County.
