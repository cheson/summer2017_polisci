Public Statements
Additional Public Hearings For Criminal Justice Policy Review Announced
Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: April 18, 2014
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

The Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice will hold three additional public hearings throughout the state. The hearings allow interested parties to share ideas for criminal justice policy changes that should be considered by the Commission as a follow-up to Governor Gary Herbert's charge for reform, given during his 2014 State of the State address.
"I have asked for a full review of our current system to develop a plan to reduce recidivism, maximize offenders' success in becoming law-abiding citizens, and provide judges with the tools they need to accomplish these goals," Gov. Herbert said. "The prison gates through which people re-enter society must be a permanent exit, and not just a revolving door."
