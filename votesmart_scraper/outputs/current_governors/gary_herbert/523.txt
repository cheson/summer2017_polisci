Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Governor Gary R. Herbert on Tuesday reached out to mayors in Utah communities affected or threatened by high water levels in several creeks and rivers.

The Governor spoke to elected officials from Salt Lake County and the cities of Cottonwood Heights, Lehi, Murray and Oakley. He expressed to the mayors his commitment to their communities and offered state assistance, if necessary.

"I have every confidence in our local leaders, who are managing this ongoing situation admirably. Once again, my appreciation for local government has been renewed upon seeing the quick and effective mobilization of our first responders," Governor Herbert said. "But I wanted to make sure the mayors knew that the State is here, and is ready, willing and able to help as needed."

The Utah Department of Public Safety, through the Division of Homeland Security and the Utah Highway Patrol, continues to help with flood control measures. The Utah Department of Transportation has also provided assistance to local communities.

In each of their conversations with the Governor, the mayors reported that Utahns have stepped forward with enthusiasm to help their neighbors. Over the past three days, hundreds of volunteers have shown up at community centers to fill sandbags to protect against flood damage.

"Utah is repeatedly recognized as the state that leads the nation in volunteerism, and situations like this prove that it's true," Governor Herbert said. "We are fortunate to live in a great state where people care about each other."
