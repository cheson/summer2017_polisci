Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: June 12, 2010
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Governor Gary R. Herbert was notified of the spill of hundreds of barrels of crude oil into Red Butte Creek early Saturday and has been closely monitoring the situation throughout the day.

"This is a devastating situation for Salt Lake City and impacted areas," the Governor said. "The response, at all levels, has been quick and immediate, and is a testament to the level of emergency planning and preparation in our community.

"Together, we will work to stop any residual leaking while we recover as much oil as possible, analyze the underlying cause and prevent future similar situations."

The state Division of Water Quality, a division of the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, is on site conducting water sampling and assessing environmental damage. The Division will issue a notice of violation against Chevron as a result of the crude oil discharge.

Fortunately, the impacted water does not deliver drinking water to Salt Lake City residents. Still, officials are cautioning all Utahns to keep their family members and pets away from the waterways while clean-up efforts continue.
