This past weekend, Gov. Gary Herbert shared some of what he has learned during his time in office with those about to take over their respective statehouses. The governor and some of his fellow veteran governors meet with governors-elect at the National Governors Association (NGA) Seminar for New Governors (SNG) in Westminster, Colorado at the two-and-a-half-day biennial seminar, which brings together governors-elect fresh off the campaign trail and assists in the transition from running for office to governing their states.
The bipartisan seminar features a series of business sessions in which veteran governors advise governors-elect and their transition teams on the leadership and management of state government, including developing the executive budget, hiring the best and the brightest, shaping a vision for the administration and managing strategic scheduling, communications and legislative relations. Current governors' spouses simultaneously lead sessions for the spouses of governors-elect.
"This seminar provides a tremendous opportunity for governors and governors-elect to get to know one another and discuss common goals for the future," said Gov. Herbert, who serves as NGA vice chair. "I especially want to thank the veteran governors for taking time to share their valuable insight and ideas for improving state government."
NGA is the bipartisan organization of the nation's governors. Through NGA, governors share best practices, speak with a collective voice on national policy and develop innovative solutions that improve state government and support the principles of federalism.
