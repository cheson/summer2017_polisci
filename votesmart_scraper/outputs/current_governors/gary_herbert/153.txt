Congressman Paul Tonko (D-NY) marked Infrastructure Week today by calling on Republican House leadership to protect good paying jobs and avoid the impending expiration of the Highway and Transit Trust Fund on May 31. Until Congress acts to reauthorize the Trust Fund, 660,000 jobs and 6,000 projects are at risk of shutdown. With only six legislative days between today and the end of the month, there has been no legislation offered and no votes scheduled to extend this critical program.
"It is unacceptable that GOP House leadership has continued its strategy of brinksmanship and manufactured crises when it has come to the Highway Trust Fund," said Tonko. "It is well past time to restore long-term certainty to workers and communities across the country and protect the hundreds of thousands of jobs this program supports."
State, local and business leaders across the country -- as well as Congressman Tonko -- have been calling for a bold, long-term reauthorization of the Trust Fund for months. Last August, Tonko asked Speaker Boehner to cancel recess so the House could act on a long to-do list of issues, specifically calling for a robust, multi-year reauthorization that allows states and cities to plan for aggressive infrastructure improvements that boost public safety, put people to work, and promote business development.
