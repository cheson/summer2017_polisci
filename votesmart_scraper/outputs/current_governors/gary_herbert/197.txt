Press Release

Date: Feb. 5, 2015
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert today highlighted the opportunity for Utahns to directly help individuals and families experiencing homelessness by donating to the Pamela Atkinson Homeless Trust Fund. While touring the Volunteers of America Adult Detoxification Center, the governor met with several formerly homeless individuals and a family who received critical care and support that was funded, in part, by the homeless trust fund.
"We have individuals and families who are homeless in all of our counties. It's hard to be a functioning member of our community, to find a job when you don't have a home," said Gov. Herbert. "When you check the box and give money to the fund, you can rest assured that it is going to someone who needs help. We're number one in the nation for charitable giving, so I encourage everyone to give to this trust fund generously."
By donating to the Pamela Atkinson Homeless Trust Fund on their 2014 tax form this tax season, Utahns can directly support statewide efforts focused on delivering critical services for our vulnerable homeless population. All donations to the fund go directly to service organizations statewide that provide vital care and assistance to individuals and families experiencing homelessness.
