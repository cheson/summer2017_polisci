Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 25, 2015
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed 56 bills into law today bringing the total number of bills signed from the 2015 General Legislative Session to 200. The Legislature passed 528 bills this session, 495 of which require action by the governor.
Among the bills signed by the governor today is HB 454, Prison Development Amendments. This bill establishes the process to finalize the location of the new state penitentiary and enacts a local option sales and use tax for a city or town where the prison will be located. No site has been chosen for the site of the new prison at this time.
"The state prison facility in Draper is outdated and needs to be replaced," said Gov. Herbert. "The construction of a new prison--regardless of where it is located--provides us with a tremendous opportunity to build a facility that will help us reduce recidivism while enhancing public safety."
The bill also ensures both the legislative and executive branches will play a role in the final decision. Once the Prison Relocation Commission makes a recommendation, the full Legislature will vote on the recommendation. The governor will then have the opportunity to review the bill and sign or veto it.
The governor also signed HB 288, Line-of-duty Death Benefits for Peace Officers and Firefighters. This bill clarifies and enhances the amount of money paid to the surviving spouses of police and firefighters killed in the line of duty, as well as allowing their health coverage to continue.
"When police officers and firefighters are lost in the line of duty, we owe them more than just a debt of gratitude," said Gov. Herbert. "I am pleased to see such strong support for their family members who have paid such a heavy price."
