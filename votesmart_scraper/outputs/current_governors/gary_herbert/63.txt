Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert has appointed Kirsten Rappleye as Public Information Officer following Aimee Edwards' transition to the Governor's Office of Economic Development earlier this month.
Prior to joining the governor's staff, Rappleye served as assistant to the Utah Senate's majority caucus, managing communications strategy, media relations and constituent services. She received a bachelor's degree in law and constitutional studies from Utah State University.
"We are excited to have Kirsten join Gov. Herbert's staff in this new capacity," said Jon Cox, the governor's communications director. "With her past legislative experience overseeing communications for the Utah Senate, she will be an invaluable addition to the governor's staff."
Rappleye will formally assume her new position on May 9, and may be contacted for media requests at rappleye@utah.gov or 801-505-1457.
