Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Sept. 28, 2011
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Just after noon today, Governor Gary R. Herbert signed a proclamation convening the Utah Legislature in a Special Session to address seven legislative issues next Monday, October 3, at 9:00 a.m.
"Redistricting is an important responsibility that the Utah Constitution assigns to the Legislature. Several other issues have come to my attention which I have added to the call for the Legislature to consider while they are in special session. These are, in large measure, technical and clean-up amendments to state law."
Among the items the Governor has asked the Legislature to consider are: changes to workers' compensation insurance requirements; modifications to the requirement that certain members of the Board of Regents represent less populous counties; and adding the presidential primary to the regular primary ballot.
