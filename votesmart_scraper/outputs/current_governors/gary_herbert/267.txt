Utah's economy continues to outpace the nation as more and more Utahns are finding jobs. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.8 percent, and our economy grew at 2.9 percent.

"Though it may seem routine to tout our low unemployment rate and strong job growth, I am focused on long term sustainability, expansion and economic success," said Governor Gary R. Herbert. "We can celebrate good news but it is even more important that we continue to build on it."

All of Utah's private sector industries are adding jobs, and the size of the labor force continues to grow. All indicators point to sustained and steady growth throughout the summer and the rest of 2014.
