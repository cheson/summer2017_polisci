Governor Gary R. Herbert released the following statement today in observance of Father's Day:
"Fathers make a tremendous difference in the lives of their children. I was blessed to have two, my biological father, Paul Richard Peters, and my adopted father, Duane Herbert. Both were fine men - pillars of the community who loved me unconditionally and instilled the work ethic and values I needed to succeed.
"From them I learned to work hard, serve others, be honest in all my dealings, treat others as I would want to be treated, and give back to the community. I am deeply grateful to both of them for the examples they set, the love they gave and the lessons they taught.
"This weekend I am pleased to join Utahns across the State in honoring their fathers and paying homage to fatherhood. Like mothers, fathers play a critical role in nurturing children and guiding their intellectual and social development. It is from fathers that children often learn perseverance, problem-solving, self-esteem, self-discipline, physical and mental toughness, and other key values necessary for success in the world around them.
"Fathers not only bless their families, but also have an immeasurable impact for good on our great State and nation. Thank you to all the responsible fathers who help make Utah such a great place to live and raise a family."
