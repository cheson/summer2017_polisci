An hour or so after being informed of his daughter's successful finish of the Boston Marathon, Governor Gary R. Herbert learned of the tragic bombings that occurred. He has released the following statement:
"As grateful as I am that my daughter is safe and was not nearby when the bombs went off, I am deeply shocked and saddened by this tragedy. This hits home, not only because my daughter was there, but also because many other Utahns participated in the race today. Jeanette and I are appalled by what happened and offer our thoughts and prayers to the families of those who lost their lives and to the many who were injured. May they recover and return home to their families quickly."
"Now regarding the security of our State and country, my Homeland Security Advisor, Colonel Keith Squires, has been in contact with the FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. There is no indication at this time that any other areas of the country have been affected. We will continue to monitor the situation and work hard to ensure the safety of Utah and the United States of America."
