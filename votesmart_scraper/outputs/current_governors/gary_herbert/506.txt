Press Release
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Sept. 10, 2010
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

In honor of all those who lost their lives on Sept. 11, 2001 - and as a tribute to the heroes who came to the aid of their country - Governor Gary R. Herbert has ordered all flags on state-owned facilities to be flown at half staff from sunrise to sunset tomorrow.

The Governor is also encouraging all Utahns to observe a nationwide moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor the victims of the terrorist attacks.

"Utahns will never forget the impact that 9-11 had on us as individuals, as states and as a country," Governor Herbert said. "The unthinkable acts of terrorism represent a devastating moment in U.S. history, but they have brought us together as Americans to rededicate ourselves to the founding principles of our great nation."

Under two separate acts of Congress, Sept. 11 is designated as Patriot Day and as a National Day of Service and Remembrance.
