Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: March 30, 2016
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

On the final day of the bill signing period, Gov. Gary R. Herbert finalized work on the remaining 33 bills, taking veto action on six bills, including nine line item vetoes. One law will take effect without the governor's signature. In total, 453 bills were passed during the 2016 General Legislative Session that required action by the governor.
"Overall, I am very pleased with the results of this session, especially the substantial increase in education funding," Gov. Herbert said. "It has been my experience that it is far more productive to work closely with legislators during the session so the bills that come to my desk represent consensus legislation. I believe we have again accomplished that goal this session."
