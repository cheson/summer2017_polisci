Utah's economy remains the strongest in the nation and has once again posted a budget surplus. Today, Gov. Gary R. Herbert announced the state of Utah ended Fiscal Year 2015 with a surplus of $103 million. Of that number, $59 million will be immediately deposited into the rainy day fund, bringing the total of that fund to nearly $528 million, the highest amount in state history.
"A healthy budget surplus is a sign that Utah continues to live within its means," Gov. Herbert said. "I am proud of Utah's growing economy, and I remain committed to making sure Utah is not only the best-managed state in the nation but also the best prepared for any economic difficulty down the road."
