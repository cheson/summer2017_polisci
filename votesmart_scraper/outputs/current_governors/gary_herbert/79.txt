It's National Salute to Veteran Patients week, a time to show our appreciation to the hospitalized veterans who bravely fought for and defended our freedom.
Governor Gary R. Herbert visited veteran patients at the Veteran Affairs medical center in Salt Lake on Wednesday to pay tribute.
"Words can never repay the service you rendered, but please know that we are continually grateful for you and for those with whom you served," Gov. Herbert told the veterans.
The annual salute encourages Americans to pay tribute through visits, volunteer work and other expressions of gratitude to the 98,000 veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces who receive care through the VA system.
The governor always looks forward to his visits to the VA Medical Center to thank veterans for the service they have rendered to our great country on behalf of the three million people of Utah.
The VA Salt Lake City Health Care System (VASLCHCS) provides healthcare to more than 54,000 eligible veterans across one of the largest geographical areas in VA. In the fiscal year 2015, it served 55,929 unique patients, outpatient visits totaled 687,393, and inpatient days for the hospital totaled 26,442. There are currently 151,719 veterans living in Utah.
