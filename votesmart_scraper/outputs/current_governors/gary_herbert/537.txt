"Jeanette and I extend our deepest condolences to Private First Class Nemelka's family, as well as all of the families affected by this senseless attack. We ought never forget about those who risk their lives every day, at home and abroad, to protect our freedoms."

Private First Class Nemelka enlisted in the Army in October 2008 and belonged to the 5/10th Engineering Company, 20th Infantry Battalion, 36th Engineering Brigade. He was preparing for a deployment to Afghanistan in January.

Also injured in the attack was Private First Class Joey Foster of Ogden, Utah.
