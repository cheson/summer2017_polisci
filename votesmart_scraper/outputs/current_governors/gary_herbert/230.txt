Gov. Herbert Statement on Supreme Court Decision Regarding Same-Sex Marriage
Statement
By: Gary Herbert
Date: Oct. 6, 2014
Location: Salt Lake City, UT

In response to the Supreme Court's decision not to hear Kitchen v. Herbert or other same-sex marriage cases, Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement:
"As I have said all along, the people of Utah and people across the country deserve clarity with respect to the law. It is best if that clarity comes from the nation's highest court. I am surprised--as are many on both sides of the issue--that the Supreme Court has made the decision not to consider Utah's case, or any similar case from another state.
"I believe states should have the right to determine their own laws regarding marriage. That said, we are a society of laws and we will uphold the law. I have instructed state agencies to implement necessary changes in light of today's news.
"Once again, I encourage all Utahns--regardless of their personal beliefs on this issue--to treat each other with respect."
