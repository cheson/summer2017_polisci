Governor Continues Fight Against PPACA as RGA Committee Co-Chair
Press Release

Location: Salt Lake City, UT

In his new role as co-Chair of the recently created Health Care Subcommittee for the Republican Governors Public Policy Committee, Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert will focus on one of the most pressing issues for Americans this year: Repealing and replacing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The Governor will co-chair the committee with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.

Utah's suit challenging the federal government and PPACA's individual mandate should reach the Supreme Court near the end of March. "While we are earnestly trying to prioritize Utah's public education funding, our state Medicaid costs are spiraling out of control," the Governor said. "Add the requirements of PPACA on top of existing costs, and state budgets are devastated."

The Republican Governors Association selected Governor Herbert for this assignment due to his leadership on health care reform, including the implementation of the Utah Health Exchange, the creation of All Payer Claims Database and major reforms for Utah's Medicaid system. "Utah is striving to set the pace for health care reform. As the incubators for ideas and innovation, states are best suited to find solutions to the challenges for health care," said Governor Herbert.

An entity of the Republican Governors Association, the Health Care Subcommittee for the Republican Governors Public Policy Committee was created to advance the policies of Republican governors on a national scale.
