Utah's unemployment rate dropped to 5.4% for the month of September, following another month of steady job growth as the state continues to show strong recovery from the recession.

"This is more great news for Utah's economy. When we prioritize low taxes, reasonable regulation, and business-friendly policies, our economy grows," Governor Gary R. Herbert said. "The benefits of our laser-like focus on economic growth are being realized month after month as more Utahns are being employed. That said, too many Utahns are still out of work, and we won't relent until every Utahn who wants a job can get one."

The data released by the Department of Workforce Services shows that in September 73,100 Utahns were out of work. This is down from the August rate of 5.8%, and down more than a full percentage point from 6.5% in September 2011.

The long-term trends show that Utah's economy is growing steadily, and has added approximately 24,400 jobs over the past 12 months, growing at a rate of 2%.
