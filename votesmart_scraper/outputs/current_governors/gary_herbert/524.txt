Press Release

Utah school teachers visited Capitol Hill Wednesday and delivered handwritten notes to Governor Gary R. Herbert to thank him for his dedicated defense of public education funding.
"As an educator in Cache Valley, I would like to thank you for the support you have given public education," wrote one second grade teacher. "We appreciate your work for the future of our children in this state."
Another educator wrote, "Thank you for your championship of funding for Utah's public schools. The students of today are our future and need to be the No. 1 priority."
Governor Herbert agrees that public and higher education is the top priority for the State of Utah. Holding education funding at current levels was the Governor's primary goal for this legislative session, which he announced at his budget rollout in December.
Through focused negotiations with the Legislature and stakeholders from the education community over the course of the legislative session, the Governor has succeeded in keeping reductions at manageable levels in both areas.
Under the budget agreement, public education will see a reduction of less than $10 million, which amounts to less than one-half of 1 percent of its overall budget. Higher education will receive an approximate 5 percent reduction, but will get additional funding for capital projects at several higher education campuses.
