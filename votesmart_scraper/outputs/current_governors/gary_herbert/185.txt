Gov. Gary Herbert attended the opening tour of a new research facility for Nature's Sunshine Friday, a global health and wellness company based right here in Utah.
The Hughes Center for Research and Innovation will host scientific discovery and product innovation for nutritional supplements. This facility has added STEM jobs for scientists, researchers and medical doctors.
Nature's Sunshine began as a small, family-owned business in 1972 and has grown into a leading global health and wellness company that operates in more than 45 countries across the globe. An employer of 550 Utahns, Nature's Sunshine has helped bolster the state's economy and job growth.
"Job creation is a top priority in my administration," said Gov. Herbert. "It's one of the four cornerstones upon which we are laying the foundation for lasting economic success in Utah and maintaining our enviable quality of life."
In 2013, Forbes included Nature's Sunshine on its "Most Trustworthy Companies in America" list.
Growing private sector companies such as Nature's Sunshine provide important contributions to the state's economy and job growth, making Utah the place to live, work and raise a family.
