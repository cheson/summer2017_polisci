Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Thanks to his efforts to a stable and efficient public workforce, Gov. Gary Herbert has received the endorsement of the Utah Public Employees' Association. UPEA is an independent, member-based association representing state, county, city, higher education and special service district employees.
"In Utah we are very fortunate to have dedicated public employees who work hard for their fellow citizens," said Gov. Herbert. "We work to minimize the tax burden on our citizens and we are successful in large part because of the great men and women who give us a great bang for our buck. I'm honored to have the endorsement of the Utah Public Employees' Association."
"Gov. Herbert has maintained an open door for state employees and follows the Association's values for protecting jobs while preserving the public trust in a quality workforce," said Jeff Horrocks, chairman of the UPEA Citizen Action by Public Employees Committee.
