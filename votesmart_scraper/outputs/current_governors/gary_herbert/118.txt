In a discussion today with Lt. Gov. Spencer J. Cox, Utah County officials have agreed to allow all county voters to cast only one ballot in the upcoming November election. Previously, election officials considered requiring voters in the five all vote-by-mail cities to also hold a separate in-person election for the county-wide ballot proposition.
"I appreciate the willingness of all parties to work together on this important issue," Lt. Gov. Cox said. "Our focus must always be on what is best for voters, and I believe this resolution accomplishes that."
Under this agreement, every voter in the county will only need to cast one ballot for both municipal elections and the county ballot proposition. Orem, Lehi, Vineyard, Cedar Hills and Alpine will continue to conduct their municipal general election all by-mail. The other municipalities in Utah County will conduct a traditional election, which includes polling locations and the option for voters to request a by-mail ballot. The Utah County Clerk-Auditor's Office will also mail to each household in the traditional voting municipalities a postcard reminding voters they may request a by-mail ballot online or in-person.
Although the ballot and administrative matters will be combined, each municipality will canvass their respective election results and the county will canvass their ballot proposition. The cost of the election will be shared between the municipalities and the county.
