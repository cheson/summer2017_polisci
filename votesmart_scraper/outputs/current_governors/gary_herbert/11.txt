Gov. Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement following Rep. Jason Chaffetz's announcement that he will not seek re-election in the Utah 3rd District:
"I was as stunned as anyone to learn of Congressman Chaffetz' decision not to seek re-election or any public office in 2018. Congressman Chaffetz has represented Utah in the United States House of Representatives with distinction, and I have appreciated working him over the last eight years on issues vital to our state. His razor sharp mind, expansive knowledge and gift for communicating will serve him well when he transitions into the private sector. Jeanette and I wish Jason, Julie and their family well in their future endeavors. Undoubtedly, he will appreciate being able to spend more time here in the great state of Utah."
