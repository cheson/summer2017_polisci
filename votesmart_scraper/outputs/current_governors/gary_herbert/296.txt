In a gathering of water experts from around the state, Governor Gary R. Herbert outlined the State's next steps in a visionary 50-year water strategy at today's Water Summit, held at Utah Valley Convention Center. Part of that plan includes the creation of the State Water Strategy Advisory Team, an entity designated to develop and refine solutions for Utah's water future. The team is comprised of elected officials, conservation leaders, water managers, recreational organizations, technical experts, attorneys, and business representatives.
"We face far-reaching challenges in Utah's water future," said Governor Herbert. "From a growing population to drought concerns and funding problems, many complicated and weighty considerations demand we plan and prepare now."
The State Water Strategy Advisory Team will:
Solicit and evaluate potential water management strategies;
Frame for public feedback various water management options and the implications of those options; and
Based on broad input, develop a set of strategies and ideas to be considered as part of the 50-year water strategy.
