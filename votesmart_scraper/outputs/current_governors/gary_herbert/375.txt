Location: Salt Lake City, UT

Yesterday Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert reached out to local religious leaders with a petition for prayer on behalf of those facing and fighting fires in the State. Following is the content of the letter distributed.

Dear Religious Leader,
A great challenge is facing our state this summer. Extremely hot, dry, and windy weather conditions are creating one of the most dangerous fire seasons in our state's history. We have already suffered through several major fires.
During this past week, I have met with many residents across our state who have been impacted by the fires. The people of Saratoga Springs, Oak City, Fairview, New Harmony, Scofield, Huntington Canyon, as well as several other communities, have shown an incredible spirit of resilience and cooperation.
Many wonderful fire fighters, search and rescue volunteers, state and local emergency and law enforcement personnel, Red Cross volunteers, and others, are doing all they can to stop the fires that are burning, prevent future wildfires from breaking out, and assist those whose lives have been disrupted by the flames.
Our hearts also go out to residents of our sister states who are fighting catastrophic fires too.
I am writing to ask you and members of your congregation, to join me in praying for the elements to be moderated, the firefighters to be safe, and the lives and homes of our fellow residents to be protected. We are in need of an extra measure of help as we battle these conflagrations. I appreciate your consideration of this request. Thank you for all you do for the residents of our great state.
Sincerely,
Gary R. Herbert
Governor
