Gov. Gary R. Herbert has issued a call for a special session of the Utah State Legislature. The session will be held on July 13 to consider measures related to unmanned aircrafts near wildland fires, the Utah State Fairpark and other issues.
"This summer, wildfires in the state have become significantly worse due to drones interrupting air operations," Gov. Herbert said. "It is dangerous and completely unacceptable, and this legislation takes steps to ensure that our emergency management personnel are safe and empowered to do their jobs effectively."
Issues to be addressed during the special session include the following:
A measure that would enhance penalties for flying unmanned aircrafts over restricted wildfire airspaces
Legislation regarding a grandparent's rights to visits grandchildren adopted by a family member of the child
Economic development legislation that would provide sales and use tax exemptions for a qualifying data center
A technical correction to the controlled substance database for probationers and parolees
Amendments to the security of investments in continuing care facilities
The addition of an enacting clause to 2016 House Bill 310, Tax Credit Review Amendments
