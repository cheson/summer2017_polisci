The director of the Utah Sentencing Commission, Jacey Skinner, will serve a second term as director and president of the National Association of Sentencing Commissions (NASC). The executive committee re-elected Skinner to serve through 2014.

"We are very fortunate to have Jacey represent Utah on the National Commission," said Governor Herbert. "She exemplifies the superior talent found within Utah's workforce."
The NASC was formally organized in the late 1990s as a nonprofit organization. The Commission facilitates an exchange of sentencing research and plays a major role in educating the public on the issues associated with sentencing policy. The Commission does not endorse a particular sentencing structure, but rather supports states developing their own sentencing policies based on the state's needs. As director, Skinner will advise 22 state commissions.
"The NASC provides a forum of discussion for sentencing issues, research, and challenges across the country," Skinner said. "This position allows me to help Utah frame and facilitate that discussion. The Utah Commission can observe and learn from the challenges and successes of other states to evaluate and make effective sentencing policy recommendations."
Skinner was appointed director of the Utah Sentencing Commission in 2008. Prior to working with the Sentencing Commission, she was an assistant district attorney with the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office. Skinner received a Juris Doctorate from the J. Reuben Clark Law School at Brigham Young University.
