Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert today appointed Woods Cross resident Todd Weiler to Utah Senate District 23. The appointment was recommended by the Davis County Republican Party delegates. Weiler will replace Sen. Dan Liljenquist who resigned to run for the U.S. Senate.
Of the appointment Herbert said, "I am confident in Todd's ability to not only serve as a state senator, but to serve extremely well. With his long-time service to the Republican Party and his commitment to the community and state, Senator Weiler is well-prepared for this new appointment, and will surely hit the ground running this legislative session."
