Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert issued the following statement following the Utah State Legislature's repeal of HB 477 this afternoon:

"I am very pleased the Legislature has responded to the will of the people by repealing HB 477. It was the right thing to do as a first step to restore public confidence. As the Legislature's working group re-examines Utah's GRAMA statutes, I am confident all members will work diligently to craft recommendations which protect the public's right to know, protect an individual's legitimate right to privacy, and protect taxpayer dollars."
