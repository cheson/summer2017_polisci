Utah posted the highest job growth rate in the nation for total and private sector job growth for the fifth consecutive month. According to new data, Utah posted its strongest growth rates of the year last month for total job growth at 4.5 percent and private sector job growth at 5.2 percent.
"Utah's economic performance continues to be the envy of the nation," said Gov. Gary R. Herbert. "Our strong and diverse economic performance across every private sector comes from our commitment to fundamental, conservative principles that cultivate an environment where business can succeed."
Here is how Utah compares with the rest of the nation:
Utah ranked first in the nation for year-over total job growth at 4.5 percent. Washington ranked second at 3.7 percent, followed by Florida at 3.5 percent and Oregon at 3.4 percent.
Utah ranked first in the nation for year-over private sector job growth at 5.2 percent. Washington ranked second at 4.0 percent, followed by Florida at 3.9 percent.
Utah had the third lowest unemployment rate in the nation at 3.5 percent. States with lower rates were Nebraska at 2.6 percent and North Dakota at 3.1 percent.
Utah's unemployment rate of 3.5 percent was 1.8 percentage points below the national rate of 5.3 percent. While the Utah unemployment rate held constant last month, this was accompanied by year-over labor force growth of 3.1 percent, which demonstrates Utah's nation-leading economy is attracting a growing number of workers. Nine out of ten private sector industry groups saw robust job gains during the month of June.
