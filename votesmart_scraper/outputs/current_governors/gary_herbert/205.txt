Governor Gary R. Herbert has strong poll numbers heading into the 2015 legislative session and a plan for what to do next.
The governor's overall approval rating remains high at 74 percent according to a new poll from Dan Jones & Associates. Gov. Herbert posts strong numbers with Republicans (89 percent) and independent voters (73 percent). The poll was conducted Dec. 22 -- Jan. 10.
Gov. Herbert has several priorities for the upcoming session, including passing Healthy Utah, an alternative to Medicaid expansion that would bring $409 million federal tax dollars Utahns already pay under the Affordable Care Act back into Utah's economy and provide health care for Utah's most vulnerable citizens.
"Healthy Utah is the best deal possible for the Utah taxpayer and for those in need," said Gov. Herbert. "I trust the Legislature to give Utahns the best deal possible on every issue they face this session, in order to ensure our state's long-term economic success and high quality of life."
Additionally, the governor has proposed a budget that calls for the largest increase to education spending in the last 25 years. He is also focused on investing in transportation infrastructure to provide for the population influx expected by the year 2040 and will continue to support good policies to further improve air quality.
The 2015 legislative session begins Jan. 26.
