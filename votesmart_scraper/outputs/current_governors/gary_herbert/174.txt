Utah's economy continues to post impressive numbers. New figures released today show total job growth of 4.2 percent, while private-sector job growth increased to 4.8 percent.
"Utah's economy is the envy of the nation," said Gov. Gary R. Herbert. "It is great to see the private sector put more and more Utahns to work so they can move toward a more prosperous future. We are dedicated to working with the business community to continually strengthen Utah's position as the best state for business."
Utah's unemployment rate remained at 3.4 percent, more than two percentage points lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.5 percent.
Utah's labor force expanded at a rate of 2.1 percent last month, which represents a twelve-month high. The report demonstrates that Utahns are continuing to enter the workforce and secure employment.
Robust additions to employment occurred across a diverse mix of industries including construction, leisure and hospitality, and information. Specialty trade contractors and computer systems design subsectors witnessed double-digit year-over growth.
