Gov. Herbert signed a declaration creating "Radon Action Week" in Utah alongside three elementary students who won a radon awareness poster competition hosted by the Department of Environmental Quality.
"I need you to be my ambassadors," he told contest winners Cetera Sorensen, (11) Ani Allan (10) and Ellie Lyman (10). "Will you go back to your schools and educate your peers about radon like you've educated all of us?"
Gov. Herbert also urged the group to continue in their studies and asked them to spread the message, that to get a good job, they must get a good education.
Radon is a radioactive, colorless, odorless and tasteless gas, which occurs naturally in the soil or groundwater. A known carcinogen, it is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.
The students shared their posters with the governor, and told him what they learned:
Radon detectors can test homes' radon levels so appropriate corrective action can be taken when elevated levels are detected.
A doctor's visit could save a life if radon is detected in one's home.
Radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.
