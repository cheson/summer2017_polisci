For Stronger National Economy Rely More on State

Utah has positioned itself as one of the strongest economies in the nation thanks to a commitment to conservative economic principles and a determination to create the most business friendly environment in America.
A former businessman himself, Gov. Gary Herbert was motivated to run for office when the family business he headed began to struggle under the weight of heavy taxation and government regulation. As governor, he is now lifting the burdens he once faced in business and recommitting the state to free market principles in order to grow Utah's economy.
"I think I am a better governor because I was once a businessman," said Gov. Herbert. "I actually have run something. I've had to make payroll. I've had to deal with the intervention of the government that sometimes gets in your way and inhibits your ability to have a profitable bottom line. So, I think the real world experience of actually running a business is extremely valuable to me as a governor who really is focused on growing the economy of the State of Utah."
In the coming weeks and months, the American Comeback project will grow to include more videos focused on individual Republican governors, their personal journeys and the progress they've made toward bringing prosperity to their states.
"We've become, in Utah, by many accounts, the most business-friendly environment in America. We're getting some good results based on just basic understanding of free market principles," added Governor Herbert. "
