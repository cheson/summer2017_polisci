The 2nd Amendment guarantees the right of citizens to keep and bear arms. I strongly support that right, not just in word, but in action.
During the 2010 legislative session, my support of the 2nd Amendment, as well as the 10th, was put to the test by Senate Bill 11. This bill protects not only the right to keep and bear arms, but the right of states to regulate commerce within their own borders. Despite pressure from anti-gun groups, I signed the bill.
