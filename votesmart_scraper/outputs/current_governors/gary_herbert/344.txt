Extremely cold temperatures have led to a sudden spike in demand for propane, causing a shortage for homes in rural areas, including Uintah Basin and Wendover. In order to ensure these homes have access to heat, Governor Gary R. Herbert signed an executive order that suspends drivers' hours of service limits for any motor carrier or driver operating a commercial motor vehicle that supplies propane in response to the shortage.
"In these dangerously cold temperatures we don't want anyone going without heat in their homes," said Governor Herbert. "This is intended for the safety and welfare of impacted Utahns."
The suspension is in place for 14 days and is only allowed in times where a motor carrier or driver is providing emergency relief. The declaration also orders that no motor carrier operating under the terms of the emergency declaration require or allow an ill or fatigued driver to operate a motor vehicle.
