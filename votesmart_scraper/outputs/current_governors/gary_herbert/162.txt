After greeting President Barack Obama at Hill Air Force Base tonight, the president invited Gov. Gary R. Hebert to ride with him in the motorcade to the hotel in Salt Lake City to discuss issues important to Utah.
"It is an honor to welcome the President of the United States to Utah, particularly at Hill Air Force Base," said Gov. Herbert. "I appreciate the president's invitation to ride in the motorcade with him to his hotel, which allowed us time to discuss a number of important issues. We discussed Utah's Public Lands Initiative, our efforts to craft an alternative to Medicaid expansion and the importance of Payments in Lieu of Taxes, which many of our rural counties depend on to provide important services.
"We also talked about a proposal to reform the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to give the states greater authority in education, the importance of international trade and other issues related to the National Governors Association."
