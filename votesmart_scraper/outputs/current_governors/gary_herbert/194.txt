Gov. Gary R. Herbert met with Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican Governors Association Chair Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam at the U.S. Capitol Wednesday to discuss how states can work with the federal government on important issues this year.
"They recognize with the new change of leadership that they needed to get some things done and wanted to rely on the governors to help them with their agenda, to find out what the states' concerns were, and what we can do to help," said Gov. Herbert.
Gov. Herbert will return to Washington, D.C. next week for the National Governors Association winter meetings where he and other governors will work toward solutions to critical issues states face.
