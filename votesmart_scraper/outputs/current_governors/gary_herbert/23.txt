Gov. Gary R. Herbert and Superintendent Sydnee Dickson issued the following statement in regards to recent reports of student harassment in Utah schools:
Over the past three days, we have received numerous reports of students throughout Utah being targets of harassment and bullying in our schools. Regardless of the motivation, we do not condone of this type of behavior.
Students should feel safe in school. Harassment of any kind is not to be tolerated. These reported actions go strongly against American principles. Any form of bullying is inappropriate and can be extremely detrimental to the quality education Utah espouses. Every report of this type of behavior should be taken seriously by educators and parents.
In Utah, we care about each other. As a community, we need to come together in supportive and safe environments. We encourage students to reach out in friendship and support to others, including those who may look, sound, or think differently than themselves. As a nation, we need more kindness, and we believe Utah can lead the way.
Parents are advised that reports of children being harassed at school should be taken seriously and immediately communicated to an administrator. School employees and students are also encouraged to report instances of harassment and to actively promote a safe, positive environment.
