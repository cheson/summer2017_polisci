Utah is tied for the second lowest unemployment rate in the nation, as the state's unemployment rate dropped to 3.5 percent posting strong job growth numbers, according to figures released by the Department of Workforce Services today.
"It's great news that our unemployment rate continues to drop and we continue to see more Utahns back at work," said Gov. Gary R. Herbert. "We are third in the nation in both overall job growth (3.5 percent) and private sector job growth (3.7 percent). Our strong and diverse economic performance across every private sector comes from our commitment to fundamental, conservative principles that cultivate an environment where business can succeed."
The state unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent, down from 3.6 percent last month, adding 44,600 jobs to the economy since June 2013. All of Utah's private sector industries posted job increases this month with largest increases coming in Trade, Transportation and Utilities (9,100 jobs) followed by Construction (6,900 jobs).
The U.S. unemployment rate currently stands at 6.1 percent with job growth at 1.9 percent.
Utah's strong economic numbers come on the heels of being recognized by Pollina Corporate as the top pro-business state for the third consecutive year based on 32 factors controlled by state government.
"Seeing such a significant jump in our job growth numbers speaks volumes to the health of our expanding economy," said Juliette Tennert, chief economist for the Governor's Office of Management and Budget. "In Utah we focus on building a balanced economy that can sustain continual success and growth. I expect good things ahead for Utah."
