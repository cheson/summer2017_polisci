Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert and Treasurer David C. Damschen announced today the recent affirmation of the state's "AAA" rating by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Utah carries the Triple-A bond rating from the two agencies, and is one of only nine states to maintain the rating by all three rating agencies.
"Utah's conservative fiscal principles and debt management practices continue to provide the state with the highest credit ratings available," Gov. Herbert said.
