Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the State Liquor Authority has approved a host of advisories to help support the continued growth and development of New York's beverage manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers. On October 7th, Governor Cuomo convened the state's third Beer, Wine, Spirits and Cider Summit, where industry participants raised specific legislative and regulatory issues facing the industry. Working collaboratively with the industry, state actions to support beverage producers have resulted in the number of New York craft manufacturers more than doubling since 2011.
"This industry is a New York success story, creating jobs and economic activity, as well as some of the best beer, wine, spirts and cider in the world, Governor Cuomo said. "By enacting these reforms, we are furthering this administration's successful efforts to cut red tape, ease regulations, and make commonsense reforms to help these businesses further grow and thrive in every corner of New York."
