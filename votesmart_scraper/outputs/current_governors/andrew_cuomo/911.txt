Governor Cuomo Announces New Statewide Effort to Crack Down on Illegal Credit and Debit Card Skimmers at Gas Pumps
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 3, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the beginning of a new, statewide cooperative effort to crack down on illegal credit/debit card skimmers at gas pumps across New York, seeking to end criminals' ability to empty the bank accounts of their victims. With card data theft incidents on the rise across the country, the State Department of Agriculture and Markets' Weights and Measures Bureau is conducting New York's first-ever training and sweep of gas station dispensers across the state to proactively protect consumers and gas station owners. Agriculture and Markets staffers will train county weights and measures officials to spot skimming devices in their communities.
"Credit card fraud is a nightmare that could have a long-lasting impact on a victim's finances and credit rating," said Governor Cuomo. "With this aggressive new action, we're aiming to crackdown on this fraud before it starts by capturing these scammers in the act, and protecting the financial future of thousands of New Yorkers."
