Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 22, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"I commend President Obama and his administration for proposing an aggressive plan to help Puerto Rico address its current debt crisis," said Governor Cuomo. "As I have said before, the U.S. must step up to the plate to help Puerto Rico set out on a new path to prosperity, because its present challenges are grave and cannot be allowed to destroy the livelihood of millions of Puerto Ricans -- many with strong connections to New York. This is an important step in the right direction, and I look forward to seeing continued progress in the weeks and months to come."
