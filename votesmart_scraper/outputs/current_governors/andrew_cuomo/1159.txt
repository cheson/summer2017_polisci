Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Legionnaires' Disease
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 6, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"The State Department of Health has been working diligently on this year's Legionnaires' outbreak from its inception. We have been coordinating with health officials from across the State, including the City of New York. Yesterday I had a conversation with Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., who as the Bronx Borough President is very much at the center of the current Legionnaires' outbreak. The Borough President has shown great leadership and sensitivity and has made the point that this is a frightening health crisis that has raised many questions and caused significant anxiety among Bronx residents.
"In a situation such as this, a number of issues are posed simultaneously. This is primarily a health crisis and must be handled as such, but at the same time, we must address the needs and fears of our citizens to make sure they understand that the matter is under control. Public confidence is paramount.
