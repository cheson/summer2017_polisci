Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 11, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Vice President Joe Biden and Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today were joined by more than 300 first responders representing fire and police departments across New York State as part of the 9/11 Memorial Motorcycle Ride. The 9/11 Memorial Motorcycle Ride is designed to pay tribute to the strength, courage, and heroism of the police and fire department personnel who led the response and recovery efforts following the September 11th terrorist attacks. The riders started this morning in Albany, Ulster and Suffolk Counties before converging in New York City and continuing on to the World Trade Center site.
"Today, we honor all those who rushed into danger on September 11, who overcame their fear in order to help others," Governor Cuomo said. "We must all remember that freedom isn't free, and on that day 14 years ago, these men and women put their duty and their obligations first knowing it could cost them their life. We admire them and we hope that after all they have done for us that we show half the courage they did because they are true Americans and true New York heroes."
