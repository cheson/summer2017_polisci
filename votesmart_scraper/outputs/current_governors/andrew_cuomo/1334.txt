Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Marriage Equality Referendum in Ireland
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 23, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"This is a truly historic day for LGBT rights. The success of Ireland's referendum on marriage equality means that men and women throughout that country will no longer be denied the right to marry the person they love simply because of their sexual orientation. As the first nation to reach this milestone by popular vote, Ireland has also set a new example for what it means to stand up for equality. The Irish people have spoken, and their statement is resonating around the world.
"New York was proud to pass marriage equality in 2011, and as we celebrate today's victory in Ireland, we must also continue to work to ensure that our nation no longer denies lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender people the freedom to marry. I offer my sincere congratulations to the people of Ireland, and I look forward to the day when all American citizens are also treated equally under the law."
