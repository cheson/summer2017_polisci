Governor Cuomo Announces $20 Million Federal Grant to Fight Unemployment
Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $20 million in federal funding to support the State's efforts to get unemployed New Yorkers back to work. The grant is the largest awarded to any state and exceeds last year's total of $18 million. Since 2012, New York State has received more than $77 million from this initiative, helping more than 298,745 unemployed New Yorkers start over, with plans to help an additional 101,000 people in 2016.
"New York continues to see tremendous job growth across the State and we are committed to ensuring that every New Yorker who wants a job can find one," Governor Cuomo said. "This funding allows us to continue providing intensive career counseling that has been key helping hard-working Empire State residents find new careers and re-enter the work force."
The funding, awarded through the U.S. Department of Labor's Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment initiative, will support 210 New York State Department of Labor Career Counselors who will work with Unemployment Insurance recipients through an aggressive service model.
The model includes three mandatory one-on-one appointments, a work search plan, training assessment and referral to employment opportunities. The individuals who receive these services under this grant frequently have barriers to employment that put them at risk of exhausting their Unemployment Insurance benefits.
Acting New York State Labor Commissioner Roberta Reardon said, "Our number one priority is ensuring that out-of-work New Yorkers have the tools they need to land the jobs that are available in the community where they live. This funding will allow us to continue our work to help anyone currently collecting an unemployment check to get back to earning a paycheck instead."
