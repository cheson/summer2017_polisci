Governor Cuomo announced the launch of a $20 million Hudson Valley Agricultural Enhancement Program to help farmers in the Hudson Valley region protect valuable, at-risk farmland from future development and maintain the land's use for agricultural purposes. This unprecedented commitment to farmland protection in the Hudson Valley was announced in the Governor's Executive Budget and is the first-ever regionally targeted farmland preservation grant program.
"Farming is a rich part of New York's heritage and remains a major industry that helps drive this state's economy," Governor Cuomo said. "This historic investment will permanently protect thousands of acres of Hudson Valley farmland, growing the agricultural economy and ensuring the industry's future in the region for generations to come."
