Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 1, 2015
Location: Onondago County, NY

Governor Cuomo unveiled a sweeping $50 million redesign plan to transform the New York State Fairgrounds in Onondaga County into a year-round, premier multi-use facility that can attract more events and visitors from across the nation. The plan includes a new multi-purpose exposition center with 110,000 square feet of flexible space, an expanded festival stage to bring in larger concerts, a larger Midway to accommodate more attractions and a 400-site RV Park, as well as various parking and pedestrian safety improvements.
"The State Fair is one of Central New York's greatest economic engines, but the grounds have needed major upgrades for years. That's why we're redesigning the Fairgrounds from the bottom up," said Governor Cuomo. "This plan transforms the Fairgrounds into a world-class set of facilities that can generate economic activity and jobs all year long. This is the first step towards a new Fair, a new regional economy, and it's all part of the new Upstate New York."
