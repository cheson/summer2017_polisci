Governor Cuomo Requests Federal Waiver For Superstorm Sandy Homeowners Set to Receive FEMA Settlements
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 13, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo requested that U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Castro use his executive discretion to waive the Duplications of Benefits regulation for homeowners affected by Superstorm Sandy. Unless waived, the regulation would require impacted New Yorkers who will now be receiving additional funds from FEMA and the National Flood Insurance Program as a result of recent legal settlements to pay back funds granted to them by NY Rising.
"Waiving this requirement is not just smart policy -- it's the right thing to do," said Governor Cuomo. "In a matter of days, Superstorm Sandy turned millions of lives upside down, and many people are continuing to put back the pieces of what was lost. They deserve our full support, and I am urging HUD Secretary Castro to help us build back better."
