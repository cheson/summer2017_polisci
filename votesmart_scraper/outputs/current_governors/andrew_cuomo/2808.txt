"There are reports of a terrorist threat against New York or Washington, D.C. Our state law enforcement agencies are in contact with federal and local agencies. All New Yorkers should be cautious and aware as we prepare to commemorate the 9/11 anniversary. However, there is no reason to panic or allow our spirit of freedom to be dampened as we get ready to celebrate the opening of the Ground Zero site this weekend."
