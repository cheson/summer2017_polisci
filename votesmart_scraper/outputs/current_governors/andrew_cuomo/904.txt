Governor Cuomo Announces Nearly $1.2 Million Recovered in Refunds and Repairs For Consumers
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 5, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that nearly $1.2 million was returned to consumers in 2014 due to the work of the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles Vehicle Safety Division -- a unit tasked with investigating consumer complaints and regulating businesses statewide. The division investigates more than 3,700 wide-ranging consumer complaints each year, including issues involving vehicle dealers or repair shops accused of selling vehicles in poor condition, failing to register vehicles, committing inspection fraud, and making faulty repairs.
"These unscrupulous business practices rob New Yorkers of their hard earned money, not to mention causing potential safety hazards that put many others at risk," Governor Cuomo said. "Our message is simple: If you prey on your customers, you will be caught and you will be held accountable."
