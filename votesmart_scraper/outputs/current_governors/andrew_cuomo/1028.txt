Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the opening of a cutting-edge, $4 million state-of-the-art Toy Halls of Fame exhibit at The Strong Museum in Rochester. The exhibit, a Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development priority project, houses the National Toy Hall of Fame--which recognizes classic toys--alongside the Toy Industry Association's Toy Industry Hall of Fame--which recognizes the outstanding individuals who design, make, and sell toys. The two prestigious halls and their unique, high-tech housing is expected to draw regional and national attention as America's most beloved toys are recognized together with toy industry luminaries such as Walt Disney; George Lucas; Jim Henson; and the founders of Hasbro, LEGO, Mattel, Radio Flyer, and Toys "R" Us.
"This unique exhibit celebrates the rich history of this industry and will be yet another reason for tourists to visit the internationally recognized Strong Museum," Governor Cuomo said. "We are very excited to host this innovative attraction and urge all visitors to also see what Rochester has to offer."
