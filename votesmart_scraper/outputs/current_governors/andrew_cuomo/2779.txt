Statement from Governor Cuomo on the Taxi Summit
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 4, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"Since the City's taxi plan was introduced in June, groups have voiced strong feelings and opinions on all sides of the issue. Today my administration held a summit that brought these varying groups and views together around one table to work toward a resolution. I have said from the start our shared goal must be designing a plan that provides taxi access to the outer boroughs, access to the disabled, revenue for the City, and a plan that respects the medallion franchise. Today was an important step towards achieving this goal and discussions will continue."
