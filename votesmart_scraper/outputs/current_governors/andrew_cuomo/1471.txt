Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that construction and installation of an over-height vehicle detection system at two interchanges on the Hutchinson River Parkway in the Hudson Valley have been completed. The purpose of the systems is to identify over-height commercial vehicles illegally entering Parkway ramps -- an effort to improve safety on the Parkway. The detection systems were built at the Mamaroneck Avenue southbound ramp onto the Parkway and at the four ramps from I-287/Westchester Avenue onto the Parkway. The detection systems' functionality is currently being tested. A photo of one of the detectors can be found here.
"This administration has been focused on improving New York's transportation network and better protecting those who rely on it," Governor Cuomo said." Installing these devices will help with these goals and ensure that a vital Hudson Valley roadway safer and more reliable for those depend on it."
New York State Department of Transportation Commissioner Joan McDonald said, "Our transportation infrastructure must be taken care of in order to save travelers time and save taxpayers money. Thanks to Governor Cuomo, our parkways -- especially the Hutchinson River Parkway -- will be safer for those who live, work and travel in the Hudson Valley."
The detection systems, developed by New York State Department of Transportation, are designed to prevent commercial trucks from entering the Parkway, where they could strike low bridges. This is the latest effort by DOT to keep commercial vehicles off parkways and improve roadway safety across the State. Bridge strikes often result in serious accidents, significant traffic delays for motorists and sometimes damage to the bridges.
