Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that 30 additional groups, including End Rape on Campus, have joined the Enough is Enough campaign to combat sexual violence on college and university campuses. The advocacy groups, community organizations and unions joining the campaign today add to a long list of supporters pushing for passage of the Governor's bill to ensure that all colleges in the state implement uniform and comprehensive policies to prevent sexual violence and support victims when it does occur.
"We must do more to end the harsh reality of sexual assault on college campuses," said Governor Cuomo. "These attacks should be treated as the crimes that they are -- no matter whether they occur on public or private campuses -- and that's why the legislature must act. With only two weeks left in the legislative session, the time is now for the Senate and Assembly to pass our bill. New York's college students have waited long enough."
"As a mother and a public official, ensuring the safety of our young people on college campuses takes on a special importance for me," said Lieutenant Governor Hochul. "Sexual assault has no place on our campuses -- period. I have held countless sexual assault roundtables across the state, met with the survivors, and heard pleas to fix our broken system. Thankfully, Governor Cuomo has provided us the chance to enact the toughest sexual assault policy in the country. With the closing days of the legislative session before us, we call on our state legislature to step up and safeguard college students all across the state."
