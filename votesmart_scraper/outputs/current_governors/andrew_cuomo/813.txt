Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the launch of a new 'Kitchen Table Toolkit' as part of the New York State Combat Heroin and Prescription Opioid Abuse campaign. This toolkit features two new videos which can be used by parents, teachers and community members to help begin conversations with youth concerning the health risks and dangerous consequences of heroin and prescription painkiller abuse.
"Talking about substance abuse and the disease of addiction can be a difficult conversation, but it can be a life-saving one," said Governor Cuomo. "This toolkit is a valuable resource for communities, school districts, and families across our state to help start serious conversations about the disease of addiction and the inherent dangers of drug use and experimentation."
