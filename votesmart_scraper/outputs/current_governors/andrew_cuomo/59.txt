Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 4, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"The President's Executive Order is a blatant and unabashed attempt to, among other things, attack the fundamental right that women have to control their own health. Under the guise of promoting free speech and protecting individual liberties, it tramples on women's rights and undermines our values of freedom and equality.
"As Washington seeks to limit the rights of women, New York continues to protect them. New York has long-standing protections against discrimination based on gender or personal choices regarding family and health, including the first Human Rights Law in the nation, and we will continue to stand up for the rights of all New Yorkers.
"Earlier this year, my administration took strong action to ensure that the full range of contraceptive drugs and devices are covered by commercial health insurance policies without co-pays, coinsurance, or deductibles. New York will remain a state where all women have cost-free access to reproductive health care."
