Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Office of Emergency Management are deploying a fleet of 24 fully equipped Emergency Response Trailers across New York's crude oil transportation corridor. The state-of-the-art trailers will be stationed at key locations and strengthen New York's response to crude oil transportation incidents in support of the state's recently developed Geographic Response Plans.
"Protecting public safety is our top priority and these new trailers will help ensure our first responders can respond swiftly and efficiently in any spill emergency," Governor Cuomo said. "This administration remains committed to enforcing the toughest possible standards and we will continue working so that crude oil is transported safely across New York."
The new Emergency Response Trailers will be stationed across the state and managed by DEC and county entities responsible for emergency management. Locations for trailer deployment will be coordinated with DEC's Division of Environmental Remediation Emergency Response Coordination Section and based on approved Geographic Response Plans. The GRPs include strategies and tactics to respond to crude oil incidents that are specific to each as identified by local county emergency planning committees.
