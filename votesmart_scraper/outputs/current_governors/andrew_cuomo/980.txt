Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that work is set to begin on a $13.9 million project to resurface 16.2 miles of State Routes 106, 231 and 25A in the towns of North Hempstead, Oyster Bay, Smithtown, Riverhead and Babylon. The work is part of $75 million in paving projects that were accelerated to repair widespread damage caused by deep frost last winter.
