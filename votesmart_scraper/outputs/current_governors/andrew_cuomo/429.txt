Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Puerto Rico Debt Relief Bill
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 9, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"I applaud the House of Representatives for finally passing legislation that can bring an end to the debt crisis in Puerto Rico. While this bill is not perfect, it represents a path forward that can help ease some of the island's immediate issues, while setting up a structure that can hopefully create robust long-term economic growth. New York will continue to stand with Governor Padilla and the island of Puerto Rico. I now call on the Senate to act quickly and send this bill to the President for his signature."
