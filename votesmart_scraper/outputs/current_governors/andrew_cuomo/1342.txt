Statement from Governor Cuomo on Finale of "Late Show With David Letterman"
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 20, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"For more than 30 years, we've all stayed up later than we should to watch the comedic genius of David Michael Letterman. From his Stupid Pet Tricks and Top Ten lists to always keeping guests on their toes -- New Yorkers and Americans alike have happily traded rest for reveling in the Late Show's best moments. The Letterman approach to late night gave us something we could relate to and will always appreciate, as the stars of his show were often everyday New Yorkers. In the wake of 9/11, he helped us heal and brought us together with his strength, compassion and inspiration. Night in and night out, throughout thousands of tapings and guests from around the world, Dave made it clear that he felt lucky to be in the middle of New York City. Together with his stalwart sidekick Paul Shaffer, he ushered in a new generation of late night comedy that has both inspired and influenced countless comedians and hosts. After tonight, we will all feel a little lost without our late night legend -- but also a little relieved that we no longer have to worry about objects flying off the roof of the Ed Sullivan Theater.
"Last year, I was honored to appear on the Late Show to reveal the "Top Ten Ways New York State is Better Than Ever.' When Dave announced his retirement, we created our own Top Ten list in his honor. Today, on behalf of all New Yorkers, we have a new No. 1: Thank you Dave -- we'll miss you."
