Governor Cuomo Directs 1 World Trade Center to be Lit Orange in Honor of Gun Violence Awareness Month
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 30, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Tonight, in recognition of Gun Violence Awareness Month, I am directing One World Trade Center be lit orange as a tribute to the victims lost in Orlando and all those around the world who have been affected by gun violence.
"New York took bold action in 2013 to pass the strongest gun safety legislation in the nation, strengthening background checks and banning assault weapons like those used in reprehensible mass murders across the country.
"New York showed the nation it's possible to pass sensible gun reforms with the support of both Democrats and Republicans -- and now Congress must follow suit. The failure of the federal government to act on gun violence is not only appalling, but dangerous. Congress was founded on the principal that it would fairly represent the views of the people -- yet today, despite overwhelming public opinion, it has been taken hostage by special interests.
"Democrats continue to fight to advance common sense gun safety laws, even holding a sit in on the House floor to force a vote. But clearly the NRA still has a stranglehold on too many members of Congress who lack the courage to do right by the American people. Congress must stop this madness and act now to pass a strong national gun safety bill to protect all Americans."
