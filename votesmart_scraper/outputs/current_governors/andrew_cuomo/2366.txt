Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that New York will dedicate a portion of the Federal Sandy funds to cover the cost of raising or relocating power lines to accommodate New Yorkers whose houses are still under construction and must be elevated to comply with codes. By covering this cost, ratepayers and homeowners will not have to foot the bill for this project. The Governor's office, together with the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), has developed a plan to cover the costs of raising or relocating its power lines without charging property owners, and to coordinate with municipal buildings department in the affected areas to ensure that building permits will not be delayed.

"We want to make sure that New Yorkers who are recovering from Hurricane Sandy do not face additional financial burdens or costs," said Governor Cuomo. "The state is footing the bill for these adjustments to our power lines to help our communities recover and to make our state safer and more prepared for future natural disasters."

Richard Kauffman, Chairman of Energy and Finance, sent a letter to Scott J. Mandel, City Council President of Long Beach, informing him of LIPA's plans and how the state intends to cover the cost. Many homes throughout the flood zone including homes in Long Beach, the Rockaways, Breezy Point, Island Park, Oceanside, and Fire Island were severely damaged and will need to be rebuilt and raised to meet the applicable code requirements. New York State is fully committed to providing the assistance necessary to help homeowners rebuild in a mitigated fashion while also ensuring that ratepayers on Long Island do not shoulder the bills for related costs.
