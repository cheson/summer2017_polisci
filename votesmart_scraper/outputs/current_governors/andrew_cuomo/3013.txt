Issue Position

Location: Unknown

We must make New York the jobs capital of the nation and get unemployed New Yorkers back to work. We will give businesses a tax credit of up to $3,000 for each unemployed New Yorker hired for a new job. We must also replace New York's ineffective economic development efforts with a new strategy organized around regional industry clusters; reduce the high costs of doing business in the state; and support small businesses by increasing access to capital and streamlining regulatory barriers.
