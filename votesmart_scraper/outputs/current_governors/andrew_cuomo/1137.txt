Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 12, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that during the first seven months of 2015, $18,143,000 was returned to nearly 19,000 workers who originally were not paid the proper minimum wage, overtime pay or fringe benefits. This amount represents a six percent increase over the same time period last year, and is on pace to beat the record $30.2 million disbursed to 27,000 in 2014.
"New York has zero tolerance for those who seek to deny an honest day's pay for an honest day's work," Governor Cuomo said. "We will continue to aggressively protect workers from exploitation and crack down on wage theft in all of its forms."
