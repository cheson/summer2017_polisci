Statement from Governor Cuomo, Senate Majority Leader Flanagan, and Assembly Speaker Heastie
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 18, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Negotiations on a range of issues important to the people of New York State remain ongoing and are moving in a positive direction toward a resolution. As discussions continue through the weekend, the Assembly and Senate have agreed to pass -- and the Governor has agreed to sign -- a five day extender of New York City's rent regulations that will codify into law important safeguards for more than two million tenants.
"This year's legislative session has already seen real accomplishments for this State -- from landmark education investment, a fifth timely and responsible budget, major investments in infrastructure and Upstate economic renewal, and new protections to help combat the epidemic of sexual assault on college campuses. There are important issues that still must be addressed and by working collaboratively, we remain confident that the 2015 legislative session will end with the passage of additional reforms to help keep New York moving forward."
