Governor Cuomo Lights World Trade Center to Honor Victims of Earthquake in Italy
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 25, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

This evening, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo has directed the lights of One World Trade Center's 408-foot spire to be displayed in the green, white and red colors of the Italian flag to honor victims of the earthquake in Italy.
Italy's influence touches every community across New York -- from its vibrant culture to the more than 2.7 million Italian Americans who call the Empire State their home. New York and Italy are more than allies. We are family.
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my condolences to the men, women and children who lost their lives from the earthquake that devastated Italy," Governor Cuomo said. "The people of Italy have shown courage and resilience throughout this natural disaster, and New Yorkers continue to keep them in our thoughts and prayers. While the true extent of the damage is still to be determined, we are closely monitoring the situation. New York stands ready to lend our support in the weeks and months to come -- just as Italy did for New Yorkers in our time of need."
