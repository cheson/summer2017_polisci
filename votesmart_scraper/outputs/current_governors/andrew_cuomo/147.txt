Governor Cuomo Announces Comprehensive Plan to Better Protect New Yorkers from Deceptive Telemarketing Practices
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 1, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a comprehensive plan to protect New Yorkers from deceptive telemarketing practices at a time when the number of Do Not Call complaints in New York State is on the rise. The initiative centers around newly signed legislation requiring telemarketers to use correct caller identification information and also includes deploying Division of Consumer Protection staff throughout the State to warn consumers about telemarketing scams and facilitate same-day consumer complaint filing, as well as increasing transparency in Do Not Call Law enforcement by posting settlements with violators.
"Despite already being listed on the Do Not Call registry, New Yorkers continue to find themselves bombarded by calls from opportunists looking to defraud them out of their hard-earned money," Governor Cuomo said. "This unscrupulous behavior and disregard of the law is unacceptable and we're taking action to not only hold those who violate the law accountable, but also increase transparency and stop these deceiving marketing practices in their tracks."
New York Secretary of the State Rossana Rosado said, "Unwanted telemarketing calls continue to be a nuisance to New Yorkers and a wasted sales effort for businesses. In New York State, if a phone number is on the Do Not Call Registry at the time of the telemarketer's initial unwanted sales call, its residents have a place to go when they are victims."
