Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today directed the Port Authority to take a multifaceted, comprehensive series of actions in coordination with local communities to address noise issues at its New York City airports. The agency will also be stepping up the review of noise data with the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency's overall goal is to address noise concerns while supporting growth at the airports, which annually generate billions of dollars in economic activity and wages and support more than 500,000 regional jobs.
"Airport noise is rightly an important concern for residents of Queens, the Bronx and Nassau County and that is why I am directing the Port Authority to open a full and thorough dialogue with the impacted communities while also pursuing a noise study to better address the issue," Governor Cuomo said. "We will listen to local residents and ensure their input is used to make both JFK and LaGuardia airports better neighbors."
"Catalyzed by Governor Cuomo's directive to the Port Authority on this issue, the Port Authority has taken big steps in addressing noise surrounding our airports,'' said Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye. "We are committed to working with all communities we operate in to address their concerns, while bringing JFK and LaGuardia airports into the 21st Century and maintaining the viability of our airports as major economic engines for the metropolitan region."
"The Port Authority understands it must strive to be a good neighbor in the communities where its airports are located and we will seek noise mitigation with the FAA where feasible," said Port Authority Aviation Director Thomas Bosco.
