Governor Cuomo Issues Statement on Congress Passing the Surface Transportation Authorization Bill
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 29, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"I applaud Congress for producing a bi-partisan surface transportation bill that keeps tens of thousands of New York construction workers employed and supports over 19 million New Yorkers who use our roads, bridges, and trains daily. Passage of the bill also means a huge boost for the Tappan Zee Bridge replacement project. New York is in a group of projects that received strong ratings on their applications for TIFIA funding, which was dramatically increased in this legislation. Businesses and communities around the state need long-term stable infrastructure investment to sustain jobs and support economic recovery. Working with our Congressional Delegation and many of our industry and labor partners, New York has demonstrated to the rest of Congress that infrastructure investment leads to economic development, growth, and jobs."
