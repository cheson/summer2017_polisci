Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Adoption of 2017-2026 Port Authority Capital Plan
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 16, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"The Port Authority's $32 billion, 10-year capital plan ensures New York will continue to move forward with the nation's most ambitious infrastructure program. The plan provides Port Authority capital funds to redevelop LaGuardia and JFK airports, construct a LaGuardia AirTrain, deliver on the states' commitment to the Gateway Tunnel Project, and build the Moynihan Train Hall. These projects are essential for our economic vitality as a state and a region.
"At long last, New York is on its way to having airports worthy of this great state. This plan ensures that both LaGuardia and JFK airports will become the 21st century airports that New York deserves, while accommodating the extraordinary passenger growth projected in the future.
"LaGuardia will also no longer stand alone as the only major East Coast airport without a rail connection. The LaGuardia AirTrain will guarantee a 30-minute ride from Midtown Manhattan and a seamless regional connection via the Long Island Railroad -- while taking cars off congested Queens roadways.
"This plan transforms rail access to New York City with significant support for the Gateway Tunnel Project and a modern Moynihan Train Hall -- which will be part of a world-class transportation hub for commuters and visitors.
"This plan is a huge step forward for New York and the region and shows once again that no challenge is too big for our state to take on."
