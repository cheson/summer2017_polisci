Governor Cuomo today awarded $2.5 million in College Access Challenge Grants (CACG) to programs that will help thousands of low income students obtain a college degree
These programs, run by organizations and schools across the state, provide crucial services including academic support for students at risk of dropping out, training for high school guidance counselors serving low income students and college financing workshops. Last year, these CACG funded programs helped more than 47,000 New Yorkers apply for and succeed in college.
"We are investing in a brighter future for students who might not otherwise get a degree or attend college," Governor Cuomo said. "Education is the key to success, and it's important that we create opportunities, especially for those who want to go to college but don't have the means. I want to thank our partners in the federal government and HESC for their effort and dedication to providing higher education to all New Yorkers."
The CACG grants were awarded by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) to fifteen community-based organizations statewide that support services for high need students and their families. Funding for these grants come from a $7.6 million grant received by the state in 2010.
"These funds help regional and statewide organizations reach thousands of students and families with services that build a solid foundation for achieving a college education," said Elsa Magee, Acting President of HESC. "HESC is proud to play such a meaningful role in carrying out higher education initiatives that help underrepresented students living in New York."
