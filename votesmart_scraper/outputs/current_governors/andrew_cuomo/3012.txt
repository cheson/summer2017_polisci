Issue Position: Rightsizing Government
Issue Position
By: Andrew Cuomo
Location: Unknown

Government in New York is too big, ineffective and expensive. We must enlist the best private sector minds to help overhaul our more than 1,000 state agencies, authorities and commissions and reduce their number by 20 percent. We must make it easier to consolidate or share services among our more than 10,000 local governments.
