Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Senate Republican Health Care Bill
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 22, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"The Senate Republican health care bill continues the ultra-conservative assault on New Yorkers and our values. Senate Republicans have broken their promise to protect the American people and are trying to pass an inhumane piece of legislation that hurts middle class New Yorkers, discriminates against women, defunds Planned Parenthood, and turns its back on the most vulnerable Americans.

"Like the disastrous House proposal, this bill will strip coverage from millions of New Yorkers, cost New York State billions of dollars, and devastate our health care system. Senate Republicans have intensified the war on Medicaid services that New Yorkers rely on. And by keeping the reckless Collins-Faso Amendment, this bill targets New York and threatens to slash an additional $2.3 billion in Medicaid funding for the state, leading to devastating cuts to our hospitals, nursing homes, and home care providers.

"In New York, we believe that health care is a human right. That is why earlier this month, we took aggressive actions to ensure that whatever happens in Washington, essential health benefits will continue to be the rule in New York, not the exception. Today I stand with our Senate delegation in opposing this disastrous bill, and I call on all New Yorkers to make their voices heard. Together, we will continue to fight for quality and affordable health care coverage and safeguard the rights of all New Yorkers."
