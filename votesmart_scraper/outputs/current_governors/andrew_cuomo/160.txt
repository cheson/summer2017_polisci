Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Recent Incidents of Bias, Discrimination
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 17, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"New York and this nation were founded on the premise that we are all created equal. In the weeks that have followed the election, that promise has rung hollow for too many New Yorkers and Americans.
"Hate crimes have spiked across the country and this state has not been spared. Last night, fliers glorifying the KKK were found distributed on cars in Patchogue. This morning, a swastika was discovered on the B train in Manhattan. These are just the latest incidents. My administration has launched a number of investigations into hate crimes targeting minorities and immigrants.
"I call on all public officials, of all parties, and indeed, all people everywhere, to denounce and repudiate these expressions, and to pledge to punish to the full extent of the law anyone engaged in such acts. To remain silent is to engage in a dangerous new permissiveness that threatens our American way.
"Let me be very clear: These acts of hate and intolerance go against everything New York stands for. We have welcomed generations of immigrants with open arms. This state will continue that proud legacy -- we will not turn our backs and we will not let this heated rhetoric divide us. We will stand strong united in the face of intolerance and show the world that we are one people, one family, and one New York."
