Governor Cuomo Announces Designation of 11 New Brownfield Opportunity Areas
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 3, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the designation of 11 new Brownfield Opportunity Areas in communities across New York State. The program helps participants develop revitalization strategies focused on returning dormant and blighted areas into productive communities of economic growth and development. Projects in these areas will be given priority status for grants and the project developers may access additional Brownfield Cleanup Program tax credit incentives.
"These designations are a vital first step in transforming and revitalizing lands left to ruin in communities across the Empire State," said Governor Cuomo. "Despite being ignored for years, these sites each have tremendous potential for developing local economies and this new status gives these areas greater access to state resources needed to get projects underway as soon as possible."
