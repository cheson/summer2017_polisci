Press Release

Date: July 25, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a new I Love NY advertising campaign to promote Oswego Harborfest. The ad highlights the attractions of the free, four day festival, including live music, fireworks, and the James E. Strates Midway.
The 29th annual Harborfest will take place from July 28 to July 31 on the shores of Lake Ontario. The new ads are part of a $50 million statewide marketing initiative, enacted by Governor Cuomo in the 2016-2017 Executive Budget.
"Harborfest is a great Central New York tradition that showcases the very best of Oswego," Governor Cuomo said. "I'm proud that this festival is supported by the I Love New York program and I encourage New Yorkers and visitors alike to take a drive and check out this festival and the many other attractions and activities this region has to offer."
The ad will run until July 29 on television networks in the Watertown, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester and Albany-Schenectady-Troy markets and online in the Central New York, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, Capital Region and North Country regions.
Earlier this month, a new record-high economic impact of tourism in New York State of $102 billion was announced -- an increase of 25 percent since 2010.
Empire State Development President, CEO & Commissioner Howard Zemsky said, "Oswego's 2016 Harborfest is the go-to place to enjoy live performances and make memories with friends and family this summer. With great music, art and craft vendors, family-friendly activities and much more, there's something for everyone at the 29th Annual Oswego Harborfest. I encourage both residents and visitors to attend this event on the beautiful shores of Lake Ontario."
