Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today held a storm briefing in Western New York on the current winter storm conditions, where there is in some areas more than five feet of lake effect snow already on the ground, with up to two more feet expected. The State has been working around the clock to rescue motorists stuck on the Thruway and other state roads, as well as provide help to other New Yorkers affected by the storm. All occupants of passenger vehicles have been evacuated, and there are 45 commercial vehicles that have chosen to wait out the storm at Thruway service areas after being checked on by State teams. The New York State Police urge anyone needing immediate help to call 911.
The Governor declared a State of Emergency Tuesday night for affected counties so that residents can receive as much assistance as possible. With a significant amount of snow expected again today and tomorrow, the Governor has instructed the National Guard, the New York State Police, and all state agencies to prepare to help affected residents and roadways. State offices remain closed today in the counties declared States of Emergency.
"Tremendous progress has been made in clearing vital roads, with help getting here yesterday and more help on the way," Governor Cuomo said. "With that being said, phase two of the storm is on its way and safety continues to be our top priority. As snow removal efforts continue, we urge people to stay inside and off the roads so that we can get people back to their everyday routines as quickly as possible."
