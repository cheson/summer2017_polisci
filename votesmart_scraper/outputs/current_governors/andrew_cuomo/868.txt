Governor Cuomo announced that New York State is partnering with Walmart, Wegmans, the National Supermarket Association, The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo and FreshDirect this Thanksgiving Week to help deliver meals to feed more than 35,000 people statewide.
"Each year, Thanksgiving provides a time to not only join with family and friends to reflect on what we are grateful for, but it is also a time to help fellow New Yorkers," Governor Cuomo said. "The partnerships we have forged with these companies ensure that families throughout the state will have a warm, nutritious meal that they can enjoy with loved ones. As the holiday season continues, I encourage all New Yorkers to find ways to pitch in and do something to help someone in need."
