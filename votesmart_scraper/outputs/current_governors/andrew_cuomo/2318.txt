Governor Cuomo Launches Grant Program For Projects to Support Cleaner, Greener Communities in Central New York
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 27, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $30 in the first round of funding for the implementation of regional sustainability plans, including a plan recently endorsed by the Central New York Regional Economic Development Council. The plans were developed under the governor's $100 million Cleaner, Greener Communities program, a major statewide initiative to invest in smart growth planning and sustainability.
"This first round of funding will put each region's sustainability plans to action," Governor Cuomo said. "Through the Cleaner, Greener Communities program, regions across the state have developed plans from the bottom up, building on their assets and identifying needs, to create green jobs for New Yorkers while investing in projects that improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution. These plans will help accelerate our clean energy economy and improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers."
VisionCNY, as the plan is called, outlines the region's vision, goals and objectives for a sustainable future, identifies a number of regional assets and makes recommendations for building on those assets. It provides a framework that leverages the area's unique character and assets, and integrates and advances its natural, built, human and social and financial capital, which serve as the foundations of it environment, economy and society.
A consortium of dozens of municipal leaders and organizations completed the plan, which estimates that, if fully implemented, the plan will help generate thousands of jobs in Central New York while lowering energy costs by nearly $1 billion and eliminating 4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and associated greenhouse gas emissions.
