Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that he is beginning a new online, interactive educational project as part of his ongoing initiative to increase openness and transparency in government. Working with input from educators, parent groups, and school administrators, the Governor will launch a weekly interactive webcast series called "Albany at Work" aimed at helping high school students learn about and keep updated on the workings of New York State government.
"Albany at Work" webcasts will take place during the legislative session and will be posted online for all New Yorkers to view. The webcasts will feature a weekly review of the actions and operations of state government and a preview of upcoming activity. Over a dozen schools have already signed on to include the webcasts as part of their lesson plans.
The webcasts will also feature a segment called "Ask Albany" in which students can submit questions about government that will be answered directly by state officials. Governor Cuomo will also invite state legislators and officials to address questions from students.
"My administration is committed to including citizens in the workings of their government," Governor Cuomo said. "Empowering students with knowledge about the state government and engaging them in an active dialogue is an important part of this process. By partnering with schools and educators from throughout New York, we can teach students about the challenges we face and help them learn how to work together to solve them."
Chancellor of the Board of Regents Merryl Tisch said, "I am glad Governor Cuomo is launching such an ambitious project to bring the workings of government to life for high school students. The Regents believe that knowledge of how public policy is formed and implemented is an important element of readiness for college, work and citizenship."
United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew said, "New Yorkers need to understand the activities of our government to help them maintain a voice in the operations of our state. Governor Cuomo's program will help get students involved in the processes of their government and will encourage active participation in civic life."
NYSUT President Richard C. Iannuzzi said, "Citizen participation in government is the foundation of a robust democracy, and a way for all New Yorkers to be heard on the important issues of the day. Inviting students of all ages to use the Internet to learn more about how state government works will lead to greater public engagement, and that can only be a positive as New York moves forward in the days to come."
New York State PTA President Dr. Maria Fletcher said, "NYS PTA commends the Governor for offering the opportunity to students to involve themselves in state government. He has pledged to 'open up the Capitol'; the planned webcasts demonstrate he is seriously attempting to engage state constituents. Engaging students is a laudable first step."
NYS School Boards Association Executive Director Timothy G. Kremer said, "I applaud Governor Cuomo for his efforts to increase transparency in government through this interactive educational program. Students will be able to see how their government operates and will learn about the issues of the day."
New York State Council of School Superintendents Executive Director Robert Reidy said, "These webcasts will help educate students about how their state government affects them and their communities. What's more, this project is a big step in the right direction toward bringing transparency to Albany and promoting dialogue between public officials and the people they serve."
School Administrators Association of New York State Executive Director Kevin Casey said, "Citizen participation in government is crucial. By providing important knowledge about the structure and activities of state government, Governor Cuomo's education project will help teach students how to become involved in the world around them."
New York Charter Schools Association President Bill Phillips said, "This initiative will enrich learning by bringing real life experiences about state government directly to students. Rather than merely reading about state government in a textbook, Governor Cuomo's proposal will connect the workings of state government directly to the classroom in a way to show its relevance and importance to students' daily lives -- and their future."
Executive Director of the Conference of Big 5 School Districts Georgia Asciutto said, "With this project, students from all across New York will be able to get a hands-on lesson in civics. I congratulate Governor Cuomo for his leadership in opening up Albany, encouraging New Yorkers to get involved in their State government and for cultivating the future leaders of our State."
Albany Public School District Superintendent Raymond Colucciello said, "This educational project presents a wonderful way to get students involved in discussing the issues of the day and learning about how they can make change through state government. I applaud Governor Cuomo for his devotion to involving all New Yorkers in civic life."
Buffalo Public School District Superintendent James A. Williams said, "I am proud to have our District involved in Governor Cuomo's education initiative. Through this project, students will be able to see the real workings of state government and interact with our elected leaders."
Principal Ellen Sherman of the Academy of American Studies High School in Queens said, "Governor Cuomo's initiative is an innovative approach to teaching government that will allow students to get their questions about government answered directly by elected officials via webcast. I am excited that my school will be participating in this program."
Alexis Kirschbaum, an Advanced Placement United States Government teacher at Staten Island Technical High School, said, "I am excited that our school will be participating in Governor Cuomo's educational initiative and that our students will have this incredible opportunity to be actively engaged with their government officials. The leadership of the Governor will help our students develop a greater degree of civic participation and responsibility for their role in New York's future."
