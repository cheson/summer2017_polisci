Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 23, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that temporary lane closures associated with road and bridge construction projects on New York State highways will not be permitted from 6 a.m. on Wednesday, November 25, to 6 a.m. on Monday, November 30, in order to accommodate motorists during the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel week. Some work may continue behind permanent concrete barriers or for emergency repairs.
"The Thanksgiving holiday is one of the busiest travel periods of the year, so starting Wednesday, the state will temporarily suspend major construction projects to reduce traffic congestion and delays," Governor Cuomo said. "This action puts drivers first by getting them where they need to go faster and with less aggravation this holiday weekend."
