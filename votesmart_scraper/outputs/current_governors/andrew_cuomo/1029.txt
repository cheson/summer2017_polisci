Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today announced that 30 notable civil rights groups and prominent civil rights and community leaders have joined the Mario Cuomo Campaign for Economic Justice, a statewide initiative aimed building support for a $15 minimum wage for all workers in New York State. The announcement came at the Fifth Annual Amsterdam News Labor Breakfast where Governor Cuomo was presented with the outlet's Labor Champion Award.
"Raising the minimum wage isn't just a matter of economics, it's a matter of civil rights," Governor Cuomo said. "The current minimum wage has trapped millions of hard working New Yorkers in poverty and has prevented them from finding a way out of it. This vicious cycle has left them at a permanent disadvantage and the time for change is now."
