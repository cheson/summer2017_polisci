Upstate Business Leaders Join Governor Cuomo's Campaign to Raise the Minimum Wage
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 17, 2015
Location: Unknown

Governor Cuomo announced that business leaders across Upstate New York have joined the "Fight for Fair Pay" campaign to raise the minimum wage in New York this year. These 44 business leaders join 41 from Downstate representing broad private sector support -- including some of New York's most prominent business leaders and an array of small businesses -- for the Governor's proposal, which increases the minimum wage from the current $8.75 to proposed $10.50 statewide and $11.50 in New York City.
"As our economy comes back with new jobs and growth, we must do everything we can to ensure all New Yorkers are part of our new economic momentum," Governor Cuomo said. "Raising the minimum wage statewide will give our lowest wage workers a much needed boost, while injecting billions of dollars into local economies across Upstate New York. I thank theses business leaders for recognizing that our proposal to raise the minimum wage will be good for workers and good for business, and look forward to working together to see this increase passed this year."
In total, 1.3 million New Yorkers will experience higher wages as a result of the minimum wage increase, which translates into a $3.4 billion direct economic value statewide -- meaning that more New Yorkers will have more money to spend on goods and services in their community. During the last six increases in New York State's minimum wage, employment subsequently increased in industries with many minimum wage workers.

A chart of the regional breakdown of the $3.4 billion in direct economic value and 1.3 million New Yorkers who will experience higher wages as a result of the increase is available here.
The Governor is urging New Yorkers to join the #Fight4FairPay campaign by contacting their State Legislators; details are available on the Fight for Fair Pay website.
A reasonable minimum wage can help improve the standard of living for workers, reduce poverty, encourage fair and more efficient business practices, and ensure that the most vulnerable members of the workforce can contribute to the economy. An increase in the minimum wage will affect women and adults most, and lift more than 100,000 New Yorkers out of poverty.
More than 594,000 New Yorkers earn the current minimum wage of $8.75 per hour. The State has taken action to raise the minimum wage incrementally from $7.25, when Governor Cuomo came to office, to $9.00 by the end of 2015. This progress has been important, but it has not been enough to make up fully for a trend that had seen the minimum wage fall far below the average hourly wage in the state, now over $30. The Governor proposes to again raise the minimum wage to increase earnings for many wage earners in low-income households, which will also aid local economies.
Capital Region
Ted Potrikus, Retail Council of NYS said, "Retailers across New York understand that when their workers earn a higher minimum wage, two important things happen. First, the extra wages will help many households with low income and second, the extra pay in workers pockets returns to the local economy. That's why we support Governor Cuomo's efforts to raise the minimum wage, it is a win-win for our members and their employees."
Jim Pascarell, President of nfrastructure said, "Ensuring economic vitality within a community is critical to achieving sustainable growth into the future. By raising New York's minimum wage from $8.75 to $10.50 statewide and $11.50 in New York City, more than 1.2 million people will experience higher wages. Billions of dollars in additional economic activity will in turn be generated -- spent and invested, spurring private sector growth in the Capital Region and beyond. It is for this reason that I support the Governor's proposal to raise the minimum wage."
Omar Usmani, Executive Partner at Aeon Nexus Corporation said, "Our economy flourishes when citizens have more income to spend. By raising the minimum wage to $10.50 statewide, nearly 83,000 people in the Capital Region will have an additional $156.8 million to spend on their education, their homes, goods and services throughout our community. This growth is key to the success of the Capital Region's economy and I support raising New York State's minimum wage."
Mohawk Valley
Doug Plummer and Garth Roberts, owners of the American Hotel said, "As a small business owner for the past 20 years, we have witnessed firsthand the lack of sustainability a minimum wage job offers an employee. Raising the minimum wage is a practical approach to ensuring increased economic activity. By increasing the income of our low-wage workers, the Mohawk Valley is injected with millions of dollars in new spending and revenue for local businesses. Increased spending on goods and services is exactly what we need to keep growing and thriving here in this regoin -- which is why we support raising New York's minimum wage. It is also quite simply the right thing to do."
Tony Colon, President and CEO of Solutions by Technologic, LLC said, "An increase in the minimum wage will be great for Mohawk Valley businesses -- including businesses here in Utica. By raising the minimum wage to $10.50 statewide, consumers in the Mohawk Valley will have more than $58 million of additional earnings to spend and invest in our community. Therefore, I urge the Legislature to pass the Governor's proposal this session."
Southern Tier
Samuel Nasca, Chairman of Hornell IDA said, "Increasing the minimum wage is not just good for workers -- it's great for business, too. Because workers will earn more money, they will apply their new disposable income to the purchase of local goods and services from businesses across Hornell and in the greater Southern Tier. I believe in economic growth, which is why I support raising the minimum wage to $10.50 statewide."
Barbara Schindler, President of Golden Artists Colors said, "When we raise the minimum wage to a level that offers the potential to sustain low wage earners, organizations make the statement that employees' work is valued and their labor has not been purchased at a discount. In the Southern Tier, direct economic value close to $82 million will be generated from the increased pay, and much of that will be spent and invested right back here. For that reason, raising the minimum wage is good for business and good for our community."
Sherry Eaton, owner of Garland Gallery said, "It's time to fuel the true engine of economic growth -- the consumer -- by empowering them to spend and invest more money in the Southern Tier economy. More than 43,000 people in our region will experience a higher wage when the minimum wage is increased to $10.50 as Governor Cuomo has proposed. I encourage my state legislators to pass the Governor's proposal this session so that the Southern Tier economy can continue moving forward."
Finger Lakes
Sergio Esteban, Chairman & CEO of LaBella Associates said, "Businesses in the Finger Lakes stand to benefit greatly from an increase in New York's minimum wage. A bump from the current $8.75 to proposed $10.50 will lift the compensation levels of more than 89,000 of our region's prospective customers, improving their quality of life and injecting more than $168 million into our communities. When people have more money in their pocket, they spend more money at our area businesses -- which is why I support the Governor's minimum wage proposal."
Tyrone Reaves, President of Truform Manufacturing said, "Business is based on supply and demand. As demand increases, we must meet it by ramping up production and increasing supply. By raising the minimum wage as Governor Cuomo is proposing, we will empower more families to spend and invest in their communities. Because this is sure to help more families meet their basic needs, it will lead to increased demand. I support raising the minimum wage to $10.50 statewide."
Marci Muller, owner of Renewable Property Maintenance Services said, "Raising New York's minimum wage will help thousands of families across the state further invest in their communities and their future. Governor Cuomo's minimum wage proposal would add billions of dollars of economic value to New York -- which presents a tremendous opportunity for growth for thousands of businesses in the Empire State."
Chris Hansen, co-owner of Climbing Bines Craft Ale Company said, "We are proud to be a member of the vibrant Finger Lakes community. That's why we support the Governor's proposal to raise the minimum wage from the current $8.75 to $10.50 statewide; it will give nearly 90,000 of our community members a higher wage, empowering them to spend and invest here at home. Because that's good for business and good for the Finger Lakes, I encourage our state legislators to pass the Governor's proposal this session."
Dick Rapach, President and CEO of Velocitii said, "The business community of the Finger Lakes region stands to benefit from an increase of the minimum wage. Governor Cuomo is proposing raising the minimum wage to $10.50 statewide and $11.50 in New York City -- which will add more than $168 million in economic value here in the Finger Lakes. This is a good move for business -- which is why I support the Governor's proposal."
Central New York
Sam Haines, CEO of Gear Motions said, "By raising the minimum wage to $10.50, tens of thousands of more people in Central New York will have a collective $105.5 million that they will be able to spend -- giving the economy here the boost it deserves. That's powerful for business, which is why I urge my state legislators to raise the minimum wage to $10.50 this session."
Jim Daddabbo, Managing Partner of Mesa Grande Taqueria, LLC. said, "I believe a rising tide can and should lift all boats. But I don't want to know that my boat was lifted because everyone else's boats were sunk. Raising the minimum wage will help to restore balance to an economy that has left those with a lesser voice behind. It will be good for businesses large and small. It will be good for our communities and for individuals. This is why I support raising the minimum wage."
Laura Miller, General Manager Darco Manufacturing said, "We know that in order to grow business, you must increase sales. Raising the minimum wage will put more money in peoples' pockets, giving them greater spending power to go out and shop and dine in communities throughout Central New York. Because we are in favor of a strong business and strong community, I support the Governor's proposal to raise the minimum wage in New York from $8.75 to $10.50."
Chris Fowler, Executive Director of SyracuseFirst said, "Raising the minimum wage will provide a welcome boost to businesses throughout Central New York. By raising the minimum wage to $10.50 statewide, more than 55,000 workers in this region will experience higher wages. This will in turn generate a projected $105.5 million in direct economic value -- money that will be spent at our community's shops, restaurants and grocery stores. For this reason, I support the Governor's proposal to raise the minimum wage."
Dan Williams, Owner of Williams Fence said, "I support raising the minimum wage because it is smart business. It will give people more money to spend right here in our community -- exactly where many of our customers live and work. The influx of capital will both grow our economy and keep people working so that Central New York is a sustainable place to live and work for years to come."
Bob Winston & John Hunter, co-owners of J.D. Hunter said, "Raising New York's minimum wage to $10.50 statewide and $11.50 in New York City is good for workers and even better for business. Statewide, $3.4 billion will be injected into our economy in the form of wages, which economists predict will almost immediately be spent out in local communities like ours. This will go a long way to keeping the Central New York economy moving forward."
North Country
Tim Carter of TAP Industries said, "There is no better way to grow the potential strength of the North Country's economy than by raising the minimum wage. An increase in the minimum wage - $10.50 statewide -- adds a projected $46.5 million in direct economic value to our community. This means that people will spend more money on goods and services throughout the North Country, which is good for business and good for the economy."
Patrick Curran of Curran Renewable Energy, LLC said, "A lot of people that live in the North Country have struggled for years to make a decent living. By raising NY's minimum wage to $10.50, it will provide them with opportunities they would not otherwise have, enhance their quality of life, and strengthen their communities for years to come."
Jean Pond, owner of Creative Home Elements said, "A minimum wage increase would put money in the pockets of hard working New Yorkers, who in turn spend in and around their communities. I strongly support raising New York's minimum wage to $10.50."
Tom Sullivan, owner of Sullivan Office Supplies said, "Raising the minimum wage means that more workers will have more money to spend on items they couldn't normally afford -- which means a boost for the economy and for business owners across the North Country. I support raising the minimum wage to $10.50 statewide and $11.50 in New York City, because an additional $46.5 million in the pockets of tens of thousands of consumers means real economic growth."
Mark Dzwonczyk, CEO of Nicholville Telephone Company, parent company of Slic Network Solutions, said, "We have found that paying good wages is just good business because it helps us grow through our committed workforce. Raising the statewide minimum wage will have a similarly positive effect on our communities in the North Country. This is something all businesses should get behind."Governor Cuomo announced that business leaders across Upstate New York have joined the "Fight for Fair Pay" campaign to raise the minimum wage in New York this year.
