Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Regarding President Obama's Action to Expand Overtime Protections for Workers
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 18, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"From enacting a $15 statewide minimum wage to implementing the nation's most robust paid family leave plan, New York has taken bold action to help ensure fairness and equality in the workplace for all. By extending overtime protections for an additional 4.2 million Americans, the Obama administration is helping to ensure the promise of opportunity, mobility and economic justice to working men and women across the country. This new rule will require a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, while injecting $12 billion into the economy over the next decade. I applaud President Obama and Secretary Perez for their leadership on this vital issue and commend them for their commitment to workplace fairness."
