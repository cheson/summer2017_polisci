Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio and MTA Chairman Tom Prendergast today announced that an agreement has been reached on the remaining funding for the MTA Capital Program. New York State has committed to provide $8.3 billion, and New York City has committed to provide $2.5 billion. The Program, which totals $26.1 billion, outlines the next five years' worth of vital investments to renew, enhance and expand the MTA network. This marks the largest investment in MTA infrastructure in history.
Governor Cuomo said: "The MTA is the lifeblood of New York, helping millions of people travel throughout the city and the surrounding suburbs, and fueling one of the largest economies on the globe. Our challenge is not only to help the system continue to fuel the region's growth, but to keep up with and respond to that growth as it happens. This MTA Capital Plan is what we need to make the system smarter and more resilient, facilitating major upgrades, expansions and building crucial pieces of equipment so that riders are not forced to accept the failures of outdated infrastructure. This plan will mean a safer, stronger, more reliable transit system for people all over New York, and is crucial in supporting our growing economy. And this program would not have been possible without everyone stepping up to pay their fair share. Today with this agreement, we are making an historic investment not only in the MTA, but in the future of New York."
