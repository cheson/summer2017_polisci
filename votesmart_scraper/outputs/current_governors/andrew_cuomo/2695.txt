Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo Michael Bloomberg
Date: March 22, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"In recent days, the United Federation of Teachers, New York State United Teachers, and other unions withdrew their support for this weekend's 25th annual Somos El Futuro conference in Albany because they are angry about the passage of pension reform. We think the unions' actions are unfortunate, and don't want the conference to suffer as a result. We both support the Somos El Futuro Conference and, as such, we will be donating $72,000 to Somos El Futuro and the scholarship to make up for the donations that the unions withdrew. Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, who is Chairman of the New York State Senate/Assembly Puerto Rican & Hispanic Task Force, was instrumental in arranging this contribution."
