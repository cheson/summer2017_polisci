Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 2, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, Rhode Island joined New York and eight other states, as well as the District of Columbia, to become the 10th state in the nation to allow same-sex couples to legally marry. This is yet another step forward in our efforts to achieve marriage equality for all in the United States. I hope that Rhode Island's passage of the Marriage Equality Act will inspire others to tear down the barriers of inequality and injustice that continue to exist outside the boundaries of our states. Together, we can help move this country forward to allow individuals, no matter their sexual orientation, to marry the person they love. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Governor Chafee, on this historic day in Rhode Island."
