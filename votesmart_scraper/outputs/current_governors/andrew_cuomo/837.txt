Governor Cuomo announced New York State has proposed a new statewide regulation that will improve air quality and protect public health by placing limits on emissions from distributed generation sources such as diesel generators and natural gas-fired engines. This new regulation will align New York State with federal air quality standards and help mitigate climate change.
"Establishing limits on these harmful emissions is a critical step towards protecting air quality, as well as the health of New Yorkers," said Governor Cuomo. "These new standards will reduce pollution, further encourage the development of renewable resources and support this state's efforts to combat climate change."
