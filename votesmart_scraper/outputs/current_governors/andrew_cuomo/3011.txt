Issue Position: Get Our Fiscal House in Order
Issue Position
By: Andrew Cuomo
Location: Unknown

We must get our State's fiscal house in order by immediately imposing a cap on state spending and freezing salaries of state public employees as part of a one-year emergency financial plan, committing to no increase in personal or corporate income taxes or sales taxes and imposing a local property tax cap. We must also eliminate mandates that make it impossible for school districts and localities to contain costs.
