Statement from Governor Cuomo on Sentencing of Ray Harding
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 18, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's sentencing of former Liberal Party boss Ray Harding is a reminder that those who partner with corrupt public officials can no longer rely on the defense of business as usual in Albany. While the judge spared him prison time due to his health, Harding now has a criminal record, has lost his law license, and can never reapply to the bar or do business with the State again.
"Harding is the eighth conviction in the case, joining former Chief Investment Officer David Loglisci and chief political consultant Hank Morris, and Comptroller Alan Hevesi himself, who was sentenced to jail, and we recovered $170 million for the people and the State pension fund.
"When public integrity is eroded, we all pay the price. We must be vigilant in rooting out corruption and we must change the rules of engagement in Albany to bring transparency and accountability to those who serve the public trust."
