Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that GEICO is the first insurance company in New York State to complete the certification process through the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles to allow customers to begin using electronic identification cards on their smart phones and other electronic devices. At the Governor's direction, DMV amended its regulations in April 2015 to allow insurance companies to issue e-cards to their customers. This new feature will be available to New York customers on the GEICO app starting Tuesday, November 17.
"This new program will both improve efficacy and increase convenience for motorists across New York State," Governor Cuomo said. "This administration is committed to providing a better customer experience for New Yorkers and I thank GEICO for working with us to keep the needs of our drivers a top priority."
