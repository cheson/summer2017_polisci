Governor Andrew Cuomo today reminded New Yorkers that with lake effect snow forecast during New Year's Eve celebrations, it is a good time to be cautious and careful while celebrating 2016. Lake Effect Snow will move into central New York State this afternoon and continue through 6 P.M. on Saturday. The National Weather Service has issued a Lake Effect Snow Watch through Saturday afternoon for Jefferson, Oswego and Lewis counties. The greatest amounts of accumulation will occur in the Tug Hill Plateau region where up to 18 inches are possible. 12 to 18 inches are expected in lower elevations.
"With heavy snow arriving just in time to ring in the New Year, we want people be cautious and stay safe on the roads," said Governor Cuomo. "I urge all New Yorkers to prepare for the weather, be mindful of other drivers on the roads, take plenty of time arriving at your destination and never drink and drive or get into a car being driven by someone who is drinking."
