The administration of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today issued a report detailing the crisis of failing schools in New York State. According to the report:
The State currently has 178 failing schools.
There are more than 109,000 students currently enrolled in New York's 178 failing schools.
77 of these schools have been failing for 10 years, with more than 250,000 students passing through these schools while New York State government has done nothing.
Statewide, more than 9 out of 10 students in failing schools are minority or poor.
While the education bureaucracy demands more and more money, the reality is school districts with failing schools have statewide seen an average 13.8 percent increase in funding over the past three years, and continued to fail.
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said: "This is the real scandal in Albany, the alarming fact that state government has stood by and done nothing as generation after generation of students have passed through failing schools. This report underscores the severity and shocking nature of this problem. The time is now for the State Legislature to act and do something about this problem so we no longer are condemning our children to failing schools."
