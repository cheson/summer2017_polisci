Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Senate's Failure to Pass Background Check Legislation
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 17, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"The Senate's failure to pass a bipartisan measure that is supported by the vast majority of American people is a sad statement on the power of extremists to stand in the way of reason and common sense. Background checks for firearm sales is a reasonable measure that would help keep guns out of the hands of criminals and help keep Americans safe from gun violence. In the wake of the seemingly unending cycle of tragedy involving gun violence, the Senate's inability to pass even a watered down, minimal gun safety bill is simply unacceptable."
