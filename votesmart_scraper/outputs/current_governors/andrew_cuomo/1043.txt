"Tonight, members of the Jewish community all across New York will begin the observance of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Rosh Hashanah provides an opportunity for the Jewish community to join with neighbors and loved ones to reflect on the year that has passed and to look forward to the year ahead. During this period of reflection, let us remember how New York has thrived due to our commitment to diversity, inclusion, and hard work.
"In the Jewish tradition, Tikkun Olam is the principle that we all have a shared responsibility to heal, repair, and transform the world. It's an acceptance that the world is imperfect and that there is injustice, inequality, and terrible loss, but that together we can, and we must make it better. Let us commit to continuing our collective work toward a more peaceful and secure future for all people. I believe that these principles will continue to guide our state and our communities in the year to come.
"On behalf of the entire state of New York, I extend the warmest of wishes for a healthy and prosperous New Year. L'Shanah Tovah."
