Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 23, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"The proposed federal budget is an egregious attack on the values and priorities that built this state and this nation. The radical conservative agenda in Washington is putting corporations before people and billionaires before vulnerable New Yorkers, and the consequences would be catastrophic.
"At a time when our middle class is hurting, the federal government is proposing reckless budget cuts that will devastate the people of New York. This heartless proposal would slash Medicaid and disability insurance, cripple our health care system, and gut programs that help New Yorkers warm their homes, feed their children, and find quality affordable housing.
"While ultra-conservatives in Washington seek to tear down what we've built, we're building it stronger in New York. While they seek tax breaks for the wealthy, we're providing tax relief to the middle class. While they propose to slash funding for our schools, we're making historic investments in our young people and launching free college tuition. And while they turn their back on the environment, we're protecting our water, our climate and our health.
"In New York, we believe in our nation's motto--out of many, one. We are one family and one society, and we are committed to the progressive principles that have made New York a beacon of hope and opportunity for all. I will continue to work with New York's congressional delegation to oppose the conservative ideologues in Washington and protect New Yorkers."
