Statement from Governor Cuomo on Guilty Plea in Pedro Espada Federal Criminal Case
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 12, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"Nearly three years ago, my Attorney General's Office brought a case against then Senator Pedro Espada for looting his taxpayer-funded not for profit and abusing his position of public trust.

"Mr. Espada's reaction was to lash out again and again and to falsely disparage and accuse my Office of engaging in a politically-motivated witch hunt. Today, I give Mr. Espada the last word - when he says, 'guilty.'"
