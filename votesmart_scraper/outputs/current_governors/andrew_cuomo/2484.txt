"The actions last night of Department of Environmental Conservation Forest Rangers, State Police, and local emergency personnel demonstrated the unwavering dedication and tireless commitment of our state's first responders to protecting New Yorkers and those who visit our state. Responding to a small plane crash near Lake Placid, a team of DEC Forest Rangers walked miles in the bitter cold and dark through rough terrain to find and safely rescue three individuals who were in the aircraft.

"I commend the DEC Rangers who conducted this rescue, Lt. Charles Platt, Joe LaPierre, Scott VanLaer, Jim Giglinto, Kevin Burns, David Russell, Pete Evans, and Chris Kostoss, as well as the members of the State Police and local emergency response personnel who helped with this rescue.

"No matter the weather conditions or the time of day, our state's first responders step up to the call of duty and do what is necessary to find and rescue people that are lost or injured. These first responders went above and beyond to save lives and on behalf of all New Yorkers I thank them for their bravery and service."
