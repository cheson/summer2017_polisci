Governor Cuomo Directs State Agencies to Prepare For Prolonged Heavy Rains and Tropical Storm Conditions
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 1, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo activated the State Emergency Operations Center in Albany to monitor severe weather that is anticipated to impact southern parts of New York State beginning today and potentially lasting through this weekend. This weather is expected to include heavy rain, high winds and coastal flooding as Hurricane Joaquin makes it way up the east coast. Local power outages in hard-hit areas are also anticipated.
"As Hurricane Joaquin makes its way up the East Coast, New York is in a much better position today than we have ever been before - but when it comes to Mother Nature, you can never be too prepared," Governor Cuomo said. "That is why we are activating the State's Emergency Operations Center and positioning critical resources across the state as we learn more about this developing storm. I urge New Yorkers to exercise caution and stay informed in the coming days."
