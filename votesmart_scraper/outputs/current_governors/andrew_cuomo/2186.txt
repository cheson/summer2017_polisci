Governor Cuomo Details Fiscal and Economic Impact of Passage of Amendment Authorizing Casino Gaming in New York State in Broome County
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 6, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today traveled to Binghamton, New York to discuss how the approved casino gaming amendment has the potential to bring millions of dollars in new revenue to school districts and local governments as well as provide property tax relief and boost tourism and economic development in communities across the state. In the Eastern Southern Tier region, Broome, Chemung, Schuyler, Seneca, Tioga, Tompkins, and Wayne counties will share a projected $20,062,210 in revenue that will go towards school aid, property tax relief, and local government aid.

"The passage of Proposal One is a big win for local governments, school districts and taxpayers in the Eastern Southern Tier region," Governor Cuomo said. "Yesterday's vote by New Yorkers to authorize casino gaming will keep hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year in neighboring states right here in New York, providing more revenue for local schools, relief for property taxpayers and countless jobs for New Yorkers, while bringing proper regulation to the industry. This passage also builds on the landmark agreements we reached with Native American tribes this year, ending expensive court battles and unnecessary discord and restoring hundreds of millions of dollars to local governments. My administration is committed to reviving the state's economy and especially in Upstate New York where we need it the most. This passage will help pave the way for the creation of new jobs, construction, and increased tourism in communities across the state."
