The State Office of Emergency Management continues to monitor the effects in New York State from the 5.9 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mineral, Virginia this afternoon.
The state is initiating comprehensive reviews of critical and sensitive infrastructure including the state's hydroelectric plants, nuclear power plants, key bridges and tunnels, and other assets.
I am getting regular reports from agencies all over the state and at this time there are no reports of damage or power outages.
