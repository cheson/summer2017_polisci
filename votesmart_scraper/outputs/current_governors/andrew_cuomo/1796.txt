Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced an additional $106 million in funding for the Vital Access/Safety Net Provider Program, which supports healthcare services for New York State's elderly and low-income populations. The funding will go toward projects at facilities specifically chosen because they are struggling financially.

"Ensuring that all New Yorkers have access to quality healthcare is one of our highest priorities, and with this funding the state is stepping in to bolster organizations that provide for New Yorkers in need," Governor Cuomo said. "This money supports healthcare services for the elderly and low-income families -- two groups that may otherwise lack proper care -- and the work that it supports will ultimately lead to healthier New Yorkers in communities all across the state."

These funds will be used primarily to improve community care and to achieve defined financial, operational, and quality improvement goals related to the integration or reconfiguration of services offered by the facility. Specific examples include:
-Expanding access to ambulatory services through additional needed services or added hours of operations
-Opening urgent care centers to help reduce use of emergency rooms
-Improving quality through reduced adverse events, which reduces overall costs
-Expanding services in rural areas through additional primary and specialty care services
-Establishing care coordination between providers and levels of health care service delivery
-Providing more effective services that meet the needs of the community

The state Department of Health works with all of the awarded facilities to establish goals that measure the program's success, and identify financial, operational, and quality metrics to track progress toward these goals. The program was established by the Medicaid Redesign Team and to date, the program has awarded $324 million in funding.
