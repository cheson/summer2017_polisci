Governor Cuomo Signs "Amanda Lynn's Law"
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 23, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

The measure is named after Amanda Lynn Wienckowski, a Western New York woman who died under questionable circumstances in 2009. Although authorities were unable to prove the exact circumstances of her death, they did establish that individuals hid her body in an apparent attempt to avoid its discovery. That action had been only punishable by a misdemeanor.
"With this legislation, these vile and reprehensible acts will be treated under the law with the seriousness they deserve," Governor Cuomo said. "The heartache and uncertainty that Amanda Lynn's loved ones experienced is unacceptable and I thank the sponsors of this bill for working to help ensure this horrific situation is not repeated."
