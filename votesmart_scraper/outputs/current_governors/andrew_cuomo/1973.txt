Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 10, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

The Cuomo Administration today announced that the Citizen Preparedness Corps Training Program will take place on Saturday, April 12, in Onondaga County. The program, highlighted in Governor Cuomo's State of the State Address in January and launched in February, aims to provide approximately 100,000 New Yorkers with the tools and resources to prepare for emergencies and disasters, respond accordingly, and recover as quickly as possible to pre-disaster conditions.
"In just the past few years alone, New Yorkers all across the State have seen the damage and disruption that can come from natural disasters and emergencies, so it is critical that we act now to prepare for whatever the future may bring," Governor Cuomo said. "The Citizen Preparedness Corps Training Program is helping New Yorkers to be first responders in their own homes and on their blocks when a disaster strikes. It is more important than ever to be prepared, and I urge all New Yorkers to join us as we work to build safer communities across the State."
