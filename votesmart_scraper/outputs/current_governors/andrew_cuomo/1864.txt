Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo in Support of Israel
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 14, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"Over the past week, rocket attacks on Israel by terrorist organizations have put six million lives at risk. For years, rockets have targeted the Israeli population; what were once indiscriminate acts of terror have now become an onslaught. Friends stand together in times of crisis, and the people of New York stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Israel. Our state has always had a special relationship with Israel. We are home to the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. At a time of upheaval across the Middle East, Israel remains a bulwark of democracy and a beacon of courage and freedom.

"We strongly support Israel's right to defend itself. As New Yorkers, we have experienced global terrorism firsthand. At my direction, New York's Department of Financial Services has aggressively cracked down on institutions that bankroll terrorist organizations. And we will continue to work closely with our ally Israel to fight global terrorism."
