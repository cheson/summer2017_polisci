Governor Cuomo Announces Dramatic Reform in Use of Special Housing For Inmate Discipline
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 16, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced a groundbreaking agreement which will transform the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision's use of Special Housing Units in New York State. Since May 2013, the Governor's Office and DOCCS have been negotiating with the New York Civil Liberties Union to settle impact litigation filed in Federal District Court, Southern District of New York, and reform the State's current discipline practices and policies.
"This package of reforms will result in a safer correctional system, as well as a fairer and more humane response for inmates who engage in misconduct," said Governor Cuomo. "This groundbreaking agreement with the NYCLU should serve as a model for other states across the nation to follow in reforming the use of solitary confinement. From working to raise the age, to breaking down re-entry barriers for the formerly incarcerated, to today's agreement, I am proud that we are continuing to create a safer and smarter correctional environment in New York State."
