"Today the International Criminal Court (ICC) stated that it was opening a preliminary examination with respect to Israel. I was proud to lead a bipartisan delegation to Israel during Operation Protective Edge as a sign of our friendship and support. I saw first-hand the Hamas tunnels that lead directly into communities and whose sole purpose is to inflict terror and kill civilians. Given the extraordinary threat to Israel from Hamas and other terrorist organizations, today's action of the ICC is incomprehensible. Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East, has a right to defend itself against terrorist organizations. Friends stand with friends in times of crisis, and New York will continue to stand with the people of Israel."
