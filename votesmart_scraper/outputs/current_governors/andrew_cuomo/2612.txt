"On the Fourth of July, we come together as New Yorkers, and as Americans, to celebrate our nation's independence and the birth of our nation's freedom. Today we also must honor the men and women of our Armed Forces who courageously serve our nation throughout the world. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I thank them, as well as the military families here at home, for their commitment and sacrifice. I wish all New Yorkers a happy and safe holiday."
