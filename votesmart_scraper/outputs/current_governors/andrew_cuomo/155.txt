Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Arrest of Brooklyn Man Attempting to Support ISIL
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 21, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"The arrest of Mohamed Rafik Naji on charges he provided material support to ISIL is a sharp reminder of the evolving threat of global terrorism. New York must remain vigilant in the face of hate and intolerance, and continue to advance the core values of democracy that this state and nation were founded upon. While we do not have any specific threat at this time, public safety is paramount and we will continue to work aggressively with all local and federal partners. I would like to thank the dedicated professionals at the FBI, US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District, and state and local police on the Joint Terrorism Task Force for their efforts to keep New Yorkers safe."
