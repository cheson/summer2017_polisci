Statement from Governor Cuomo on Albany Gang Member Pleading Guilty to Dealing Cocaine
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 4, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"This is the culmination of a case that stopped large amounts of drugs from reaching the streets of the Capital District.
Gang activity and drug trafficking are a deadly combination that is tearing apart urban communities across the state.
As Attorney General, I vowed to stop the flow of guns and drugs through the state, and this case proves that with coordination between state and local law enforcement, we can really make a difference.
I applaud the men and women of law enforcement who pursued this case and thank them for their outstanding work."
