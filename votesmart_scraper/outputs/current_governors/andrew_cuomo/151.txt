Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Regarding Indian Point Nuclear Facility
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 21, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's unanimous decision by the Court of Appeals reaffirms the State's authority to review Entergy's federal applications to continue its operation at Indian Point. The Department of State already concluded that the Indian Point relicensing application is inconsistent with New York's long-standing Coastal Management Program requirements and will continue to use this program to protect New York's coastline. Indian Point is antiquated and does not belong on the Hudson River in close proximity to New York City, where it poses a threat not only to the coastal resources and uses of the river, but to millions of New Yorkers living and working in the surrounding community."
