Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on LIRR-MTA Labor Negotiations
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 9, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"I want to thank the New York State Congressional Delegation for making it abundantly clear today that Congress will not act to bring about a labor settlement at the Long Island Rail Road. The unions' false belief that Congress would step in to mandate a settlement was a major impediment to any real progress. With this obstacle removed, it is now clear that the only path to resolution is at the bargaining table between the MTA and the unions, and they should proceed in good faith. The LIRR plays a unique role and is vital to Long Island's economic and social activity. This dispute must be handled amicably. A strike is just not an option and would be a terrible failure by both the unions and the MTA. I would like to thank MTA Chairman and CEO Tom Prendergast and the New York State Congressional Delegation, especially Congress Members Charles Rangel, Peter King, Steve Israel, Carolyn Maloney, Tim Bishop, Grace Meng and Gregory Meeks for their help in clarifying this situation."
