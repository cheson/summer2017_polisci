Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced funding for a new energy competition that will award up to $20 million for the most forward-thinking, advanced energy projects in Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers. First proposed by the Governor in 2014, the projects aim to reduce energy costs by as much as $400 million annually, lower carbon emissions, and support clean energy technologies and jobs.
"This competition will allow regions to develop their best possible plan to bring their energy infrastructure into the 21st century," Governor Cuomo said. "It will not only save costs and reduce harmful carbon emissions, but create jobs and help our cities move toward a more sustainable future."
The total comprehensive effort, of which the competition is a part, is spearheaded by the New York Power Authority and designed to spur broader participation by the private sector in the State's clean-energy economy.
Some of the anticipated outcomes include:
Revitalizing urban centers to attract new businesses and residents
Retrofitting city and community buildings
Improving the energy efficiency of outdoor lighting with light-emitting diode (LED) fixtures
