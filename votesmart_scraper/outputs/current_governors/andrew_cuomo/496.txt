Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Regarding Grade Crossing Collision at River Point Road in Poughkeepsie, NY
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 20, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, an unoccupied vehicle was struck by a train at a grade crossing in Poughkeepsie, NY. Thankfully, no one was injured and no lives were lost. The fact remains, however, that hundreds of people die nationwide each year in grade crossing accidents like this one. Enough is enough. While this administration has taken steps to improve railroad crossing safety, including working with the state Department of Transportation, the MTA and the federal government to implement reforms -- more needs to be done. This is a serious issue that must be addressed before the end of the legislative session in order to prevent more senseless and avoidable tragedies."
