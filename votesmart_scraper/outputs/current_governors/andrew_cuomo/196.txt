Governor Cuomo Announces Proposed Regulation to Hold Banks and Mortgage Servicers Accountable for Maintaining "Zombie Properties"
Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the Department of Financial Services has proposed a regulation that mandates banks and mortgage services report vacant and abandoned properties in accordance with the new law. The proposal comes on the heels of a law signed by the Governor in June that curbs the threat posed to communities by "zombie properties" by expediting foreclosure proceedings, improving the efficiency and integrity of the mandatory settlement conferences, and obligating banks and mortgage servicers to secure, protect and maintain vacant and abandoned properties before and during foreclosure proceedings. The new law goes into effect on December 20, 2016.
"Abandoned homes are a blight on New York communities, and the longer they are allowed to fall in disrepair, the lower property values for entire neighborhoods are dragged down," Governor Cuomo said. "This regulation is another step toward combatting the scourge of vacant and neglected properties, and will ensure that banks and mortgage servicers are held fully accountable for complying with their obligations under this new law."
