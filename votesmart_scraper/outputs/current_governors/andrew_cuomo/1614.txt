Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 6, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"The New NY Bridge is a symbol of the progress that government can achieve when we choose results over gridlock and focus on delivering for the people we represent. By fast-tracking this replacement with the help of our partners in the federal government, we are on-time and on-budget for one of the largest transportation projects in the nation. This is a dramatic investment in the region's transportation infrastructure, and I look forward to seeing it used by future generations for decades to come."
