Governor Cuomo Signs Legislation to Allow the Alternative Veterans' Tax Exemption to Apply to New York City School Taxes
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 28, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today signed legislation to allow New York City to extend the alternative veterans' tax exemption to school taxes.
"Our veterans answered the call to protect the freedoms that this state and this nation were founded upon and this exemption is just one small way to thank them for their service," Governor Cuomo said. "I'm proud to sign this measure and close the loophole that denied New York City veterans the opportunity to receive the same benefit as their peers in every other part of the state."
In 2013, the Governor signed legislation to allow school districts across the state to provide the alternative veterans' exemption against school taxes. However, since the City of New York does not have a school board, there was no mechanism to grant this relief to veterans in the five boroughs.
This legislation (A.9688 / S.7121) reforms this inequity and allows the New York City Council to pass a local law to extend the alternative veterans' tax exemption to school taxes.
