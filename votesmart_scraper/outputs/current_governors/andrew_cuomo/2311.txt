"The Fourth of July is an opportunity for New Yorkers to celebrate our nation's independence and the freedoms that we cherish as Americans. Today we offer our gratitude to the men and women of our nation's armed forces who serve our country, and those that have paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our nation. This weekend, as we gather with friends and family to celebrate the holiday, let us remember our service members, our veterans, and all those who put their lives on the line so we can live in peace. I wish a happy Independence Day to all New Yorkers."
