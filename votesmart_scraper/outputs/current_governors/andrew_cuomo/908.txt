By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 4, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that during the first 10 months of 2015, New York State recouped and returned $25.1 million to approximately 22,600 workers who originally were not paid the proper minimum wage, overtime pay or fringe benefits. This amount puts the state on pace to exceed the record $30.2 million disbursed to 27,000 workers in 2014.
"New York has zero tolerance for worker exploitation and those who seek to deny a fair day's pay for a fair day's work," Governor Cuomo said. "We will continue to crack down on unscrupulous employers who disregard the law and ensure employees are paid what they earn."
