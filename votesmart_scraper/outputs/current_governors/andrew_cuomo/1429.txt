Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Earth Day
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 22, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"As we celebrate Earth Day, we recommit ourselves to protecting the environment and preserving New York's tremendous natural resources. This is both an opportunity to reflect on the beauty of New York's many scenic locations, and a time to reimagine our state amid the new reality of extreme weather. To paraphrase an old Native American saying, we did not inherit the Earth from our parents; we have borrowed it from our children. It is with that idea in mind that our administration continues to build a New York State that is cleaner, greener and rising to meet the challenges of a changing climate. I encourage all New Yorkers to join us in that effort -- together we will ensure that our state remains a healthy and vibrant place to live and work for generations to come."
