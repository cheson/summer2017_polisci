Date: June 1, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that more than $181 million in economic development funding has been approved for 24 projects that are spurring growth and opportunity in nine regions of the state. The funding, approved by Empire State Development's Board of Directors, supports projects that are creating 1,524 new jobs and retaining 2,009 existing New York State jobs -- many of which have already been created or retained. This funding will also leverage more than $5 billion in private assets and other public funding to support local businesses and projects that are building a strong foundation for future economic growth and job creation.
"This funding is part of this administration's ongoing efforts to create new opportunities for companies and workers all across New York," Governor Cuomo said. "By investing in these projects, we are jumpstarting local development priorities, attracting new businesses that create jobs, and helping to rebuild New York's economy. "
"Under Governor Cuomo's leadership, we are making targeted investments to support key projects and initiatives that are boosting local economies statewide," said Empire State Development President, CEO & Commissioner Zemsky. "Whether it's helping critical employers expand or remain in New York, encouraging regional tourism, aiding local communities through infrastructure improvements or supporting strategic industry growth, these projects are strengthening economies and communities from New York City to the North Country."
