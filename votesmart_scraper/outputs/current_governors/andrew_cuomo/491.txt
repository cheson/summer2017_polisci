Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that road and bridge construction projects on New York State highways will be suspended from 6 a.m. on Friday, May 27, to 6 a.m. on Tuesday, May 31, in order to accommodate travelers during the busy Memorial Day holiday weekend. Some work may continue behind permanent concrete barriers or for emergency repairs.
"Memorial Day Weekend is one of the busiest travel times of the year and we are taking every step we can to minimize delays and disruptions on New York's roadways," Governor Cuomo said. "These actions put drivers first and will help New Yorkers get where they need to go in less time and with less aggravation this holiday weekend."
The construction suspension is in keeping with Governor Cuomo's Drivers First program, which prioritizes the convenience of motorists to minimize traffic congestion and travel delays due to road and bridge work.
New York State Department of Transportation Commissioner Matthew J. Driscoll said, "Governor Cuomo's action to limit construction activities during a major holiday weekend will allow people to observe Memorial Day without worrying about traffic delays. I encourage everyone to travel safely and to check 511NY before starting any trips."
New York State Thruway Authority Interim Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer Maria Lehman, P.E. said, "As we gather this Memorial Day with friends and families to honor and reflect on our fallen service members, ensuring that drivers reach their destination safe and sound is the Thruway Authority's main priority. Suspending major construction projects during such a heavily commuted weekend will not only ease traffic for motorists but help ensure a safe holiday for travelers all over the state."
