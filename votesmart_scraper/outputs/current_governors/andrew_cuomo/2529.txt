Location: Albany, NY

New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie released the following statement regarding today's critical vote by the House of Representatives:

"Today's action by the House was a necessary and critical first step towards delivering aid to the people of New York and New Jersey. While we are pleased with this progress, today was just a down payment and it is now time to go even further and pass the final and more complete, clean disaster aid bill. We are trusting Congress to act accordingly on January 15th and pass the final $51 billion instrumental for long-term rebuilding in order for New Jersey, New York and our people to recover after the severe devastation of Hurricane Sandy."
