Governor Cuomo announced that $4.5 million projects will enhance outdoor recreation for people of all ages and abilities in the Thousand Islands Region. A roughly $3.6 million project to improve the beachfront and campgrounds of Wellesley Island and Grass Point State Parks is now complete, making the parks more attractive to visitors to these popular destinations on the St. Lawrence River in the Thousand Islands region. In addition, construction is now underway on a $1 million accessible trail at Wilson Hill Wildlife Management Area in St. Lawrence County.
"From fishing, swimming and boating to camping out under the stars, the Thousand Islands offer a wealth of recreational experiences for visitors from across the state and beyond," said Governor Cuomo. "To know the North Country is to love the North Country and with these important projects, we're investing in some of the region's best assets. I encourage everyone to pay the Thousand Islands a visit and see what you've been missing."
