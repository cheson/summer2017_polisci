Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $26.3 million in grants and interest-free loans to support seven vital environmental improvement projects across the state.
"Today we are continuing to revitalize local infrastructure and improve communities across the state," said Governor Cuomo. "This program helps to advance important infrastructure projects in order to support local governments statewide, and I look forward to seeing the work get underway."
The funding consists of $6.5 million in grants, part of $75 million recently awarded by Governor Cuomo for 45 statewide drinking water and wastewater infrastructure improvements, and $19.8 million in no-interest loans, which were approved today by the New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation's Board of Directors.
In addition to this funding, Governor Cuomo's 2016 Executive Budget proposal includes a total of $250 million in additional grant funding to support drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects across the state, with half to be distributed to municipalities this year and the remaining half in 2017.
The $26.3 million in grants and interest-free loans from the Environmental Facilities Corporation will support the following water projects statewide:
City of Poughkeepsie (Dutchess County) -- $11,663,000, including a $2 million grant and a $9,663,000 interest-free loan to replace an aging 5 million gallon water storage reservoir that was constructed in the 1920s, as well as to replace aged, undersized water mains.
City of Glens Falls (Warren County) -- $4,545,364, including a $1,058,438 grant and a $3,486,926 interest-free loan for sewer rehabilitation work on Ridge, Harrison and South Streets to protect water quality in the Glens Falls Feeder Canal and, ultimately, the Hudson River. Governor Cuomo previously awarded the City a $30,000 Engineering Planning Grant for this project.
Village of Endicott (Broome County) -- $3,946,375, including a $906,250 grant and a $3,040,125 interest-free loan for wastewater treatment plant improvements to remove nitrogen and phosphorous from entering the Susquehanna River. Governor Cuomo previously awarded the Village a $30,000 Engineering Planning Grant and a $300,000 Water Quality Improvement Project Grant.
Town of Liberty (Sullivan County) -- $2,412,027, including a $403,187 grant and a $2,008,840 interest-free loan for wastewater upgrades to the treatment plant to protect water quality in Loomis Creek and the Delaware River Basin.
Town of Carrollton (Cattaraugus County) -- $1,098,000, including a $273,375 grant and an $824,625 interest-free loan for upgrades to the wastewater treatment plant, including the removal of sludge accumulations from the treatment system lagoons. Governor Cuomo previously awarded the Town an $18,000 Engineering Planning grant for this project.
Village of Fort Plain (Montgomery County) -- $1,092,000, including a $273,000 grant and an $819,000 interest-free loan to remove excess infiltration and inflow being received at the Sewer District's wastewater treatment plant, protecting the water quality of the Mohawk River.
Village of Phoenix (Oswego County) -- $1,593,750 grant to address inflow and infiltration corrections, along with pump station and treatment plant upgrades. The Village is also receiving a previously-approved $4,743,250 interest-free loan for this project.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2016 for most of these projects.
A project map with detailed information on all 45 projects awarded grants is available here.
The Environmental Facilities Corporation also today approved $14.8 million to support two additional water-quality protection projects:
Westchester County -- $7,717,600 in loans (half interest-free, half low-interest loan) for HVAC equipment replacement and odor control in several buildings at the Yonkers joint wastewater treatment plant;
Town of Louisville -- $7,145,000 in a long-term interest-free loans to finance completed work at the Town, including a new distribution system, storage tank and system consolidation.
New York State Senate Environmental Conservation Committee Chair Thomas O'Mara said, "We're hopeful that ongoing state assistance will prove successful in helping localities throughout New York undertake these critical projects, including sewer and pipeline repairs. We're also hopeful that it can represent a long-term model for how the state-local partnership can be strengthened for the good of local environments, local economies and local property taxpayers by helping municipalities meet critical infrastructure needs while remaining within the property tax cap."
New York State Assembly Environmental Conservation Chair Steve Englebright said: "In light of the long decline in Federal funding to support drinking water and wastewater infrastructure and the critical needs in communities across our state, we welcome the news of the approval of these water infrastructure funding grants and commend the Governor for expediting them."
New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation President and CEO Sabrina Ty said, "Governor Cuomo's continued investment to rebuilding water infrastructure will go a long way toward protecting public health, improving the environment, and supporting and sustaining new jobs and economic development throughout New York State."
The New York State Water Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2015 was established as part of the 2015-2016 New York State Budget and provides $200 million in grants over three state fiscal years. Funding is administered by the Environmental Facilities Corporation, and the Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation.
The Environmental Facilities Corporation invests more than $1 billion each year to fund water-quality improvements through the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, the largest and most active revolving loan funds in the nation.
