Governor Cuomo Issues Statement on 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 28, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"The 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic "I Have a Dream' speech, is a moment to reflect as a state and as a nation on the progress that we have made towards achieving equality and opportunity for all. New York has always been a beacon of equal rights as the birthplace of so many progressive organizations and social movements such as the NAACP, the women's rights movement, the environmental movement, the labor movement, and the gay rights movement. As Governor, I will continue to prioritize creating social and economic equality for all residents in our state to maintain New York's place as the progressive capital of the country. And while today is a day to celebrate our progress, it is also an opportunity to reflect upon the work that still needs to be done to truly realize Dr. King's dream and to make our state and country a fairer and more just place for all."
