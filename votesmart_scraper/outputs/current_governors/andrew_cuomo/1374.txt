By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 11, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the launch of a multi-agency Enforcement Task Force that will move immediately to prevent unlawful practices and unsafe working conditions in the nail salon industry. The Task Force will also recover unpaid wages and shut down unlicensed businesses and businesses out of compliance with state law.
"New York State has a long history of confronting wage theft and unfair labor practices head on and today, with the formation of this new Enforcement Task Force, we are aggressively following in that tradition," Governor Cuomo said. "We will not stand idly by as workers are deprived of their hard-earned wages and robbed of their most basic rights. This Task Force will crack down on these kinds of abuses in the nail salon industry, enforce all of New York's health and safety regulations, and help ensure that no one -- regardless of their citizenship status or what language they speak -- is illegally victimized by their employer."
