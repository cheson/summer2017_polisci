Governor Cuomo Announces New Addiction Treatment Facility in the North Country
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 12, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a new agreement to bring detoxification and outpatient substance use disorder services to Clinton, Essex and Franklin counties. The collaborative effort by the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and the New York State Office of General Services will enable Champlain Valley Family Center, an OASAS-certified treatment provider, to open a facility in Schuyler Falls. The center will provide detox, stabilization/respite and outpatient substance use disorder services and will operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
"This center will expand treatment options in the North Country, helping those battling addiction and saving lives in the process," Governor Cuomo said. "This is one more step towards building a stronger and healthier New York."
The new treatment center will be located at 516 Norrisville Road on the campus of the former Adirondack Residential Center, a facility that had been previously used by the State Office of Children and Family Services as a youth rehabilitation and conservation education center on land under DEC's jurisdiction. By reopening this facility, the state will be creating new jobs in northern New York to refurbish these buildings and to assist with substance abuse treatment.
