Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the appointments for the board of officers to coordinate New York State's significant financial investments with the National Manufacturing Innovation Institute for Integrated Photonics. First announced by Vice President Biden and Governor Cuomo in July, the Integrated Photonics Institute will help secure the nation's leadership in emerging technology research, development, and manufacturing.
"The Photonics Institute is going to redefine the local economy for generations -- and this Board of Officers will play a pivotal role in guiding that change day in and day out," said Governor Cuomo. "Each of these individuals has a background and skillset that will be incredibly valuable in supporting the Institute as it develops, and helping it cement Rochester's status as a global hub for research and advanced manufacturing."
