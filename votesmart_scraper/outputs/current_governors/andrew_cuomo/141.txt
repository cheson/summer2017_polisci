Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the final 2016 Open Space Conservation Plan, which provides a blueprint for how the conservation and protection of open space can accomplish the state's environmental goals. The Plan, developed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, will guide funding through the Environmental Protection Fund to safeguard important habitats and natural resources across New York.
"New York's open space conservation efforts are essential to improving the environment and economy of the state, and this new plan will guide our continued efforts to protect the state's precious natural resources," Governor Cuomo said. "From the Adirondacks to the Catskills to Long Island, New York has an abundance of natural resources and exquisite open spaces that we must protect for future generations to enjoy."
The final Open Space Conservation Plan provides a blueprint for how open space conservation can help accomplish Governor Cuomo's environmental goals, including:
ensuring clean water, air, and land for a healthy public and vibrant economy;
greening New York's economy;
protecting natural resources and promoting outdoor recreation;
increasing, deepening, and improving the visitor experience to state parks and lands;
creating a 21st century parks system that is aesthetically compelling, energy and operationally efficient, and built to last.
The plan also includes recommendations on how open space conservation programs can better prepare the state for climate change by improving resiliency following extreme storms and weather events.
