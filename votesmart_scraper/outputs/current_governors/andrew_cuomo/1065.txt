Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced up to $500,000 in state grants to increase college access for 2016 high school graduates. New York State's College Action Grants will award up to $5,000 to eligible high schools and community organizations that promote activities aimed at increasing the rate of low-income New York State high school seniors who apply to college, complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, and ultimately enroll in a college.
"Increasing access to higher education is essential to strengthening this state's economy," Governor Cuomo said. "This funding will help more low income and at risk students get access to a college education and unlock the potential that comes with it."
