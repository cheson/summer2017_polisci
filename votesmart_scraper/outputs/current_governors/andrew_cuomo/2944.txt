Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 24, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"The Census figures released today offer stark evidence of the lack of growth in certain regions as well as ongoing stagnation. We must correct the trajectory of the state by changing the financial and operational paradigm of our government. My budget and the agenda I have put forward charts that new course and it is important, now more than ever, that we follow through on it."
