"In light of the ongoing Moreland Commission investigation into utility performance in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, I have asked Con Edison to freeze the remaining executive bonuses until the Public Service Commission review is complete. I also urge Con Ed to fully cooperate with the Public Service Commission's review so we can ensure ratepayers are protected."
