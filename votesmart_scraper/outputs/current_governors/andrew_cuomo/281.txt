Governor Andrew Cuomo today announced the start of "Operation Clear Passage" -- a three-day, multi-agency Homeland Security exercise and water quality/navigational-boating enforcement event on Lake Champlain.

"Organization and coordination are key in any emergency response and this first-ever exercise will help ensure that New York and is ready to deal with anything that threatens our heath, environment, or national security on the lake."
The event will feature a federal Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program radiological detection exercise and a maritime-based law enforcement operation. The goals of the operation are to:
Bridge partnerships and improve coordination with agencies that protect Lake Champlain
Improve maritime counter-terrorism capabilities and agency responses to natural and man-made disasters through real-world threat exercises
