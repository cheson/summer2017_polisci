Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 5, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a ban on both commercial and passenger vehicles until further notice on Interstate 84 between the Pennsylvania and Connecticut borders. The ban is effective immediately. Any cars on the road will be ticketed.

"As this winter storm progresses, safety continues to be our top priority," Governor Cuomo said. "The State is closing I-84 as a precaution to protect drivers as this storm moves across the state. I urge all New Yorkers to stay off the roads and monitor news and weather reports throughout the day for updates."

Department of Transportation Commissioner Joan McDonald said, "Our crews have been working around the clock to clear roads and ensure the safest travel conditions possible. With that being said, commuters should not be using I-84 until further notice, as we continue to clear snow and ice from the roadway."

State Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said, "The State Police will be monitoring Interstate 84 throughout New York State to ensure that vehicles are not on the road until the ban is lifted. Drivers across the State should exercise extreme caution if travel is absolutely necessary, and only use roadways that are open."
