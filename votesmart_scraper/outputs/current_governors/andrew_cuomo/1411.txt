Governor Cuomo Announces $3 Million to Aid Low-Income New Yorkers With Medical Needs to Keep Cool This Summer
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 28, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that $3 million has been allocated to the Cooling Assistance Component of the Home Energy Assistance Program to help low-income New Yorkers who suffer from medical conditions aggravated by extreme heat. The program will provide air conditioning units to eligible households for the summer months. Prolonged exposure to high indoor temperatures poses health risks that disproportionately affect those already suffering from medical ailments.
Local departments of social services will accept applications to the program beginning May 1st. The Home Energy Assistance Program is overseen by the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance.
"The summer months can bring extreme heat, and we must ensure that our most vulnerable New Yorkers are protected," Governor Cuomo said. "This program will provide extra assistance to those who need it to stay safe in their homes this summer, and I encourage all who are eligible to apply."
Last summer, the program provided cooling assistance to 3,400 households.
To qualify for the subsidized air conditioning units, households must meet 2015 Home Energy Assistance Program income guidelines and have a member that suffers from a documented medical condition exacerbated by extreme heat. Acceptable written documentation can be from a physician, physician's assistant or nurse practitioner and must clearly indicate the need for an air conditioner. The document must be dated within the last 12 months.
