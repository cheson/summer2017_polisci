Governor Cuomo Announces New Policies Regarding State Issued Parking Placards following Inspector General Review
Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced rigorous new policies for state issued parking placards after a review by State Inspector General Ellen Biben found systemic problems with how the placards were distributed and how they were used by some state employees.
Currently, the state distributes two types of parking placards. One says "police" in all capital letters, the other says "official business."

As a result of the Inspector General review, the Governor's office will:
* Reduce the number of police placards distributed by over 84 percent from 1730 to 261 by limiting the distribution of police placards to only police personnel
* Reduce the number of total placards distributed by almost 10 percent from 2210 to 1993.
* Redesign placards for greater transparency.
* Create an application and approval process for receiving a placard -- a protocol that previously did not exist.
* Create a clear enforcement process to handle those who abuse the privilege.
"Government issued parking placards are meant to be used by state employees when they are doing official business," Governor Cuomo said. "Under my administration, abuses of government powers will be stopped and those responsible will be held accountable. I applaud Inspector General Biben for her review of the distribution and use of parking placards, and for her recommendations reforming the system to hold those who have placards responsible for their actions."
"Too often we hear stories of the abuses of parking placards," Inspector General Biben said. "Parking placards are not perks - period. These new policies intelligently transform the system from one that was flawed and ripe for abuse and to one that is transparent and will make individuals personally accountable for use of their placards."
