Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a new funding opportunity for school districts across New York State aimed at connecting them to local growers and producers to increase the use of locally grown specialty crops. Through the Farm to School program, $350,000 in grants is now available for projects that will help Pre-K through Grade 12 schools procure and serve healthy, locally grown foods on school menus.
"The Farm to School program is a win-win that supports New York farmers as well as ensures the use of fresh, healthy foods in school meals across the state," said Governor Cuomo. "By providing funding for key projects like training and equipment, we can help strengthen our agriculture industry and build a healthier New York."
