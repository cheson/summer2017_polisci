Governor Cuomo Warns Against Scam Tickets to See Pope Francis During Visit to New York
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 13, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo warned New Yorkers of scams surrounding Pope Francis' scheduled September visit, urging those interested to only get tickets from verified sources. The Archdiocese of New York has confirmed that tickets will not be sold for any of the Pope's planned events and will only be made available through Catholic parishes. Additionally, other dioceses in New York State (Brooklyn, Rockville Centre, Albany, Syracuse, Ogdensburg, Rochester and Buffalo) will receive tickets to distribute to their members.
"We are proud to welcome Pope Francis to New York and I urge those interested in attending his events to obtain tickets only through the verified Catholic parishes," Governor Cuomo said. "Anyone attempting to sell tickets is a scam artist and should be avoided at all costs. Making certain that you receive valid tickets will ensure that this event remains joyous and festive for all."
Pope Francis will visit New York City on September 24th and 25th as part of his visit to the United States--the first papal visit since 2008. Consumers are urged not to respond to any solicitation about purchasing tickets for the papal visit as tickets will not be sold and can only be obtained through the various Archdiocese in New York State and their parishes. There will be no tickets available through any other means.
New Yorkers should be aware that ticketing scams are not rare, and include previously used tickets, resale of lost or stolen tickets, online auction fraud, counterfeiting, tickets for non-existent events, fictitious tickets, and fake web sites. Scammers tend to victimize those dedicated New Yorkers who will spend generously to attend certain events. With their enthusiasm to obtain admittance to the event of choice, consumers fail to take safety precautions, and fall victim to scams.
