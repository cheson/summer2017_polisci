Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

"Binghamton University has long been a premier institution of higher learning -- so it is fitting for BU to be featured among our nation's top 100 universities in U.S. News & World Report's annual rankings."
"Over the past several years, this SUNY institution has continued to lead by example on a number of fronts ranging from the implementation of energy-smart infrastructure to attracting new business to the Southern Tier through START-UP NY. It is this type of leadership that is integral to providing students with world-class opportunities and jumpstarting the region's economy. I am proud to see BU earn this well-deserved distinction, and look forward to its continued excellence in the years ahead."
