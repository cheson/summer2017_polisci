Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 3, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Since the crash, the State has been taking new precautions to protect the safety of New York commuters and devoting every resource at our disposal to expedite restoration efforts. At my direction, the MTA will be implementing a Safety Stand-down that will require all employees to participate in safety briefings. Since Sunday, other State agencies and authorities have been providing extra support to restore service to the Hudson River Line as quickly as possible, including Port Authority escorts of heavy equipment, extra DOT and Office of Emergency Management workers to help on the scene and DEC personal to monitor any environmental issues. In the aftermath of Sunday's tragic crash, New York's commuters have shown incredible patience. The State will continue to work day and night to get things back to normal so New Yorkers are no longer inconvenienced."
