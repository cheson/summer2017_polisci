Letter
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

Dear New Yorkers,
Yesterday, Governor Cuomo presented his Executive Budget & Reform Plan. Thanks to the tough choices we made in 2011, Governor Cuomo was able to balance the budget without broad cuts and with no new taxes, fees or borrowing.
The Executive Budget & Reform Plan will:
* Create tens of thousands of jobs through leveraging private investment to build the economy;
* Move our schools to a performance-based system, including effective teacher evaluations, that put the students first;
* Help control property taxes through pension reform and eliminate state laws that increase local government costs;
* Reimagine and reinvent state government operations to make them more efficient and effective.
Governor Cuomo is proposing dramatic change to the system, and it's not going to be easy to get it done. But with your help -- if we come together as New Yorkers as we did last year -- we can make these reforms reality.
