Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Court Decision Regarding Defense of Marriage Act
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 18, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"In June 2011, New York State inspired the rest of the nation by becoming the largest state to achieve marriage equality. Today's ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit provides further momentum for national progress on this important civil rights issue. What we did here in New York can only be the beginning, and we must continue to work together until all Americans are free to marry whom they love and are entitled to all of the rights and benefits of marriage equally, regardless of sexual orientation."
