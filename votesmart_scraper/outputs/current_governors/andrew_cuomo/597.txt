Governor Cuomo Announces $13.3 Million to Continue the Fight Against Gun Violence Across New York State
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 7, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced more than $13.3 million in funding for law enforcement agencies to continue fighting gun violence in the 17 counties currently participating in the state's Gun Involved Violence Elimination -- or GIVE -- initiative. This initiative provides technical assistance, training and funds personnel, such as prosecutors and crime analysts, as well as overtime and equipment.
"We've worked tirelessly to combat gun violence across this state and prevent the senseless tragedies it causes," Governor Cuomo said. "The GIVE initiative gives law enforcement agencies the resources necessary for fighting gun violence in our streets, and helps create a safer and stronger New York for all."
The GIVE initiative targets communities served by 20 police departments in those 17 counties, which report 85 percent of violent crime in the state outside of New York City. This is the second year of a two-year contract, with agencies in those counties receiving the same grant award as last year. The GIVE initiative is administered by the Division of Criminal Justice Services. Its funding cycle begins July 1, 2016, and ends June 30, 2017. Those 20 police departments and their county law enforcement partners -- district attorneys' offices, probation departments and sheriffs' offices -- receive funding.
