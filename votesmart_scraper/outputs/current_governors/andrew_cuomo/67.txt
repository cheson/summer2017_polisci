Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 1, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"On Yom Ha'Atzmaut, we celebrate Israel's Independence Day in recognition of the rich history between our two countries.
"This evening, I have directed One World Trade Center and the new Kosciuszko Bridge to be lit white and blue, the colors of the Israeli flag, to honor Israel as it celebrates Yom Ha'Atzmaut.
"New York joins with the Israeli people and the State of Israel as they celebrate their 69th year of independence. The 408-foot spire of One World Trade Center, which was built as a response to terrorism and the Kosciuszko Bridge, a sign of growth and determination, will be lit in a dazzling show of lights in honor of a country that epitomizes resilience and progress.
"I wish all Israeli people both at home and abroad a happy Yom Ha'Atzmaut. Chag Sameach."
