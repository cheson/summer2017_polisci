Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a brand new mobile app and updated website for the Great New York State Fair, which runs daily through September 7. These new tools will allow users to purchase tickets online, create a custom schedule with reminders for events throughout the day, and features a GPS-enabled map that allows visitors to know where they are on the fairgrounds. The mobile app, made by Persource, is available at nysfair.org/app.
"This new app and website will bring one of the state's most treasured traditions into the 21st century," Governor Cuomo said. "With new tools on the website and on mobile phones, it has never been easier to plan a day at the fair and see the very best this state has to offer. I encourage all to use these tools and take a trip this year to the Great New York State Fair."
