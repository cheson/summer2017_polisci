Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 28, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"On behalf of all New Yorkers, I offer my deep gratitude to the men and women of our nation's armed services who for generations have defended our country and put their lives on the line so others can live in peace. Memorial Day offers an occasion for each of us to commemorate and reflect on the tremendous sacrifice of the service members who lost their lives fighting to defend the freedom that we take for granted each day. Today we also thank our military families, and especially honor those who have lost loved ones during war. As we gather with relatives and friends this Memorial Day holiday, let us pause to pay tribute to the fallen and honor their sacrifice."‬
