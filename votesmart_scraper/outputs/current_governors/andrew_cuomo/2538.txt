Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that New York state will observe a moment of silence on Friday, December 21, 2012 at 9:30 AM in remembrance of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, CT.
"Last Friday, 26 innocent lives were lost to a senseless and horrific act of violence," said Governor Cuomo. "One week later, we will honor those victims--many of whom were young children--with a moment of silence. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Newtown as we continue to mourn the loss of these precious lives. During this time of tragedy, I, along with all New Yorkers, stand together with Governor Malloy and the people of Connecticut to remember the victims and help bear the pain of their community."
This week, Governor Cuomo received a letter from Governor Malloy asking New York to join Connecticut in honoring the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In addition, Governor Cuomo has requested that places of worship and government buildings in New York that have the capability, to ring bells twenty-six times in honor of each life that was lost at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
