Today Governor John R. Kasich announced Col. Chip Tansill (U.S. Army, retired) will lead the Ohio Department of Veteran Services beginning today. Tansill served as executive director of the Franklin County Veterans Services Commission and replaces Col. Tim Gorrell, who recently stepped down as director.
"We are grateful to our veterans for their service and the more we work to improve opportunities for them, the stronger our state becomes," said Kasich. "I'm grateful to Col. Tansill for taking on this important new challenge and value Col. Gorrell's service and passionate advocacy for those who have served our country. We look forward to continued work with Col. Gorrell to serve our state."
