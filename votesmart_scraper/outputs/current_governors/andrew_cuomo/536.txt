Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Regarding Rights of Farm Workers
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 10, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"From nail salons to restaurants to the home health care industry, this administration has fought tirelessly to end abusive employment practices and protect the rights of employees. We have moved aggressively against employers who abuse their workers, and held bad actors accountable to the fullest extent of the law. We raised the minimum wage to restore the basic promise of economic justice, and have fought to strengthen worker protections statewide.
"Yet because of a flaw in the state labor relations act, farm workers are not afforded the right to organize without fear of retaliation -- which is unacceptable, and appears to violate the New York State Constitution. I agree with the NYCLU that the exclusion of farm workers from the labor relations act is inconsistent with our constitutional principles, and my administration will not be defending the act in court. We will not tolerate the abuse or exploitation of workers in any industry. This clear and undeniable injustice must be corrected."
