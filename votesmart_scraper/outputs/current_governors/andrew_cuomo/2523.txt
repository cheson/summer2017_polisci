"Tonight, the Senators that voted for the NY SAFE Act of 2013 made a bold statement, coming together in a bipartisan, collaborative manner to meet the challenges that face our state and our nation, as we have seen far too many senseless acts of gun violence. I commend Senator Skelos, Senator Klein, and Senator Stewart-Cousins for their hard work on this important legislation."
