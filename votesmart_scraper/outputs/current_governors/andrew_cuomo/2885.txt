Letter to New Yorkers: Marriage Equality for All New Yorkers
Letter
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 29, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

Progress in New York State has always turned on the right side of history, but for too long we lagged behind on the issue of marriage equality.
Governor Cuomo believed this issue came down to a question of fairness and civil rights. The Governor worked alongside an unprecedented, bipartisan coalition of organizations and supporters to build momentum in every region of the state for passage of marriage equality legislation.
With the world watching, the Legislature passed marriage equality at the end of the legislative session, making New York the largest state to legalize marriage for all of its citizens.

With this legislation, we have finally torn down the barrier that has prevented same-sex couples from exercising the freedom to marry and we have reclaimed our position as a progressive leader of the nation.
