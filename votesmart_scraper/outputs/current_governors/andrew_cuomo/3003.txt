Governor Cuomo to Reduce His Salary by 5 Percent
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 3, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that he will reduce his salary by five percent.
The salary for the Governor, $179,000, is set by state law and has not changed since 1999. The Governor will return to the State the amount his salary is reduced.
In addition, Lt. Governor Robert J. Duffy and newly hired senior members of the Cuomo Administration who are filling existing positions in the Executive Chamber are also taking salary reductions and have agreed to take a pay cut of 5 percent from their predecessors' salaries. This includes the Governor's Secretary, Counsel, Director of State Operations, Counselor and the Chief of Staff.
Governor Cuomo also directed that the budget for the Executive Chamber be reduced by five percent.
"Change starts at the top and we will lead by example," Governor Cuomo said. "Families and business owners in every corner of the state have learned to do more with less in order to live within their means and government must do the same."
The Secretary to the Governor has initiated a review of all Executive Chamber expenses to determine where the reductions will be made.
Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said, "The Governor's announcement of cuts in the Executive Chamber budget, including cuts to his own salary, demonstrate that sacrifices will be necessary in all aspects of State government if New York is to regain its fiscal health."
