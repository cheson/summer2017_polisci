Governor Cuomo announced $22.6 million in grants awarded to not-for-profit organizations and municipalities throughout the state to rehabilitate, repair and improve 1,166 homes and provide new opportunities for homeownership.

"The state is committing nearly $23 million to improve homes and make New York a better place to live, especially for some of our most vulnerable citizens," said Governor Cuomo. "New York State wants to help build stronger, more vibrant communities from the ground up, and I am proud to be partnering with local governments, community leaders and the nonprofit sector to make it happen."
