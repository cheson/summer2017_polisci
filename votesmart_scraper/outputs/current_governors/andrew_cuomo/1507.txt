Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Speaker Carl Heastie today outlined an agreement on groundbreaking reforms to New York State's ethics laws and rules.
"I said that real ethics reform was essential to a complete budget this year and I applaud Speaker Heastie and the Assembly for their leadership in supporting the highest ethical standards New York has ever established," Governor Cuomo said. "This new level of disclosure and transparency will go a long way towards restoring the public trust. The more trust, the more credibility."
Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, "When I assumed the leadership of the New York State Assembly, I assured the voters of this state that their government is working for them. I assured them that by whatever means necessary, we would do everything in our power to regain their trust and to bring true reform and accountability into these halls. Today, the Assembly Majority took a monumental step toward fulfilling that promise. I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Governor Cuomo on ethics reform."
