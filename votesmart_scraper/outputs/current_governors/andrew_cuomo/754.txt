Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that 29 district attorneys' offices will receive more than $14.2 million in grants to enhance their investigation of state tax evasion and welfare fraud cases. Prosecutors in Saratoga and Rensselaer counties will receive grants for the first time, while 27 additional municipalities will receive funding to continue their work to crack down on individuals and businesses who fail to pay taxes or commit fraud.
"This fraud is not only a theft from taxpayers, but it also diverts resources and assistance from our most vulnerable New Yorkers," Governor Cuomo said. "This funding will give prosecutors the tools they need to help crack down on this fraud and hold accountable those who seek to game the system."
