Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 2, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today issued an update on the lake effect snow that dumped up to 12 inches of snow on parts of Erie County over the holiday weekend and continues to move across central portions of the State. The forecast calls for the heaviest snow to occur across the northern and central portions of New York and could bring up to 12 inches of snow to the warning areas. Additionally, snow showers are moving into the western parts of the Capital District region. Generally, wind gusts will be 8-15 mph, but strong gusts up to 40 mph are possible by the shores of near Lake Ontario and Lake Erie.
"Snow and strong winds are expected to continue to impact parts of the state through Monday, and I urge all New Yorkers in those communities to exercise caution if they must travel," said Governor Cuomo. "This is still one of the busiest travel periods of the year, and drivers should plan ahead to account for low visibility or other hazardous conditions, and above all, stay safe."
