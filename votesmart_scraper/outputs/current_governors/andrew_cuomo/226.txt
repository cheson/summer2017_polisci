Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 24, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my condolences to the men, women and children who lost their lives from the earthquake that devastated Italy earlier today. The people of Italy have shown courage and resilience throughout this tragedy and tonight, we keep them in our thoughts and prayers.
"While we are still trying to understand the extent of the damage, we are closely monitoring the situation. New York stands ready to lend our support in the weeks and months to come -- just as Italy did for New Yorkers in our time of need."
