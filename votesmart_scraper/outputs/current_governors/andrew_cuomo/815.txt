Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo outlined the latest efforts of his Task Force to Combat Worker Exploitation. From the start of 2015 to today, the State has recovered and returned $28.9 million to more than 24,000 workers who were victims of wage theft. Additionally, since its formation in July, the Governor's Task Force to Combat Worker Exploitation has officially launched more than 450 investigations into worker exploitation, finding more than 2,700 violations, including theft of wages, failure to protect workers with mandatory Workers' Compensation coverage and retaliation against workers who complain about violations of the law. The cases affect more than 2,000 workers in New York State.
The Governor highlighted these efforts at a national conference on integrating immigrants, often the victims of workplace exploitation. Under Governor Cuomo, New York State directs more than $1.8 billion annually for immigrant-related services, including medical services to legal immigrants, bilingual education for both children and adults and legal services for immigrants.
"I believe that government has a responsibility to protect and promote immigration -- not to block it or harass people who only want a better future for their families," said Governor Cuomo. "New York is a state of immigrants, and when the immigrant community succeeds, we all succeed. As Governor I am proud to be standing up for New York's immigrants and fighting exploitation, and this administration is not going to rest until every worker and every family has the opportunity to make the most out of their God-given talents."
