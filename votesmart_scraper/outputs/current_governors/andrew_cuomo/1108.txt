Governor Cuomo announced that attendance at New York State Park campgrounds is on pace for another record-setting year, and reminded New Yorkers that many of the state's finest camping facilities are open for fall camping well into the autumn months.
"We're on track for a banner year at New York state campgrounds and it's not too late to see what you've been missing," Governor Cuomo said. "With Labor Day right around the corner and the fall foliage season fast approaching, there is still plenty of time to make a reservation and visit on of New York's great campgrounds and experience that natural beauty that dots every corner of this state."
