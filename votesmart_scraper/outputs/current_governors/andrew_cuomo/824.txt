Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Skelos Verdict
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 11, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"There can be no tolerance for those who use, and seek to use, public service for private gain. The justice system worked today. However, more must be done and will be pursued as part of my legislative agenda. The convictions of former Speaker Silver and former Majority Leader Skelos should be a wakeup call for the Legislature and it must stop standing in the way of needed reforms."
