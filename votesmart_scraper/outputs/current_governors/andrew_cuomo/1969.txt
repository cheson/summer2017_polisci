Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that 10 projects have progressed to the next stage for federal action based on a thorough State vetting of their Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) proposals. This past June, Governor Cuomo announced a call for projects to be funded by the HMGP program to assist local governments and non-profit organizations rebuild stronger, more sustainable communities. Authorized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the program aims to increase the State's resiliency, mitigate the risks of loss and damage associated with future disasters, and reduce hardship.
"As extreme weather becomes increasingly routine, we must not only rebuild New York but build it back stronger and better able to protect the safety of our citizens," Governor Cuomo said. "This vital program enables communities to think creatively about preparing for future storms, bolstering infrastructure and helping to revive local economies in the process."
The 10 projects, estimated at $128 million, are among the first to be advanced for funding from this program. FEMA funds provide 75 percent reimbursement of eligible costs, up to the amount of the award. In-kind services or materials may be used toward the 25 percent non-Federal match.
After a Presidential disaster declaration, as in the case of Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee and Superstorm Sandy, FEMA provides HMGP funds for States to administer grant programs that support local hazard mitigation planning and long-term hazard mitigation measures to reduce the loss of life and damage to improved property from natural disasters.
