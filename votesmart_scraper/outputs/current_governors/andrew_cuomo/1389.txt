This week the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, announced the Top 10 programs for the Roy and Lila Ash Innovations in Public Engagement in Government Award. Included is the NY Rising Community Reconstruction Program, launched by Governor Cuomo in 2013 to help rebuild communities after the devastation caused by Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee.
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo released the following statement regarding the recognition:
"The NY Rising Community Reconstruction Program took an innovative approach by empowering local communities to not just rebuild what was lost, but also back better and stronger for the future. This award by Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government recognizes the high level of local engagement and community involvement that is at the core of the NY Rising Community Reconstruction Program, and has helped New Yorkers to play a leading role in the rebuilding after storms Sandy, Irene and Lee. I congratulate the program staff and executive director Jamie Rubin for their creative work and continued dedication to this cause."
