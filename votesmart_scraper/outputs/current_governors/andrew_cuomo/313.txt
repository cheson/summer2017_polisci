Letter to New York Post - Response to their July 9th Editorial
Letter

To the Editor,
The comptroller's audit of the state's Excelsior jobs program is flawed to the point of having no merit. Furthermore, to say that the state's economic development efforts have "no tangible results" is laughable. Nearly 800,000 new private sector jobs have been created during the course of this administration, bringing this state's overall private sector job number to a record 7.9 million. Unemployment has also been cut by almost half across the state and upstate New York is experiencing historic growth. Does the Comptroller thinks it's just a coincidence that we hit new record highs? The fact is, state efforts have shown more economic skills, knowledge and capacity than the comptroller has shown in managing the state pension fund--which has had very poor results. We suppose the Comptroller would like to claim that too is a coincidence?
Additionally, the Post's suggestion that New York should cut taxes only shows their lack of knowledge. Taxes have been cut every year of this administration. Income taxes are down in every bracket, middle class rates are at a 70-year low, corporate taxes are at their lowest rates in four decades, and manufacturing taxes have been reduced to zero.
Start Up zones should be the Post's euphoria as they are tax free zones for 10 years. As the Post should know, high taxes exist in New York State because of property taxes, which are double the amount of state taxes, and are not under the state's control. If your editorial board were interested in the facts, they would point out Governor Cuomo not only cut state taxes, but capped property taxes--something never done by the Post-friendly Republican governors.
