Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 23, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo launched a statewide effort to recruit Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces to volunteer and assist immigrants who want to become American citizens. Veterans would teach newcomers English and help them prepare for the U.S. civics portion of the naturalization exam. The initiative will also encourage immigrants to volunteer with Veterans organizations, including the New York State Division of Veterans' Affairs offices and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals to assist returning service members in their transition from military to civilian life.
"New York has long been a beacon to those who come to this nation to make a better lives for themselves and their families," Governor Cuomo said. "I can think of no better way to honor and continue this rich legacy than this program, which pairs heroes who fought to preserve the American Dream with those who came to here to pursue the American Dream. Our strength is our diversity and I'm proud to help launch this new initiative for new New Yorkers."
