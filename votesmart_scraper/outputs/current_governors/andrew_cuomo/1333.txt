"This Memorial Day, as we enjoy time with friends and loved ones, we pause to remember the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice safeguarding the freedoms that we cherish every day. In times of war, these heroes selflessly answered the call of duty to protect our nation's values and built our country into the land of strength and opportunity that it is today.
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of our fallen heroes, and sincerest thanks to all who have served and continue to serve. Their sacrifice and courage has earned our deepest gratitude. On this day and every day, we celebrate that service, we honor their lives, and we remember."
