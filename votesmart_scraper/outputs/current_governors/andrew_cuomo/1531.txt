Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today traveled to Rochester to deliver an address to the Rochester Rotary and Rochester Business Alliance regarding his Upstate agenda and Executive Budget, in which he detailed the $10 billion in capital investments that are specifically targeted for Upstate.
The $10 billion in capital investments represent the highest amount proposed specifically for Upstate in modern history and builds off of the more than $15 billion in capital investments the State has made Upstate over the past four years. As part of today's address, the Governor discussed in detail two programs to continue the State's focus on growing the Upstate economy: the Regional Economic Development Councils (REDCs), and a new program, the Upstate Revitalization Initiative (URI).
"Upstate New York has turned the corner after decades of neglect that it used to see from state government -- and now it's time to make that progress permanent by making the largest investment in the region in modern political history," Governor Cuomo said. "Our proposal for more than $10 billion isn't just about injecting capital into the region, it's about investing in the talent and sophistication and potential that these communities have always had but have yet to be fully realized. It's about believing in Upstate again, and saying to New Yorkers throughout the region that we do stand with them, and that better days are yet to come. That is why the Legislature needs to pass our Upstate Economic Revitalization plan this year, because Upstate communities have waited long enough."
