Location: Albany, NY

"I extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of those lost in the accident that occurred on Sunday morning on the Long Island Expressway. While we are still learning more, at least three souls were killed and eight more injured in this terrible tragedy.
"I personally knew Scott Martella who was among those killed in the crash as he served in my administration for more than four years. Scott was a dedicated, beloved public servant who worked day in and day out to improve the lives of his fellow New Yorkers. Scott was always full of big ideas to help solve the toughest challenges of the day, and he was deeply respected for his strong work ethic, candor and fighting spirit. Long Island is a better place today because of his service and dedication to the community.
"I join all New Yorkers in mourning the passing of those lives lost, and my thoughts and prayers are with all Long Islanders during this extremely difficult time."
