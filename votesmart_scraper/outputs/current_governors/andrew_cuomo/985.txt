Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo signed legislation to strengthen financial support for the families of terrorist attack victims. The new bill will allow insurers to waive commission fees associated with the purchase of annuity insurance for families affected by any terrorist attack on the United States, expanding on the current law which only allows a waiver for families affected by the September 11, 2001 attacks.
"New Yorkers stand together whenever tragedy strikes," said Governor Cuomo. "This bill will allow insurers to better support people who are impacted by heinous acts of terrorism, and I am proud to sign it into law."
