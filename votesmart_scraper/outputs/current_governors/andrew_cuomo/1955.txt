Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the New York State Police will conduct a week-long enforcement initiative targeting speeding and aggressive drivers across the state. The "Speed Week" campaign runs from April 17 through April 24, 2014. Fines for speeding and aggressive driving can reach nearly $1,000 and add up to 11 points on a driver's license.
"Too often families are forced to endure needless heartache as a result of reckless driving," said Governor Cuomo. "During Speed Week, the State Police will be out in force across New York cracking down on drivers who break the law, putting themselves and others at risk. This week and every week, I urge drivers to slow down and adhere to the vital and lifesaving rules of the road."
