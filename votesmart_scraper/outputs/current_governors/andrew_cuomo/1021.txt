Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that the New York State Board for Historic Preservation has recommended the addition of 27 properties, resources and districts to the State and National Registers of Historic Places. The nominations reflect the remarkable breadth of New York's history, ranging from an Oswego fort that sheltered Holocaust refugees to the nation's first outdoor bank teller window to the only remaining historic carousel on Coney Island.
"These sites are the locations of significant moments in New York's rich history that in many cases reverberated across the nation and beyond," Governor Cuomo said. "By placing these landmarks on the State and National Registers of Historic Places, we are honoring and preserving their legacy and giving visitors the chance to learn about this state's vibrant history."
