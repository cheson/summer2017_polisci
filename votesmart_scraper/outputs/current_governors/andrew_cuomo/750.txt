Governor Cuomo today announced the successful completion of another round of targeted crude oil tank car and rail inspections intended to improve public safety and reduce potential dangers associated with the transport of crude oil across New York State. Inspection teams examined 756 crude oil tank cars, approximately 239 miles of track and 51 switches. Overall, state and federal teams uncovered and addressed three critical defects and 66 non-critical defects.
"By holding crude oil transporters to the highest standard in New York, we are making the public safety our number one priority and reducing the potential for deadly accidents," Governor Cuomo said. "We will continue to work with our federal partners to ensure that any and all defects are repaired immediately, and that New York's rail systems remain the safest in the nation."
