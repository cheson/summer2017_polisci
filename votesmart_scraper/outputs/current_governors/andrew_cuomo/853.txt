Governor Cuomo Announces Over 100 Farm Breweries Are Now Operating in New York State
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 2, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that during the past year, 43 new farm breweries have opened their doors in New York State, bringing the state's total number of operational farm breweries to 106. Additionally, the Governor's Farm Brewery law, which created a new license for craft brewers that use New York grown ingredients and included an exemption on brand label registration fees for small brewers, has saved brewers nearly $1 million to date.
"New York's thriving craft beverage industry continues to grow, create jobs and bolster local economies in every corner of this state," Governor Cuomo said. "This administration has cut red tape and eased regulations that have helped these farm breweries expand while strengthening the state's agriculture and tourism industries."
