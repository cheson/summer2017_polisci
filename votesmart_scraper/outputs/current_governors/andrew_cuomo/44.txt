Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Manchester Arena Explosion
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 22, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"I am both shocked and heartbroken by the horrific explosion at the Manchester Arena in England. This apparent act of terrorism, targeting a concert attended by thousands of teenagers and young people, is an inexplicable and abhorrent assault on our universal values as human beings. An attack on one is an attack on all, and New York stands in solidarity with the British people and our friends around the world against the forces of hate and terror.
"Out of an abundance of caution, I have directed state law enforcement officials to step up security and patrols at high-profile locations across New York, including our airports, bridges, tunnels and mass transit systems. The safety of New Yorkers is priority number one, and we are in close contact with federal and local officials as we continue to remain vigilant in the wake of this tragedy.
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest condolences to the victims and their loved ones."
