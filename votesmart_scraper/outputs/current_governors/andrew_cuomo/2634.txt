Statement

"The important legislation passed by the Senate and Assembly today sends a strong message that New York State has zero tolerance for domestic violence. This legislation will strengthen the state's existing laws to ensure that those who repeatedly commit domestic violence crimes are subject to stricter bail requirements and harsher penalties, so that innocent victims no longer have to live in fear of harm or continued abuse. New York State will be a safer place for our children and families as a result of this legislation, and I thank Majority Leader Skelos, Speaker Silver, and the sponsors for their hard work on this critical bill."
