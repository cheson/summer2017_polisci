Letter to New Yorkers: Help Your Neighbor This Holiday Season
Letter
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 23, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

As we give thanks with family and friends this holiday season, it is important that we also give back.
In the spirit of Thanksgiving, Governor Cuomo today launched "Help Your Neighbor," a statewide initiative to urge businesses and New Yorkers to give directly to regional food banks throughout the holidays.
Regional food banks are the primary sources of food for those in need, but in these difficult economic times, food banks are struggling to fill their shelves.
If you would like to volunteer at a local food bank or make a donation, click here to find a food bank near you.
Items in highest demand at food banks include: canned meat, vegetables, and stews; soups; pasta; canned or boxed entr√©es; cereal; and personal care items.
Thanksgiving is a time for common purpose and togetherness. It is a time for generosity, and New Yorkers have always been the first to give. With the "Help Your Neighbor" initiative, we can all do our part to make sure that no New Yorkers go hungry throughout the holiday season.
