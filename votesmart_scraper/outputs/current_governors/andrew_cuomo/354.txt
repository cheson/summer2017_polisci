Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 30, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"I commend the Pentagon's decision to end its archaic practice of discriminating against transgender military service members, whose sacrifices to protect our country are as whole as those of any other United States soldier. Now, the values of our military more closely reflect those that our Armed Forces fight to preserve.
"For centuries, New York has proven that diversity is our greatest asset and our strongest weapon against injustices everywhere. This is the state of the Stonewall Movement, and I am proud to be advancing the fight for equality during our time -- from passing marriage equality to prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity. The military's new policy will ensure that transgender Americans who step forward to defend our freedoms are treated with the dignity, respect, and fairness they deserve."
