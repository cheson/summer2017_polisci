Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 30, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today urged residents to begin preparing their homes and families for heavy rains and potential flooding and the possible arrival of Hurricane Joaquin later this week. The Governor also reminded New Yorkers to sign up for NY-Alert at https://users.nyalert.gov to receive immediate alerts on flood warnings and severe storms.
"Our state has seen the damage that extreme weather can cause time and time again -- and I am urging New Yorkers take precautions for more heavy storms in the coming days," Governor Cuomo said. "Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Irene proved that you do not have to be near the coast to be impacted by Mother Nature. I have directed State agencies to ready their emergency response equipment in partnership with local governments, and I encourage all of our state's residents to be prepared and stay safe."
