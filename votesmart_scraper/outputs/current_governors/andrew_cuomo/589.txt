Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

"Earlier today, in Jerusalem, a horrific terrorist attack injured over 20 people. This is another reminder of the hate-fueled violence that the people of Israel have faced, and that violence must end. I have said before that friends stand together in times of crisis, and this remains especially true today. As we continue to pray for peace, my thoughts and prayers are with the people of Israel, and especially those most affected by this tragedy."
