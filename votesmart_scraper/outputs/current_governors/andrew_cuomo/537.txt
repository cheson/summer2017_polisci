Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today toured the fish stocking operation at Indian Lake in Hamilton County, New York. The state Department of Environmental Conservation released more than 14,000 trout and salmon in lakes, rivers and ponds in remote acres across the Adirondacks. The effort builds on spring stocking operations which includes the release of more than 1.7 million catchable-size brown trout, 431,555 rainbow trout, and roughly two million yearling lake trout, steelhead, and landlocked salmon.
The Governor also visited Whiteface Memorial Highway in Essex County, where he was joined by state and local officials from the region.
Earlier today, the Governor announced the state's largest Adirondack land acquisition in more than 100 years, with the purchase of the 20,758-acre Boreas Ponds Tract that completed the purchase of 69,000 acres from The Nature Conservancy.
