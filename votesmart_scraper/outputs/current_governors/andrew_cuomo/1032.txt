Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced 15 more businesses plan to expand in or locate to New York as a result of START-UP NY, the innovative program that establishes tax-free areas associated with colleges and universities across the state. These 15 businesses have committed to create at least 220 new jobs and invest approximately $4.3 million over the next five years in the Western New York, Southern Tier, Central New York, Capital District, Mid-Hudson and Long Island regions.
"START-UP NY is changing the way our state does business and with 15 more companies joining today, it is clear that our approach is delivering results," Governor Cuomo said. "The program continues to build momentum and attract private investment, already gaining commitments for nearly 4,000 new jobs from Buffalo to Brookhaven. I congratulate the latest round of companies that have joined START-UP NY, and I look forward to welcoming even more businesses to the Empire State."
