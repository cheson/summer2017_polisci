Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Teacher Evaluation Deadline
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 17, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Today is the final deadline for the handful of school districts, including New York City, that have failed to get their teacher evaluation systems in place. Please hear me - there will be no extensions or exceptions. Since we established one of the strongest teacher evaluation models in the nation last year, 98% of school districts have successfully implemented them. The remaining districts and their unions have until midnight tonight to do the same or they will forfeit the increase in education aid they have been counting on and both parties will have failed the children they serve."
