Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the New York Air National Guard has opened a $5.1 million federally-funded green technology hangar at Fort Drum's Wheeler-Sack Army Airfield that will house MQ-9 "Reaper" remotely piloted aircraft. The MQ-9s at Fort Drum are operated by the 174th Attack Wing, headquartered at Hancock Field Air National Guard Base in Syracuse, and are used to train Air Force pilots, sensor operators, and maintenance personnel. The $5,194,860 facility took nine months to build and will house two MQ-9 aircraft within 12,000 square feet of storage space.

"This new hangar is a real asset in improving the training and operations of the New York Air National Guard at Fort Drum," Governor Cuomo said. "This permanent facility provides the 174th Attack Wing with enough space to shelter its aircraft and more effectively train service members from across the country for overseas operations and domestic emergencies. As the major storms from the last few years have shown us, the National Guard is vital to New York State in responding to a natural disaster. Furthermore, this green facility will also reduce the use of energy to save taxpayer dollars in the long run, exemplifying our state's goal to dramatically increase energy efficiency in the next several years. The completion of this project will result in a stronger Fort Drum and enhance the security of our nation.
