Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the New York State Department of Financial Services and New York State Office of Children and Family Services have partnered to offer financial institutions and professionals training sessions on effectively recognizing, preventing, and reporting elder financial abuse -- the illegal or improper use of an elderly adult's funds, property, or resources by another individual.
"These professionals are in a critically important position to spot red flags and stop elder financial exploitation," said Governor Cuomo. "This training will help employees at banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions identify potential warning signs and promptly report suspected abuse."
