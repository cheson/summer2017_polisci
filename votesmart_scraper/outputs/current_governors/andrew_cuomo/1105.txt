"The killing of Idrissa Camara was a senseless and tragic act of violence that has robbed his family of someone who loved them deeply. My heart goes out to his family, his friends, and his fellow 32BJ members during this incredibly difficult time. I encourage New Yorkers to keep his loved ones in their thoughts and prayers."
