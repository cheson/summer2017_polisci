Statement

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the results of Child Passenger Safety Week seat check events, during which 88 percent of the 931 seats inspected were found to be improperly installed. Technicians found that only 112 had been installed correctly, which demonstrates the importance of learning how to properly install car seats and taking advantage of the state- and local-sponsored safety check events.
"The sheer number of incorrectly installed car seats found during these recent events is truly eye-opening," Governor Cuomo said. "As a father, I know that there is nothing more important than the safety of our kids. I encourage all parents with younger children to attend one of these free checks, get the facts, and ensure our youngest New Yorkers are being buckled up safely and properly."
