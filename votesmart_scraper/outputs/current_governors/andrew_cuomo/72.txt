Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Earth Day
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 22, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"This Earth Day, we celebrate the unparalleled natural beauty of the Empire State, but also recognize the very real and increasingly complex challenges facing our environment. From combating climate change and reducing carbon emissions to safeguarding our coastal communities and strengthening resiliency in the face of extreme weather -- New York must continue to lead the way forward.
"That's why we are doubling down on our commitment to safeguard the environment by implementing a plan to source 50 percent of our electricity from renewables by 2030, maintaining record funding for the State's Environmental Protection Fund, and advancing solar, wind, energy efficiency initiatives to drive the clean energy economy forward. And even as the federal government in Washington abdicates its responsibilities, New York is committed to exceeding the targets of the Clean Power Plan and setting a national example for progress.
"While we have made great strides, there is still much work, and I urge the federal government to uphold the Paris Agreement, which unites our planet's most powerful nations in the global fight against climate change. Today, I join with New Yorkers in reaffirming our pledge to protect our environment and create a safer, more prosperous New York for generations to come."
