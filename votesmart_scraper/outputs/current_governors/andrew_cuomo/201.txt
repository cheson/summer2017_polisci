This evening at approximately 8:30 p.m., an explosion was reported near 135 West 23rd Street in Manhattan. At this time there are at least 26 injuries, none of which have reported to be life-threatening. State officials are coordinating our response with federal and New York City authorities, and full State resources have been made available for this investigation. We are closely monitoring the situation and urge New Yorkers to, as always, remain calm and vigilant.
"Those traveling in or through the area should be advised of closed sidewalks and roadway, and check MTA.info for subway and bus service alerts. As a reminder, the PATH station at 23rd Street is closed for previously-announced weekend closures.
"We are in close contact with health providers to monitor the extent of the injuries and will provide information as it becomes available."
