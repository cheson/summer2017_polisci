Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Arrest of Rochester Man Attempting to Support ISIL
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 31, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"The arrest of Emanuel Lutchman is an important reminder of the new normal of global terrorism. Today law enforcement did their job well -- but the challenges we face have never been greater, and it is incumbent on every citizen to be diligent and responsible. I want to reassure all New Yorkers and our state's visitors that we are taking every precaution to keep people safe, and are in regular contact with our partners in both the federal government and local communities, statewide. I commend the Department of Justice as well as the FBI's Rochester area Joint Terrorism Task Force, including the State Police, for their hard work and diligence in preventing this possible attack."
