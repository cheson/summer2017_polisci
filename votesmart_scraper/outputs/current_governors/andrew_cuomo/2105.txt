Statement from Governor Cuomo on President Obama's 2014 State of the Union Address
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 28, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"In his 2014 State of the Union address, President Obama laid out a bold vision for the future of our nation. His agenda is a promising blueprint for economic development, with a focus that mirrors our approach in New York to bring jobs and businesses back from overseas and create new opportunities for the middle class to grow. I was proud to hear President Obama express his support for states prioritizing early education and I look forward to making New York the 4th state in the nation to offer quality full day pre-K for every child statewide.

"Just as we must strengthen our schools and economy, we must also invest in our infrastructure in order to prepare for the new reality of extreme weather. The federal government's support in 2013 helped New York State begin to rebuild after the damage of storms Sandy, Irene, and Lee, and as the President has suggested, we must continue to invest in strengthening our communities for Mother Nature's next challenge.

"Finally, President Obama is right that women deserve equal pay for equal work, and he is right to call on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. New York is a state that has long fought for equality and celebrated diversity, and by welcoming new families and new businesses we will continue to grow as a community, as a state, and as a nation. I look forward to working with President Obama and our partners in the federal government to create new economic and educational opportunities for all New Yorkers, ensure safer, fairer, and cleaner communities, and reimagine our State for the future."
