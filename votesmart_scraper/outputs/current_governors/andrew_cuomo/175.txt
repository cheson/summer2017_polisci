Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Consolidation of Purchasing Operations in Onondaga and Otsego Counties
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 3, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"New York has some of the highest local property taxes in the nation, which is why my administration implemented a 2 percent property tax cap to tame out-of-control increases on property taxpayers and incentivize local governments to share services, lower costs and live within their means. There are more than 10,500 local governments, and too many counties, towns and villages offer overlapping services and employ administrators performing duplicative responsibilities, passing along those costs to residents.
"The recent agreement between Onondaga and Otsego Counties to share a purchasing director is a smart and effective way to save taxpayer money by eliminating administrative overhead and increasing purchasing power. Onondaga County has been a statewide leader in championing and implementing innovative consolidation efforts, having made similar agreements with dozens of other localities.
"I encourage other counties and municipalities across the state to follow the lead of Onondaga and Otsego Counties as we work to make local government more efficient by reducing bureaucracy and streamlining operations."
