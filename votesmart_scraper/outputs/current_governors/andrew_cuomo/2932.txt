Statement from Governor Cuomo on Sentencing of Alan Hevesi
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 15, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

Public integrity was my top priority as New York Attorney General and it is as Governor. For government to work, it must have the trust of the people. Those who hold public office must safeguard that trust, and those who violate their oath must incur just punishment. It is a new day in Albany and the old way of doing business will not be tolerated.
"My public integrity bureau spent four years investigating and prosecuting those who had corrupted the integrity of the New York State Comptroller's Office under Alan Hevesi. In the beginning, skeptics said it was business as usual, not a crime. It was assumed to be typical Albany corruption. At the end of the day, eight guilty pleas resulted, including those of Hevesi's Chief Investment Officer David Loglisci and chief political consultant Hank Morris, and ultimately by Hevesi himself, and we recovered $170 million for the people and the State pension fund.
"Today, Hevesi was sentenced to a term of one to four years in prison. As we learn of the court's ruling, it is important to bear in mind the heavy toll of public integrity offenses. Just as you cannot put a price on public integrity, you cannot quantify the harm done to the bond between the government and the People when public integrity is compromised. Hevesi was a statewide elected official who admitted violating his oath for personal and political gain, and we must continue to root out corruption wherever it may be found."
