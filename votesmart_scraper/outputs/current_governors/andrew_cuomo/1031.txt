Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Duplication of Benefits Decision By U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 16, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's decision by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to waive the "duplication of benefits" policy is a victory for homeowners whose homes were damaged by Superstorm Sandy. This will allow homeowners who have received FEMA flood insurance proceeds to continue focusing on what is most important -- building back better and stronger with the next storm in mind. This was the right move for HUD to make, and I am grateful to Secretary Castro for hearing our plea to relieve the burden that this policy would have caused to New Yorkers who were already burdened by the effects of extreme weather."
