Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on MTA Approval of 2015-19 Capital Program
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 28, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Today is a great day for the millions of New Yorkers and other riders who rely on the MTA. Mass transit forms the backbone of New York's economy -- allowing millions of people to move throughout the region on a daily basis -- and the MTA's approval of the revised Capital Program means that the system will continue to move New Yorkers forward in the years ahead.
"I challenged the MTA to revise its Capital Program in a way that reduced costs and delivered results more efficiently, without cutting any major projects or the benefits they will bring to commuters -- and that is exactly what this new Program does. Along with the State's historic $8.3 billion investment and significant funding from the City to pay its fair share, this will mean a stronger, safer and more reliable MTA well into the future."
