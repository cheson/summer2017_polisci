Governor Cuomo Announces Continued Efforts to Protect New Yorkers from Crude Oil Disasters
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 27, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced additional efforts to protect New Yorkers from potential disasters involving the transport of crude oil, including a second targeted round of rail inspections designed to enforce freight rail safety regulations, as well as urging changes to federal spill response plans to better reflect and properly address threats posed by the increasing transport of crude oil throughout New York State.
"The state is continuing proactive inspections to protect New Yorkers and prevent crude oil accidents," Governor Cuomo said. "Our preparedness and response plans must be adequate ahead of time--not after tragedy strikes. We have seen too many crude oil disasters, and with continued comprehensive safety and emergency response reviews and efforts to improve federal policies and regulation, we can help ensure that New York is doing everything possible to prevent mishaps and keep crude oil transport safe."
Following several severe accidents across the U.S. and Canada, Governor Cuomo issued an Executive Order on January 28 that directed several State agencies to conduct a top-to-bottom review of safety procedures and emergency response preparedness related to rail, ship and barge shipments of crude oil. Out of growing concern regarding the volatility of crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota, agencies were requested to work with federal partners to enhance preparedness and oversight, and increase inspections.
