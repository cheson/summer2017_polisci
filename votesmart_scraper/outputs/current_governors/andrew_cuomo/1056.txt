Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 9, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"This week, U.S. News & World Report selected the University at Buffalo as one of the top 100 universities in the nation. This a truly prestigious distinction, and I offer my congratulations to all of the faculty, staff and students that have made UB into the educational powerhouse that it is today."
"Over the past few years, the University at Buffalo has been vital to Western New York's economic and cultural resurgence. It has helped to attract and retain everything from large scale manufacturing companies to young people and budding entrepreneurs, and Buffalo is thriving as a result. The Queen City has become a national model for urban revival, and I fully expect UB to play an integral role in the region's future for years to come."
