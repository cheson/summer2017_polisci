Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 28, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"I never thought I'd see the day when refugees, who have fled war-torn countries in search of a better life, would be turned away at our doorstep. We are a nation of bridges, not walls, and a great many of us still believe in the words 'give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses...'
"This is not who we are, and not who we should be.
"I have directed the Port Authority, the Department of State, and my Counsel's Office to jointly explore all legal options to assist anyone detained at New York airports, and ensure that their rights are protected.
"America is a nation of laws and those laws provide rights that must be respected and followed regardless of political ideology."
