Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has pledged to make Indian Point its first and top priority in its review of seismic risk at 27 nuclear plants throughout the country. At the request of the Cuomo Administration, the NRC has agreed to a cooperative review of Indian Point as a joint effort between the NRC and New York State.
As a result of the meeting today at NRC headquarters in Maryland between Lieutenant Governor Robert Duffy, Director of State Operations Howard Glaser, and top NRC officials, the NRC has also agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding that will:
* Share federal data regarding seismic risk specific to Indian Point with New York technical experts
* Include New York experts as part of the NRC on-site inspection team that will evaluate Indian Point with regard to seismic risk
In addition, NRC Chair Greg Jaczko has agreed to conduct a personal site inspection of Indian Point with New York officials.
"It is essential that the NRC move quickly to answer the significant and long-standing safety questions surrounding Indian Point," Governor Cuomo said. "We appreciate the NRC agreeing to move swiftly and we look forward to working closely with them on this issue to protect the health and safety of New Yorkers."
"I thank the NRC for hosting us today and for recognizing the legitimate concerns that exist regarding Indian Point," Lieutenant Governor Duffy said. "Seismic activity is a serious concern regarding the facility and we will now work with the federal government to make sure we get answers for the people of New York."
