Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo, New York City Public Advocate Letitia James, and child plaintiffs today announced a series of measures being taken by the state to better protect foster children. The measures are the result of a recently settled class action alleging harm to children in New York City's foster care system.
"The care and protection of vulnerable children must be one of society's highest priorities. Today we are making that a reality for the tens of thousands of children in the New York City foster care system," said Governor Cuomo. "This case is about compassion and the true nature of human justice, and Public Advocate James and the plaintiffs should be commended for drawing attention to this issue. I am proud that we are taking this action, because it is the right thing to do."
