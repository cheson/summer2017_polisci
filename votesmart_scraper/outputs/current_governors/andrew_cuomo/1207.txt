Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today held the 2015 Summer Adirondack Challenge to promote summer tourism and showcase recreational opportunities in the Adirondack region. The event brought together hundreds of state and local officials, tourism industry representatives and summer enthusiasts to explore Upstate New York and enjoy local Taste NY food and beverage products. At the Adirondack Challenge, the Governor announced four vital investments to strengthen tourism in Upstate New York.
"The Adirondacks are truly one of New York's crown jewels and I know that once people see them for themselves, they will fall in love and keep coming back," Governor Cuomo said. "From the Adirondack Challenge to these new State initiatives, we are getting the word out in order to grow tourism in this region, as well as other parts of Upstate, which in turn will create jobs and improve these local economies. This is the perfect time to plan a visit, and I encourage everyone to come and experience all that the North Country has to offer."
A total of 350 Adirondack Challenge participants, including New York State Tourism Advisory Council Vice Chair Thurman Thomas, joined in some of the region's most alluring outdoor activities, including: a whitewater rafting trip down the Indian River; golfing at Cedar River Golf Course; a 6-mile hike to Ross Pond; fishing at Cedar Creek; a 68-mile motorcycle ride though the Adirondack Park; and paddle boarding, canoeing kayaking at Byron Park in Indian Lake.
