Governor Cuomo Launches Initiative to Return Thousands of New York City Apartments to Rent Regulation
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 6, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced a major initiative to return up to 50,000 illegally deregulated apartments to rent regulation, restoring rights to thousands of tenants. The owners of the targeted buildings are receiving J-51 tax benefits and claim to be exempt from rent regulation, contrary to the law. Each will be instructed via a letter to re-register their units.
"There will be zero tolerance for those who disregard the law and reap these benefits while denying tenants affordable housing they are obligated to provide," Governor Cuomo said. "We're pursuing every avenue to return these units to rent stabilization and take us one step closer to ensuring every New Yorker has a safe, decent and affordable place to call home."
