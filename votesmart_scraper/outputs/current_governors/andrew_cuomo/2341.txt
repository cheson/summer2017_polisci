Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Passage of Legislation to Combat Texting-While-Driving
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 5, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Today the New York State Legislature passed legislation that strengthens penalties for new and young drivers who are found texting-while-driving or using a handheld electronic device while behind the wheel. Under this legislation, penalties will be strengthened for individuals holding junior and probationary licenses if they text and drive. Inattention and inexperience is a deadly combination and no parent should have to experience losing a child at the hands of a text message. I applaud my colleagues in the Legislature for their swift action in passing this necessary law."
