Governor Cuomo congratulated Sheldrake Point Winery, a farm winery in Ovid, Seneca County, for winning "Best Wine" for its 2014 Wild Ferment Riesling ice wine at the Canberra International Riesling Challenge in Canberra, Australia. Now in its 16th year, the Challenge is the biggest Riesling event in the southern hemisphere, with almost 500 wines from seven countries competing for the top honor.
"This is a great honor for a great New York winery and I'm proud to congratulate Sheldrake Point Winery for earning the top award at this rigorous international competition," said Governor Cuomo. "It's no secret that New York's wine industry is flourishing, and this is an example of how more and more people are taking notice of that renaissance. Our state is home to some of the best wines in the world, and I look forward to seeing the industry continue to reach new heights in the years to come."
