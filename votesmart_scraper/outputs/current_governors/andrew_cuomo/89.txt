Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 3, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"The passage of today's budget extender continues all state operations and fully funds our $16.4 billion new New York construction and economic development plan for the next complete fiscal year.
"From the Buffalo Billion to Whiteface Mountain to Penn Station to the LIRR, our development moves forward. But make no mistake: we are far from done. We must finish the job and pass a responsible budget that makes college tuition free for the middle class, fully funds our public schools, cuts taxes for the middle class, Raises the Age of criminal responsibility, combats homelessness, and moves New York forward. We will work until we accomplish it all."
