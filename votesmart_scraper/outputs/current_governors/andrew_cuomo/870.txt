Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the grand opening of the rehabilitated F.W. Woolworth building in Watertown. This historic landmark, which was one of the nation's earliest F.W. Woolworth stores, has been transformed from a downtown eyesore into a vibrant building with 50 units of affordable rental housing and ground-level retail space.
"A symbol of the past has become a sign of vitality for this city," Governor Cuomo said. "Through coordinated efforts between state, local and private sector partners, this historic building now provides the residents of Watertown with housing that is safe, affordable and energy efficient, while attracting new life and business activity to the downtown area."
