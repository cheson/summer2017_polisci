Statement from Governor Cuomo on President Obama's Strong and Sensible Actions and Proposals to Reduce Gun Violence
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 16, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Today President Obama proposed a series of common sense measures that would strengthen federal laws to protect all Americans from gun violence, including universal background checks for all gun sales and a new ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. In addition, the executive actions the President took today will be a big help in the fight to keep guns out of the hands of potentially dangerous people, and keep our schoolchildren safe from harm. As many of the illegal guns in New York come from out of state, I strongly applaud the President's proposal for tougher gun trafficking laws that will help to end the proliferation of lethal weapons across state lines.

"These are reasonable and sensible proposals that have nothing to do with the right to bear arms, or the interests of hunters or sportsmen. Our nation has experienced far too much bloodshed as a result of gun violence, and the time for action is now. I commend the President for his leadership and swift action to stem the tide of gun violence, and I pledge my full support to seeing these proposals put into law. We have done it here in New York, and Congress should stand with the President to make our nation a safer place for all."
