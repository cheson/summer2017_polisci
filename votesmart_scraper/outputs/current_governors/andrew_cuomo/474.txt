Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 29, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Earlier today, a Department of Corrections and Community Supervision Correction Officer was severely injured and received serious burns to his body upon opening a suspicious package at his home in Oneida County. The State of New York has no tolerance for any violence of this sort, and I have ordered a full investigation to find those responsible for this horrific incident. The New York State Police and New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision are assisting the Oneida County Sheriff's Office and federal law enforcement agencies.
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, our thoughts and prayers are with this Correction Officer and his family during this difficult time, and we join them in hoping for a full and speedy recovery."
