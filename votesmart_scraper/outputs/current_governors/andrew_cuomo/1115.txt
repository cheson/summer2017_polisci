Governor Cuomo Announces Initiative to Educate Bar Owners About Revamped ID Cards
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 19, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced a new state effort to educate bar owners, security, and staff of licensed establishments about new security features included on driver licenses, permits, and ID cards issued by the state. A new electronic brochure will be distributed to thousands of bar owners across the state that provides a description of the advanced security features in these forms of identification to make it easier for owners and staff at establishments with liquor licenses to authenticate them and identify fake IDs.
"The new security features embedded in New York's redesigned driver's licenses and identification cards are second to none and we're looking to help responsible bar owners and their employees spot fakes and forgeries," Governor Cuomo said. "As a new college semester is about to begin, we must work together to keep underage New Yorkers out of the bars and out of harm's way."
