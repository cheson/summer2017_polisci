Statement from Governor Cuomo on Assembly Passage of Fair Pay Legislation
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 27, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"The women of New York have waited far too long for this day to come. My administration was proud to introduce this legislation two years ago to address the discrepancy in pay that -- even in 2015 -- still exists between men and women in the workplace. This discrimination is wrong, and will be addressed across New York with the signing of this bill. All women deserve to receive a paycheck based on their position and job performance rather than their gender. Today, with the Assembly's passage of the fair pay provision of the Women's Equality Act, the Empire State is taking a firm stand in support of equal pay for women in the workplace, and I look forward to signing this legislation as we continue to advance and ensure the rights of women across New York State."
