Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the State Department of Taxation and Finance's wide array of tax enforcement programs collected $3.9 billion in the past year, helping ensure that honest New York taxpayers are protected and tax evaders are held responsible for their fair share. The $3.9 billion in evaded taxes collected is an increase of approximately $200 million compared to the prior year, a five percent increase.
"The vast majority of New Yorkers file their taxes honestly, and they should not have to pick up the tab for tax scofflaws who attempt to cheat their way out of paying their fair share," Governor Cuomo said. "This administration has worked hard to crack down on tax evasion and put tools in place that enable the State Tax Department to better enforce the law. With nearly $4 billion collected over the past year, these stepped up enforcement measures are working to help protect New York taxpayers."
Each year, 96% of the $87 billion in state and local taxes collected by the New York State Tax Department is remitted voluntarily. The Department's enforcement programs -- criminal investigations, audit and collections - are responsible for collecting the additional 4%.
Of the $3.9 billion in evaded taxes collected during the 2013-14 fiscal year, $800 million was collected by the Tax Department on behalf of local governments. The remaining $3.1 billion funds New York State programs.
