Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 12, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a joint investigation between the New York State Police and the State Division of Human Rights into the alleged hate crime in Wellsville, New York. Earlier this week, it was reported that a softball field dugout was defaced with the words "Make America White Again," accompanied by a spray-painted swastika. Governor Cuomo has directed a full investigation into the alleged hate crime.
"New York has zero tolerance for bigotry, fear and hatred, and those who seek to undermine the core values this state and nation were founded upon," Governor Cuomo said. "I have ordered a full investigation into this deplorable act, and those responsible for this conduct will be held to the fullest extent of the law. New York is one of the most inclusive and open communities in the world -- this type of behavior is not who we are, and not who we will ever be."
In 2000, New York State enacted legislation to strengthen penalties for hate crimes. Under the law, a person commits a hate crime when one of a specified set of offenses is committed targeting a victim because of a perception or belief about their race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation, or when such an act is committed as a result of that type of perception or belief. Hate crimes can be perpetrated against an individual, a group of individuals or against public or private property. Also under state law it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, religion, ethnicity and many other protected classifications.
