By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced 53 state-supported projects are underway or set to begin in New York to provide clean, resilient on-site power for hospitals, schools and other buildings, as well as reduce demand on the state's power grid. When completed, these projects will increase the total number of combined heat and power systems in the state by approximately 10 percent.
"New York is committed to a clean energy grid that also reduces our electricity demand, saving money for taxpayers and businesses," Governor Cuomo said. "These projects will help contribute to this goal, cutting existing energy consumption and working toward creating a sustainable and resilient community."
