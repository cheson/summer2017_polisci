Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today convened the first meeting of a new working group established to carry out the Mohawk Valley Capital for a Day 31-point agenda.

"This outgrowth of the Capital for a Day initiative is one more way that we're working to keep this region's economic momentum moving forward."
