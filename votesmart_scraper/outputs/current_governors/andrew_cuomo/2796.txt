Statement From Governor Cuomo on Today's Protest Related to The City's Taxi Plan
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 4, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"Today a group is protesting against the City's plan to change the taxi and livery rules in New York City. Previously groups protested in favor of the City's plan. There is no doubt that there are strong feelings and opinions on many sides. The optimum goal is to design a plan that provides taxi access to the outer boroughs, access to the disabled, revenue for the City, and respects the medallion franchise. We are working to fashion a plan that fairly balances those goals. I will not approve a plan that doesn't."
