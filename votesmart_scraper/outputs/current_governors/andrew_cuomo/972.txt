Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 11, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that a delegation from New York State will embark on a follow-up mission to Puerto Rico on October 12-14 to assist the commonwealth in creating a health care transformation plan. Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, Secretary of State Cesar Perales and State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker will be joined by New York State Medicaid Director Jason Helgerson, as well as Assembly Members Marco Crespo and Richard Gottfried.
"New Yorkers help out when others are in need," Governor Cuomo said. "The health care challenges that Puerto Rico is facing are not unlike those that we addressed successfully here in New York. I believe that together we can help the Puerto Rican government reform its health care system, save taxpayer dollars and ultimately improve the lives of millions of people -- and we are proud to be helping out."
