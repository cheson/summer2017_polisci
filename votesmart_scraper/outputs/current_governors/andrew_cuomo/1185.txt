Governor Signs Legislation to Protect Workers and Homeowners Involved in Mold Assessment, Remediation and Abatement
Governor Cuomo today was honored by the NYS Laborers and the NYS Pipefitters and Plumbers at their respective events in Warren County. The Governor was presented with the "Champion of Organized Labor" award by the Laborers and the "NY Builder" award by the Pipefitters and Plumbers. These awards come on the heels of the Governor's presentation of a comprehensive vision to transform LaGuardia airport.
Additionally, the Governor also signed legislation to protect workers who are involved in the cleanup of mold from harm. The law modifies and improves upon a new licensing requirement for contractors and workers engaged in the assessment, remediation and abatement of mold.
"New York is New York because we dared to do what people said was impossible -- and today, we are doing it again," said Governor Cuomo. "From building a new Tappan Zee Bridge to fundamentally reimagining LaGuardia airport, we are taking on big, visionary projects in New York. It's not easy, but together with our brothers and sisters in organized labor we are getting it done and we are building a new future for this state -- and I am proud to be a partner in that effort."
