Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced more than $17 million in state funding for improvements to restore and enhance the natural beauty of historic Niagara Falls State Park. The improvements are part of the Governor's $70 million commitment to restore the park's natural landscape, enhance its recreational facilities and attract thousands of new visitors to the region each year. Governor Cuomo also announced that, after a month-long competition and review, "Niagara Scenic Parkway" has been selected as the new name for the former Robert Moses Parkway, which will soon grace the more than fifteen miles of parkway between the Grand Island Bridge and the Town of Porter.
"Niagara Falls State Park is truly one of the crown jewels of New York, offering unparalleled natural beauty and some of the best outdoor recreation opportunities in the nation," Governor Cuomo said. "This investment builds the good progress we have made to transform Western New York from the ground up -- revitalizing our state parks and historic sites, boosting tourism and creating thousands of well-paying jobs. Today we are recapturing the bold vision and determination that created the most ambitious parks system in the nation, and preserving and enhancing our natural treasures for generations to come."
The Niagara Falls State Park revitalization plan is a multi-year commitment to transform the nation's oldest state park and better reflect noted park designer Frederick Law Olmsted's vision for the landscape. The plan has renewed the park's major viewing areas including Luna Island, Prospect Point, Three Sisters Islands with new pedestrian walkways, enhanced landscaping, new benches, light posts and railings.
Key improvements moving forward this year include:
