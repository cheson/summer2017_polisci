Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on NFL Approval of Deal to Keep Bills in Buffalo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 19, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"I thank Commissioner Roger Goodell and the owners committee of the National Football League for approving the agreement that keeps the Bills where they belong--in Buffalo. The agreement protects taxpayer dollars and puts in place a long term plan for the team's continued presence in Buffalo. The NFL approval is an important step and I look forward to the formal signing of the stadium lease and non-relocation agreement by the Bills, the State and the County soon."
