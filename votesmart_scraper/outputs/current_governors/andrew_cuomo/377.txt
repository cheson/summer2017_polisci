Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the 5th Anniversary of Marriage Equality in New York
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 24, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Today marks the fifth anniversary of marriage equality in New York. Without a shadow of a doubt, signing this bill into law was one of my proudest moments as Governor. This state and nation were founded on principles of fairness, equal justice and equal rights -- and it is our duty to ensure that those values ring true for every New Yorker under the law. By passing marriage equality, we demonstrated once again that when New York leads -- the rest of the nation follows. That progress continues in this state for the LGBT community with first-in-the-nation executive action to protect transgender individuals from discrimination and harassment, as well as new regulations to ban conversion therapy. In New York, we believe that it is a fundamental right to live free and love whom you choose, and we will continue to fight for freedom and equality for all people."
