"Today, FEMA has informed New York State that residents in communities affected by the recent flooding will not be eligible for the Individual Assistance program that would have provided federal funds to help homeowners rebuild and recover. Hundreds of families sustained significant damage to their homes and have had their lives upended. New Yorkers believe in coming together to help each other in times of disaster. We are good neighbors and come to each other's aid. As I have said from the day the flood waters devastated towns and villages across Upstate New York, if federal assistance is not provided, the State of New York will step in to provide whatever is needed so New Yorkers can rebuild their lives and their homes. An effective government is one that serves the people and when disaster strikes is there to help. In this situation, people need help, and you haven't seen anything until you see New Yorkers come together. The state will step up to the plate to ensure that those affected by these floods have the resources and assistance they need to get their lives back together."
