Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 11, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo highlighted a conference for the Upstate Revitalization Initiative -- the $1.5 billion economic development competition that is designed to invest in locally-identified assets and transform regional economies in Upstate New York. The conference was held today in Buffalo, where local officials and community leaders from across Upstate presented status reports for their economic revitalization plans to attract new opportunities and support growth in their own regions. The conference also gave officials the opportunity to gain a more detailed understanding of the economic resurgence currently being seen in Western New York.
"Buffalo has had an extraordinary economic recovery - and through this competition, we're going to take that momentum and energy across Upstate New York," Governor Cuomo said. "This competition is about creativity, energy and a local vision for the future. We are making the most transformative investment in Upstate in modern political history, and I look forward to seeing the best that each regional council has to offer."
