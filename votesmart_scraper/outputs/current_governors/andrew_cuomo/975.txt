"New York State is a leader and national model when it comes to dealing with the effects of climate change and this funding further strengthens that standing," Governor Cuomo said. "This first-ever grant program addresses the need to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of farms, while also enhancing the ability of those farms to recover after severe weather events which have become an all too frequent reality."
