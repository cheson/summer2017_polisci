Holiday Crackdown on Impaired, Distracted and Speeding Drivers to Start Tomorrow
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the State Police and local law enforcement will increase patrols to crack down on drivers who violate the law this Fourth of July weekend from Friday, July 3 until Monday, July 6.
"As we approach the July 4th weekend, State Police will be out in full force to crack down on reckless behavior and distracted driving on our roadways," Governor Cuomo said. "I urge all drivers to act responsibly and stay safe in order to avoid needless tragedies this holiday weekend."
New York State Police Superintendent Joseph A. D'Amico said, "The Fourth of July is known for its fun and fireworks, but New Yorkers should also remember it can also be fatal if they don't make the right decision. Our Troopers will be out to identify and arrest any motorist who is driving drunk or impaired. Be safe this holiday weekend, allow plenty of time to travel, put down your cell phones and don't get behind the wheel if you have been drinking."
Last year, the New York State Police issued more than 10,200 vehicle and traffic tickets during the 4th of July weekend. Troopers arrested more than 180 people for DWI and responded to more than 650 accidents, two of which resulted in fatalities.
During the enforcement, drivers can expect a number of sobriety checkpoints and DWI patrols. Troopers will also be targeting the illegal sale of alcohol to minors.
