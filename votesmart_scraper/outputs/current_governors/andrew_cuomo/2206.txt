Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 24, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $815 million in funding for a series of critical Superstorm Sandy recovery and rebuilding infrastructure projects on Long Island. These projects include rehabilitating wastewater treatment plants, upgrading Long Island's utility system, creating microgrids to meet energy needs, and strengthening vulnerable bridges for future severe weather.

"In the last year, New York State has delivered essential funding to homeowners and businesses impacted by Superstorm Sandy, allowing homes to be repaired and the doors of businesses to reopen," Governor Cuomo said. "This funding is the next big step in Long Island's recovery. We are providing $815 million to Nassau and Suffolk counties so that they can move forward on critical public works projects, rehabilitating and strengthening infrastructure that suffered costly and serious damage in communities across the island. From mitigating wastewater treatment plants that serve hundreds of thousands of households to modernizing Long Island's utility and preventing power outages to fortifying vulnerable bridges for future storms, these projects will rebuild a more resilient Long Island for years to come. I am pleased to provide this support, and we remain fully committed to helping the residents of Long Island reach a full recovery."
