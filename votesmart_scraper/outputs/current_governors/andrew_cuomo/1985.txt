Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 3, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

The Cuomo Administration today announced that the Citizen Preparedness Corps Training Program will take place on Saturday, April 5, in St. Lawrence County. The program, highlighted in Governor Cuomo's State of the State Address in January and launched last month, aims to provide approximately 100,000 New Yorkers with the tools and resources to prepare for emergencies and disasters, respond accordingly, and recover as quickly as possible to pre-disaster conditions.
"Over the past three years we have experienced several significant natural disasters that have caused the state and the nation to adjust to a new type of normal -- one where we need to make sure our communities and citizens are safe, prepared and trained to respond to often disastrous weather events," said Governor Cuomo. "The Citizen Preparedness Corps Training program will train citizens across the State to provide critical assistance in their own homes and to their own neighbors whenever disaster strikes. Beginning with approximately 100,000 citizens trained this year, we intend to make this program a centerpiece of the State's coordinated response to future severe storms and natural disasters."
