Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 20, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today urged New Yorkers to take steps to protect themselves and stay aware of current and potential hazardous weather conditions. Heavy rainfall from the remnants of Tropical Depression Bill is expected to impact the Hudson Valley, Long Island, and New York City Saturday night through Sunday evening, with the heaviest rain expected to occur overnight.
"With heavy rain on the forecast this evening and Sunday, I urge New Yorkers to exercise caution and take the necessary steps to stay safe," Governor Cuomo said. "New Yorkers should be prepared for the possibility of flooding and hazardous travel conditions, and I urge all residents to put safety first."
A flood watch is currently in effect for New York City, Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester counties until further notice. New York City has activated their Flash Flood Emergency Plan in anticipation of heavy rain today and into tomorrow.
A flood warning is currently in effect for Tompkins County until further notice.
A flash flood or flood watch means there is a potential for flooding within the designated watch area based on current forecasts -- when a watch is issued, citizens should be alert and ready to take action. A flash flood or flood warning is issued when flooding has been reported or is imminent -- at that point, the public should take necessary precautions and actions at once. It is essential that citizens get up-to-date weather information during flood watches and warnings, which can escalate quickly.
The best way to receive official emergency information, which can change quickly, is to subscribe to NY-ALERT (nyalert.gov), the state's free, all-hazards notification system, and by downloading the app for iOS and Android devices at ialertz.com.
