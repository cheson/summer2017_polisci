Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today issued the following statement after the Public Employees Federation Executive Committee approved the administration's three-year labor agreement. PEF is one of the largest unions in the United States and is New York's second-largest state-employee union, representing 54,000 workers.
"The approval of this agreement by the Public Employees Federation Executive Committee marks a major step forward in our efforts to secure a fair contract for our state's workforce and all New Yorkers. We are pleased that this balanced agreement benefits all parties while also protecting taxpayers' bottom line. New York's public servants represent the backbone of our government, effectively delivering results for the people of this state. I commend PEF's Executive Committee for their leadership, and look forward to seeing this contract ratified by its membership in the near future."
The three-year contract agreement includes a 2 percent increase in 2016-17, 2 percent increase in 2017-18 and a 2 percent increase in 2018-19. Both the state and PEF agree to work together on a plan to reduce out-of-control healthcare costs.
The contract must now be ratified by its membership.
