Statement from Governor Cuomo on State Response to Severe Storms and Power Outages in Southern Tier
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 28, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"Storms on Thursday night and Friday night produced high winds that knocked out power to tens of thousands of New Yorkers. NYSEG customers in Binghamton, Elmira, Oneonta, Ithaca, Liberty and Mechanicville were among those hardest hit and company officials predicted that some customers will be out of service for multiple days. In order to speed up the restoration process, last night I secured crews from the Long Island Power Authority to assist NYSEG in the effort to restore power as quickly as possible. Twenty LIPA crews are now in the field assisting NYSEG, bringing the total number of line and forestry crews currently working to restore power to 301. In addition, I have directed the Public Service Commission staff to survey the restoration efforts and the extent of the damage. Commission staff is working directly with NYSEG officials to ensure that there are no impediments or bottlenecks that could prevent speedy restoration of electric service, and has coordinated with other utilities to bring additional resources to bear as they become available."
