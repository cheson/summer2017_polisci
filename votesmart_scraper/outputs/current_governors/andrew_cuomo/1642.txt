"Today's announcement from Attorney General Holder that the Department of Justice will support marriage equality for same-sex couples as it goes before the Supreme Court is another important step toward ensuring equality for all.
"This case should be an important step forward for our country -- a chance to right a wrong that continues to divide us into first and second-class citizens based on whom we love. No one should be denied the right to marry because of who they are, and that's why I am proud that New York led the nation as the first large state to ensure marriage equality for all of its citizens. I applaud President Obama and his administration for taking this stand on the right side of history."
