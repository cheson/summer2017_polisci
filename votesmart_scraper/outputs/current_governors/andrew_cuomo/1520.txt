"It is with great sadness that we learn of the death of State Police Trooper Donald R. Fredenburg, who passed away this morning after collapsing during a training exercise. A Utica native, Trooper Fredenburg put his life on the line for his fellow New Yorkers as a U.S. Marine, and was prepared to do the same during his training as a New York State Trooper. He represented the ideal of service to another that defines the State Police so well. My heart goes out to the friends and family of Trooper Fredenburg, and I am directing that flags on all state government buildings be flown at half-staff on Monday, March 16 in his memory."
