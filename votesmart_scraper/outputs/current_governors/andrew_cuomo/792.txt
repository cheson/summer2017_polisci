Governor Cuomo Cracks Down on Landlords Who Illegally Remove Buildings' Central Heating System
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 22, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the first results of an ongoing investigation that uncovered the illegal removal of central heating systems in over two dozen rent regulated buildings in New York City impacting 145 tenants. Landlords, who are required by law to pay for and provide heat and hot water to rent regulated tenants, had replaced their central heating systems with individual apartment meters, forcing tenants to pay for their own heat.
"My administration is committed to protecting the rights of all tenants, and this action is another example of how we are standing up for New Yorkers and holding unscrupulous landlords accountable," said Governor Cuomo. "These landlords are going to restore their central heating systems, and others should be aware that we will not hesitate to crack down on any illegal behavior."
