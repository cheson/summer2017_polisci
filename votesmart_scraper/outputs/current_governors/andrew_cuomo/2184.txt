Governor Cuomo Issues Proclamation Making November Military Family Month in New York State
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 8, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"During the month of November, we honor New York's military families, who have made their own sacrifices in the service of our country," Governor Cuomo said. "When our service members are deployed for a mission overseas or to respond to a domestic emergency, they leave behind spouses, children, siblings and parents, and in many ways, these family members provide the courage and support that allows their loved ones to serve in the U.S. Armed. We owe these military families our gratitude, and they are in our prayers and thoughts as we wish our service members abroad a safe return home to the U.S."

The legacy of New York State is built upon the courage of the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, as well as the many family members who have supported them during both wartime and peacetime. Today there are roughly 30,000 New Yorkers in serving in the National Guard and Reserves, in addition to nearly 900,000 veterans living in New York State.
