Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 7, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Early this morning, Carey Gabay -- a member of our administration -- was shot in Brooklyn. Carey is now in critical condition at Kings County Hospital. Carey is First Deputy General Counsel at Empire State Development and was formerly an Assistant Counsel to the Governor.
"Carey is an outstanding public servant who joined our administration in 2011. He is a Harvard-educated lawyer who works for the State because he wants to give back to others and make a difference. He is just 43 years old and is a kind-hearted man. Carey is a friend to all who have the pleasure of meeting him. I ask that New Yorkers join us by keeping him, his wife Trenelle and his family in their prayers at this time.
"This tragic shooting -- this one by another seemingly random bullet -- is the latest heartbreaking reminder that the crime of gun violence must stop. Enough young, innocent people have died, and it must stop now."
