Governor Cuomo Directs State Agencies to Activate State Preparedness Efforts For Tropical Storm Hermine
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 1, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"As Tropical Storm Hermine continues to gain strength in the Gulf of Mexico, I have directed the State Office of Emergency Management to closely monitor its path and for state agencies to be prepared. The MTA, Port Authority, Department of Transportation, National Guard, State Police, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, State Parks and Public Service Commission are on alert and ready to respond in the event this storm impacts our region.
"Current projections show the storm growing into a Category 1 Hurricane in the next 24 hours before it makes its way up the East Coast. If the storm continues far enough up the coast, there is a possibility downstate New York may experience high rip currents, heavy rain and strong winds this Labor Day weekend.
"While we continue to monitor this storm, I urge all New Yorkers, especially those in the downstate region, to be prepared, check local weather reports, and use NY Alert to stay updated on the storm's progress throughout the weekend."
