Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that 54 organizations from across the state, including statewide and local nonprofits, advocacy organizations and labor groups, are joining the Enough is Enough campaign to combat sexual assault on college campuses. Many of these organizations represent countless victims of sexual violence, and today they are adding their voices to the growing coalition of supporters of the Governor's proposal to codify uniform sexual assault prevention and response protocols for all colleges and universities -- public and private -- in New York. The adoption of this proposal will make New York a leader in the fight against on-campus sexual violence and will better protect the State's 1.2 million college students.
"New York is taking a stand by proposing the strongest measures in the nation to combat sexual assault on college campuses," Governor Cuomo said. "This wide-ranging group of local and statewide organizations is joining our call to action to fight this growing epidemic. Together, we are saying enough is enough -- it's time for New York to lead the charge to end this scourge on our colleges now."

The support of these organizations comes one day after student advocates from Barnard College, Columbia University, Fordham University, New York University and Syracuse University travelled to Albany to meet with Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul and lobby legislators to support the Governor's proposal.
It also builds on the recent support received from the following:
· 18 members of New York's Congressional Delegation;
· More than 100 elected officials from across the State;
· More than 40 city mayors;
· 17 of 18 county executives;
· Whoopi Goldberg.
The "Enough is Enough" campaign includes a new State Police hotline -- 1-844-845-7269 -- dedicated to reporting sexual assaults on college and university campuses. Specially-trained members of the State Police will be on-call 24 hours a day to respond to sexual assault calls throughout the State. The campaign also has a video featuring students, advocates and elected officials supporting the Governor's policy to address sexual assault on college campuses.
To promote the campaign and the importance of passing the Governor's proposal, Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul has embarked on a statewide tour to bring Enough is Enough to college campuses across the State. She is meeting with members of the student body, faculty and administration as well as service providers and advocates for survivors of rape and sexual assault.
The Governor's on-campus sexual assault prevention proposal includes the following components:
· A statewide definition of affirmative consent, defining consent as a clear, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement between the participants to engage in specific sexual activity;
· A statewide amnesty policy, to ensure that students reporting incidents of sexual assault or other sexual violence are granted immunity for certain campus policy violations, such as drug and alcohol use;
· A Sexual Violence Victim/Survivor Bill of Rights, which campuses will be required to distribute to all students in order to specifically inform sexual violence victims of their legal rights and how they may access appropriate resources. The Bill of Rights clearly states that students are given the right to know they can report sexual assaults to outside law enforcement, including the State Police;
· Comprehensive training requirements for administrators, staff, and students, including at new student orientations.
