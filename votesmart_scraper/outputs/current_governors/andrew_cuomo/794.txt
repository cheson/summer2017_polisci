Governor Cuomo Signs Executive Order to Separate Teens from Adult Prisoners
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 22, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo issued an Executive Order directing the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, in collaboration with the Office of Children and Family Services, to implement a plan to remove minors from adult prisons in the state. The plan, which was developed over the past several months, will transfer all female youths and all medium and minimum security classified male youths sentenced to state prison from adult facilities where they are currently housed to a juvenile facility. This facility will provide specialized programs of treatment geared for younger offenders while also ensuring the safety of staff, inmates and the surrounding community.
"By housing 16 and 17 year-olds in an age-appropriate correctional facility, we can offer them a better chance at turning their lives around and becoming productive members of society," said Governor Cuomo. "This action will help reduce the recidivism rate, increase public safety, and save taxpayer dollars over the long run. No matter how you look at it -- whether it's the economic benefits, the security benefits, or the human benefits -- this action is the right thing to do, and I am proud to continue bringing much-needed reform to the justice system."
