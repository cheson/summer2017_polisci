Governor Cuomo Urges Caution as Arctic Temperatures and Record Low Wind Chills Continue to Sweep New York
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 14, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today warned New Yorkers that arctic temperatures and severe winter weather are expected to continue through the long weekend. The National Weather Service has issued Wind Chill Warnings for counties across the state as a polar air mass coupled with gusty winds has produced hazardous wind chills well below zero. Temperatures could plummet as low as 30 degrees below zero, and wind chill temperatures are forecasted to reach -25 degrees to -60 degrees, especially in the Southern Adirondacks. The lower Hudson Valley, New York City, Nassau, and Suffolk Counties will also continue to experience wind chills as low as 30 degrees below zero. The temperature in New York has not been this low since February 2015.
"With bitterly cold temperatures expected to continue through the long weekend, New Yorkers should remain alert and avoid all unnecessary travel," Governor Cuomo said. "The state continues to monitor the situation closely and provide assistance to communities in need. As this weather poses an acute health risk to children and the elderly, I urge New Yorkers to exercise caution, remain indoors, and above all -- stay safe."
New York has established a cold weather hotline at 1-866-881-2809 to provide New Yorkers with important safety tips during extreme cold weather. Many counties have established warming stations in their communities. For a current list of open warming stations, callers should select option 1 to speak with a NYS representative.
Governor Cuomo reminds New Yorkers to make sure they are prepared by keeping ample emergency supplies in their home and vehicles. If you are heading outdoors, dress in layers and keep your hands and head covered to protect against frostbite. Other safety tips include:
