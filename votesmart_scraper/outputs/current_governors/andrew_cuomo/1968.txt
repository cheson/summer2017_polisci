Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced nearly $790,000 awarded to New York State under the 2014 federal Farm Bill to prevent invasive species on agricultural lands across New York State. This funding will help the State Department of Agriculture and Markets, the State Integrated Pest Management program and institutions of higher learning to jointly work together to identify potential pests before they gain a foothold in New York agriculture.
"We've seen how insects that prey on crops have wreaked havoc in other states, and we're taking steps to guard against that here in New York," Governor Cuomo said. "New York's agricultural industry is essential for the state's economy and employs thousands of New Yorkers. This funding will help ensure that potential threats to agriculture are contained so New York's vital agriculture industry can continue to thrive and grow."
Specific sectors impacted by this funding cover a number of agricultural commodities, including: grapes, apple orchards, peach orchards, forests, vegetables including tomatoes and potatoes, and nurseries. Potential threats to these commodities include: leaf roll virus (grapes), apple proliferation phytoplasma (apples), plum pox virus (peaches), tomato leaf miner (tomatoes), Emerald Ash Borer and Asian Longhorned Beetle (forests).
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service solicited suggestions from interested parties, including states and U.S. territories, universities, federal agencies, nongovernmental organizations, private companies and tribal organizations. New York's high success rate in receiving these awards speaks to the importance of its past successes on previously funded invasive species projects.
