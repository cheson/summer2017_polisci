Governor Cuomo has made significant reforms to the state's energy and environmental policies in this legislative session.
The Governor championed the passage of "Power New York," a program that will encourage investment in clean power plants, streamline the approval process for new and improved plants, and give communities more opportunities to meaningfully participate in the siting process. The program will also encourage homeowners to invest in energy efficiency by allowing them to repay loans used to make energy-efficient improvements to their homes through savings in their monthly utility bill.
After years of gridlock, this important measure passed with support from environmental advocates, industry leaders, consumer and labor groups, and community organizations.
The Governor also pushed for greater protections to our waterways through the creation of a permitting system for large withdrawals from many of New York's rivers, lakes, and streams. New legislation now requires those extracting large amounts of water -- at least 100,000 gallons -- to first get a permit from the Department of Environmental Conservation. Under this new system, we can better safeguard New York's precious natural resources.
With Governor Cuomo's leadership, these provisions will help position New York as a leader in clean energy and environmental protection.
