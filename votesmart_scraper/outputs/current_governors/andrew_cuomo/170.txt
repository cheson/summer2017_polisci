Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 10, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced more than $325 million in funding is available to help elderly and low- and moderate-income New Yorkers heat their homes this winter. Applications for the Home Energy Assistance Program will be accepted beginning Monday, November 14.
"No one should have to choose between putting food on the table and paying their heating bill," Governor Cuomo said. "This critical program helps seniors and hard-working New Yorkers cover the high cost of heat during the cold winter months. I encourage those who are eligible to apply for this support and to stay warm and stay safe."
Eligible households can receive a one-time benefit of up to $626, depending on income, household size and heating source. A family of four can have a household income of up to $53,076 annually, or $4,423 a month, and still qualify for help.
Anyone living outside of New York City can apply for a regular Home Energy Assistance benefit online at myBenefits.ny.gov/. New York City residents can download the application here and mail it in.
The program is overseen by the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, but applications are accepted at local departments of social services.
Additionally, households may also qualify for an emergency benefit if they are at risk of getting their heat shut off or running out of fuel. Applications for emergency benefits will be accepted beginning Tuesday, January 3, 2017. Anyone in need of emergency assistance should contact their local department of social services.
