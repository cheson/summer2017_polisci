Cuomo Spokesperson Statement Regarding Ongoing Taxi Legislation Negotiations
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 13, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"Tomorrow, the Governor's office will be convening a summit of the stakeholders involved in the taxi legislation negotiations in order to resolve the outstanding issues. Among the outstanding issues are handicap accessibility of livery cabs, the transferability of and market for livery permits, livery and yellow cab pickups at airports, lack of financial incentives to purchase handicap accessible licenses, and concerns regarding the effectiveness of Taxi and Limousine Commission enforcement. As we have said all along, we are working very hard to reach consensus with the stakeholders in order to address taxi access issues in the five boroughs. The meter is running and this is the last chance to get a deal done before the end of the year. The issues are not primarily governmental ones among the Governor, the state legislature and the City. There are, however, remaining issues among the various stakeholders, business and advocacy groups whose interests must be reconciled."
