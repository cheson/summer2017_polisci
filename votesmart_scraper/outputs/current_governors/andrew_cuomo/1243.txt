Governor Urges New Yorkers to be Alert as Federal Government Issues Terror Warning for July 4 Weekend
Governor Cuomo directed the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Office of Emergency Management to enhance monitoring of celebrations and events on Saturday, July 4 in light of the recent terror warning issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Governor additionally urged New Yorkers to be alert and aware of any potential suspicious activity during the holiday weekend.
"We are keenly aware that New York State remains a top target for terrorists," Governor Cuomo said. "In response to the warning by the federal government, New York State is taking steps to increase monitoring and communication with our local, state, and federal emergency management and law enforcement partners through the holiday weekend. As we celebrate with family and friends this Independence Day, I urge all New Yorkers to not only remember the freedoms that we hold dear, but also remain cautious of their surroundings and learn to recognize and report suspicious activity."
This Saturday through 11:00 p.m., additional staff will operate the Emergency Operations Center and the New York State Watch Center, the state's 24-hour hour, seven-day-per-week monitoring point for all state national and international events.
DHSES Commissioner John P. Melville said, "Reporting suspicious activity can be crucial to maintaining the safety of all communities. If you see something, say something by calling the New York State Terrorism Tips Line at 1-866-SAFE-NYS."
