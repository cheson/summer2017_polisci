Statement from Governor Cuomo on the Assembly's Passage of Legislation to Combat Human Trafficking
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 16, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, New York is continuing to move forward in the fight against human trafficking. With the Assembly's passage of our bill to combat this heinous crime, which we introduced two years ago, we are now one step closer to strengthening protections for victims and enacting tougher penalties against those who exploit and oppress. Human trafficking is a crime that robs victims of their most fundamental rights, and it affects people in communities across our state -- including more than 1,000 children every year. That is an injustice that simply cannot be allowed to continue in New York, and I look forward to signing this legislation quickly to make our state safer for this vulnerable population."
