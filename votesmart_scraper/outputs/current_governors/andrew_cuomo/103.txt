Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Raise the Age
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 7, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"This year's state budget has exciting potential to make great strides for the people of New York. The budget contains a robust economic development program, groundbreaking college affordability program, property and income tax cuts for the middle class and groundbreaking civil rights progress with the proposal to 'Raise the Age' of criminal liability.
"New York should be ashamed to be one of two states in the nation that treat 16- and 17-year-olds as adults for criminal liability. The hell that is Rikers Island would be a target for human rights groups if they ever looked in their own backyard. Speaker Heastie, to his credit, has strongly advocated to pass Raise the Age. I have included it in my budget proposal to afford maximum leverage. Senator Klein is in a unique position to end the Senate's historic recalcitrance on this issue and insist that Raise the Age reform be passed in the budget.
"The Executive and Legislature have an excellent track record on achieving multi-faceted, balanced progress for the state. We have achieved unprecedented economic progress with spending controls, tax cuts, and our business development program. We have accomplished historic social change with marriage equality, paid family leave, gun safety, minimum wage, and transgender rights. We are a national progressive leader. This session we must add Raise the Age to that list."
