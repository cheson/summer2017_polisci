Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Rent Regulations
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 15, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"At this point, both houses of the State Legislature have been unable to come to an agreement to pass new rent regulations. While today may be the legal expiration date for some of these laws, landlords should under no circumstances believe that their responsibility under the current rent stabilization program has expired.
"Just as in 2011, when the Legislature let these critically important laws lapse, there will be no short term emergency. As outlined in the letter I wrote on Sunday to landlords of rent regulated units, the new package will be retroactive and any landlord who attempts to exploit this situation will face serious legal consequences. I have been clear and unambiguous: this Legislature will not leave Albany without passing new rent regulation laws for the more than 2 million tenants who depend on these protections.
"While the Legislature needs to act immediately, New York tenants should know that this state government will have zero tolerance for landlords that seek to exploit those who live in rent regulated units."
