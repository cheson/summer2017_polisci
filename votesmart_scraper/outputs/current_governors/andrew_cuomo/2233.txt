Governor Cuomo Announces More Than One Million Homeowners Have Registered for STAR
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 4, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that, after just six weeks, more than one million homeowners have registered with New York State for their Basic STAR exemptions. Basic STAR saves New York homeowners $700 every year on average, but is only available on the primary residence of owners with incomes below $500,000. A study by the Department of Taxation and Finance last year found that thousands of individuals with multiple properties were receiving more than one STAR exemption. This registration will ensure that homeowners only receive one STAR exemption for their primary residence.

"In just six weeks, more than one million homeowners have registered for their STAR exemptions, a huge boost in our efforts to protect New Yorkers from fraud in the program while ensuring eligible homeowners continue to receive the tax relief they deserve," Governor Cuomo said. "I encourage all New Yorkers who are eligible for STAR to follow the lead of these homeowners by registering for this tax exemption today."

More than 90 percent of those who have registered completed their registration on the Tax Department's website: www.tax.ny.gov. Online registration is fast, safe and easy.

"The response has been impressive to date, particularly with only 80% of the letters delivered thus far," said Commissioner of Taxation and Finance Thomas H. Mattox. "If you're one of the homeowners who have yet to register, don't delay - visit our website to register today. It will only take two to four minutes."
