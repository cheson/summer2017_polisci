Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a number of new measures to support the mission of the Task Force to Combat Worker Exploitation. First, the Task Force will be supported by $700,000 to coordinate outreach and education with workers and employers, as well as investigations, prosecutions and data collection and compliance efforts. Additionally, the Governor has created an Anti-Retaliation Unit and a Mediation Unit within the State Department of Labor to eliminate retaliation against workers who assert their rights, and to expedite the speedy disposition of cases generated by the Task Force's investigations. The Governor has also launched a new website (www.ny.gov/EndWorkerExploitation) to provide workers, employers and the general public with information about the Task Force and how to come forward and help combat worker exploitation.
"Our administration is taking aggressive steps to protect workers and combat exploitation, and today we continue our progress in that fight," said Governor Cuomo. "I want all employers across the state to hear this message loud and clear: we will not tolerate worker exploitation, period."
