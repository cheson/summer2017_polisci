Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that he is deploying the Department of Financial Services' Mobile Command Center to help eligible New Yorkers prepare and file their taxes for free. The unit will be making stops at locations throughout Upstate New York from April 4 through April 9.
"By delivering in-person assistance to help New Yorkers prepare and file their taxes, we are making the process as easy and straight-forward as possible," said Governor Cuomo. "I encourage all eligible New Yorkers to take advantage of these free services."
"It's now more convenient than ever for taxpayers to file their returns ahead of this year's April 18 deadline," said NYS Commissioner of Taxation and Finance Jerry Boone. "Tax Department volunteers are traveling with the Mobile Command Center and will be available to answer questions as taxpayers proceed step by step through the user-friendly tax preparation and filing software."
Taxpayers with federal adjusted gross incomes under $62,000 can save the expense of hiring a preparer or purchasing software by filing both their federal and state income tax returns at no cost. Tax Department volunteers will be on hand to answer questions about the software.
Since the tax filing season opened in January, the Tax Department has been partnering with libraries and non-profit organizations to provide free tax assistance to thousands of taxpayers at 85 locations, including sites in Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica. By deploying the Mobile Command Center, Governor Cuomo is extending the network of free filing assistance sites across the state.
