Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 18, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"I commend the administrators and faculty of the West Genesee School District who have taken a voluntary salary freeze. These are the type of tough but smart decisions school districts across New York should be making. West Genesee clearly understands the economic pressures we are facing and other school districts should follow this example."
