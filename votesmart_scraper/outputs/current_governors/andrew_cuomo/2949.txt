Location: Albany, NY

"In light of the catastrophe in Japan, New Yorkers must know the facts regarding Indian Point and its latest risk assessment.
"After watching the events in Japan and having previously opposed the Indian Point plant, this past Tuesday, I requested the White House schedule a meeting between my staff and senior members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. That meeting has now been scheduled for Tuesday, March 22 with, among others, Lieutenant Governor Robert Duffy and Director of State Operations Howard Glaser.
"The purpose of the meeting will be to discuss the risks facing Indian Point in the event of an earthquake, how prepared Indian Point is to handle an earthquake, as well as what risk assessments have been completed regarding Indian Point.
"We are looking forward to a productive dialogue with the NRC."
