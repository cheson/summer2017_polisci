Governor Cuomo Announces "Operation Hang Up" to Stop Distracted Driving
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 9, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that State Police and local law enforcement are stepping up patrols and checkpoints throughout the state from April 10 - 15 as part of "Operation Hang Up," which encourages drivers to focus on the road instead of using mobile devices. This effort combines periods of intense enforcement of anti-texting and hand held cell phone laws coupled with advertising and media outreach to let people know about the enforcement and convince them to obey the law.
"The message is clear: distracted driving is deadly and it will simply not be tolerated on New York roads," Governor Cuomo said. "With stricter laws and crack downs like this one we are working to make New York a safer state for all our drivers. Vigilance is particularly important as young motorists develop habits that will stay with them throughout their lifetime. I urge all New Yorkers to hang up, keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel so that no one has to unnecessarily suffer the pain of losing a loved one at the hands of a text."
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2012, 3,328 people across the country were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and an estimated 421,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver. Additionally, 10% percent of fatal crashes were reported as distraction-affected crashes.
