Governor Cuomo announced the safe return of the 20-member crew of forest rangers, employees and volunteers from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation who have been battling the 25,324-acre Stouts Creek Fire, near Milo, Oregon, for the past two weeks. Additionally, Governor Cuomo yesterday dispatched a second 20-member crew to continue New York's assistance in containing the West Coast fires. This next group is comprised of eight forest rangers, six employees and six volunteers from the Saratoga Springs division of the Department of Environmental Conservation.

"The professionalism and valor displayed during this assignment were second to none and I am thankful for their safe return. I wish the same for this second group that will be assisting in fighting these wildfires."
