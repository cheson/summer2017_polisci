Governor Cuomo on Federal Budget: This is the Niagara Falls of Trickle Down Economics
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 24, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

The federal budget, first let's be clear on the basic of the federal budget: it's a tax cut for the richest Americans, it is an investment in the government that they believe in, which is defense in the pentagon, and the way they finance tax cut for the rich is by cutting affordable housing, health care for the poor, and food for the poor. SNAP program. It is nothing new. In the 80s this was called trickle down. The theory is that if the rich do better, the rewards will trickle down to the rest of us. Now, this is trickle down much worse than Ronald Reagan did it. This makes, this is the Niagara Falls of trickle down economics, ok? But it will be devastating to a state like New York. The rich get a tax cut, the little guy, no housing assistance, no health care, no food. Have a nice day. It's an ultra-conservative approach to government. It's a hypocritical approach to government. Look at what they say. We believe in limited government, and small government. And we want to save tax dollars. Except for the Pentagon, which we like and we're going to give them $50 billion more. We want to close down Washington, and we want the power to go to the states, and let the states decide because they're closer to the people. Unless we disagree with what the states do, like in the case of New York where they do healthcare for the poor, then we want to stop that, right? They're against judicial activism. They don't like judges who are activists. But, they want the judges to enforce their view of the world like, "a woman doesn't have the right to choose." It is hypocritical all the way through. And it would be devastating to this state.
