Governor Cuomo Launches New York Youth Mentoring Program
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 5, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo launched the New York Youth Mentoring Program, which will provide career and life guidance to children who are at risk of failing out of school or in foster care across the state. The Program--guided by its Advisory Board, chaired pro bono by the Governor's mother, Mrs. Matilda Raffa Cuomo--will identify, train, and match hundreds of business-based mentors with students in some of New York's most challenging elementary and middle schools.
"New York State has a long-standing tradition of giving children access to every opportunity possible to reach their full potential," Governor Cuomo said. "New York once led the way in mentoring when my mother established the first New York State Mentoring Program nearly two decades ago. Today we are recommitting ourselves to helping our youngest New Yorkers. This mentoring program will give at-risk students the support they need to succeed in school and life. With this program, New York is once again leading by example in securing a brighter future for our children."
