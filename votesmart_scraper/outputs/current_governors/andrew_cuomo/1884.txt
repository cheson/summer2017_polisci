Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 2, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Fifty years ago today, President Lyndon Johnson moved our nation further along the path of progress by signing the Civil Rights Act. Since then, we have made significant headway in achieving greater equality throughout New York and the United States -- but there is still much that remains to be achieved. It is our duty as New Yorkers to stand with those who cannot stand up for themselves, and to side with those who are fighting for their rights. From achieving greater support for immigrant communities to protecting women's rights, the battle is not over, and New York remains committed to realizing full equality for all.
