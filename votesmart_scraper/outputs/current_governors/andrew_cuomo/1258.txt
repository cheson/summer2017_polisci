Governor Directs Port Authority to Light Spire of One World Trade Center in Rainbow Colors This Sunday
"New York has been a leader in the fight for marriage equality, and today's Supreme Court decision affirms what we have fought so hard for -- that marriage is a fundamental right that should be afforded to everyone, regardless of whom they love. When we passed the Marriage Equality Act in 2011, New York sent a message to the nation that it was time to end one of society's greatest inequities, and I am thrilled to see the Court join us on the right side of history. Dividing people into first and second-class citizens is not only wrong, it runs contrary to who we are as a nation. From Stonewall to Edie Windsor, New Yorkers have always been on the front lines of the fight to ensure equality and fairness for all. Today, we are proud New Yorkers and proud Americans. Today, progress marches on."
In recognition of this decision and New York City Pride Week, the Governor has directed that the lights on One World Trade Center's 408-foot spire will light up in rainbow on Sunday night, June 28.
