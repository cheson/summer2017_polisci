"Today we are seeing another sign of how New York is on the move, as Fitch Ratings has revised its outlook of the New York Power Authority from stable to positive and affirmed the Authority's high AA rating," Governor Cuomo said. "Following the recent "Triple Play" of upgrades to the State's overall credit rating from Standard & Poor's and Moody's as well as Fitch Ratings, this positive assessment of NYPA is a testament to the progress we have made over the last few years to put the State's fiscal house in order. After passing four on-time and balanced budgets, we have brought a culture of fiscal responsibility back to Albany. I am especially proud of the exceptional leadership shown by NYPA President and CEO Gil Quiniones and NYPA Chairman John Koelmel which helped make this upgrade possible."
