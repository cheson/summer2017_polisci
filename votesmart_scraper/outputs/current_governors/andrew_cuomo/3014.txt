Issue Position
By: Andrew Cuomo
Location: Unknown

We must restore honor and integrity to government, with tough new ethics standards, expanded disclosure requirements, independent investigators to root out and punish corruption, and an overhaul of campaign finance laws. We must remove legislative redistricting from partisan elected politicians and place it in the hands of an independent commission that works only for the people. And we must hold a constitutional convention -- A People's Convention -- to rewrite the Constitution and make these changes immediately because we cannot wait any longer for the state legislature to act.
