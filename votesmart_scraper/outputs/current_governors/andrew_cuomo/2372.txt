By: Andrew Cuomo

"NYPIRG's report is further evidence that we cannot wait on passing real reforms to our election system. The buildup of over 100,000 campaign finance violations over the last two years is unacceptable, and a clear sign that the current self-policing system at the Board of Elections does not work. The people of New York deserve an independent enforcement unit to pursue these violations and protect the integrity of our democratic system. Now more than ever there is no excuse for delay. The common sense reforms I have proposed give district attorneys the power to aggressively pursue corruption, create fairer elections, expand the voter registration process, and improve ballot access must be passed this session."
