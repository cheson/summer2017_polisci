Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the reopening of Interstate 84 between the Pennsylvania and Connecticut borders. This morning's ban on commercial and passenger vehicles will be lifted effective immediately.

"State crews have been working diligently to clear snow and ice from roadways across the State," Governor Cuomo said. "It is important to note that while the vehicle ban on I-84 has been lifted all motorists should proceed with caution as slippery road conditions may remain in certain areas."

Motorists can also get real-time traffic information, including road closures and winter road conditions by calling 511 or visiting www.511NY.org. The phone and web services provide travelers with up-to-the-minute traffic conditions and links to information about air, rail and transit services.
