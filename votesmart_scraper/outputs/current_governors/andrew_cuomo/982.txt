Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 7, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today hosted the third New York State Wine, Beer, Spirits and Cider Summit in Albany, where farm-based beverage manufacturers, industry leaders and agricultural producers met with educators and State officials to explore new industry opportunities and grow New York's thriving beverage industry. As a result of these conversations, the Governor announced a number of state actions, including investments and initiatives totaling more than $16 million, to support the industry's continued growth.
"Our investments in the farm-based beverage industry have created a synergy of economic momentum for wineries, cideries, breweries and distilleries. That momentum is fueling opportunity for small businesses across the state, and we are going to keep it coming well into the future," Governor Cuomo said. "By cutting more red tape and encouraging creative investments, we are cementing New York's role as a leader in the craft beverage industry. This summit is a testament to the progress we've made, and I look forward to seeing our State's beverage producers continue to excel in the years ahead."
