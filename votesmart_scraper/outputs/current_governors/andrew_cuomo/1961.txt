Location: Albany, NY

"It is with heavy hearts that we remember the tragic bombing and aftermath in Boston one year ago that claimed four lives and injured hundreds more. The people of Boston showed true patriotism on that Patriot's Day when thousands of first responders and citizens rushed to help the wounded and repair the damage. New York stands with our neighbors in Boston, and we continue to keep the families of the victims in our thoughts and prayers. Boston reminds us that with resilience and unity, we can overcome anything, and today we remember there is no evil that can triumph in a community that is Boston Strong."
