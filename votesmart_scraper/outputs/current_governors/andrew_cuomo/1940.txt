Statement From Governor Cuomo on Crude Oil Train Derailment in Lynchburg, Virginia
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 30, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"Earlier today, I wrote a letter to President Obama urging the federal government take immediate steps to bring much needed and overdue safety regulation to the crude oil transportation system. Just hours later, news comes of yet another serious oil train derailment, this time in Lynchburg, Virginia. Our thoughts and prayers are with any possible victims of this accident.

"This is the latest in a series of accidents involving trains transporting crude oil, a startling pattern that underscores the need for action. In addition to steps that states like New York are taking, the federal government must overhaul the safety regulations, starting with taking DOT-111 trains off the rails now. These trains travel through populated communities in Upstate New York and we cannot wait for a tragic disaster in our state to act."
