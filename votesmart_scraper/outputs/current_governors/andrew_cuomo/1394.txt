Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today highlighted the growth and success of Business Mentor NY, a program that connects businesses with skilled mentors. Announced by the Governor in his State of the State Address last year, the free program has garnered more than 750 volunteer mentors, with more than 500 successful matches already made between experienced professionals and entrepreneurs looking for assistance in navigating businesses challenges.
"This innovative new program has succeeded in creating new relationships that help entrepreneurs succeed and grow their businesses," Governor Cuomo said. "I encourage any interested mentors or new business owners to learn more about Business Mentor NY and the opportunities available to them."
Mentors and entrepreneurs connect through the Business Mentor NY website, which allows entrepreneurs to review profiles of potential mentors and communicate directly with them at no charge. Mentors and entrepreneurs can be matched regardless of geographical boundaries--for example, a business in New York City can get assistance from a professional in Western New York. The one-on-one guidance and counsel complements the state's current network of financial and technical assistance and is helping entrepreneurs increase revenue and create jobs.
President, CEO & Commissioner of Empire State Development Howard Zemsky said, "This innovative network was designed to help small businesses grow by learning from the experiences of other professionals in the same field throughout the State. The program has really taken off and the website is filled with hundreds of mentors ready to help start-ups and established small businesses take their company to the next level."
