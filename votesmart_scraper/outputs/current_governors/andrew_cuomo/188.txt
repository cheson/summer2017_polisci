Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $1 million to support two new Community Schools programs at the State University of New York's Adirondack and Onondaga Community Colleges. The Community Schools initiative aims to increase college access and support degree completion by providing comprehensive services for students. Previous Community Schools funding was awarded to Jefferson, Mohawk Valley and Rockland Community Colleges.
"These programs will invest in the future of local students and open new doors to opportunity in Central New York and the Capital Region," Governor Cuomo said. "By transforming local schools into community institutions, we can better serve the needs of our neighborhoods and help foster the next generation of New York leaders."
These new programs will launch in 2017 and will provide comprehensive wraparound services for students, including child and elder care, transportation, health care services, family and employment counseling and legal aid. Over the course of three years, each of the grant recipients will receive $500,000.
