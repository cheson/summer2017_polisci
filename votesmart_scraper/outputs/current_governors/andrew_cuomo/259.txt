Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Today, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation will seek financial compensation for damages to groundwater resources related to contamination from the Northrop Grumman State Superfund Site in Bethpage. DEC issued a Notice of Intent letter to Northrop Grumman and the U.S. Navy, naming them as "potentially responsible parties." The letter formalizes the state's plan to perform a Natural Resources Damage Assessment to quantify the damages to groundwater resources and obtain funding from these entities to support critical ecosystem restoration projects.
"Protecting the health and safety of our residents is the top priority of our administration," Governor Cuomo said. "By continuing to hold Northrop Grumman and the Navy accountable for their actions, we are ensuring that the responsible parties clean up the groundwater contamination, while securing compensation to revitalize local ecosystems on Long Island."
The state's pursuit of an NRD settlement is in addition to the ongoing site remediation being conducted by Northrop Grumman and the U.S. Navy under Consent Order with New York State. DEC is overseeing and expediting this remedial work through the State Superfund program.
Groundwater contamination, which stretches southward from the former manufacturing sites and covers over one mile, is currently treated by multiple wellhead treatment systems. Long Island is a sole source aquifer that provides drinking water to millions of people; it must be protected from contamination and managed effectively to reduce saltwater infiltration and other threats related to its unique geology.
