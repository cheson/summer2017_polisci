Governor Attends Opening Day of 2015 Syracuse Nationals Classic Car Show
Governor Announces New "I LOVE NY" State Fair License Plate to Debut at this Year's Fair, Support New York State Tourism
State Investing $50 Million to Reimagine Fairgrounds as Year-Round Destination
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that one of the nation's largest classic automobile shows, the Syracuse Nationals, has signed an agreement to remain at the New York State Fairgrounds through 2019. The Governor announced the contract extension while attending opening day of the 2015 Nationals in Syracuse, where thousands of classic cars and trucks were on display throughout the 375-acre Fairgrounds. The Governor additionally announced the debut of the "I LOVE NY" State Fair license plate, a new custom license plate available at the start of this summer's State Fair on August 27.
"I'm proud that the New York State Fairgrounds will be home to the Syracuse Nationals Car Show for another five years," Governor Cuomo said. "This agreement will keep one of upstate's biggest attractions right here in Central New York and is yet another step in raising the profile of the region's growing tourism industry."
Today's agreement and enhanced focus on the Fairgrounds complement a $50 million State investment announced by Governor Cuomo in the 2015-16 Budget to reimagine the fairgrounds as a year-round tourism destination. The investment will be aligned with Onondaga County's vision for redevelopment of the area, and will strengthen the success of the Great New York State Fair -- which last year, experienced the largest one-year increase in attendance, set two daily attendance records, and set a record for gross sales and revenues.
