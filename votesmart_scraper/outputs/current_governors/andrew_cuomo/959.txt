Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that $39.2 million in economic development funding has been approved for 34 projects that are spurring growth and opportunity across the state. The funding, approved by Empire State Development's Board of Directors, supports projects that are creating 233 new jobs and retaining 1,589 existing New York State jobs -- many of which have already been created or retained. This funding will also leverage $338.6 million in private assets and other public funding to support local businesses and projects that are building a strong foundation for future economic growth and job creation.
"With this funding, we are supporting regionally-significant initiatives and growing local economies across New York," Governor Cuomo said. "This investment is another example of our commitment to developing key industries and creating new opportunities for companies and workers to thrive in every region of this state."
