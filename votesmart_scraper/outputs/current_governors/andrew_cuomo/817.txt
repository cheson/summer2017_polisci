Governor Cuomo Announces Tougher Toll Violation Enforcement at MTA Bridges and Tunnels
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 14, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that Metropolitan Transportation Authority Bridges and Tunnels is set to strengthen toll evasion enforcement at its seven bridges and two tunnels in New York City. This plan aligns with a proposed New York State regulation to suspend the registrations of vehicles that repeatedly evade payment on toll crossings.
"New York's transportation network relies on drivers paying their fair share and those who evade tolls put an unfair burden on other law-abiding motorists," Governor Cuomo said. "This ramped up enforcement sends the message that these actions will not be tolerated and will keep those who ignore their responsibilities off our roadways."
