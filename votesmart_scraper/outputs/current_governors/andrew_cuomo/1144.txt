Governor Cuomo Announces Wage Bond Requirements For Nail Salon Owners and Availability of New Nail Specialty Trainee Registration For Workers
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 10, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that nail salon owners will be required to secure a wage bond within the next 60 days or they will face newly enacted fines and penalties, which could include the closure of their business for non-compliance. In addition, unlicensed nail salon workers will be able to register now free of charge for the nail specialty trainee program. The wage bond requirement and trainee program are two integral pieces of the comprehensive package of industry reforms recently introduced by Governor Cuomo to protect nail salon workers.
"We will not stand for the exploitation of workers in the state of New York, plain and simple," Governor Cuomo said. "This administration will not tolerate abuse in any industry -- it's simply not who New York is -- and today we are taking another step forward to protect the dignity and rights of nail salon employees across the state."
