Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, and two legislative bill sponsors, Senator William Larkin and Assemblymember Amy Paulin, today agreed to advance legislation during the next State budget to provide up to three years of additional public pension credit for an expanded pool of eligible state and local employees who served in the military. Governor Cuomo also signed legislation today to provide additional benefits to veterans throughout the State.
"Our Veterans exemplify dedication, patriotism, and sacrifice -- and we owe them a debt that can never be repaid. As we celebrate Veterans Day, we honor not only the extraordinary sacrifices they've made on our behalf, and their service here and abroad, but also the contributions they make to our communities once they return to private life," said Governor Cuomo. "New York is one community and one family. Together we hope and pray for the safe return of our military men and women serving around the world. Above all, we remember those who have paid the ultimate price to protect our freedom and security. To our Veterans and military families, on behalf of all New Yorkers, thank you."
