"I applaud the Public Employees Federation for ratifying their one-year retroactive contract agreement today following negotiations in good faith. It is a contract that importantly ensures fairness and equity for much of the state's workforce while continuing a record of fiscal discipline that taxpayers deserve.
"Members of PEF play a vital role in state government and to delivering on our commitment to performance in public service. I thank PEF leadership for working collaboratively with us and look forward to continuing that partnership into the future."
