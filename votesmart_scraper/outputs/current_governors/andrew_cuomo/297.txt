Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Shooting in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 17, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, our hearts are heavy as we struggle to cope with the horrific shootings of police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana -- a cowardly attack that resulted in three deaths. These heroes put their lives on the line every day to protect their fellow citizens and the senseless manner in which their lives were taken is appalling.
"The tragic events of the last few weeks -- from Falcon Heights to Dallas to Baton Rouge -- are deeply troubling and cannot be allowed to persist. We must not let fear and intolerance overtake our better angels. We must instead choose unity. It is in our darkest moments that we must show our greatest strength.
"Now more than ever, we must come together to find hope, achieve progress and make change for all Americans. On behalf of all New Yorkers, my thoughts and prayers are with the families and victims of this terrible tragedy."
