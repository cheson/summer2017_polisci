Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 6, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today signed landmark legislation (S.8158/A.10740) mandating that schools across the state test drinking water for lead contamination. Lead is a toxic material that is extremely harmful to young children and can result in lowered IQ, behavioral problems and brain damage. The state Department of Health also issued emergency regulations pursuant to the new legislation, requiring that school districts test their water for lead contamination by Oct. 31, 2016 and report results to parents, the state Department of Health and local government officials. These new regulations will reduce the risk for exposure to this dangerous substance and ensure all New York's students have access to clean, drinkable water.
"These rigorous new protections for New York's children include the toughest lead contamination testing standards in the nation, and provide clear guidance to schools on when and how they should test their water," Governor Cuomo said. "As children begin another school year, I'm proud to sign this legislation, which marks a major step forward in protecting the public health and ensuring the future growth and success of students across the state."
