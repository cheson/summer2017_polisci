Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today highlighted key points of the 2014-2015 New York State Budget, the fourth consecutive on-time budget that holds spending growth below two percent, in Irondequoit. The Budget provides $1.5 billion in property tax cuts to help New York's homeowners and encourage local governments to increase efficiencies, transforms schools and increases education spending by a record 5%, and lowers the corporate income tax rate to zero.
"This fourth consecutive on-time budget builds on the State's progress over the past three years and the commitment to grow the economy and create good jobs for New Yorkers and their families," Governor Cuomo said. "It maintains our fiscal discipline by holding spending growth below two percent, while also cutting up to $1.5 billion in property taxes to help homeowners and address the unsustainable proliferation of local governments. The budget also contains major investments in education that will transform our schools, including an increase in state aid by more than $90 million for schools in the Finger Lakes region and support for quality pre-k programs across the state. These investments, along with many other important provisions, are what make this budget a blueprint for success that will continue to make New York stronger, more competitive, and more affordable for all."
