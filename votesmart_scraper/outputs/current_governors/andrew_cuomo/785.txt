"Traditionally, on the first day of each year, New York's governors often chose to host an open house at the Executive Mansion. However, this January 1st also marks the anniversary of my father's passing, and my family and I wish to commemorate his loss. However we would also like to continue the open house tradition, therefore, we will move the open house to Easter Sunday. At that time family and visitors will be welcome to experience the Mansion and also participate in an Easter Egg hunt which will commence a new activity and tradition that we are excited to initiate."
