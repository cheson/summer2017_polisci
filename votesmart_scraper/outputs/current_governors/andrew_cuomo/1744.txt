Governor Cuomo shakes hands with challenger Rob Astorino before the debate
Four of the candidates for governor of New York faced off in an hour long debate Wednesday night, where they discussed a number of key issues, and the two major party candidates traded charges of lying, and even racism.
Governor Cuomo , a Democrat, Republican Rob Astorino, Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins and the Libertarian Party's Michael McDermott talked about hydro fracking, legalizing marijuana and ,being in Buffalo- the Bills football team.
But the topic that drew some of the sharpest comments was corruption -and Governor Cuomo's Moreland Act Commission. The panel had begun investigating the legislature, but Cuomo disbanded it as part of a budget deal. The US Attorney is investigating whether Cuomo's staff interfered with any of the probes.
The governor saying he was glad to clear up "a lot of misinformation", says the Syracuse area DA that co chaired the panel, William Fitzpatrick made all the decisions on probes independently, and Cuomo denied he ended the panel early.
"There was no abrupt stopping," said Cuomo, who said the purpose of the commission was to get a law passed curbing corruption. " I said to the legislature when you pass the law, the commission will go way. They passed the law."
Astorino, who has criticized Cuomo over the handling of the commission, jumped right in, saying the Democrat is "swimming in a cesspool of corruption" .
