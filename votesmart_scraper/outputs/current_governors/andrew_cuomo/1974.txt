Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today highlighted key points of the 2014-2015 New York State Budget, the fourth consecutive on-time budget that holds spending growth below two percent, in Erie County. The Budget provides $1.5 billion in property tax cuts to help New York's homeowners and encourage local governments to increase efficiencies, transforming schools and making a record 5% increase in education, lowers the corporate income tax rate to zero and continuing to fulfill the $1 billion commitment to Buffalo.
"Over the past several years we've seen the energy start to turn around and people and businesses are starting to believe once again in Western New York," Governor Cuomo said. "This fourth consecutive on-time budget continues that momentum by fulfilling the Buffalo Billion promise, making historic investments in our schools, and delivering real property tax relief to hardworking homeowners across the region."
