Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 1, 2016
Location: Rensselaer County, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the issuing of Executive Order No. 147.4. The conforming order amends Executive Order No. 147, signed by the Governor last year, to include the investigation, and if warranted, prosecution by the New York State Attorney General of any alleged unlawful acts or omissions by any law enforcement officer relating to the death of Edson Thevenin on April 17, 2016 in Rensselaer County.
The Governor signed Executive Order No. 147 on July 8, 2015, which appointed the New York State Attorney General as special prosecutor in matters relating to the deaths of unarmed civilians in deadly encounters with law enforcement. The order allows the special prosecutor to review cases where there is a question whether the civilian was armed and dangerous at the time of his or her death.
The full text of the conforming order can be found below:
