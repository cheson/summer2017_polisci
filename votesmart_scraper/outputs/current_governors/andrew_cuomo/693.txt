Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a major expansion of Athenex that will create 1,400 jobs throughout Western New York. This announcement, made possible by a partnership with the SUNY Polytechnic Institute, includes a major expansion of Athenex's North American headquarters at the Conventus Building in Buffalo, as well as the creation of a state-of-the-art, 300,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Dunkirk. The combined projects are expected to yield a $1.62 billion investment over ten years from Athenex, along with $225 million from New York State.
"Western New York's economic transformation has captured the attention of companies and investors around the globe," said Governor Cuomo. "The business development environment in and around Buffalo has made it clear to cutting-edge companies that this is the right place to put down roots and thrive. Whether it's pharma-based development, medical research, clean technology or advanced manufacturing, this region is defined by incredible opportunities and potential for growth. I am proud to congratulate Athenex -- which could have gone anywhere -- on beginning this exciting new chapter, creating good-paying jobs and further strengthening the region's and state's economy."
The partnership with New York State secures the Athenex's presence and growth in the state and provides for significant high paying new jobs in multiple locations in Western New York. This partnership also accelerates the goal of converting investments made in medical research into long term sustainable manufacturing jobs in high tech pharmaceutical products.
