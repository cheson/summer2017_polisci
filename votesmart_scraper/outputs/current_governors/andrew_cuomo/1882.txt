Location: Albany, NY

"Today, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court made a sound judgment in affirming the work of the Adirondack Park Agency on the Adirondack Club and Resort Project. This ruling confirms the Agency's approval was based on substantial evidence developed carefully and in strict accordance with mandated State statues and environmental regulations. I applaud the Agency's board and their staff for their dedication and commitment to the Adirondack Park. The Adirondack Club and Resort Project will bring significant economy activity, jobs, and new opportunities to Tupper Lake and the Adirondack Park. I applaud the Court for today's decision and I look forward to working with the community of Tupper Lake to successfully build this project."
