2nd Proposal of Governor Cuomo's 2016 Agenda: Transform and Expand Vital Infrastructure Downstate
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 5, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo unveiled the second signature proposal of his 2016 agenda: a comprehensive plan to transform and expand vital infrastructure downstate and make critical investments in the region. Most notably, the proposal includes a major expansion and improvement project for the Long Island Rail Road. The Governor outlined these initiatives at an event today in Nassau County, where he was joined by Long Island Association President Kevin Law, MTA Chairman Thomas F. Prendergast and LIRR President Patrick Nowakowski.
"Long Island's future prosperity depends on a modern transportation network that eases congestion on our roads, improves service on the LIRR, helps this region's economy and preserves the character of these great communities," said Governor Cuomo. "This is a robust and comprehensive agenda to do just that and help build a brighter tomorrow for Nassau and Suffolk residents."
