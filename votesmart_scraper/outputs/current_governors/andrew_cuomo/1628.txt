Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that winter farmers' markets in New York have again reached an all-time high, now with 120 markets located across the state.

"Buying New York products helps New York farmers, and strengthens this state's agriculture industry -- something that becomes even more important in the winter months," Governor Cuomo said. "I encourage all New Yorkers to find a winter farmers' market and plan a visit."
