Letter
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 14, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

A distracted driver is a bad driver.
Driver inattention and distraction has been the number one cause of motor vehicle crashes in New York State.
This week, Governor Cuomo signed a new law to strengthen enforcement against texting while driving.

With this law and new regulations, drivers will face a fine of up to $150 and three points on their license for using handheld electronic devices while a vehicle is in motion.
Texting while driving can cause damage, injuries, and even death -- and it's all preventable.
Now we can help put a stop to this dangerous activity and make our roads safer for all New Yorkers.
