Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the 100th Anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 25, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"On March 25, 1911, a tragic fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City killed 146 workers. From the ashes of this tragedy came some of the most sweeping changes to working conditions ever enacted by a state government. New York's actions in response to the fire changed the face of workplaces in this country for the better.
"In New York, we have historically taken on the nation's most difficult challenges first and solved them. Our state's celebrated history made New York the progressive capital of the nation. There is no better example of this than our state's response to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire.
"New York's Factory Investigation Commission, which emerged as a result of the fire, prompted our lawmakers to act on behalf of our most vulnerable workers. Laws were passed that were considered revolutionary at the time. These laws were the foundation for modern labor laws, not just in New York, but in other states and at the federal level.
"As I said in my State of the State address, we must continue to achieve the social progress that made the Empire State a leader. This commission brought forth sweeping changes in New York's factories. The country, in turn, followed our lead. As New Yorkers, we must continue to lead, continue to make progress on behalf of our most vulnerable workers, and never forget the memory of those who perished in the flames of this horrific tragedy."
