Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 13, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the approval of two North Country energy projects that will help improve the reliability of electricity transmission in the region and throughout the state.
The actions call for the replacement of an aging cable between New York and Vermont that travels under Lake Champlain, and funding to license and design the rebuild of the 85-mile Moses-Adirondack transmission lines, which are more than 70 years old.
"These projects will help create a modern, more reliable and more resilient power grid for the North Country and New York as a whole," Governor Cuomo said. "This administration has taken significant steps to rebuild this state's energy infrastructure and we remain committed to creating one of the most innovative power grids in the country."
