Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today urged New Yorkers to prepare for heavy snow and hazardous wind gusts for most of the week, especially in Western New York, Central New York, the North Country and the Southern Tier. Wind gusts, especially in the heaviest snow bands, will produce whiteout conditions at times and make driving extremely dangerous.
"Current reports show that this unseasonably mild weather is coming to an end for many parts of New York," Governor Cuomo said. "With up to three feet of snow in the forecast and winds that could make driving hazardous and knock out power, I'm asking residents to be prepared, stay informed and use extra caution when traveling."
