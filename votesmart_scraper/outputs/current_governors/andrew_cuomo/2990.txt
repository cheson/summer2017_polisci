"I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Sargent Shriver, an icon whose leadership of the Peace Corps made it a world-renowned institution of good will and American public service. His tireless dedication and decades of experience fighting poverty improved our country and ensured that countless generations will thrive and prosper. I will always honor his memory, his achievements and his dedication to his family. I had the opportunity to work with him, and I will miss him greatly."
