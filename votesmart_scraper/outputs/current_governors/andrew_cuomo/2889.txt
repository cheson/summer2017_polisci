Our state is closer than ever before to achieving marriage equality for all New Yorkers.
Today, you can help make it happen.
Last week, the state Assembly voted to pass marriage equality in New York, affirming their commitment to fairness and equal rights for same-sex couples.
Now, it is up to the state Senate to do the same.
With Albany's legislative session coming to a close this week, the time for progress is now.
Contact your state Senator today and urge them to vote yes on marriage equality.
With this historic legislation, we can ensure that same-sex couples in New York are finally given the rights and protections they deserve.
