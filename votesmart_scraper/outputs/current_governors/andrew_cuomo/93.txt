Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Senate Vote to Allow States to Withhold Funding from Planned Parenthood
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 30, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"With this repugnant vote, the Vice President and the U.S. Senate rolled back the progress we've achieved to safeguard women's health and protect the rights of all New Yorkers. By advancing this measure, Vice President Pence and Republicans in Congress turned their backs on millions of women across the country and jeopardized their freedom, health, and future. New York will not let the federal government's backward mentality stand in the way of women receiving the critical health services they are entitled to by law. New York will continue to be a champion for women and ensure that their rights are protected from ignorant and reckless decisions in Washington."
