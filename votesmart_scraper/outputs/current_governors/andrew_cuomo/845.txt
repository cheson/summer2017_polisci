Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on National Recognition For State Medicaid Director Jason Helgerson
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 3, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"When I appointed Jason Helgerson in 2011 to manage the overhaul of New York's Medicaid program, it was the largest and most expensive program in the nation, costing $53 billion and growing at a rate of 13 percent per year. We needed to reform the system and bring its costs under control -- and with Jason overseeing it, that is exactly what we did. Today, Medicaid spending per recipient has dropped to its lowest level in 13 years, even as enrollment has grown to 6.1 million people and we have improved the quality of care in communities across the state."
"Jason's hard work has made a fundamental difference in the lives of millions of New Yorkers, and I am proud to congratulate him on receiving this well-deserved honor."
