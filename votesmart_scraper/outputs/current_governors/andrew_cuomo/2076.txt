Governor Cuomo Declares Statewide State of Emergency
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 5, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today declared a state of emergency for all of New York State, effective immediately as a winter storm continues to bring heavy snow, ice, and freezing rain to communities in both the upstate and downstate regions.

"This is a significant winter storm impacting all regions of the state and we are taking all necessary steps to keep New Yorkers safe," Governor Cuomo said. "I have declared a state of emergency for all counties so that we can continue our effective and quick response in communities that have been hit the hardest. New Yorkers in affected regions should stay off the roads, check on their neighbors and loved ones, and stay inside their homes until the worst of the storm has passed."

Department of Transportation Commissioner Joan McDonald said, "Our crews have been working around the clock to clear roads and ensure the safest travel conditions possible. With that being said, commuters should not be using I-84 until further notice, as we continue to clear snow and ice from the roadway."

State Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said, "The State Police will be monitoring Interstate 84 throughout New York State to ensure that vehicles are not on the road until the ban is lifted. Drivers across the State should exercise extreme caution if travel is absolutely necessary, and only use roadways that are open."

Under a state of emergency, critical resources that are normally restricted to State use are mobilized to assist local governments and laws and regulations that would otherwise impede their rapid response are suspended
