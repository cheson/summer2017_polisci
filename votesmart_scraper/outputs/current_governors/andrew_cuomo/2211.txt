Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today signed a series of new laws designed to continue the State's support for ongoing Superstorm Sandy relief efforts.

"Nearly one year ago, Superstorm Sandy hit our state, causing damage and loss that continues to be felt by communities today," Governor Cuomo said. "Since then, we have taken many steps to rebuild not only in the short term, but also to take measures that prepare New York State for the future. From providing tax relief to homeowners and essential assistance for local governments to protecting our coastal areas, these new laws will move us forward on the path to a full recovery and ensure that we build back stronger than before. I am pleased to sign these four bills and commend the bill sponsors for their hard work."
