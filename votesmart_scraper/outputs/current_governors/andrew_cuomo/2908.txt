Letter to New Yorkers: Support Equality for All New Yorkers
Letter
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 26, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

New York has a proud, progressive history as a national leader in bringing greater equality and respect for all. From the fight for women's suffrage to the struggle for civil rights, New Yorkers have not only been on the right side of history, we have made history.
But on the issue of marriage equality, New York has fallen behind. Same-sex couples are denied rights that other New Yorkers take for granted, including over 1,000 federal and 700 state rights that are afforded to millions of others.
Marriage equality is a matter of fairness and dignity. It's hard to imagine today, but at one time it was illegal for an interracial couple to marry in this country. Now it is time to ensure that same-sex couples in New York are given the rights and protections they deserve.
When it comes to fighting for what's right, New Yorkers wrote the book. Marriage equality is the next chapter of our civil rights story.
