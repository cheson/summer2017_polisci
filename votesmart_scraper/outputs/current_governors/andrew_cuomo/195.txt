Governor Cuomo Signs Legislation Barring Telecom & Utility Companies from Charging Early Termination Fees in the Event of Death
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 27, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today signed legislation that prevents telecommunications companies and utility providers from charging a contract termination or early cancellation fee in the event of a customer's death.
"This was a heartless and inappropriate policy that is mostly borne by grieving New Yorkers grappling with the loss of a loved one," Governor Cuomo said. "Ending these fees is the right thing to do and will spare those in mourning from this annoying burden."
Many companies use early termination fees to ensure that a customer continues to use a service through the full contract period. Under this new law, (A.8630A /S.6485-A), landline, cell phone, television, internet, energy and water service providers are prohibited from charging contract termination or early cancellation fees if a customer dies before the end of an agreement. In addition, a civil penalty of up to $1,000 will be placed on providers that violate this law. This measure takes effect immediately.
