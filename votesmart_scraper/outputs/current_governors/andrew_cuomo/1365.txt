Governor Andrew M. Cuomo this morning announced that New York National Guard personnel and emergency officials from the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services are traveling to Pennsylvania to assist ongoing response efforts after the fatal Amtrak accident Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.
"New Yorkers have always come together to help others in times of crisis, and that is exactly what we are doing today," said Governor Cuomo. "Last night's Amtrak accident was a terrible tragedy, and this morning I called Governor Wolf to express my support and let him know that New York stands ready to help in any way possible. To that end, I am deploying personnel from New York State to assist with the ongoing recovery effort. My thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been injured as a result of the crash, as well as the loved ones of those who were lost."
The delegation of New York officials includes DHSES Commissioner John Melville, Office of Emergency Management Director Kevin Wisely, and from the New York National Guard, General Raymond Shields and Colonel Steve Fukino. These officials, along with the Governor's office, have been working in close coordination with the City of Philadelphia and State of Pennsylvania since the accident occurred last night.
According to recent reports, at least six people were killed and dozens injured when an Amtrak train traveling from Washington D.C. to New York City derailed in Philadelphia.
