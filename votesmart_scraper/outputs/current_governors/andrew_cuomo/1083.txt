Governor Cuomo announced that New York State has been awarded a $3.75 million grant, over five years, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to enhance the treatment and prevention of stroke. Stroke remains the fourth leading cause of death in New York, accounting for more than 6,000 deaths annually.
"Stroke continues to be a major cause of death and disability in New York, but advances in treatment have started to make an impact on survival and recovery," said Governor Andrew M. Cuomo. "This funding will continue those efforts and incorporate more life-saving preventive measures into our health care system."
The grant will allow the New York State Department of Health to expand upon its existing New York Coverdell program which was created in 2012 through another federal grant to improve in-hospital care for acute stroke. This includes growing the program's components on community education, emergency medical services, and transitions of care, as well as addressing stroke risk factors such as high blood pressure, tobacco use, high cholesterol and poor medication adherence.
Additionally, the funding will be used to help identify and address gaps in care between the transition from ambulance to hospital, and then from hospital to home. Ultimately, the goal is to find ways of reducing mortality, readmission and disabilities resulting from stroke
