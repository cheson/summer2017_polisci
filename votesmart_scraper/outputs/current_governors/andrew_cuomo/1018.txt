Governor Cuomo Signs Bill Strengthening Protections For Victims of Sexual Assault
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 22, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo signed legislation strengthening protections for victims of sexual assault. This ensures that, in cases where the defendant is convicted of sexually assaulting a family member, the order of protection for the victim extends at least through the end of the defendant's probation term.
"This measure closes a potentially dangerous loophole and will help ensure that victims receive the protections that they deserve," Governor Cuomo said. "I'm proud to sign this common-sense legislation into law and I thank its sponsors for their work on this very important issue."
