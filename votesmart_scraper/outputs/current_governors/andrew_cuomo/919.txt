Governor Cuomo Signs Legislation to Support Homeowners Impacted By Superstorm Sandy
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 29, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo signed two pieces of legislation relating to Superstorm Sandy and extreme weather. The first bill is designed to reform the insurance industry in New York State with regard to claims involving sewer issues and flooding, and the second supports New Yorkers who made repairs to their homes after Sandy.
"In the three years after Hurricane Sandy, we have continued to rebuild New York in a way that is smarter, stronger and more resilient in the face of the increasing threat of extreme weather," said Governor Cuomo. "These two bills do exactly that, by both supporting homeowners who are building back from the damage they experienced, and by making sure that insurance companies support those who are impacted. "
