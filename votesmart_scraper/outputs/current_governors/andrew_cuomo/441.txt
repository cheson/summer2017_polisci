Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 8, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Today, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced he is taking first-in-the-nation action to curb the power of independent expenditure campaigns unleashed by the 2010 Supreme Court case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. The Governor's Counsel, Alphonso David, issued an opinion to enforcement entities offering guidance on existing state law and whether coordination exists between independent expenditure campaigns and the candidates they support. The opinion clarifies permissible conduct under state law and works to preserve the integrity of the electoral process in New York.
The Governor is also advancing legislation which would limit the "quid pro quo" danger posed by colossal corporate donations and ensure that independent expenditure groups remain autonomous from the entities they support. The legislation also would strengthen disclosure requirements and mandate that groups report the identity of anyone exerting control over them, as well as any former staffers or immediate family members of a candidate. The Governor made the announcement in a speech at Fordham University School of Law.
