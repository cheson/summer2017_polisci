Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Passage of Legislation to Protect People with Special Needs and Disabilities
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 20, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"For too many years, we have heard story after story of abuse and mistreatment in facilities that are supposed to care for those with special needs and disabilities. With the legislation passed today, New York is standing up to say enough is enough. The Justice Center for the Protection of People with Special Needs will ensure that the more than one million New Yorkers with disabilities and special needs receive the proper treatment that they deserve. Protecting the civil rights of vulnerable individuals was one of my top priorities this legislative session, and with this new law, New York State has raised the bar to put in place the strongest standards and practices in the nation for protecting people with special needs. I thank the thousands of New Yorkers, including my colleagues in the Senate and Assembly, who joined in the fight to take action and bring justice to the system. Without their help, the passage of this important legislation would not have been possible."
