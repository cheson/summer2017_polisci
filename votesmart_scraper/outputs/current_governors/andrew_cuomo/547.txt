Governor Cuomo Announces Over $10 Million in Recovered Wages in First Three Months of 2016
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 6, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that over $10 million has been returned to more than 17,000 victims of wage theft during the first three months of 2016. This amount surpasses last year's first quarter total of $9 million and places the state on track to exceed the $31.5 million in stolen wages recovered in 2015 -- the highest ever. The surge in wage recoveries is a result of the Governor's efforts to root out worker exploitation across multiple industries throughout New York State.
"New York State has zero tolerance for employers who seek to cheat their employees of hard-earned wages," Governor Cuomo said. "These numbers clearly demonstrate the success of our ongoing efforts to combat worker exploitation. We will continue to aggressively crack down on unscrupulous employers and ensure a fair day's pay is paid for a fair day's work."
The following table provides a regional breakdown of the $10.2 million distributed to 17,208 victims of wage theft in the first quarter of 2016:
