Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today detailed the $1.2 billion in savings to employers that will occur as a result of the sweeping reforms to the state's Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Insurance systems that were included in the recently passed state budget.

"For too many years, businesses in New York struggled under the burdensome requirements and costs of our state's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation systems," Governor Cuomo said. "Two years ago we pledged to reopen New York's doors to business and transform our economic climate to make our state friendlier to job creators and reduce the unnecessary bureaucracy and burdens facing businesses. While there is still work to be done, the sweeping reforms to the workers' comp and unemployment insurance system included in the 2013-14 budget are a major victory for our state's businesses large and small, and will save our job creators more than one billion dollars."

The new system will achieve administrative efficiencies and provide predictability to employers.

The savings as a result of this reform to self-insured businesses, by region, are outlined below:
