"This evening at sundown, members of the Jewish community all across New York State will begin the celebration of Hanukkah.
Hanukkah celebrates the spirit of resilience and dedication of the Jewish people who faced adversity and persecution with fierce determination. As New Yorkers, we have all been confronted with adversity, challenges and destruction but the message of Hanukkah teaches us to commit to build back better and stronger.
I join with all New Yorkers in honoring the message of Hanukkah and commend the willingness of the people of our state to come together during challenging times to create a safer and stronger community for all.
Best wishes for a joyous and safe holiday."
