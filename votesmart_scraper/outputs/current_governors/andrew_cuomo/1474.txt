Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today highlighted the major investments for Upstate New York included in the 2015-16 Budget Agreement:
"With this budget, we are making the single largest investment in Upstate New York in a generation," Governor Cuomo said. "From creating jobs and strengthening our infrastructure to investing in farms, hospitals and broadband access, this budget is paving the way toward a new economic vitality in Upstate. It's all part of how we're turning around the decades of neglect that the region used to experience from Albany, and we will continue building the region back better than ever."
