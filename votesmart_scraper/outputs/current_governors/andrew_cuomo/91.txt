Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 1, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"These are extraordinary times in our state and country and we have an ambitious agenda to protect New Yorkers. We have resolved the financial issues customarily included in the state budget, but complex issues such as criminal justice reform ("Raise the Age") and affordable housing should also be enacted.
"As April 1 falls on a Saturday this year, I have told the Legislature that I will allow them a grace period to continue to work through the weekend to resolve all of these matters at one time.
"If the Legislature does not reach agreement at the conclusion of the weekend, then I will put forth emergency legislation to extend the current budget. Extending the state budget also allows us flexibility to adjust to future federal changes, which if enacted, could cost the state billions. The federal budget comes out on May 21 and we will have more information at that time."
