Governor Cuomo Announces Distribution of $30.2 Million in Upstate Destination Resort License Fees to 22 Counties
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 21, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that 22 counties and three municipalities across upstate New York are receiving $30.2 million in license fees paid by newly licensed destination resort casinos.
"This funding will help counties and local governments provide essential services to their residents as well as work to reduce their tax burden," said Governor Cuomo. "These destination resorts will help drive more tourism and economic development dollars upstate and, with these payments, local governments are already seeing the benefits of these projects."
The county payouts are one portion of the $151 million in commercial casino license fees that are being distributed across upstate using the same formula for casino gaming revenue laid out in the Upstate New York Gaming and Economic Development Act of 2013 -- 80 percent will be applied statewide for school aid/property tax relief; 10 percent will be split between host municipality and county; and 10 percent will go to counties in the regions established by the Act based on population.
New York State Association of Counties Executive Director Stephen Acquario said, "Governor Cuomo has demonstrated that smart gaming policy helps the entire state. With these funds, Governor Cuomo has fulfilled an important commitment he made with the passage of the Upstate New York Gaming and Economic Development Act. Millions of dollars in casino license fees are a much-needed benefit to upstate communities, and we are grateful for the support."
