Joined by dozens of women on the steps of New York City Hall, NARAL Pro-Choice New York announced its support for Andrew Cuomo's candidacy for Governor of the State of New York. President Kelli Conlin made it apparent that the men and women of New York have a clear choice in this race: "New York needs a leader who will represent our pro-choice values and that leader is Andrew Cuomo."
In the year 2010 we are still fighting the battle for equal rights, Cuomo said, 'We will not rest until we shatter that glass ceiling.'
'New York can and should be the national leader for gender equality and women's rights and I know that working together we can continue to ensure that those rights are protected. We cannot afford to jeopardize the enormous progress we have made.'
