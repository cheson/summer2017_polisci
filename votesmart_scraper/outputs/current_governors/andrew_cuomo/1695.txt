Governor Cuomo Encourages New Yorkers to Donate to Anti-Hunger Organizations Aiding Western New York Recovery
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 25, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today is encouraging New Yorkers interested in helping victims of the recent Western New York snow storm to give cash donations to local anti-hunger charitable organizations as the holiday season approaches. A number of charities, like the Food Bank of Western New York and Meals on Wheels for Western New York, are providing meals to the regions in Erie County affected by the major lake-effect storm, and New Yorkers wishing to make financial contributions to aid recovery efforts are suggested to do so through such organizations.
"New Yorkers have always come together in times of need, and this year is no different," Governor Cuomo said. "I saw firsthand that spirit of community in the Buffalo area as residents and neighbors helped each other dig out from last week's major snowstorm, and I encourage all New Yorkers to continue supporting them through this holiday season."
Since the storm hit, the Food Bank of Western New York and Meals on Wheels for Western New York have been targeting their efforts on disaster relief:
Food Bank of Western New York is the key source of food for most local food banks and pantries, providing donated and some purchased foods to soup kitchens and pantries throughout the region. The organization has about 320 members, including City Mission Society, St. Vincent DePaul Dining Room, and chapters of Catholic Charities and The Salvation Army, that rely on it for food to distribute to those in need.
