Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo - Assemblymember Gabryszak
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 12, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"Following the latest reports of horrific behavior in the Assembly against Assemblymember Gabryszak, I asked him to either deny the allegations or resign immediately. Today, he has given us his answer. Our representatives in elected office can and should be held to a higher standard -- especially at a time when the Legislature's ethics are being questioned and the confidence of their constituents being undermined. This kind of alleged behavior has no place in New York State government or any other office in society. My thoughts are with the alleged victims and Mr. Gabrysak's family during this difficult time."
