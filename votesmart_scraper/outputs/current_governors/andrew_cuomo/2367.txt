"Mother's Day is an opportunity to let our mothers know how special they are and how thankful we are for all that they do. My siblings and I have been blessed to have a wonderful mother who instilled in each of us the values of service and respect for others. Mothers are truly the backbone of our families and our society. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I wish every mother across our state a happy Mother's Day."
