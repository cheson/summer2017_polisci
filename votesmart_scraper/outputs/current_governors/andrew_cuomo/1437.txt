Governor Cuomo Announces More Than 115,000 Positions Available on Jobs Express Website
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 20, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that more than 115,000 available jobs, a new record high, are now listed on the Jobs Express website (www.jobs.ny.gov). The site sorts thousands of jobs by region and occupation, and also allows users to search jobs based on zip code and travel distance. There is also a one-stop-shop website that provides information and resources for Jobs Express at https://www.ny.gov/services/find-job.
"The Jobs Express website is connecting New Yorkers to real jobs, and with our economy growing, more and more businesses are seeking and hiring skilled workers," Governor Cuomo said. "I encourage anyone looking for a job to check out Jobs Express and explore a variety of employment options across New York."
The new record high in available jobs is an indicator of an improved economy, as well as an indicator of the success businesses have in using the site. In March 2015, New York State's private sector job count increased by 8,600 to 7.75 million, reaching a new all-time high.
New businesses and job listings are added to the Jobs Express site every day.
Acting Labor Commissioner Mario J. Musolino said, "The New York State Department of Labor has always taken pride in its role of connecting job seekers and businesses. Jobs Express is one way the Department continues to do that -- free of charge -- for businesses and job seekers alike. With so many open positions now posted in the database, there's no reason for job seekers not to start with the Department of Labor."
