Governor Cuomo Grants Clemency to Four Individuals and Launches Pro Bono Clemency Program
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 22, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo granted two sentence commutations and two pardons to four individuals who have demonstrated rehabilitation and made positive strides in their lives since their criminal convictions. These individuals, selected after a review of all applicants for clemency, were granted sentence commutations in the interests of justice and rehabilitation and issued pardons to address the immigration and reentry consequences of their convictions.
"Today we are taking a critical step toward a more just, more fair, and more compassionate New York," Governor Cuomo said. "With this new initiative, we are seeking to identify those deserving of a second chance and to help ensure that clemency is a more accessible and tangible reality."
