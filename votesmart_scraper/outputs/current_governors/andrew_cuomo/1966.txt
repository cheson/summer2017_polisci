"Tonight, members of Jewish communities all across New York will gather to celebrate the first night of Passover. Passover is a commemoration of the Jewish people's exodus from slavery and oppression. It is an enduring narrative of fearlessness and determination which has instilled hope and inspiration across the world to this very day. As New Yorkers join with family and loved ones to celebrate, let us redouble our efforts to continue this timely message ensuring a safe and secure society and brighter future for all. My best wishes for a happy and joyous Passover."
