Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on President Obama's Nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 16, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"President Obama has nominated a strong candidate for the Supreme Court. Now the members of the Senate must fulfill their constitutional obligation as a functional, deliberative body. We do not stand for the politics of obstruction in New York, and the U.S. Senate should not either.
"Partisan gridlock has already succeeded in immobilizing entire functions of the legislative and executive branches of the federal government -- we cannot allow it to hinder our courts as well."
