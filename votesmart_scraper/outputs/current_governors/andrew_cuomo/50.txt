Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that $4.2 million in federal funding is available to support the expansion of New York's Apprenticeship Program. This investment will increase the state's ability to establish new registered apprenticeships by working with Regional Economic Development Councils and other workforce development partners to continue fostering the skilled workforce needed to fuel business growth in emerging industries.
"These critically important apprenticeship programs are the gateway to good-paying jobs that are the bedrock of New York's middle class," Governor Cuomo said. "This funding will create 800 new registered apprenticeship positions in high-demand industries across the state, helping more hard-working New Yorkers achieve the American Dream."
This funding includes $3 million from the Middle Skills Training Fund and $1.2 million in ApprenticeshipUSA State Expansion Grant funding for registered apprenticeships in emerging industries.
The Request for Applications is designed to incentivize increased business participation with a focus on the emerging fields of advanced manufacturing, healthcare and information technology, along with other high-demand occupations. It will also help registered apprenticeship sponsors develop new programs and enroll more apprentices in current programs by providing reimbursements of up to $5,000 per apprentice for on-the-job training, related instruction, books and tools.
Registered Apprenticeship is a time honored workforce development tool and is a proven vehicle for entry to a middle-class career. This grant will be used to reach more industries and further expand New York's growing program.
