Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that insurers and HMOs offering comprehensive health insurance coverage through the New York State of Health individual marketplace are now required to allow victims of domestic violence, or spousal abandonment, to enroll in insurance plans at any time of the year. The New York State Department of Financial Services has created a new special enrollment period which will permit these individuals to enroll at any time outside of the standard November 1 through January 31 annual open enrollment period.
"Victims of domestic violence should not be forced to ensure additional hardships because they lack access to quality health coverage for themselves or their children," said Governor Andrew M. Cuomo. "This action will help break this cycle of violence and help victims gain the independence and the assistance they need."
Acting Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo said, "DFS is taking this action to ensure that domestic violence victims, as well as victims of spousal abandonment, have the opportunity year-round -- not just during the standard open enrollment period -- to sign-up for necessary health insurance."
