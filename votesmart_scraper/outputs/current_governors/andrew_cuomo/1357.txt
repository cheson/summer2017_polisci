Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Assembly Passage of Legislation to Combat Sexual Harassment and Pregnancy Discrimination
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 15, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, the Assembly passed two important pieces of legislation that strengthen New York's role as a national leader in standing up for women's equality. With the long overdue passage of bills that expand protections against both sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination, we are ensuring that equal rights are protected in New York. I was proud to introduce these two measures as part of the Women's Equality Act more than two years ago, and I look forward to signing them into law as we continue to build a more fair society."
