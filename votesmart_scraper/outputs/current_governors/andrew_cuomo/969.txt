Governor Cuomo announced the opening of a newly expanded facility for Autronic Plastics, an injection molding company in Suffolk County that will create 21 new jobs and support 106 existing jobs. Through the Governor's ReCharge NY program, the firm is receiving 436 kilowatts of low-cost electricity from the New York Power Authority in exchange for its commitment to job support and about $4 million in capital investments.
"We are committed to helping companies grow and expand on Long Island and across New York and through providing low-cost electricity, we are seeing businesses create jobs and plant deeper roots in local communities." Governor Cuomo said. "These investments have a great impact across the entire state and will help ensure that we continue to move forward."
