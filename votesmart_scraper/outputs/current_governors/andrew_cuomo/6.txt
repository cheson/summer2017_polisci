"Today Muslim New Yorkers are gathering together with friends and loved ones to mark the end of Ramadan and celebrate Eid al-Fitr. This holiday is an opportunity to reflect on the past month of fasting and practice the Muslim traditions of empathy and charity.

"In New York, we celebrate our diversity as our greatest strength, and stand together to protect free religious expression and uphold the values of unity and tolerance embodied by the Lady in our Harbor.

"To all who are celebrating, I wish them a joyous holiday."
