Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $1.8 million in economic development grants for eight upstate local governments and not-for-profit organizations. Funded through the Northern Border Regional Commission -- a regional economic development partnership between federal, state, and local government -- the grants are intended to alleviate economic distress by spurring development opportunity and strengthening local infrastructure projects. Projects are expected to leverage an additional $36 million in public and private funding.
"Key investments in communities across upstate New York are attracting businesses and new talent, and laying the foundation for continued growth," Governor Cuomo said. "These grants will build on that success by supporting critical infrastructure projects and leveraging private investment in these communities."
The Department of State's Division of Local Government Services partnered with the Northern Border Regional Commission and regional planning organizations to solicit project applications for funding. DOS received 14 applications, requesting over $3.25 million in funding for water and wastewater infrastructure, telecommunications, workforce development, health care, resource conservation and tourism projects.
Secretary of State Rossana Rosado said, "The State Department is ready to support and guide the recipients of the NBRC grant. Sustainable economic development in upstate New York must be supported by strategic investments in our towns, villages, hamlets and other critical places. This package of projects does that."
