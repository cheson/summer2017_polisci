Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the 50th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 6, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Today is a national reminder that there is more to be done to achieve equality for all. The right to vote is one of our most fundamental rights as Americans, and we cannot allow it to be compromised by institutional prejudices and false arguments. When the Voting Rights Act was signed by President Johnson in 1965, it was a monumental victory for the civil rights movement and a profound step toward a more perfect union. But today, a full generation later, that progress is being challenged, and obstacles to its future remain. Only when voting rights are protected and affirmed can we continue to move forward as one truly indivisible nation. It's time for Congress to act, and protect the voting rights of all Americans."
