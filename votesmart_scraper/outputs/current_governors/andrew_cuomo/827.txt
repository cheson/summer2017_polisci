Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Decision By Industrial Board of Appeals in Fast Food Wage Board Case
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 9, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's decision by the Industrial Board of Appeals to uphold the fast food minimum wage increase is a tremendous victory for working men and women across New York. When New York State set the fast food industry on the path to $15 earlier this year, it made a fundamental difference in the lives of more than 200,000 low-income workers and families.
"No one who works hard should ever be condemned to a life of poverty and that's why we are continuing the fight today. We will not stop until we ensure a new standard of economic justice for all workers -- and when New York acts, the rest of the nation follows."
