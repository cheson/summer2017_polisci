Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the Public Employees Federation has ratified its three-year labor agreement with the state.

"The New York State Public Employees Federation today ratified its three-year contract through 2019," Governor Cuomo said. "PEF represents more than 54,000 employees, whose contributions play a vital role in delivering service to New Yorkers and moving this state forward. This agreement will continue to protect the rights of our state's workforce while maintaining the fiscal responsibility our taxpayers deserve."
"I applaud the governor for the cooperative and fair manner in which his team approached the bargaining table," PEF President Wayne Spence said. "The dedication and professionalism of both negotiating teams and their expertise have resulted in an agreement that the PEF membership overwhelmingly ratified. I, along with PEF's elected leaders, appreciate the governor's recognition of his valuable workforce and how each union member contributes to making New York the greatest state in our nation."
