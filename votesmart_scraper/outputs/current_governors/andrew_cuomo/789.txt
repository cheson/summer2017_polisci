Governor Andrew M. Cuomo has directed that flags on state government buildings be flown at half-staff on December 24, 2015 in honor of a New York Air National Guard member who died in Afghanistan on Monday, Dec. 21.

Both were members of the 105th Base Defense Squadron, which is an element of the 105th Airlift Wing at Stewart Air National Guard Base at Newburgh, N.Y.
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest sympathies to the family, friends and fellow servicemen of Staff Sgt. Bonacasa," Governor Cuomo said. "We will join his loved ones in honoring his valor, leadership and service to this great nation. His sacrifice will be remembered with gratitude."
