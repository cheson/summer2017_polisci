Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced record-breaking growth and traffic achievements in digital service, one year after the launch of the official New York State website. Comparatively, users doubled, mobile traffic tripled, pageviews quadrupled, and the rate at which visitors leave the website is down by over 20 percent.
"When we redesigned NY.Gov, we put New Yorkers at the center and made it easier than ever to utilize and learn more about government services," said Governor Cuomo. "The figures over the last year prove that when we use technology to transform how government communicates, it can have a positive impact on people's lives. Our strategy is working, and we will continue to use technology to engage New Yorkers and move our state forward in the days ahead."
