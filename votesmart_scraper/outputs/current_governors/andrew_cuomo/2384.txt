Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 30, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"This administration is fully committed to protecting ratepayers, especially after the utilities' lackluster performance before, during, and after Superstorm Sandy. No ratepayer should pay a single penny for bonuses given to senior utility executives, especially for bonuses awarded for their performance during Sandy. I anticipate Con Ed will fully cooperate with the PSC review. "
