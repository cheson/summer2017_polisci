Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a grant to provide occupational training to unemployed individuals and assist them in obtaining employment in Jefferson and Lewis counties. The grant, funded through the United States Department of Labor, will award up to $1.3 million to eligible private sector for-profit businesses, private not-for-profit businesses, training providers and the local workforce investment board.
"One of my administration's top priorities is to help out-of-work New Yorkers find employment, and today we're taking another step forward for jobseekers in Jefferson and Lewis Counties," Governor Cuomo said. "This additional funding will provide unemployed New Yorkers with the resources they need to secure a job, while also helping local businesses expand their workforce. I encourage all interested businesses to apply for this funding today."
The program will train dislocated workers, with priority given to those who have been unemployed long-term. A dislocated worker is an individual who has been or will be terminated or laid off and is unlikely to return to their previous industry or occupation. A long-term unemployed dislocated worker has been unemployed for at least 27 weeks.
The funding will support two types of occupational training:
-Work-Based Learning, including: On-the-Job Training (OJT), Customized Training, and Registered Apprenticeships; and
-Classroom-Based Learning that leads to industry-recognized credentials in high-demand occupations, such as Class-sized Training (through contracts with institutions of higher education or other eligible training providers) and Remedial Training.
