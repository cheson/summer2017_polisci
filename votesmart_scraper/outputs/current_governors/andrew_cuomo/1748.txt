Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Settlement Regarding Indigent Legal Services
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 21, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's agreement is a positive step for New York's judicial system that addresses longstanding inequities and ensures fulfillment of the constitutional promise of criminal defense counsel for those who cannot afford it. This was a problem that our administration inherited from years past, and I am proud that we have been able to reach a resolution that results in a fairer, more humane justice system."
