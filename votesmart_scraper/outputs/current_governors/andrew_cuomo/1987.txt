"The shooting at Fort Hood has left New York saddened and shocked at the senseless violence that claimed the lives of dedicated soldiers and injured 16 others. I join the nation in mourning the loss of those Americans who demonstrated great patriotism in serving their country. Among those injured is Major Patrick Miller, from Allegany, NY, who joined the U.S. Army after graduating from St. Bonaventure in 2003. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I send my thoughts and prayers for a speedy recovery to the injured victims and their families. "
