Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that eight dams across New York State will receive $905,000 in funding under the NY Works initiative for improvement projects to address flooding concerns. Funding will cover design work for seven dams, and one project was awarded a contract to begin construction this fall.
"In the last few years, regions across the state experienced terrible storms and flooding, which made it clear that we need to update and improve our infrastructure," Governor Cuomo said. "Under our NY Works program, this round of funding will support critical dam improvement projects while creating jobs and generating economic activity. Most of all, these investments will strengthen our ability to control and prevent flooding and better protect our communities for years to come."
The projects include two work orders awarded by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and the State Office of General Services (OGS), and six work orders awarded by DEC and the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY).
Specific work to be performed includes: raising the height of some dams to increase stormwater storage capacity; reinforcing and regrading embankments; installing rip rap to control erosion; expanding piping and adding outlet valves; and installing new culverts.
DEC Commissioner Joe Martens said, "The New York Works program has provided funding for critical projects to upgrade New York's flood control infrastructure and protect communities across the state. The Governor created New York Works to address local needs expeditiously and as these projects demonstrate, vital work is being done to improve the integrity of dams and enhance flood control."
Work orders are being awarded to the following projects:
