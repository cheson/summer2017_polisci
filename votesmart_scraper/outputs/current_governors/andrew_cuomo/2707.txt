Statement from Governor Cuomo on Department of Defense Announcement Regarding Deductions at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 6, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"The plan announced today by the Department of Defense regarding reductions at the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station is a blow to the Niagara Falls community and hundreds of New Yorkers who are employed at the base. Since WWII, the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station has served our nation, and the men and women stationed here have risked their lives in combat zones across the world. I have asked the Secretary of Defense to take into account the economic impact any planned reductions would have on Western New York. At my request, Lieutenant Governor Duffy is in Washington, D.C., today and tomorrow to meet with top officials at the White House and the Department of Defense to brief them on the importance of the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station to the community and the state. We will continue to make the case to protect Niagara and all of our bases."
