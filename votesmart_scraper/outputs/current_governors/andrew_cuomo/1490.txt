Businesses Across Upstate New York State Support Governor Cuomo's #Broadband4All Campaign
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 24, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that 95 businesses from across Upstate New York are supporting the #Broadband4All campaign, which is backing the Governor's proposal to dramatically expand the state's broadband infrastructure. Broadband plays a crucial role in supporting economic activity in both rural and urban communities, and New York's competitiveness and overall business climate would be dramatically improved by the implementation of the Governor's New NY Broadband Program.
"Access to broadband is critical for businesses to compete and succeed in the global marketplace," Governor Cuomo said. "That's why we need to make a bold investment to strengthen New York's tech infrastructure. Our proposal will transform the landscape of broadband access for all New Yorkers, and I urge the legislature to join us in making it a reality this year."
Broadband is an essential component for creating and sustaining economic opportunity throughout the state, regardless of geography, by connecting businesses with consumers and markets around the globe. Nationwide, the amount of annual e-commerce sales from web-only merchants grew from approximately $9.72 billion in 2003 to nearly $106 billion in 2013. It is also closely linked to job creation -- regardless of industry, broadband is considered responsible for 43 percent of all new jobs created by businesses across the country since 2013.
