Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Regarding State Supreme Court Ruling Upholding the Governor's Tenant Protection Unit and Rent Law Reforms
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 13, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"We created the Tenant Protection Unit to give renters a voice and to crack down on those who seek to harass and intimidate them out of their homes. This ruling upholds the creation of the TPU and additional renter protections advanced by this administration, which is a victory for the more than 2 million rent-regulated tenants across New York. Make no mistake: We will continue to protect tenants and move aggressively against unscrupulous landlords who seek to violate their rights and the law."

To date, the Tenant Protection Unit has successfully returned close to 60,000 improperly deregulated apartments and recovered over $3.8 million in overcharged rent for unsuspecting tenants through settlement agreements and administrative proceedings.
