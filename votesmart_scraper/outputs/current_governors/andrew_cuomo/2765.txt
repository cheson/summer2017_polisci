Restoring Fairness to Our Economy
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 7, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

Like every state in the country, New York is being hurt by the national economic slowdown and by the political dysfunction in Washington that has prevented the solutions we need.
But in New York, we are not waiting for Washington to act. We are taking action now.
Governor Cuomo is proposing a bold and innovative plan to stimulate our economy, create jobs, and restore fundamental fairness to our economic system.
Click here to view a video message from the Governor about this new plan, which includes incentivizing private sector job growth, continuing to link government spending to performance, and establishing a new Fair Tax Plan to make our tax code more equitable.
The state's current tax code places an undue burden on our middle class. With the Governor's reforms, 4.4 million New Yorkers would receive a tax cut, including a reduction of hundreds of millions of dollars for middle class taxpayers.
With Governor Cuomo's comprehensive and balanced approach, we can rebuild our economy, embrace fundamental fairness over political ideology, and once again show that New York will rise above partisan gridlock to deliver results for the people.
