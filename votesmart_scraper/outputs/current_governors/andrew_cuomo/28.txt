Governor Announces Formation of U.S. Climate Alliance with California and Washington to Uphold Paris Climate Agreement and Take Aggressive Action on Climate Change
"The White House's reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord has devastating repercussions not only for the United States, but for our planet. This administration is abdicating its leadership and taking a backseat to other countries in the global fight against climate change. New York State is committed to meeting the standards set forth in the Paris Accord regardless of Washington's irresponsible actions. We will not ignore the science and reality of climate change, which is why I am also signing an Executive Order confirming New York's leadership role in protecting our citizens, our environment, and our planet."
Governor Cuomo, along with California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., and Washington State Governor Jay R. Inslee, also announced the formation of the United States Climate Alliance, a coalition that will convene U.S. states committed to upholding the Paris Climate Agreement and taking aggressive action on climate change.
