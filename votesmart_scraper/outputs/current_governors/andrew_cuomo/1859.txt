Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Possible LIRR Strike
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 17, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"The possible LIRR strike would be highly disruptive to the people and economy of Long Island. The parties returned to the negotiating table yesterday morning at my request. Late yesterday, when the conversations had not been fruitful, I began participating in them directly. Those conversations proceeded until late into the night.

"Time is very short. We are less than 48 hours from the point at which the railroad would commence closing procedures. I want to make sure I have done everything I can possibly do to avert a strike, so I will now convene a meeting at 10AM at my Manhattan office to continue discussions."
