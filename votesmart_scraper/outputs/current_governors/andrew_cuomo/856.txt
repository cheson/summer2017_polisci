Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that his Administration is proposing a new anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering regulation that includes -- among other important provisions -- a requirement modeled on Sarbanes-Oxley that senior financial executive certify that their institutions has sufficient systems in place to detect, weed out, and prevent illicit transactions.
"Money is the fuel that feeds the fire of international terrorism," said Governor Cuomo. "Global terrorist networks simply cannot thrive without moving significant amounts of money throughout the world. At a time of heightened global security concerns, it is especially vital that banks and regulators do everything they can to stop that flow of illicit funds."
