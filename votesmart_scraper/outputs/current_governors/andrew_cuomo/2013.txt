Joint Statement From Governor Cuomo and Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente in Response to Vote to Dissolve Village of Bridgewater Into Town of Bridgewater
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 19, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"Turning around New York's reputation for sky-high property taxes requires addressing the long-term driver of the problem -- the proliferation of local governments. Last night's vote by the residents of Bridgewater to dissolve the municipality and join the local township is a sign of progress in our efforts to free homeowners from the weight of costly and repetitive bureaucracies. We commend this bold action to lower the cost of local governments, and the voters who made this smart decision to make government more efficient and move their community forward."
