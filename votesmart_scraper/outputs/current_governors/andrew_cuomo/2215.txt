Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that dozens of New York State chefs and restaurants have taken the Pride of New York Pledge to support New York State's excellent wines, beers, spirits, agricultural products and local foods. Together with the New York State Restaurant Association, the Governor reached out to restaurants, restaurant groups and chefs throughout the state to support the Pride of New York Pledge and increase their use of New York State products by 10 percent or more. The Pride of New York Pledge is an important new component of the Governor's Taste NY program and is designed to encourage the state's culinary industry to take advantage of the abundant food and beverage products the state has to offer.

"Many chefs and restaurants have already discovered that New York State offers some of the best locally produced foods, agricultural and dairy products, beers, wines and spirits in the entire country," Governor Cuomo said. "Taste NY is not just about promoting the outstanding food and beverages made in New York, it's about opening up critical markets for agricultural producers all across our great state. We are very proud that dozens of New York's top restaurateurs have pledged to increase their use of these products to help generate greater awareness of our local foods and beverages and in turn, help local New York businesses succeed."
