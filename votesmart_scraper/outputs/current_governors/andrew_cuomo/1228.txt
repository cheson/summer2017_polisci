Governor Cuomo today announced that the lights on One World Trade Center's 408-foot spire will light up red, white and blue on Friday night, July 10, to honor the U.S. Women's national soccer team on its historic world cup victory. After their 5-2 win against Japan on Sunday in Vancouver, the team will be in Lower Manhattan for a ticker-tape parade at 11 a.m. today.
"The teamwork and dedication that led to the Women's National soccer team's resounding World Cup victory is an inspiration to all of us," Governor Cuomo said. "On behalf of all New Yorkers I am proud to honor these exemplary athletes and show our appreciation to their accomplishments on the international stage."
The United States is the only country to win three women's World Cups and scored the most goals of any country in a women's World Cup final. Historically, the ticker-tape celebration has been one of great prestige and stature, and the U.S. women's national team will be the first all-women team to receive such an honor.
