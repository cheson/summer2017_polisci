Statement from Governor Andrew M.Cuomo on Minimum Wage Increase Officially in Effect
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 1, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"No one who works full-time should be condemned to a life of poverty. In New York, we believe in a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, and that's why we started the Mario Cuomo Campaign for Economic Justice to pass the country's first $15 minimum wage law earlier this year.
"As 2017 begins, the first minimum wage increase has officially gone into effect, providing the opportunity of a decent life to more than 2 million hard-working New Yorkers who will now see an increase in their wages. I encourage any worker who does not receive a raise to call the Department of Labor Hotline (1-888-4-NYSDOL) to ensure that they are paid the wages they are due.
"New York's minimum wage law is showing the way forward on economic justice, and setting an example for the rest of the nation to follow."
$15 Minimum Wage Phase-in
The $15 minimum wage legislation was passed as part of the 2016-17 state budget, and marks a major accomplishment in the Governor's efforts to restore economic justice and fairness to working families in New York State. The phase-in schedule on a regional basis is as follows:
For workers in New York City employed by large businesses (those with at least 11 employees), the minimum wage will rise to $11 at the end of 2016, then another $2 each year after, reaching $15 on 12/31/2018.
For workers in New York City employed by small businesses (those with 10 employees or fewer), the minimum wage will rise to $10.50 by the end of 2016, then another $1.50 each year after, reaching $15 on 12/31/2019.
