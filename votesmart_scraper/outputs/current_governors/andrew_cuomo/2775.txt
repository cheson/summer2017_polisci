Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

"Today we honor the sacrifice and service of our nation's veterans who have defended our country and fought for the values and freedom we enjoy today. Over the last ten years since the September 11th attacks devastated our state and nation, a new generation of Americans has answered the call of duty, and on this Veterans Day we reaffirm our commitment to give our veterans and their families the support they need as soldiers return from the battlefield. New York State is home to more than 900,000 veterans and on behalf of all New Yorkers, I thank each of them for their courage and sacrifice. As we gather this Veterans Day weekend, let us continue to keep our service members, their families, and those who have lost loved ones in our thoughts and prayers, and remember the extraordinary service they have given to New York and America."
