Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 1, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Today we celebrate Labor Day, a time to appreciate the efforts of all the men and women who contribute daily to making this State and nation one of the most productive and enviable places in the world.

In New York, we take particular pride in Labor Day. It was here in the nineteenth century that the country first celebrated this holiday, and New York has continued to lead the fight for workers' rights and support the efforts of organized labor.

My best wishes to you and your family for a happy and safe Labor Day.
