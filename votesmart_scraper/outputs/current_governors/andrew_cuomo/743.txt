Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo as Women's Equality Law Takes Effect
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 19, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"New York continues to lead the nation in promoting fairness, equality and justice for all. More than a century ago, our state was the birthplace of the national women's rights movement, and now we are building on that legacy with the enactment of the women's equality agenda. From helping to ensure equal pay for equal work, to strengthening protections for victims of domestic violence and banning discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace, these laws are improving the lives of millions of women across the state. I am proud to see these laws take effect today, and will continue to fight to ensure New York remains a beacon for social justice, fairness and opportunity for all."
