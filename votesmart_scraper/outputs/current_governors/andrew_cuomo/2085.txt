Governor Andrew M. Cuomo tonight announced that the State will close Interstate 84 to tandem trailers trucks beginning at midnight tonight in advance of a major winter storm expected to hit New York on Wednesday.

"In anticipation of heavy snow, ice and freezing conditions, the State is closing I-84 to tandem trailer trucks, directing state agencies to take preventive measures and continuing to mobilize necessary resources for local communities," Governor Cuomo said. "We are taking every precaution needed to keep New Yorkers safe and ensure the State is in a position to respond as quickly and effectively to the snow and any emergency situations. I urge New Yorkers to put safety as their first priority, only travel when absolutely necessary, and keep an eye out for their neighbors."
