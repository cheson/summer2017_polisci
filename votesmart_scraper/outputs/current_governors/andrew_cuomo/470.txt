Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that full pilot programs for two new MTA technologies aimed at improving customer and passenger safety -- a pedestrian turn warning system and a collision avoidance system -- will launch later this year. Based on the successful completion of the pilot programs, the technologies will roll out on a city-wide basis in the fourth quarter of 2016, and be installed on up to 1,600 buses beginning in mid-2018.
The launch of the pilot programs follows the completion of field tests for the new safety systems, during which the MTA identified key enhancements. The Authority is currently working with manufacturers to implement those enhancements in time for the full launch of the pilot program.
"Increasing safety is a critically important part of our drive to enhance, renew and improve the MTA," Governor Cuomo said. "These upgrades will leverage new technology to make our streets safer, protect pedestrians and motorists, and build a stronger mass transit system."
"The MTA is working constantly and breaking new ground to make our bus operations as safe as possible for riders, pedestrians and the rest of the community. Just this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, New York State, city and federal transit officials, transport labor leaders and representatives from North America's major public bus systems, all gathered at an MTA-organized Bus Safety Symposium to develop best practices for operating buses safely in our ever more congested environment," MTA Chairman and CEO Thomas Prendergast said. "It's the latest step in our consistent effort to develop the technological advancements or regulatory reforms to maximize bus/pedestrian safety through expert collaboration and professional input."
