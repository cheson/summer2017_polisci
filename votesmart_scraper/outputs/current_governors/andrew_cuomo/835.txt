Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 8, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"The decision by the New York State Supreme Court dismissing attempts to block the wage bond that we fought for earlier this year is a victory for some of the most vulnerable New Yorkers.
"This administration believes in the promise of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work and this requirement will ensure that nail salon workers are paid what they are legally owed.
"We have come a long way in improving the lives of nail salon workers statewide -- and we will continue that progress to ensure dignity and economic justice for all New Yorkers."
