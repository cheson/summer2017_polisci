Letter to New Yorkers: A Six Month Progress Report
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 1, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

At the beginning of Albany's legislative session in January, Governor Cuomo promised New Yorkers that he would bring transformative change to our state by energizing our economy, reforming our government, and delivering real results.
Over the last six months, that is exactly what he has done.
Governor Cuomo's first legislative session came to a close last week, and with it brought a host of accomplishments that can make New Yorkers take pride in their government once again.
New Yorkers can now look at Albany and see progress on major initiatives, action on issues that have been left unresolved for decades, and a government that works for the people. We must now seize this momentum and press forward as we continue to build a new New York.
