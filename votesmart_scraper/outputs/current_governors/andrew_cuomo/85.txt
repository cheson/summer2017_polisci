This is a pivotal time in our nation's history. Ultraconservatives in Washington are challenging our values, ignoring the middle class and trying to tip the balance in favor of the wealthy. In recent weeks, the federal government has tried and failed to devastate our health care system and tried and failed to create a religious test for immigration. Now Congress is moving to cut taxes for the few at the expense of everyone else.
That's not what New York is about. We believe that government can and should be at the service of the people, and we are forging our own path. With our agreement on a $153 billion budget for 2017, New York State has issued a bold and forward-looking statement of our values.
This budget invests in our middle class, cuts taxes for working families, strengthens our economy and expands opportunity for all. And it does so while keeping spending growth to 2 percent for the seventh consecutive year. With this responsible and balanced budget, we are saying without equivocation: New York is moving ahead.

Nowhere is that more true than in Buffalo. Six years ago, we made a commitment to breathe new life into the city and restore its legacy of innovation and growth. With the support of the Buffalo Billion, the city has exceeded all expectations. Today, jobs are up, wages are rising and new industries and new families are putting down roots in the city.
