Statement from Governor Cuomo on Proposal by Onondaga County Executive Mahoney to Transform New York State Fairgrounds
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 3, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"The proposal for the State Fair laid out this evening by Onondaga County Executive Joanie Mahoney is an impressive plan that will help transform the fairgrounds into a more complete year-round facility and restore parts of the facility in need of repair. The plan recognizes the potential economic development benefits of this investment, and contains a long term vision for the region, including measures to revitalize land adjacent to the grounds and importantly, connect the fair grounds to the community and further revitalize the lakefront. Recognizing the significance of the State Fair, both to Central New York and our entire state, I proposed $50 million in this year's budget to make the fairgrounds a more enjoyable experience and an even bigger draw for visitors, in addition to helping attract tourist activity and events in all four seasons. I thank County Executive Mahoney and State Fair officials for their hard work on this proposal, and I look forward to working together with them and the Legislature to ensure this plan is funded in this year's state budget."
