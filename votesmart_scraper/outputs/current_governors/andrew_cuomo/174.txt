Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the New York State Department of Labor recovered nearly $3.45 million in fraudulently obtained Unemployment Insurance benefits during the first 10 months of 2016. The amount of restitution recovered so far this year puts New York State on track to exceed last year's record total.
"Unemployment benefits are intended for New Yorkers in need, and this administration has zero tolerance for those who seek to exploit the system for personal gain," Governor Cuomo said. "Our aggressive efforts to crack down on fraud are recovering millions to ensure that these benefits go to those who are entitled to them."
Cases of suspected Unemployment Insurance fraud are identified and investigated by the Department of Labor's Office of Special Investigations and prosecuted by local District Attorney's offices. Successful prosecutions result in restitution to the Trust Fund. In 2015, the office set a record, collecting over $3.7 million in restitution from 568 cases statewide.
The amount collected to date in 2016, $3.447 million, is 93 percent of the total amount collected in 2015 and an 8 percent increase over the same period in 2015, putting the state on track to set a new annual record this year.
