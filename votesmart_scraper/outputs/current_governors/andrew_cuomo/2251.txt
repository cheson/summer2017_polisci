Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today paused to remember the sacrifices and service of members of the U.S. armed forces who were once prisoners of war (POW), as well as those who are missing in action (MIA) and their families on POW/MIA Recognition Day. Today is a day to take time and remember the brave Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines who have been held captive or never returned home from war.
"Today we honor and remember the brave servicemembers who have been held captive or never returned home from war," Governor Cuomo said. "Since World War I, more than 142,000 Americans have been captured and interned as POWs. These men and women demonstrated valor that words cannot adequately describe. We must never forget the sacrifices made for our country by the courageous servicemembers who are unaccounted for, including 105 servicemembers and 1 civilian from New York still unaccounted from the Vietnam War. My heart goes out to all of the families still in search of answers, and I am grateful for all heroic men and women of our Armed Forces."
All Americans have a duty to remember and recognize with honor those outstanding patriots who went to war and never returned home, and to reflect upon the pain and anguish that lingers with their families and friends. New York joins in this annual tribute to honor all Americans who remain missing and unaccounted for as a result of their service in the Armed Forces of the United Stat
