Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 6, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced New York will participate in the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Ready Vets training program, which will provide military personnel stationed at Fort Drum, NY with technical skills to obtain jobs in the growing solar industry after they transition from active service. This is the first Solar Ready Vets training cohort in New York, and just the eighth offered at military installations in the U.S. The inaugural New York-based class under the program will begin on January 11.
"Soldiers and veterans have the experience and know-how to get the job done," Governor Cuomo said. "The dramatic growth of solar in New York is creating a demand for highly skilled workers. Offering these heroes valuable training and the technical skills needed to work in this rapidly growing industry, not only helps veterans succeed post service, but helps all of us create a more sustainable future."
