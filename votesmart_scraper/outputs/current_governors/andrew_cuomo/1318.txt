Letter to Joan McDonald, Commissioner of the New York Department of Transportation - Lowering Speed Limit on Part of the Scajaquada Expressway
Letter
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 31, 2015
Location: Unknown

Dear Commissioner McDonald:
I am deeply saddened to learn of the tragic car crash in Buffalo on Saturday that claimed the life of a young child and severely injured another.
While law enforcement agencies are still investigating the circumstances surrounding this terrible crash, it is clear that immediate action needs to be taken to improve safety for motorists and pedestrians on the portion of the Scajaquada Expressway that passes through Delaware Park.
For this reason, I direct you to immediately lower the speed limit on this section of the roadway to 30 mph, install speed messaging boards, and construct park-appropriate guard rails to protect pedestrians.
These actions are to be taken as Ã½the Department of Transportation continues to investigate long-term solutions to prevent further tragedies on this part of the Expressway.
This administration will continue to take every available action we can through engineering, education and enforcement to avoid crashes like this in the future.
Sincerely,
Andrew M. Cuomo
