Public Statements
An Update on Indian Point
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 22, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today announced important developments regarding safety issues at the Indian Point nuclear facility.
In light of the recent crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan, earlier today the Governor sent top members of his administration -- including Lieutenant Governor Duffy -- to meet with senior staff at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) about Indian Point.
Indian Point is located in Westchester County, within fifty miles of where more than 20 million people live and work. Among its other structural and safety flaws, the facility is situated near a fault line and concerns have been raised about whether it was designed to withstand the seismic activity that could result from an earthquake.
After their meeting, the NRC pledged to make Indian Point its first and top priority in its review of seismic risk at 27 nuclear plants throughout the country. At the request of the Cuomo Administration, the NRC has also agreed to a cooperative review of Indian Point as a joint effort between the NRC and New York State. In addition, NRC Chair Greg Jaczko has agreed to conduct a personal site inspection of Indian Point with New York officials.
Governor Cuomo has long been an opponent of Indian Point and has worked to prevent the federal relicensing of the facility. The Governor and senior officials will continue to work with the NRC to monitor the status at Indian Point and protect the health and safety of New Yorkers.
