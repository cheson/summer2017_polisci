Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today honored Ross Huffer and Andre Maurice - two Emergency Medical Services providers who died in the line of duty. Their names were added to the "Tree of Life' Memorial, which recognizes EMS providers who lost their lives in the service of others, during a ceremony earlier today that was attended by Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul and EMS professionals and volunteers from across the state. Huffer and Maurice join 58 other EMS professionals represented on the memorial.
"EMS workers deserve our gratitude each and every day for putting their lives on the line to protect the health and safety of our communities," Governor Cuomo said. "As we add the names of Ross Huffer and Andre Maurice to the Tree of Life, we remember their courage and commitment to protecting the lives of New Yorkers and pay tribute to their hard work and sacrifice."
Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul said, "The brave men and women of our EMS community, along with their families, are in our thoughts and prayers Ã½as we honor their courageous actions. Ross Huffer and Andre Maurice were more than just heroes - they were devoted members and beloved by their communities. We commend their admirable service and New Yorkers are humbled to call them one of our own on this day."
