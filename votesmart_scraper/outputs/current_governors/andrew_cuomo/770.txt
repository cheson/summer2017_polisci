3rd Proposal of Governor Cuomo's 2016 Agenda: Bolster New York's Legacy of Environmental Protection
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 5, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo unveiled the third signature proposal of his 2016 agenda -- a number of initiatives to bolster New York's legacy of environmental protection. The Governor announced that New York State will allocate $300 million for the State's Environmental Protection Fund -- the highest amount ever for the fund and more than double the fund's level when the Governor first took office. The Governor also announced two major investments in water infrastructure in Suffolk and Nassau Counties. These announcements were detailed earlier today at an event on Long Island.
This increase will provide record funding for urgent environmental investments, adding resources for land acquisition, farmland protection, invasive species prevention and eradication, waterfront revitalization, and an aggressive environmental justice agenda. The Governor made this announcement at an event today in Nassau County.
"New York's natural environment is one of our greatest assets -- so we are stepping up to protect it like never before," said Governor Cuomo. "This year we are going to make big investments that will protect the environment and make our communities cleaner, greener and more resilient for generations to come."
