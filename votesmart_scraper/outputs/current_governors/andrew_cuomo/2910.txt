Location: Albany, NY

"Last month, employers in New York state created more than 43,800 private sector jobs -- the largest monthly increase in more than a decade. Additionally, the state Labor Department reports solid private sector job growth over the past year in long-economically ravaged upstate New York.
"These statistics are a sign that our state is getting back on the right track and we are creating jobs and getting New Yorkers back to work.
"While these numbers are positive news for our state, we have a long way to go. We must continue to work together through private and public partnerships and responsible economic policy to create more jobs and make this the Empire State once again."
