Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Port Authority's Action to Start First Phase of Comprehensive Laguardia Redesign
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 28, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"The Port Authority's initial plan was to replace what was existing at LaGuardia. That was short sighted; no one should want to replace a 1950s-style airport. My directive was not to rebuild what was but imagine and build what should be. This airport is the welcoming point to the greatest state in the country and New York deserves the best. I applaud the Airport Master Plan Advisory Panel headed by Dan Tishman for their pro bono work, as well as Gov. Christie, Port Authority Chairman Degnan, Vice Chairman Rechler and Executive Director Pat Foye for working together to put us on track toward building a completely re-imagined, integrated 21st century new LaGuardia."
