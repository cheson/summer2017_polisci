Governor Cuomo announced that an investigation by the Department of Public Service's Consumer Advocate has resulted in 1,566 utility consumers receiving $950,700 in energy bill refunds from Ambit Energy, a retail electricity provider, following customer complaints filed against the company in New York State.
"New York has no tolerance for companies who change the rules and rob ratepayers of an even playing field," Governor Cuomo said. "The State's Consumer Advocate was created to correct these inequities and, as this action illustrates, return hard-earned money to New Yorkers who have been wronged."
