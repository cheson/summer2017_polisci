Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 28, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"The local unemployment rates released today by the State Department of Labor are great news for Upstate New York. The numbers speak for themselves -- the unemployment rate for Upstate New York dropped from 8.4% in December 2012 to 6.4% by the end of 2013. These figures prove Upstate New York's economy is heading in the right direction and that our focus on revitalizing the region is delivering results. More needs to be done. This year, we will build on that work to deliver another on-time budget that creates jobs in every region, connects New Yorkers with new economic opportunities, and continues to make our communities more prosperous."
