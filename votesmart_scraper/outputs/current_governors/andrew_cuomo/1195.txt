128 Businesses Now Participating in START-UP NY and Committing to Create More Than 3,600 New Jobs across New York State
Governor Cuomo announced that 12 more businesses plan to expand in or locate to New York State as a result of START-UP NY, the innovative program that establishes Tax-Free Areas associated with colleges and universities across the state. These businesses have committed to create at least 385 new jobs and invest approximately $7.3 million over the next five years in the Western New York, Mohawk Valley, Capital District, New York City and Long Island regions.
"From Buffalo to Albany and down to Long Island, START-UP NY is transforming the way companies look at doing business in New York State," Governor Cuomo said. "This program offers a truly one-of-a-kind opportunity, and we're seeing it attract new businesses and jobs to communities across the state. I congratulate the latest round of companies that have joined START-UP NY, and I am excited to see this program continue to drive New York's economy forward."
"Today's announcement of 12 more companies joining START-UP NY is yet another example of the positive impact this program is having on the state's economy," Empire State Development President, CEO & Commissioner Howard Zemsky said. "With 128 companies now participating, it is clear that START-UP NY has been an effective tool in turning New York into a better place to do business, while gaining commitments to create thousands of new jobs and invest millions of dollars in our communities."
The 12 companies announced today are being sponsored by the University at Buffalo, SUNY Oswego, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, SUNY Downstate, New York University and Stony Brook University. START-UP NY now has commitments from 128 companies -- sponsored by 25 different colleges and universities statewide -- to create 3,609 new jobs and invest upwards of $180 million over the next five years in communities throughout the state.
SUNY Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher said, "We are thrilled with this development and look forward to growing relationships between these new businesses and SUNY. University-business partnerships are some of the strongest economic generators out there, and SUNY is happy to supply the proof with continued START-UP NY engagement on our campuses throughout the state."
Laura L. Anglin, president of the Albany-based Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities (CICU) said, "START-UP NY capitalizes on a sector whose very job it is to set in place the ideal conditions for the growth of viable ideas: the best talent, world-class facilities, and a mission to transfer knowledge. Private, not-for-profit colleges and universities are at the forefront of innovation and today's announcement is another step forward in the Governor's plan to proactively engage higher education in service to the state's economic development goals. This is a win for our students, and for our communities."
The businesses expanding in or locating to the Empire State under START-UP NY will create jobs in several key industries, including research and development in biotechnology and high technology; research and development in the physical, engineering, and life sciences; computer systems design services; and manufacturing.
