Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 19, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, leadership of the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers reached a tentative contract agreement with Verizon. This agreement preserves service for millions of customers, the job security and benefits of more than 45,000 working men and women, and takes reasonable measures to ensure Verizon, a New York company, can manage the costs of labor in these difficult economic times. I want to thank the leadership of CWA, IBEW, and Verizon for their commitment to working together and reaching this agreement."
