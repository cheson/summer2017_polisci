Statement from Governor Cuomo on UB 2020 Summit and Plan to Construct Medical Campus in Downtown Buffalo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 24, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, the representatives of the University of Buffalo and key stakeholders in the region presented their UB 2020 proposal. It is a transformative plan that has the potential to revitalize Western New York. I wholeheartedly support it and will do everything I can to see that it becomes a reality. UB's proposal is exactly the type of plan that state government should be supporting in Western New York and across the state. It will create jobs, breathe new life into the City of Buffalo, and help its namesake university become one of the nation's leading public research institutions.
"One of the reasons why the UB 2020 proposal is so exciting is because it has such broad and deep support across the region. From the academic and research community, to business and labor, to elected and community leaders, key stakeholders across the Western New York region have come together to back this plan. This is the model my Administration will seek to replicate across the state."
