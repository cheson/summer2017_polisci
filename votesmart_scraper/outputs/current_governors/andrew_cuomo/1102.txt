Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the New York Power Authority has finished $2.1 million in energy efficiency upgrades at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Metro-North Railroad North White Plains Train Yard. This energy saving project, completed under the Governor's BuildSmart NY program, will save New York State more than $328,000 in energy costs and remove approximately 1,280 tons of greenhouse gases annually.
"These upgrades will make this facility greener, more energy efficient, and will reduce its energy bill, saving the MTA and ultimately riders and taxpayers money," said Governor Cuomo. "It is vital that we all take steps to help sustain the planet and through initiatives like BuildSmart NY, this administration will continue to support commonsense projects that save taxpayer dollars and make sense for the environment."
