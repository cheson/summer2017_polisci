14th Proposal of Governor Cuomo's 2016 Agenda: Increase Opportunity for Minority and Women-Owned Businesses
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 11, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today unveiled the 14th signature proposal of his 2016 agenda: increase opportunity for minority- and women-owned business enterprises across New York State.
In 2014, Governor Cuomo established a goal of 30 percent for New York's MWBE state contract utilization -- the highest goal of any state in the nation. However, under state law, that goal only applies to contracts issued by state agencies and authorities; it does not apply to state funding given to localities such as cities, counties, towns, villages and school districts, which amounts to approximately $65 billion annually. This year, the Governor will advance legislation addressing this disconnect by expanding the MWBE goal setting to localities and entities that subcontract with those localities. Doing so will leverage the largest pool of state funding in history to combat systemic discrimination and create new opportunities for MWBE participation.
"We must extend our MWBE program to all state dollars in order to ensure fairness in economic opportunity," said Governor Cuomo. "This proposal will help minority and women-owned businesses compete for another $65 billion in state contracts. This is about continuing New York's legacy as a national leader on economic justice, and I am proud to be leading the fight again this year."
