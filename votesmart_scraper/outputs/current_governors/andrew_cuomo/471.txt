Location: Albany, NY

Earlier today, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo marched with local officials and veterans in two parades to honor and remember members of the armed forces who died in service to our country.
"Pleasure to be back in Queens. I'm a Queens boy through and through and proud of it. I worked in Washington for eight years, as you know, in Bill Clinton's cabinet, and I worked in all 50 states, literally. Inevitably, somebody would come up to me afterward and they would say, 'That's some New York accent.' I would say, 'No, no, that's a Queens accent.' There's a difference. Pleasure to be back. This is a great parade. I have a lot of fun, lot of old friends, but there's also a serious message, which is: We remember; we celebrate; we commemorate the people who gave their lives so we could live the life we live. The saying is that freedom isn't free. Many, many people pay the ultimate price. Many families are still sacrificing from lost ones. And we have to remember, we are still at war. We, since last Memorial Day, have lost dozens of people. We are still at war, we still have people sacrificing their lives, and I think we have a special burden as New Yorkers to remember, because 9/11 happened here, and 9/11 was the most recent attack in this country where this country opened its eyes once again to the threat that is out there. What the veterans have done, we owe our eternal gratitude to them and their families. And as New Yorkers, let us lead the way on Memorial Day. Let us lead the way as an honor to the 9/11 families who we lost, and the 9/11 victims, so that we take this seriously and 9/11 becomes part of the ongoing Memorial Day Tribute."
