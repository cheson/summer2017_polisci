Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today unveiled a coordinated transportation resiliency program to help prepare the region for future emergencies, reduce the impact of future storms on vital transportation infrastructure, and improve the long-term reliability and resiliency of the public transportation network.
At Governor Cuomo's direction, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) and the Moynihan Station Development Corporation (MSDC) worked together to prepare a plan that considered transportation needs and priorities on a regional level, in order to protect against stronger and more frequent storms in the future.
A key element of the plan is protecting commuter railroad access into Manhattan, by hardening Penn Station's existing railroad service and providing alternate service to Penn Station for MTA Metro-North Railroad customers in the event of a single-point failure along its existing network through upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
"Our response to the billions in damage Superstorm Sandy caused our transportation system is to build back stronger, better and smarter than before," Governor Cuomo said. "These projects build on the State's commitment to transforming our infrastructure, transportation networks, energy supply, and coastal protections to better protect New Yorkers from future disaster."
Governor Cuomo's plan will be submitted this week to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), which has made $3 billion available for resiliency programs throughout the region affected by Sandy. The New York plan includes projects worth $4.9 billion. The state's applications exceed available federal funding because the projects represent the extensive need New York faces in trying to protect its vital infrastructure.
