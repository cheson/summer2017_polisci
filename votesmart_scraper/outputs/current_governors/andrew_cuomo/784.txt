Governor Cuomo Announces First Minimum Wage Increase For Fast Food Workers as Result of Wage Board's Recommendation
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 30, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that three increases in the minimum wage in New York will take effect tomorrow. Workers in the fast food industry, tipped positions, and all other industries will each receive a higher wage beginning December 31 as the Governor continues to push for a $15 statewide minimum wage.
"No one who works full time should ever be condemned to a life of poverty," said Governor Cuomo. "As we prepare to ring in the New Year, we are making a fundamental difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of workers across this state. I am proud to mark these milestones in the fight for fair pay for workers in fast food, tipped industries, and others -- but too many home health care workers, airport workers and so many others continue to be left behind. That's why we will continue fighting for a $15 minimum wage so that all workers can afford a decent life and a decent opportunity in New York State."
