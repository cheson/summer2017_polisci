Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the funding of over $185 million in state and federal homeland security grants to municipalities across New York State. The funding will support critical infrastructure protection, sustain anti-terrorism programs in New York City, and enhance core emergency preparedness and response functions in counties statewide.

"From September 11th to Superstorm Sandy, our first responders and local law enforcement agencies have been essential to protecting New Yorkers and keeping our communities safe," Governor Cuomo said. "These grants are vital to supporting their work, and I am confident that they will go a long way toward building a stronger and more resilient State."

The funding for these programs was made available by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the State Homeland Security Program (SHSP), the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) grant, and the Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG). The New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (DHSES) manages these programs in close coordination with local stakeholders.

DHSES Commissioner Jerome M. Hauer said, "DHSES distributes critically important grant funds to local municipalities and first responders that help them fortify their preparedness and response capabilities. These grant funds will aid our local first responders in providing the most efficient and effective protective services to their communities."
