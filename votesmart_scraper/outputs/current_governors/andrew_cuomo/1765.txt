Republican candidate for governor Rob Astorino blasted Gov. Cuomo as a "coward" for refusing to take part in a one-on-on televised debate before the election.
Astorino, during an Albany radio appearance, also said voters -- particularly women voters -- need to decide what's more important to them -- the availability of late term abortions or a healthy economy.
"Honestly, people are going to have to decide what's more important - an economy that needs to get moving, the fact that people are leaving this state in droves, the fact that the governor is under investigation and could be indicted, who knows, or third term abortions on demand and performed by non-physicians," Astorino said.
Astorino's comments were in response to questions about a Quinnipiac Poll on Wednesday showing Cuomo with a 32-point lead among Women. Cuomo has made female voters a propriety this year and, over the weekend, launched a bus tour highlighting his 10 point Women's Equality Agenda, which includes a measure strengthening the state's abortion statute.
Astorino and other Republicans have slammed the abortion plank, saying it would increase dangerous late term abortions. Cuomo and other supporters claim that argument is nonsense and say the plank would simply write into state law the protections guaranteed by the Roe v. Wade decision.
