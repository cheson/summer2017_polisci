Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $3.85 million in funding to support the state's ongoing effort to combat heroin and prescription opioid misuse across New York. This funding will expand current addiction support initiatives to ensure two Family Support Navigators and two Peer Engagement Specialists are available in each of the state's ten economic development regions. Funding is also available to support community coalitions to help stem the addiction epidemic in local communities across the state.
"This funding will further New York's fight against heroin and opioid addiction and help ensure those in need have access to vital recovery resources and treatment," Governor Cuomo said. "With these advancements, we are moving one more step toward a stronger and healthier New York for all."
The funding will be made available through a Request for Applications administered by the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services.
