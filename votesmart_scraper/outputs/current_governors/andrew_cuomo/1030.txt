Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced locations for the Integrated Photonics Institute for Manufacturing Innovation, all of which will be in Rochester, New York. First announced by Vice President Biden and Governor Cuomo in July, the Integrated Photonics Institute will help secure the nation's leadership in emerging technology research, development, and manufacturing. These new specifics are a result of close collaboration between the Governor's office, Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology.
"New York is incredibly proud to be chosen as the home for this new, groundbreaking Photonics Institute, and we are hard at work to ensure development of this job-creating, game changing project advances as quickly as possible," Governor Cuomo said. "This state is a new hub for high-tech industries, and these new facilities will be a great example of how we are transforming the economy in Upstate. I thank all of our partners for working together to make this happen--it's another great day for Rochester."
