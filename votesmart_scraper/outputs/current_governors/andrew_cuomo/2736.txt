Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 19, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"The announcement that Kodak is filing for bankruptcy is difficult and disappointing news for the City and people of Rochester. Although Kodak will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process, the State has been in touch with the company and local officials and New York State stands ready to support the Rochester community. This is a time for all of us at all levels of government to come together and work with the private sector to support Rochester's growth. Rochester is known the world over as a place where businesses can come to thrive and grow and the State will continue to empower the Rochester community in order to build on that remarkable strength."
