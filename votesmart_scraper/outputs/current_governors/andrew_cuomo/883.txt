Governor Cuomo Announces Enhanced Security Measures Following Paris Attacks
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 14, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo said, "In times of darkness, we confront the hatred that drives terrorism and the tremendous pain and loss it can cause. Yet we also know that terrorism will never prevail -- it never has. We grieve deeply for the people of Paris, as New Yorkers who have experienced the same pain and loss firsthand in an attempted assault on our values of liberty and equality. Yet we are stronger now in our commitment to those values than we have ever been before. Today, we are one -- we stand shoulder to shoulder in rejecting extremism, condemning violence, and working to achieve a better and brighter future for all."
"In light of yesterday's horrific attacks, we are stepping up precautionary security measures at key points around the state. The safety of New Yorkers and our state's visitors is our number one priority, and we are remaining vigilant and in close contact with local and federal officials and our partner law enforcement agencies."
