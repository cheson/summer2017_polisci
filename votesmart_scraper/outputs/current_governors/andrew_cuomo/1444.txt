Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the craft beer industry in New York State grew 59% from 2013 to 2014, with a total economic impact estimated at $3.5 billion. These results, according to a research report prepared for the New York State Brewers Association and the New York Wine and Grape Foundation, are another example of the incredible growth the industry has been seeing. The report can be viewed here.
"We have said time and time again that New York produces some of the best craft beverages anywhere, and this report backs up exactly why we are focusing on growing these breweries," Governor Cuomo said. "By cutting the costs of doing business, rolling back red tape, and promoting products through Taste NY, we are seeing monumental success across the state. When these craft beverage producers do well, it creates jobs, puts more money in local economies and sets the stage for future growth."
The report, prepared by Stonebridge Research Group, finds significant growth in the craft beer industry since the 2012 passage of New York Farm Brewery legislation and with continued support from the Governor. The number of craft breweries has more than doubled from 2012 to 2015, from 95 breweries in 2012 and 207 in January, 2015. Craft beer production is up 54% from 2011 to 2013, to 859,535 barrels.
The craft beer industry is creating large ripples in the state's economy. Craft beer accounts for 6,552 direct industry jobs, according to the report, while supporting another 4,814 jobs in related industries. It is responsible for more than $2.9 billion in direct and indirect revenue within the state, and another $554 million in direct and indirect wages, making up the nearly $3.5 billion in total economic impact on the state.
Tourists and New Yorkers alike are flocking to craft breweries and brewpubs. Their visits support more than 3,000 jobs that pay more than $77 million in annual wages and generate more than $450 million in revenue, the report says.
Governor Cuomo has hosted several summits for the beer, wine, spirits, and cider industry. Those summits resulted in a significant effort to eliminate regulatory red tape and create incentives for the strong growth of the industry.
