Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that as a result of this administration's reforms, employers across New York will realize an average savings of $1,200 on their unemployment insurance costs this year.
"In 2013, we put into place sweeping reforms to fix New York's broken Unemployment Insurance system in a way to help lower costs for employers, offer greater benefits for workers, and increase the integrity of the program," Governor Cuomo said. "Today's lower assessment is a direct result of these badly needed changes and one more way we are helping to move New York forward."
