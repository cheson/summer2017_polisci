Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 9, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that New York State Police arrested 769 individuals for driving while intoxicated during the 20-day Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over national crackdown on impaired driving, which is aimed at significantly reducing deaths and injuries caused by motorists driving drunk or impaired by drugs. During this crackdown, which was coordinated by the Governor's Traffic Safety Committee, State Police and local law enforcement agencies targeted not only drunk or impaired motorists, but also drivers who were distracted, speeding, not wearing seatbelts, and not abiding by the "move over" law.
"The message is clearer than ever before: New York has zero tolerance for drunk driving and reckless driving," Governor Cuomo said. "One mistake can change a life forever, and I applaud the State Police and our law enforcement partners for getting dangerous drivers off the road and keeping New Yorkers safe."
State Police report that of the 769 DWI arrests between the August 21 to September 7 enforcement period, more than 219 occurred during Labor Day weekend alone. During the same period last year, 663 people were arrested for DWI. During the "Drive Sober" campaign, Troopers also issued 47,359 tickets, up from more than 46,500 in 2014: 18,660 for speeding, 1,613 for distracted driving, 2,522 for child restraint and seatbelt violations, and 556 for failing to "move over." Additionally, Troopers investigated a total of 2,973 crashes during the 20-day period, compared to 2,940 last year. Of these crashes, 857 people were injured, and 25 people were killed.
