Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Indictment of Ahmed Khan Rahimi
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 16, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"I condemn in the strongest of terms the bombings perpetrated against the people of New York and New Jersey in September. New York has zero tolerance for those who seek to spread fear and division, and we will continue to stand united in the face of terror. I applaud the State Police, local law enforcement and the U.S. Attorney's Office for their swift and diligent work on this matter. Today's indictment charging defendant Ahmed Khan Rahimi is an important milestone for those impacted by this hateful act, and I am confident that justice will be served."
