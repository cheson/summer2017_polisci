"Carey Gabay was a dedicated public servant whose life was cut short due to reckless gun violence -- tragedy that plagues too many of our communities. With Carey's help, New York passed the nation's toughest gun safety law, but his murder underscores the fact that our federal gun laws are woefully inadequate. While we took a great step forward with our historic legislation, without action from Congress, known criminals will continue to buy guns in other states today and sell them on the black market in New York tomorrow. I am grateful to the law enforcement officials for their relentless work investigating this case and feel strongly that the perpetrators of this heinous act should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Today's indictments are an important milestone in the quest for justice, and I hope that they bring solace to Carey's family and loved ones."
