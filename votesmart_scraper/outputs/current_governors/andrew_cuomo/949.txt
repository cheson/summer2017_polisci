Governor Cuomo announced that roadway construction on the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge is complete and all lanes have reopened today.

"This bridge is vital to the Mid-Hudson region, and these improvements will ensure less congestion and smoother travel for years to come," Governor Cuomo said. "This project is another step in the progress we have made in rebuilding significant infrastructure projects that will support economic activity and keep this region on the move."
