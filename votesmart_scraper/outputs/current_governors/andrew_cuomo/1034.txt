Governor Cuomo announced that recent investigations to protect exploited workers in New York State have led to nearly $3.3 million in back wages, damages and settlements for 800 workers. These efforts have included a targeted wage investigation of car washes that uncovered more than $446,000 in underpayments; an investigation of supermarket locations that found hundreds workers who hadn't been receiving the proper wages; and more than $1 million in settlements or ordered damages for employees who alleged unlawful discrimination against their employers.
"A fair day's wage for a fair day's work is a right and New York has zero tolerance for those who seek to exploit workers and deny them what they are rightfully owed," Governor Cuomo said. "This administration will continue to crack down on wage theft and other unlawful employment practices across this state, helping to ensure opportunity and equality are available to all."
