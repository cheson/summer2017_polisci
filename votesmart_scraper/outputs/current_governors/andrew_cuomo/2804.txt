Statement From Governor Andrew Cuomo on Today's Announcement by President Obama
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 19, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"As the President has rightly realized, the federal government is facing not only a fiscal and debt crisis but needs to take a strong action to create jobs and grow our economy.
I urge Congress to move quickly to pass the President's plan so we can put New Yorkers and Americans back to work.
While I am against raising taxes in general, if taxes need to be raised to create jobs, balance the budget and lower the deficit then those increases need to be done at the federal level and on the wealthiest Americans, not the middle class.
New York State is one of the highest taxed states in the country. New York cannot have the people and businesses that create jobs and wealth in New York move to Connecticut or New Jersey which have lower taxes."
