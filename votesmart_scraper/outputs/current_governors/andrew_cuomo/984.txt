Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 6, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that two of the New York metropolitan region's most iconic structures -- the George Washington Bridge and the spire on One World Trade Center -- will glow pink tonight, October 6, to commemorate Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women and the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women in New York State.
"Tonight we are taking another step to raise awareness and move forward in the fight against breast cancer," said Governor Cuomo. "Early testing can make a world of difference when it comes to fighting breast cancer, and I encourage women across the state to utilize the many free screening opportunities that are available this month. Together we can end the nightmare of this disease once and for all."
