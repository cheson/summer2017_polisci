Governor Cuomo Announces Over 8,100 Dangerous Drivers Kept Off the Road
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 28, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that 8,132 dangerous drivers have been kept off the road during the last three years as result of tough regulations implemented by the Governor in 2012. The measures deny licenses to repeat offenders that continually drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or persistently drive recklessly.
"Impaired and irresponsible driving far too often results in needless tragedy and ramifications that can last a lifetime," Governor Cuomo said. "These tough regulations have taken chronically dangerous drivers off the roads and helped make this a safer state."
