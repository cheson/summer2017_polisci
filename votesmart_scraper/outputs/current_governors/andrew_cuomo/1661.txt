"I am saddened to learn of the passing of Senator Owen Johnson. For four decades, Senator Johnson honorably served the people of Suffolk County, and all of New York State, helping strengthen the middle class, protect our environment, and keep the State safe and secure. During my first two years as governor, I had the pleasure working alongside Senator Johnson in our efforts to hold the line on property taxes for homeowners on Long Island and across the State, and to make state government work for all New Yorkers. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I send my most sincere condolences to the Senator's family and friends."
