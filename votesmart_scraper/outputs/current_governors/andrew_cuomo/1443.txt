Statement from Governor Cuomo on Yom Hashoah
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 16, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, we commemorate Yom Hashoah -- the day that memorializes the more than six million people who died during the Holocaust. I join with people of all faiths around the world in remembering those we lost.
"On this day, here in New York, let us recommit ourselves to the ideals of acceptance and freedom of worship and expression that define who we are as a state. By speaking out against discrimination and practicing tolerance and inclusion for people from all walks of life we continue to honor the memory of those who perished. It is with this spirit of peace that we strive to forever refute the hatred of the past, and ensure the world never again witnesses this kind of evil."
