Governor Signs Legislation to Help New York City Residents Cut Through Bureaucracy, Build Back Better
Governor Cuomo announced the NY Rising Housing Elevation Study to aid in the overall recovery of Breezy Point by providing the community with the critical information needed to elevate and reconstruct their homes. The Governor also signed legislation extending a law that permits building owners to repair Hurricane Sandy-damaged homes and businesses without having to file for a special permit from the City of New York. The Governor signed the legislation in Breezy Point, Queens, a community where many of the homes have needed significant repair following the devastating effects of Superstorm Sandy. Building owners are able to begin renovations up to 12 months sooner as a result of this legislation.
"Superstorm Sandy left an unprecedented level of devastation and destruction on the Breezy Point Community and today, we are not only making progress towards replacing what was, but building back better," Governor Cuomo said. "With these changes, we are leaving this community stronger and more resilient for its next generation."
