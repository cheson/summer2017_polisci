Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Six Months Since Sandy Hook Elementary School Tragedy
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 14, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Six months ago today, twenty children and six teachers went to school and never came home. In the aftermath, our nation stood together, heartbroken to learn of the horrific tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Today, New Yorkers stand with our neighbors in Connecticut and send our prayers and condolences to the families who lost loved ones. We will never grasp the pain and anguish that these families endured and continue to experience as they grieve."

"As our nation collectively mourned the unthinkable act that occurred on December 14th, the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School signified a long-overdue wake-up call for our country to finally address the reality of gun violence in our society. Across the nation, several states including New York overcame the outsized voices of the guardians of the status quo and passed common sense gun safety reform that bans lethal assault weapons and helps keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. Yet since Sandy Hook, another 4,000 people have died from gun violence, while Washington remains paralyzed. Today, I call on members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to renew their commitment to passing common sense gun control legislation because parents in this country shouldn't have to wait for the next tragedy for Washington to act."
