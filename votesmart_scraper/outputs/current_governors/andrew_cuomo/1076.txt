Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 2, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that New York State has been awarded $5.4 million in AmeriCorps funding from the federal Corporation for National and Community Service. New York will administer this funding to 19 municipalities and non-profit organizations which help at-risk children, homebound seniors, low-income families, and struggling veterans throughout the state.
"This is about putting people and resources on the ground in high-needs communities," Governor Cuomo said. "By supporting these programs, we are guiding children to academic success, preparing the unemployed to re-enter the workforce, and taking care of those who have served our country."
Awarded through a competitive Request for Proposals process, the grants will enable the 19 municipalities and non-profit organizations to recruit approximately 700 AmeriCorps members across the state. Each member will receive a scholarship upon completion of his or her service. Nearly $600,000 will complement the work of the Governor's Rochester Anti-Poverty Task Force by supporting programs designed to improve academic achievement, adolescent health, and violence prevention in the city's most impoverished neighborhoods.
The New York State Commission on National and Community Service -- New Yorkers Volunteer, a Governor-appointed commission, will administer the grants. The Commission uses the power of AmeriCorps to address some of the state's most challenging issues, and encourages citizens to make a difference in the lives of others.
