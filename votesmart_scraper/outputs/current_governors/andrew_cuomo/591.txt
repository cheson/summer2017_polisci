Governor Cuomo Announces Alcoholic Beverage Control Law Working Group Recommendations
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 13, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today announced the final report and recommendations of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law Working Group -- a diverse group of alcoholic beverage industry experts assembled to review ways to modernize and simplify New York's 80-year old Alcoholic Beverage Control Law.
"Working collaboratively with all stakeholders, this administration has taken important steps to cut red tape, roll back burdensome recommendations and help this industry continue to grow, thrive and create jobs in New York," Governor Cuomo said. "I thank the members of this group for their work and their recommendations on how to continue this progress and look forward to reviewing its findings."
Following the third Wine, Beer, Spirits and Cider Summit, Governor Cuomo called for the modernization of the state's Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, noting that the statute, enacted in 1934 following the repeal of Prohibition, is outdated, confusing, and difficult for businesses to navigate. In November 2015, the Governor created this Working Group comprised of industry attorneys, craft manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers, a Community Board representative and other industry experts to review the law and make recommendations on how best to modernize it.
