"Secretary Carter's announcement that the U.S. military will open all combat jobs to women is a tremendous step forward for our nation. It is a long overdue change in policy that will allow more women to serve their country while making all of us safer for generations to come. Women have always been equal to the task, and this measure demonstrates that the U.S. not only believes in the promise of equality, but embodies it as well. I commend Secretary Carter and President Obama for bringing us to this important milestone."
