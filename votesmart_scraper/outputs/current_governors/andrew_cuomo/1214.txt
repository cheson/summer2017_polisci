10-Agency Joint Task Force to Investigate and Focus on 14 Industries including Day Laborers, Farm, Domestic, Restaurant and Car Wash Workers

Governor Launches Hotline to Report Worker Exploitation, Wage and Workplace Violations: 1-888-469-7365
Governor Cuomo announced a first-of-its-kind statewide Task Force to root out worker exploitation issues in multiple industries in New York State. Building on the Governor's groundbreaking initiative to protect workers in the nail salon industry, the Task Force will identify and halt illegal practices in more industries across the state. The Task Force is composed of 10 State agencies including the Department of State, Department of Labor and Department of Agriculture and Markets, and will work in partnership with an advisory committee that is charged with providing legislative, regulatory and administrative recommendations. The Governor made the announcement while in the Bronx signing legislation to protect and support nail salon workers in New York.
"If there is a state that is going to take a stand against worker exploitation, it is New York," said Governor Cuomo. "New York offers a promise that our arms and hearts are open to those who come here to work and build a better future for themselves -- and we will not tolerate worker exploitation, period. It's not a Democratic or a Republican issue -- it's what we believe, and together we're going to make this a reality."
The multi-agency Task Force is a critical addition to New York's fight against worker exploitation and builds on the Governor's initiative protecting workers in nail salons. The Governor was joined today by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie to sign legislation that helps protect nail salon employees from unsafe working conditions and unfair labor practices.
