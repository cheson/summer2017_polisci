Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Passing of Nelson Mandela
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 5, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today issued the following statement on the passing of Nelson Mandela. The Governor also directed that flags on state government buildings be flown at half-staff on Friday, December 6, 2013, in honor of President Mandela.

"Nelson Mandela refused to accept injustice, fought relentlessly for what was right, and showed that a dedicated person of courage actually can change the course of history. His struggle to end racism, poverty and inequality began with his fight against apartheid, continued through his service as the first black President of South Africa and is now passed on for the world to continue. We will not soon see again, nor should we ever forget the profound example of humanity that Nelson Mandela embodied. While President Mandela is no longer with us, here in New York and all around the globe, his legacy lives on. His family and friends, and the people of South Africa, are in my thoughts and prayers along with those of all New Yorkers."
