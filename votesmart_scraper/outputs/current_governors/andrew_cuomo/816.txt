Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 14, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced New York State has executed an agreement to join the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy PMP InterConnect hub. States that participate in the hub are able to share data from their respective Prescription Monitoring Programs and prevent individuals from evading state laws in order to stockpile dangerous controlled substances.
"Prescription drug abuse continues to claim far too many lives in the state and country -- so I am proud that we are taking another step in New York to stop it," said Governor Cuomo. "By joining this hub, prescribers and pharmacists across New York State will be better able to ensure that their patients are not abusing or trafficking prescription drugs. This is about saving lives -- plain and simple -- and I want to thank all of our partners who have worked with us to make this possible."
