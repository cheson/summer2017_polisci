Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the success of the state's fourth regional sustainability conference, which brought together over 330 community development experts, local elected officials and business leaders to share successful economic growth strategies in the North Country. The conference is part of a statewide effort to boost awareness of resources available to local governments and nonprofit organizations to help create sustainable communities across New York. Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul hosted the conference in Lake Placid, where she highlighted a handbook that serves as a one-stop-shop resource for State grants -- providing context and web links to the complete list of more than 100 innovative funding programs.
"Whether through the work of the Regional Economic Development Council or our efforts to grow New York's tourism industry, this administration has spent the past six years working tirelessly to help jumpstart economic growth in the North Country," Governor Cuomo said. "By bringing the business community and local leaders together with all levels of government to create cross-sector partnerships, we are building on past successes to help this region continue developing a long term plan for sustainable growth."
