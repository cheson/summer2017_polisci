Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 16, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the opening of the final phase of SUNY Downstate Medical Center's Biotechnology Incubator at 760 Parkside Avenue in Brooklyn. The 26,000-square-foot addition will double the size of the current facility and open its doors to even more early-stage biotech-related companies than the 20 already located there.
"The innovative technologies being developed at SUNY Downstate's Biotechnology Incubator will improve people's lives across the globe, while bringing good jobs to Central Brooklyn," Governor Cuomo said. "The SUNY system and its students are some of New York's greatest assets, and by teaming up with them through Start-UP NY, companies can tap into a diverse and talented workforce eager to make its mark."
