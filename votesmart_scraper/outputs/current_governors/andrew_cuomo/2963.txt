Preliminary Report on Mandate Relief
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 1, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today accepted a preliminary report on ways to curb the proliferation of unfunded and underfunded mandates.
The Mandate Relief Redesign Team, consisting of private and public sector individuals and formed in January via Executive Order, is reviewing unfunded and underfunded mandates imposed by New York state government on school districts, local governments, and other local taxing districts. Such mandates include legal requirements that a local district provide a program, project, or activity on behalf of the state.
"Decade after decade, mandates have been piled on local governments and school districts, straining budgets and increasing pressure on taxpayers," Governor Cuomo said. "In these first two months of work, the Mandate Relief Redesign Team has discussed a framework to change this system. This is a good first step in helping cities, towns and villages across New York rein in costs and help taxpayers, and I look forward to additional findings throughout the year."
The preliminary report presents critical initial tools that can be provided to municipalities and school districts to help them control costs. Equally important, it includes a framework to fundamentally alter the state-local relationship. Going forward, the Mandate Relief Redesign Team will continue to review recommendations proposed by team members, state agencies, local governments, school districts and the public.
The report details findings in three key areas. First, they reform and redesign the current system to stop the proliferation of unfunded mandates by:
* Prohibiting New Unfunded Mandates: Permanently fix the problem of unfunded mandates by advancing a state law and eventual constitutional amendment prohibiting any new state mandate (with very limited exceptions) on local governments or school districts unless the state fully funds the mandate or the local entity votes to comply with the mandate.
* Requiring Independent Cost Analysis of Mandates: Strengthen the currently ineffective fiscal impact statement process by requiring legislative fiscal committees to determine the need for and prepare such statements. This would involve codifying Executive Order 17's fiscal impact statement methodology and local government consultation requirements and making the reports available to the public.
* Enforcing Limits on Unfunded Mandates: Using existing resources, establish an Office of Mandate Reform to act as a clearinghouse that will work with local governments and state agencies to address unfunded mandates.
Second, the report addresses cost-drivers to provide meaningful mandate relief by:
* Creating a Pension Tier 6: A new Tier will help municipalities and school districts address rapidly escalating pension costs.
* Avoiding the Wicks Requirement by Removing Barriers to Project Labor Agreements: In order to reduce the costs that localities and schools face due to Wicks, ease the burdens associated with project labor agreements (PLA) by eliminating the study requirement and developing regionally-negotiated PLA templates that together can reduce the costs of public works projects by 15 percent or more.
Third, the report addresses the current unsustainable burden of state mandates by:
* Giving Local Governments Greater Flexibility to Administer Existing Mandates: The State Administrative Procedure Act ("SAPA") ยง 204-a should be streamlined and expanded to allow localities to propose alternatives to current regulations and to request waivers of regulations.
* Conducting a Comprehensive Review of All State Mandates: Conduct a full agency review and accounting of state and regulatory mandates that burden school districts and local governments.
The Governor is reviewing the findings and looks forward to working with the team on these issues.
The Mandate Relief Redesign Team held meetings on January 7, 19 and February 14. Between meetings, the Chair and staff met with every group represented on the team, as well as with legislative conferences. In total, the Chair and staff have held more than 50 separate meetings in the past two months. More than 500 suggestions from the public were received through the Mandate Relief Redesign Team Web site. In addition, the Chair and the Governor's office reviewed more than 1,300 letters or emails and 150 resolutions from local governments. The Chair and staff have also met with more than a dozen state agencies to develop lists of recommended mandate relief proposals (included as Appendix B in the report).
