5th Proposal of Governor Cuomo's 2016 Agenda: Thruway Toll Reduction and Highest Transportation Infrastructure Capital Plan in State History
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 6, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo unveiled the fifth signature proposal of his 2016 agenda: the largest investment in transportation infrastructure in Upstate New York -- including a plan to keep Thruway tolls flat until at least 2020 and cutting tolls in half for those who rely on the Thruway the most. The Governor discussed these items at an event earlier today in Syracuse, where he was joined by CenterState CEO Rob Simpson and Onondaga County Executive Joanie Mahoney, who also serves as Chair of the Board of Directors of the New York State Thruway Authority, and Thruway Authority Executive Director Robert Megna.
"This year we are going to reinvest in Upstate New York like never before," said Governor Cuomo. "The Thruway is a vital artery for commerce and transportation throughout Upstate, so we are going to deliver major toll relief to New Yorkers. We are going to reduce tolls for businesses and drivers who rely on it the most, eliminate them for farmers bringing their goods to market, and freeze tolls for everyone else until at least 2020. And we are going to move forward with the largest capital plan in state history. Together we can support and rebuild our vital infrastructure and unlock the potential of Upstate New York for years to come."
