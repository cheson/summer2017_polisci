Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today announced the opening of the new $15 million Seneca Art & Culture Center at Ganondagan State Historic Site. The 17,300-square-foot Center tells the story of Iroquois contributions to art, culture and society for more than 2,000 years through specially designed interactive exhibits and historical artifacts. A collaborative venture between New York State, the Seneca Nation, Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council and many private donors made the opening of the year-round interpretive facility possible.
"New York is proud to have a rich history, and this new visitor center will allow more guests to experience the contributions of the Seneca Nation to this region," Governor Cuomo said. "We are committed to making our parks and historic sites not only beautiful natural resources, but centers of learning about the past and about protecting the environment."
