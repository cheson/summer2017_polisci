Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that President Obama has granted his request for a federal emergency declaration.
"I thank the President for his quick response. We are working hard at all levels of government to prepare for this storm and we appreciate the federal government's support," Governor Cuomo said.
The declaration will enable the federal government to provide assistance and resources to New York State and local governments to support activities related to evacuation, sheltering, and other protective measures.
The declaration will provide New York with technical assistance at no cost from any federal agency in support of the state's response to Hurricane Irene. This includes areas such as debris management, logistics management and electric power generation.
The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is authorized to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the designated areas. Specifically, FEMA is authorized to provide emergency protective measures (Category B), including direct federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program at 75 percent federal funding.
This assistance is for the counties of Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, Richmond, Nassau, and Suffolk.
Additional designations may be made at a later date after if requested by the state and warranted by the results of further evaluation.
