Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 26, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"The State Education Department is correct in refusing to recognize any side deals between the Buffalo's teachers union and the school district. The suggested collusion was a borderline legal and ethical fraud on our students and the Buffalo superintendent was right to affirm that no side deals will be recognized. We promised the students' performance - they deserve it and they will have it."
