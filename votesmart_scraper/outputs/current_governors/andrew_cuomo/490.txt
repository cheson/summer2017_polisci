Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Arrest of Bronx Man Attempting to Support ISIL
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 24, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"The arrest of Sajmir Alimehmeti in the Bronx today is another example of the continuing threat posed by global terrorist groups like ISIL. These threats can impact any community in our state, as we saw last December with the arrest of a Rochester resident for attempting to support ISIL as well.
"As Governor, I want to assure all New Yorkers that we are doing everything in our power to keep our state safe, and will continue to remain in constant communication with our federal and local law enforcement partners. While law enforcement is working aggressively to conduct investigations like those that led to the arrest of Sajmir Alimehmeti, the public is reminded to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.
"I commend the hardworking professionals in the Department of Justice, as well as the FBI's New York City area Joint Terrorism Task Force, including the New York State Police and the NYPD, for their exceptional work in preventing any possible attack."
