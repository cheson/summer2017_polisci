Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Supreme Court's Decision on Voting Rights Act
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 25, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's decision by the United States Supreme Court to strike down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is deeply troubling. Here in New York, upholding the voting rights of all people, regardless of race or ethnicity, is paramount to our democracy. We must double down on efforts to ensure that the voices of all voters can be heard at the voting booth. I urge Congress to take immediate steps to amend Section 4, which will prevent voter disenfranchisement and ensure fair elections."
