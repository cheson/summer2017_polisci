Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 23, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Manuel M. Vilar, President of the Police Benevolent Association of New York State, today announced a contract agreement between the state and the labor union representing New York State's University Police, Park Police, EnCon Officers and Forest Rangers.
The agreement resolves outstanding wage and contractual issues dating to 2005 and provides the officers with a retroactive wage increase adjustment, ensures protections against layoffs, and offers health benefits commensurate with other state bargaining units. The agreement provides for zero percent wage increases for 2011-2013, a 2% increase in 2014, 9 days of deficit reduction leave, and adjustments to the health insurance premium.
"In these tough fiscal times, shared sacrifice is needed, and this agreement puts in place important layoff protections for our officers while helping the state meet the demands of a tight budget," Governor Cuomo said. "I am pleased that by working together and finding common ground, we have reached an agreement that will protect the jobs of the men and women who serve to keep New Yorkers safe, and I thank President Vilar for his leadership."
PBA of New York State President Manuel Vilar said, "The tentative agreement reached last evening allows the PBA of New York State to bring to its members a fair and reasonable contract for their consideration and when ratified will bring a conclusion to seven years of frustration and uncertainty. Jointly the PBA of New York and Governor Cuomo have found common ground that both addresses the needs of its members; and recognizes the fiscal limitations of the state. We appreciate the professionalism and commitment of both negotiating teams to reach a timely resolution on an issue that prior to the existence of the PBA of New York State had languished."
The Agency Law Enforcement Services Unit (ALES) is composed of University police, Park Police, EnCon Officers and Forest Rangers. They have not had a contract since 2005 and were in arbitration for the years 2005-2007.
Highlights of the tentative agreement, which will require ratification by the full PBANYS membership, include:
* Zero percent wage increases for 2011-2013, a 2% increase in 2014,
* A $1,000 retention bonus paid out $775 in the third year and $225 in the fourth year
* Deficit Reduction Leave of five days this fiscal year and four days next fiscal year
* Retroactive payments that are scheduled to be paid in two installments -- one this fiscal year and one next fiscal year before the end of the calendar year.
* Health insurance premium share increase by 6% for both individual and families, making the share 16% for individuals and 31% for family premiums.
* Random drug testing and drug testing for probationary employees in addition to reasonable suspicion testing.
* A labor/management committee to review all leave taken by officers, including annual, personal, sick, workers compensation, and the manner of such use. Recommendations will be made to the President of the Union and the GOER Director for implementation.
* A health plan opt out so officers can opt out through a spouse/partner to a non-State health plan. Under the opt out, participants would receive $1,000 individual/$3,000 family
* Officers will receive broad layoff protection. Workforce reductions due to management decisions to close or restructure facilities authorized by legislation, SAGE recommendations or material or unanticipated changes in the state's fiscal circumstances are not covered by this limitation.
