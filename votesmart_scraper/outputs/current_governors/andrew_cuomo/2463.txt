Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on January Jobs Report
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 7, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

January marked the 17th consecutive month that the state has added private sector jobs -- the longest streak since the State Labor Department first started tracking this statistic. When compared to the 166,000 jobs added across the country during the same month, nearly one out of every five jobs added in the nation were created here in New York.

This report shows that our work to rebuild New York's economy and its government is paying off and New York's economy is on the right track.

Upon taking office, it was clear that the old Albany, top down approach to growing the economy would not work. With New York State reeling from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression we set out a new, comprehensive strategy to rebuild the economy -- centered around regional councils that empowered local communities to build on their unique strengths and assets, getting our state's fiscal house in order, and cutting taxes for middle class families and small businesses.

While we have made great progress, there is still more work to do. The first item on our agenda must be to pass another no-new taxes budget, and pass it on time. If we pass the 2013-14 budget on time, it will be the first time New York State has had three consecutive on-time budgets since 1984.
