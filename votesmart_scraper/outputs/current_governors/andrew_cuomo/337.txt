Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Appellate Court Decision Regarding the Hudson River Park Project
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 6, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"I am disappointed the Appellate Division has temporarily halted construction of the Hudson River Park Trust's and Pier 55, Inc.'s plan to transform an underutilized pier into an open space where New Yorkers would be able to enjoy recreation and entertainment. Delaying this project does a disservice to the public as well as damages the economic development that important public parks like this one encourages. I'm hopeful that when the appeals court hears the merits of the case, the Hudson River Park Trust and Pier 55, Inc. will be able to move forward with the construction of this important project."
