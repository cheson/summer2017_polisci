"We are thrilled that Wegman's Food Markets' has put forward this very generous donation toward the new Explore and More Children's Museum at Canalside. Buffalo's Waterfront is becoming a major draw for families and residents of the City, as well as tourists and visitors to Western New York, and the new museum will be yet another attraction for the neighborhood. I applaud Wegman's Food Markets' for their generosity and commitment to making New York's communities a better place for our residents."
