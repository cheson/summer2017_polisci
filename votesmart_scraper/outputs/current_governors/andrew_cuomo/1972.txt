Governor Cuomo Announces Reforms Implemented Following the 2014 Wine, Beer, Spirits and Cider Summit
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 10, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the State Liquor Authority (SLA) has approved advisories to help support the continued growth and development of New York's Farm based beverage producers. On April 8, Governor Cuomo convened the State's second Beer, Wine, Spirits, and Cider Summit, where industry participants discussed specific legislative and regulatory issues facing the industry. Since the first quarter of 2011, State actions that support agricultural producers have contributed to an 83 percent growth in farm-based beverage licenses.
"Just two days ago we heard firsthand from industry stakeholders on regulatory issues causing confusion and impeding growth in New York's beverage industry," Governor Cuomo said. "Today, we are taking concrete actions to address these issues, so that New York businesses can continue to thrive and grow, creating jobs and stimulating the economy statewide."
Today, the SLA Board adopted changes, effective immediately, to eliminate unnecessary paperwork and clarify standards on brand label registrations, authorize the sale of "growlers" for beer and cider, eliminate a $1,000 bond requirement for farm wineries, reduce costs for manufacturers and wholesalers with multiple licenses by allowing them to deliver all their products in one shipment, and provide guidance to the industry concerning the new "roadside farm market law."
