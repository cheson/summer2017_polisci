"I am deeply saddened to learn of this morning's horrific terror attack at a synagogue in Jerusalem. This attack was a deplorable act of evil that should be denounced as such by all - regardless of their political or religious beliefs. I want to reiterate that friends stand together in times of crisis. Today New York joins with all of Israel as they mourn those that were lost.
