Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Firebomb Attacks
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 2, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"The four reported attacks on Sunday night go against everything we stand for as New Yorkers and Americans. Attacks such as this have no place in our open and inclusive society and we must do all we can to ensure New York remains a safe and tolerant place for all. I am thankful that there were no reported injuries. To make sure those who perpetrated these attacks are brought to justice and we prevent future bias crimes, I have asked Superintendent of State Police Joe D'Amico and Deputy Secretary for Public Safety Liz Glazer to provide any assistance that is needed on the investigation."
