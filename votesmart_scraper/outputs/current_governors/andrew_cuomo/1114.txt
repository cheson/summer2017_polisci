"Last night, the community of Rochester was rocked by a deplorable act of violence. The shooting that took place outside of the Boys and Girls Club on Genesee Street -- an act that killed three young men and injured four others -- is nothing less than heartbreaking, and I join with the people of Rochester in mourning this tragedy. Local authorities are working to bring the perpetrators of this hateful act to justice, and my administration stands ready to assist them in any way possible.
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, my thoughts and prayers are with the families of the seven victims of last night's senseless violence."
