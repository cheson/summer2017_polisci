Governor Cuomo Signs Legislation to Support Family Caregivers
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 27, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today announced the signing of the Caregiver Advise, Record and Enable Act, which will require that hospitals allow patients to formally designate a caregiver before they leave the hospital, or are transferred to another facility. It will also require hospital workers to provide the caregiver with instruction or training on how to perform tasks for the patient at home, such as changing bandages or administering medication.
"Often, the hardest part of recovery begins once a patient leaves a hospital," Governor Cuomo said. "This new law will allow New Yorkers to appoint someone they trust to assist in their care and help them return to their daily lives. I thank Senator Hannon and Assemblymember Rosenthal for their diligent work on this important issue. "
