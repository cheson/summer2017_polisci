Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a marketing campaign for the 2016 Great New York State Fair, which will be hosted in the reimagined State Fairgrounds. The campaign features first-ever television advertisements that will be shown across the state to promote the fair. Governor Cuomo made the announcement while visiting Central New York today -- first touring the Syracuse Nationals Car Show at the State Fairgrounds, and later competing in the "Governor's Cup" boat race to benefit the Jim and Juli Boeheim Foundation as part of the inaugural Onondaga Cup and LakeFest.
"The State Fair is a central piece of New York's rich history," Governor Cuomo said. "From the Syracuse Nationals Classic Car Show, to live performances and boundless exhibits, the Fairgrounds have long-captured the hearts and minds of its visitors. This new campaign will not only highlight the recent enhancements, but also ensure the Fair remains a time-honored tradition for generations to come. Our investments to reimagine the Fairgrounds and revive Onondaga Lake are creating a powerful economic synergy for the region, and the revival of the regatta celebrates the next chapter in Central New York's success story."
