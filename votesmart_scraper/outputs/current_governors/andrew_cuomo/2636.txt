Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Passage of Prescription Drug Reform Legislation
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 11, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"I applaud the Senate and Assembly for passing legislation that will be a critical force in our state's fight against prescription drug abuse. Too many families have had to cope with the devastating loss of a teenager as a result of a prescription drug overdose, and the legislation passed today will enable our state to better crack down on the illegal trafficking of painkillers and help prevent more untimely fatalities. This new law will put New York on the forefront of efforts to curb prescription drug abuse, and I congratulate Majority Leader Skelos, Speaker Silver, the bill sponsors, and Attorney General Schneiderman for all of their hard work and leadership on this issue."
