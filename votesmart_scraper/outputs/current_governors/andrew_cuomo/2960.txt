Location: Albany, NY

Extended Benefits Will Provide Relief for 166,000 New Yorkers
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that he has submitted legislation to enable unemployed New Yorkers to receive extended federally-funded unemployment insurance benefits through 2011. Without this legislation, New York would forfeit approximately $620 million in federal payments to the unemployed. Extending unemployment benefits will affect 166,000 New Yorkers.

Since 2009, New York State has participated in a two-year federally-funded unemployment insurance program. In December 2010, the United States Congress extended the federal program by an additional year. The Governor's legislation will now amend New York State law to allow the state to qualify for the additional third year of the program.

"Federally-funded unemployment insurance benefits are crucial for New York's recovery," Governor Cuomo said. "Extending this program will give unemployed New Yorkers vital relief as they continue their efforts to enter the workforce and will help build a stronger economy for the entire state."

The extended unemployment insurance program will continue throughout 2011. Under the program, benefits for all private sector and non-profit employees are fully federally-funded.
