Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 28, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"Today we mourn the passing and celebrate the legacy of Dr. Maya Angelou, whose voice, passion, and life have left a lasting influence on our state and nation. Dr. Angelou was deeply involved in our nation's Civil Rights movement and spent her life helping ensure that dignity, respect and opportunity were extended to all men and women. Her poetry and prose were an extension of her love and hope for humanity, a testimony of wisdom and strength that will continue to inspire generations of Americans.

"Dr. Angelou always considered New York City -- especially Harlem -- to be her second home. That is why we in New York State are so honored to have her personal papers housed at Harlem's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I send my condolences to her loved ones."
