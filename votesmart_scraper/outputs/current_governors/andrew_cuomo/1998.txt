State Announces Citizen Preparedness Corps Training Program in Ithaca
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 26, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

The Cuomo Administration today announced that the Citizen Preparedness Corps Training Program will take place on Saturday, March 29, in Tompkins County. The program, highlighted in Governor Cuomo's State of the State Address in January and launched last month, aims to provide approximately 100,000 New Yorkers with the tools and resources to prepare for emergencies and disasters, respond accordingly, and recover as quickly as possible to pre-disaster conditions.
"Every region of the New York State has experienced some type of natural disaster-related emergency and the frequency of such events over the past few years has put a considerable strain on our communities, citizens and the State," said Governor Cuomo. "An important aspect of our ability to properly prepare and respond to such emergencies is ensuring that citizens know what to do to ensure their personal safety and possibly assist their neighbors and broader community. That's why I launched the Citizen Preparedness Corps Training program, which at a grassroots level will train citizens across the State to provide critical assistance in their own homes and to their own neighbors whenever disaster strikes. Beginning with approximately 100,000 citizens trained this year, we intend to make this program a centerpiece of the State's coordinated response to future severe storms and natural disasters."
