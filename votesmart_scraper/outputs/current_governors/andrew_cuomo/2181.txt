Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today directed the State Police and the Division of Human Rights to investigate the serious allegations of anti-Semitic harassment, physical attacks, and intimidation at the Pine Bush Central School District.

"The reports of rampant anti-Semitic harassment and physical assaults at Pine Bush schools, if true, are deeply disturbing," Governor Cuomo said. "Here in New York State, we have zero tolerance for bigotry or hate based on anyone's religious or ethnic origin, and to that end, I have directed the State Police and the Division of Human Rights, to undergo a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding these acts. The public has a right to know the truth, and parents across the state have the right to know that their children can attend our schools without fear of this reprehensible behavior."
