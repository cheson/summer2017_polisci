The 2014-15 Budget Agreement announced yesterday holds spending growth below two percent for the fourth consecutive year, continuing a record of fiscal discipline that has reversed decades of state budgets where spending grew at a higher rate than inflation or personal income growth.
"This budget builds on the State's progress over the past three years in order to grow the economy and create new opportunities for New Yorkers and their families," Governor Cuomo said. "It maintains our fiscal discipline by holding spending growth below two percent, while also cutting up to $1.5 billion in property taxes to help homeowners and address the unsustainable proliferation of local governments. The budget also contains major investments in education that will transform our schools, including an increase in state aid by more than five percent and support for quality pre-k programs across the state. These investments, along with many other important provisions, are what make this budget a blueprint for success that will continue to make New York stronger, more competitive, and more affordable for all."
