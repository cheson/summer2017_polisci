Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that nearly $42 million in state funding will be committed to bolstering safety and security at New York City Housing Authority developments. The allocation will pay for security cameras, interior and exterior lighting and gunfire detection technology, among other enhancements.
"The brave officers of the NYPD have done great work in lowering crime to historic levels in New York City," Governor Cuomo said. "But many public housing residents are worried by the violence they've seen where they live. We have heard that concern and will be funding critical safety and security upgrades at NYCHA developments in the five boroughs. Every New Yorker deserves a safe place to call home."
