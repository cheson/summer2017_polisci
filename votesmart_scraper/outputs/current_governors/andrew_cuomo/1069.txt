Governor Cuomo Warns New Yorkers of Wildfire Risks During Labor Day Weekend
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 4, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that during Labor Day weekend, much of New York is expected to have warm and dry weather which can increase the likelihood of conditions that allow wildfires to start and spread quickly. Residents and visitors are being urged to exercise extreme caution with campfires.
"Reckless behavior during these dry conditions can be a recipe for disaster," Governor Cuomo said." I urge everyone to stay safe and be responsible while enjoying the outdoors this holiday weekend in order to prevent avoidable dangers and senseless tragedies."
Currently, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Forest Rangers are working to extinguish six small wildfires that have been contained at a combined total of 3.4 acres. Two fires are in Suffolk County, two in the eastern Catskills and two in the eastern Adirondacks. Three fires were caused by unextinguished campfires, two by lightning strikes and one is under investigation. Rangers have contained the spread of these fires but the fires are burning deep into the soil and are difficult to extinguish.
