"The Administration has worked very hard with the PEF leadership to make modifications which the leadership believes will address the concerns of the membership. The contract modifications are revenue neutral to the state and achieve the same level of savings as the first proposal. The allocation of these costs among different elements of the contract have been shifted. For example, there are fewer unpaid furlough days but the cash payment has also been reduced. The layoff provisions are the same as originally proposed and the same as in other union contracts already ratified.
We hope that the leadership as a whole moves for a revote and the membership is governed by the needs of the collective and ratify the contract.
I am confident that my Administration has been more than reasonable and fair, as CSEA's ratification demonstrates.
Simply put, the fate of the members is in the union's hands. It's up to them."
