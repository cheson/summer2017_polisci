Governor Cuomo and Attorney General Schneiderman Partner to Reduce the Risk of Litigation Against New York State
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 19, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

The partnership will focus first on the agencies that incur the lion's share of state litigation including the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision and various health and human services agencies. Each Office will contribute staff to a team which will review and improve policies and procedures for administrative hearings, evidence collection and preservation, early claims resolution and diversion programs, and training to reduce the likelihood of litigation. The team will also analyze prior significant and recurring litigation to develop strategies for avoiding them in the future.
"This administration has spent the last five years modernizing state government, making it more efficient and better able to serve the residents of the State of New York," said Governor Cuomo. "With this new effort, we're further raising the bar for performance and ensuring that New Yorkers are getting the government that they deserve. I thank Attorney General Schneiderman for his partnership in this important endeavor."
