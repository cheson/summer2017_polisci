Governor Cuomo Announces Repeal of 57 Nuisance Fees
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 14, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the repeal of 57 nuisance fees as part of the 2015-16 State Budget. By repealing these fees, the Budget eliminates excess bureaucracy while still retaining the necessary functions that those fees originated from. Businesses and individuals across New York State will save approximately $3 million annually as a result of this action.
"These nuisance fees created unnecessary red tape and placed an undue burden on businesses, while at the same time resulted in no significant revenues for the state," Governor Cuomo said. "This action will eliminate unnecessary costs and paperwork, helping to allow these businesses to reinvest and grow in New York."
The fees being repealed include such items as a $20 license fee that is collected annually from farm product dealers, a $34 fee for the inspection of both seed potato plants and seed potato tubers, and a $50 fee paid by new trucking companies.
