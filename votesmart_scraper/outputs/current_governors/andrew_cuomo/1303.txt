Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 7, 2015
Location: Dannemora, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of escaped Clinton Correctional Facility inmates Richard Matt and David Sweat. Both individuals are considered to be a danger to the public and anyone with possible information or with knowledge of unusual activity should immediately contact the State Police at 518-563-3761. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 250 law enforcement and corrections officials are actively searching for the inmates.
"Today we are asking for the help of the public as we continue our search to arrest these two individuals," Governor Cuomo said. "They are convicted murderers and our first order of business is to ensure they don't inflict any more pain on the community. We are urging anybody who sees them or knows anything that may assist our investigation to contact the State Police as soon as possible. With the public's help, we will return these men to where they belong -- behind bars."
The Governor made the announcement earlier this afternoon on a conference call with New York State public safety officials providing an update to members of the media.
