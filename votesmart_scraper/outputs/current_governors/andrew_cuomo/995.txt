"The shooting earlier today at Umpqua Community College is the latest in a series of terrible, heartbreaking tragedies resulting from gun violence. My thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of those we lost, and I am praying for the recovery of those who were injured. No one should suffer the pain of losing someone they love to gun violence, although it happens all too often.
"The prevalence of gun violence in this country is a sickness that continues to claim innocent lives and threaten our communities seemingly at random on a daily basis. We have seen too many of these pointless, brutal tragedies, and the sad truth is that, in spite of it all, Washington has done nothing.
"At what point will Congress wake up and pass real, sensible gun control that keeps guns out of the hands of criminals and people who are dangerously mentally ill? How many more families will have to endure this kind of senseless, avoidable tragedy while our elected officials in Washington continue to sit on their hands?
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, I offer my sincere and heartfelt condolences to everyone who has been impacted by today's tragedy."
