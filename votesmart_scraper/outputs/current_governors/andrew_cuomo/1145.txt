Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 10, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that a record 92 percent of New Yorkers are buckling up and regularly using seat belts. This is the sixth consecutive year that seat-belt use has stayed at or above 90 percent, according to the New York State Seat Belt Observation Survey, conducted each year by the University at Albany Institute for Traffic Safety Management and Research.
"New York led the way with this nation's first seatbelt law and these new numbers are a testament to this state's ongoing efforts to get New Yorkers to buckle up and save lives," Governor Cuomo said. "We will continue this proud legacy and do all we can to ensure that our roads stay safe and avoidable tragedies are stopped in their tracks."
