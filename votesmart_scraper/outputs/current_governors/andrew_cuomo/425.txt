Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 12, 2016
Location: New York, NY

"From Stonewall to marriage equality to protecting transgender individuals to the first-in-the nation executive action to ban conversion therapy, New York has led the way in the fight for LGBT rights. In this state, we believe that no matter your race, creed, color, gender identity or expression you have the right live your life free from persecution and prejudice.
"This senseless act of terror reminds us that there are those who seek to undermine these very values and the progress we have achieved. We will not let this happen. An attack on one is an attack on all. New York joins the rest of the nation in rejecting this hate, fear and extremism and stands shoulder to shoulder with the LGBT community.
"Tonight, I am directing One World Trade Center to be lit the colors of the pride flag in a tribute to LGBT Americans and the lives that were lost. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest thoughts and prayers to those affected by this horrendous tragedy."
Governor Cuomo has directed the lights of One World Trade Center's 408-foot spire to be displayed in rainbow colors this evening, June 12, in solidarity with the LGBT community.
Governor Cuomo has also directed New York State law enforcement to remain vigilant in the wake of this senseless attack and has increased security at high-profile locations across the state.
New Yorkers are reminded to stay alert to their surroundings, and report any suspicious activity. Reports can be made to:
Counter Terrorism Center via the New York State Intelligence Center
