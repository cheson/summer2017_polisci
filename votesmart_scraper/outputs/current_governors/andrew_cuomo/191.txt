Governor Cuomo Signs Legislation Instituting New Tax Credits for New York City Beer Manufacturers
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 30, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced he signed legislation to help further grow this state's booming craft beverage industry by enabling tax credits on the local level for New York City breweries.
The bill, (A.1719C/S.6303B), adds a new beer production credit that provides New York City beer manufacturers with a 12 cents per gallon credit for the first 500,000 gallons produced and a 3.86 cents per gallon credit on the next 15 million gallons. This local credit is modeled on a similar credit on state taxes that the Governor signed into law in 2012.
"This administration has fought aggressively to lower costs and cut red tape to help New York breweries continue to grow, create jobs and generate economic activity," Governor Cuomo said. "This legislation is a continuation of this work and will help these businesses better be able to reinvest in their companies, continue to make their world class products and further strengthen this industry across New York."
Only brewers producing less than 60 million gallons annually are eligible for this credit.
