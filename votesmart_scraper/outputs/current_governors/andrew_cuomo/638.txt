Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today reminded New Yorkers that they must register to vote by March 25 in order to cast ballots in the upcoming presidential primaries on April 19. New Yorkers looking to register to vote, or to change their enrollment information, can do so easily by using the state's online voter registration service on the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles' website. Since Governor Cuomo launched the system in 2012, more than 256,600 New Yorkers -- 80,500 of which were registering for the first time -- have registered to vote using the automated online system, MyDMV.
"Thanks to New York State's online portal, it has never been easier for residents to register to vote and participate in the democratic process," Governor Cuomo said. "The ability to vote and choose our representation is one of the most important rights that we are afforded as Americans and I encourage all eligible New Yorkers make sure they are registered ahead of April's presidential primaries."
By following a few simple steps, New Yorkers can easily sign up for a secure MyDMV account and register to vote or access a variety of other services like updating party enrollment or a home address. To create an account, individuals must use their New York State driver license, permit or non-driver ID, last four digits of their Social Security Number, and the ZIP code currently listed on their driver license, permit or non-driver ID record. Upon completion, DMV sends the voter registration applications to the County Board of Elections for action. New Yorkers can use the New York State Board of Elections' website to check their voter registration status.
