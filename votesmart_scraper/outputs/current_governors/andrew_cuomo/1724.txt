Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Expected Nomination of Loretta Lynch as U.S. Attorney General
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 7, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"On behalf of all New Yorkers, I congratulate Loretta E. Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, on President Obama's announcement that he will be nominating her as United States Attorney General. U.S. Attorney Lynch is a trailblazer who has served the public with distinction in her current role under two presidents. She has earned a well-deserved reputation as an aggressive but fair prosecutor, who has used her office to seek justice through both criminal and civil proceedings. I am confident that U.S. Attorney Lynch will bring those same qualities to her new position as our country's top law enforcement official."
