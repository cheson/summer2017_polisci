Governor Cuomo Announces Regulations to Crackdown on Repeat Toll Violators
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 17, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a new proposed regulation that takes action against motorists who persistently evade the payment of tolls and fees. Under the new proposal, the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles will suspend the registration of motorists who fail to pay five tolls, fees, and other charges resulting from violations on different days, within a period of 18 months, and ignore toll authorities' repeated notices. Persistent violators will be required to pay the tolls and fees, or to have the charges dismissed, in order to prevent the suspension of their registrations or in order for their registrations to be reinstated.
"Toll evaders unfairly burden hard working New Yorkers who play by the rules and put additional stress on this state's transportation network," Governor Cuomo said. "This new action cracks down on this unacceptable behavior and will keep these scofflaws off the very roads they fail to pay their fair share to maintain."
