Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Air Force Decision Regarding Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 4, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"The Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station plays a crucial role in both our national security and the strength of the local economy and workforce -- and this decision by the Air Force to bring new refueling tankers to the base was the right call to make. I'm proud to have fought alongside Senators Schumer and Gillibrand, Congressman Higgins, then-Congresswoman Hochul, and so many others to support NFARS. My administration will continue working to ensure the brave men and women who are stationed there can play a crucial role in our national readiness in the years to come."
