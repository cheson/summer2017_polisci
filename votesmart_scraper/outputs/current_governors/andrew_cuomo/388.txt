Governor Cuomo Signs Sweeping Legislation to Combat the Blight of Vacant and Abandoned Properties
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 23, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today signed legislation to prevent foreclosures and curb the threat posed to communities by "zombie properties." The bill was passed as part of the 2016 Legislative Session and is a boon for the economic health and public safety of communities and homeowners who would otherwise be at risk of losing their residences. The legislation combats the blight of vacant and abandoned properties by expediting the rehabilitation, repair and improvement of these properties, and enabling the State to assist homeowners facing mortgage foreclosure. The Governor signed the legislation into law, touring the state and visiting affected communities, at events in Syracuse, Manhattan and Long Island.
"For many New Yorkers, homes are our single most important investment, but that investment can be undermined by the blight of neglected and abandoned properties," Governor Cuomo said. "For each zombie home that we cure and for each that we prevent with this legislation, we are saving entire neighborhoods from the corrosive effect of blight and neglect. I thank my colleagues in the Assembly and Senate for seeing a crisis and helping to turn it into an opportunity for people to realize the great American Dream of homeownership."
