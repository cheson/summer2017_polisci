Faith-Based Leaders Join Governor Cuomo's Campaign to Raise the Minimum Wage
Press Release

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced 86 faith-based leaders from across New York have joined together in support of the "Fight for Fair Pay" campaign to raise the minimum wage in this year. These 86 leaders join more than 80 business leaders representing broad private sector support of the Governor's proposal, which increases the minimum wage from the current $8.75 to $10.50 statewide and $11.50 in New York City.
"The concept of the minimum wage is that if you work full time, you should be able to afford a path out of poverty and live with dignity -- and these pastors are joining us to help in our fight to restore this opportunity," Governor Cuomo said. "These pastors are leaders in their communities, and I am proud to have their support as we work together to combat poverty and make a difference for more than one million New Yorkers."
In total, 1.3 million New Yorkers will experience higher wages as a result of the minimum wage increase, which translates into a $3.4 billion direct economic value statewide -- meaning that more New Yorkers will have more money to spend on goods and services in their community. During the last six increases in New York State's minimum wage, employment subsequently increased in industries with many minimum wage workers.
