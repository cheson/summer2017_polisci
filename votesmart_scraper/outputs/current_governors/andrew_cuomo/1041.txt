Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 14, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the results from a statewide crackdown on underage drinking and fake identification at summer concerts and other underage hotspots, which netted 133 arrests and the confiscation of 63 false identification documents. Leading up to Labor Day, the unannounced enforcement actions were carried out at various concert venues and bars across the state by the Department of Motor Vehicles' Division of Field Investigation in partnership with law enforcement agencies. The Governor previously announced the operation as part of a continued effort to deter underage drinking and discourage the purchase of fake IDs.
"Possessing a fake ID and drinking underage is not only illegal, but can also lead to bad decisions with life-long consequences," Governor Cuomo said. "By continuing to crack down on this reckless behavior we are seeking to both avoid needless tragedies and send that message that underage drinking just isn't worth it."
In addition to standard techniques employed by DMV investigators, during this crackdown they used a portable document scanning workstation for the first time ever. The document scanning workstation allows investigators to scan the IDs of individuals attempting to purchase alcohol and instantly detect alterations and counterfeits.
