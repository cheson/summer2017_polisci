Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced today that 17 counties will compete for more than $13 million to fund efforts to reduce firearm-related crimes, shootings, and homicides through the state's new Gun Involved Violence Elimination (GIVE) initiative. The initiative is designed to build upon the crime-fighting successes those jurisdictions experienced while participating in Operation IMPACT.

"New York State is home to the safest large city in the country and is the third safest state overall, and that is because we are tough, smart, and fair when it comes to fighting crime in our communities," said Governor Cuomo. "This funding will give law enforcement agencies resources to reduce gun violence in their neighborhoods. I encourage local agencies to apply for this funding and work toward making New York's streets safer."
