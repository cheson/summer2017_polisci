Governor Cuomo and Mayor Brown Announce $15 Minimum Wage for Employees of City of Buffalo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 18, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today joined Mayor Byron Brown to announce that the city of Buffalo is raising the minimum wage for public sector workers to $15 per hour. The action will take effect at the beginning of the city's next fiscal year and then follow the phased schedule of the Governor's proposal for a statewide, all-industry $15 minimum wage by 2021. A total of 479 city employees will be directly benefitted by this increase.
"A full-time worker who earns the minimum wage today is still left very far from a decent living -- that's not right, and it's time that changed. Raising the minimum wage is about fairness and justice. It's about giving hard-working people an opportunity to support themselves and their families," said Governor Cuomo. "Today, the mayors of both Buffalo and Rochester stepped up to lead by example in the fight for fair pay. We are building momentum across the state for a policy that will change lives, and I urge the State Legislature to join us in raising the minimum wage for all workers."
