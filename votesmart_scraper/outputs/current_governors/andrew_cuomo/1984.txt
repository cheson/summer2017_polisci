Statement From Governor Cuomo on Credit Rating Services' Response to 2014-15 State Budget
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 4, 2014
Location: Washington, DC

"Today, Moody's Investors Service rated this year's state budget as "credit positive,' citing the State's continuing commitment to fiscal responsibility, major investments in education, and the clear demonstration that our government is working better than it has in decades with the passage of four on-time budgets in a row for the first time in nearly 40 years.
"Today's positive rating by one of the nation's top credit agencies is further evidence that the arrows are pointing in the right direction and New York State is on the right path. Four years ago, New York was hemorrhaging jobs, passing budgets months late, spending at a rate far higher than the people of this state earned, and driving away businesses and families by increasing taxes. We made a commitment to end the dysfunction and restore fiscal discipline to the Budget process, and the positive news from Moody's demonstrates that our smart reforms and targeted investments are working for the people of this state."
