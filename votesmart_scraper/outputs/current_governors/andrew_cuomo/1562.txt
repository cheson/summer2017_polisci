Long Island: Governor Cuomo Details Taxpayer Savings from Property Tax Relief Program
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 2, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today detailed projected savings for New York taxpayers as a result of the Property Tax Relief program, which provides 1.3 million homeowners significant financial relief. The $1.66 billion program, which also includes a renters' credit, is part of the Governor's 2015 Opportunity Agenda.
"We must ensure economic opportunity in New York -- and that means putting money back in the pockets of hardworking homeowners who have been struggling under the crushing burden of property taxes for far too long," said Governor Andrew Cuomo. "During the last four years, we capped property taxes, and then we froze them. Now we are going to cut them. This program addresses the one of the most important challenges we face as a state -- making New York affordable -- by providing real, meaningful, significant tax relief that will make a difference in people's lives."
When fully phased in, 332,417 homeowners on Long Island will receive an average annual savings of $1,186.

Who Qualifies?
The property tax relief is available to homeowners with incomes below $250,000 whose property taxes exceed 6 percent of their income. The credit is valued at up to 50 percent of the amount by which property taxes exceed the 6 percent burden threshold, depending on household income. The specific amount of the credit within that 50 percent is determined on a progressive income scale, so that New Yorkers with the highest tax burdens and lowest income levels will receive the greatest amount of relief.
