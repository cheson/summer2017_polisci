Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today joined Governor Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla to announce the grand opening of the New York State Office of Trade and Tourism in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. The office will promote mutually beneficial tourism opportunities and strengthen economic ties between the state and the island. The office includes a New York State Discovery Center, which will offer residents and visitors a New York State experience, with a Taste NY and I LOVE NY store promoting New York-made and produced products. Today's announcement follows an aggressive action plan launched in September to foster a mutually beneficial economic development relationship between Puerto Rico and New York State.
Governor Cuomo said: "New York has always had a special connection with Puerto Rico -- and today we are taking a step to make that relationship stronger than ever. This office is a new gateway to the Empire State, where trade and tourism partnerships can be developed and people in Puerto Rico can get a taste of what New York has to offer. This is the beginning of an exciting new chapter in our state's long and close history with Puerto Rico, and I'm eager to see it grow in the days to come."
