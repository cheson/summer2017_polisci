Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 24, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"The federal indictments outlined that allege seven Iranian individuals performed computer hacking work on behalf of the Iranian government -- including one case targeting the Bowman Avenue Dam in Westchester County in 2013 -- are serious and demonstrate the challenges our nation faces combating cyber threats. I applaud the U.S. Department of Justice on its successful investigation of this matter and identifying those responsible."
"The number of cyber attacks in the United States continues to rise and New York State is not immune to this threat. My administration has made cyber security a top priority and implemented new measures to safeguard our critical infrastructure in New York State. As outlined in our New York State Homeland Security Strategy, these measures include strengthening networking infrastructure through upgrades in outdated infrastructure, introducing new technologies that improve security within State agencies, and developing new partnerships at the federal and local levels. While we constantly monitor and assess our cyber security capabilities, we will continue to be proactive and support our cyber security programs dedicated to the safety and security of all New Yorkers."
