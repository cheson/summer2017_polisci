Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today signed legislation that will require the public disclosure of teacher evaluation data. The new law will ensure that parents and the public have access to information about how the teachers, principals and schools charged with educating New York's children are performing, while also respecting educators' privacy.

"This law strikes the right balance between a teacher's right to privacy and the parents' and public's right to know," Governor Cuomo said. "New York's children deserve a top-quality education, and the state's new teacher evaluation system will ensure that teachers and principals are held responsible for student performance. I commend Majority Leader Skelos and Speaker Silver for their work to make sure we could protect our teachers' and principals' privacy, while also ensuring that parents and the public have access to the information they need."

Earlier this year, Governor Cuomo signed a law that strengthened the teacher and principal evaluation system in order to improve teaching and learning in New York's schools and hold educators accountable for improving student achievement.

The new law signed today by the Governor ensures that parents and the general public can assess how schools across New York are performing. The law requires school districts and BOCES to fully disclose their evaluation results to the public and require requires the State Education Department to post and make widely available important data that will allow the public to analyze and compare how schools are performing. School districts and BOCES will also be required to notify and fully disclose to parents and legal guardians the final specific ratings and composite evaluation scores of the teachers and principals to which their student is assigned
