"I join with all New Yorkers to celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

"Today, we honor a leader who dedicated his life to achieving peace and equality, who fought and sacrificed for the rights of all Americans, and who continues to inspire new generations to pursue justice throughout the world.

"Yet this day is more than just a day of national remembrance. Today is as much about how we reflect upon Dr. King as it is about how Dr. King would reflect upon us. On this day, we look at the state of our society as it is and we strive for the best that our society could be. In honor of Dr. King, we should recommit to hold ourselves up to the highest standard.

"We continue to face challenges in New York and across this nation, but when we remember Dr. King's legacy, we recognize that we have faced challenges before and that we have overcome them together. Progress comes when we realize that we all have a common purpose and a shared destiny, that, as Dr. King said, "whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."

"It is through our solemn reflection and renewed commitment that we honor Dr. King, further the causes that he championed, and carry on his dream."
