Governor Cuomo Announces $30 Million in Funding Available to Crime Victims' Assistance Programs Statewide
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 2, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that approximately $30 million in grant funding is available to benefit programs across New York State that provide direct services, including counseling and crisis intervention, advocacy and legal assistance to crime victims.
"Crime victims deserve more than our compassion -- they deserve action," Governor Cuomo said. "I'm proud New York was one of the first states in the country to provide compensation to crime victims. These funds will allow community-based organizations across the state to offer New Yorkers the immediate and long-term assistance they need to fully recover."
Crime victims' assistance programs can apply for the approximately $30 million through a competitive request for proposals that has been issued by the state's Office of Victim Services (OVS), the agency that oversees crime victims' compensation. Eighty percent of the funding for those grants comes from the federal Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Victim and Witness Assistance Grant Program, with the remainder from the state. No federal or state taxpayer dollars are used to fund the grants; funding comes from fines, fees and surcharges that are paid by certain offenders convicted in state or federal court.
