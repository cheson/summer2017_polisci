Location: Albany, NY

"This week, the Board of Regents took an important step by approving a vastly improved system to evaluate teachers and principals. The system we develop now will have a lasting effect for decades to come, and that is why I advocated for comprehensive changes.
"The Regents, led by Chancellor Merryl Tisch, should be commended for showing tremendous leadership on this issue and accepting the changes.
"Now parents across the State can be confident that the new evaluation system will improve the performance of our children."
