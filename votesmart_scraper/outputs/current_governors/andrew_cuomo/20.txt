Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Passage of Legislation to End Child Marriage in New York
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 8, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"It's shocking current law allows for children as young as 14 to be married off. This administration championed ending this intolerable practice and I commend the Assembly and the Senate for passing legislation that puts an end to child marriage in New York once and for all. This is a major step forward that will protect children, prevent forced marriages, and create a safer, more just, New York for all."
