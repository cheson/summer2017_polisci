Letter to Fellow New Yorker
Letter

Location: Albany, NY

Dear Fellow New Yorker,
The holidays are a time for celebration and family, but also a time to remember those who are less fortunate. As we enjoy the holiday season, let us not forget those among us who have suffered hardship this year.
Please join our statewide "NY Gives" campaign to provide gifts, home goods, and toys to communities most affected by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee.
Donations to support flood relief efforts are also encouraged, and 100% of all donations go directly to flood victims, with no administrative costs deducted.
New York's spirit of generosity knows no limits. Time and again, we have seen our state come together to overcome great challenges. This holiday season, I urge all New Yorkers to do what we have always done best: stand together and help our neighbors in need.
From my family to yours, I wish you a joyous holiday season and a safe and happy New Year.
Andrew M. Cuomo
Governor
