Location: Albany, NY

"The leadership of the Bethlehem Central School District has implemented a voluntary salary freeze for its top administrators. This is a responsible and sensible first step that recognizes the state's current fiscal condition and I encourage school districts across New York to find ways to reduce costs and put children first."
