Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that Soraa, an industry leader in ultra-high performance lighting and LED technologies, will relocate its global manufacturing and research and development operations from California and overseas to SUNY Polytechnic's Central New York Hub for Emerging Nano Industries. This move will create 420 new high tech jobs in Central New York and is being made possible thanks to a $90 million state investment for the facility's construction.
"Central New York's economic growth is due in large part to high-tech companies like Soraa that recognize the region's wealth of assets and resources," Governor Cuomo said. "Today's announcement not only means economic stability for the region, but it also strengthens Central New York as a leader in the development of the clean technology that will help light and power the future."
