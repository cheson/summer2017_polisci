Statement from Governor Cuomo on Women's Equality Day
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 26, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"New York is proud to be a leader in the fight for equal rights.
"From Seneca Falls to suffrage, the Empire State has long been at the forefront of the women's rights movement. Today, we are proud to uphold that legacy as we continue to strengthen and protect the rights of women with the passage of the Women's Equality Act and our Enough is Enough legislation to combat sexual assault and rape on college campuses.
"Nevertheless, our work to achieve equality is far from over. Discrimination against women still persists, and there is a great deal more to be done to achieve full equality for women.
"So as we mark Women's Equality Day and celebrate the accomplishments that have been made so far, we must also recommit ourselves to the work that remains."
