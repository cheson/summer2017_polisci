Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 30, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"For far too long, wages for tipped workers in New York State have been too low. Today the Wage Board has recommended a course that begins to rectify that, equalizing wages into a single tipped wage and recommending an increase to the highest-ever wage for all tipped workers. I thank the board members for their service to the State of New York and I look forward to action by the Commissioner of Labor on this important matter."
