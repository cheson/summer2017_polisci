Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today highlighted flood preparedness measures at New York State's emergency response headquarters in Alden, Erie County. The region is experiencing rising temperatures following days of record-setting snowfall, leading to a strong possibility of significant flooding. In anticipation of this scenario, Governor Cuomo has directed State agencies to take every precaution to protect residents and minimize damage to the impacted communities.
"With the possibility of flooding in areas already hit hard by major snowfall over the past few days, we have launched a massive deployment of emergency personnel and resources to Western New York," Governor Cuomo said. "We have mobilized resources from across the State -- including more than 500 National Guard members, hundreds of pumps and hundreds of thousands of sandbags -- and we are taking every precaution to keep these communities safe."
