"I am glad that Congress finally got its act together and passed a bill to help Puerto Rico relieve its debt obligations and put the island on the road to recovery. While the bill is not the exact one I would have passed, we must use the opportunity to chart out a sustainable economic future for Puerto Rico. New York is home to more Puerto Ricans than any other state in the country, and we will do whatever we can to continue providing assistance and support. I hope that President Obama will sign the bill into law and work with the Financial Control Board and the Government of Puerto Rico to help ensure the island's path back to prosperity."
