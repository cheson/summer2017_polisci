Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the launch of the Spending and Government Efficiency (SAGE) Commission's Web site to invite the public's participation in the process of modernizing and right-sizing state government, improving performance, increasing accountability and saving taxpayers' money.
The Web site, www.governor.ny.gov/sage, allows the public to suggest ways to improve the efficiency and quality of government services. The submissions will be an integral component to the reform process. The site will also include listings of the SAGE Commission's public meetings and materials from the Commission's first meeting on April 25.
"As I have said repeatedly, right-sizing government is essential to get the state back on the right track, but we can't do it alone ," Governor Cuomo said. "The future success of New York requires that we consolidate the sprawl of state entities, find efficiencies, and further improve the state's operations. As this is the people's government, the public must have a say in how it operates."
The Commission includes representatives from the private sector, labor and government. The Commission is co-Chaired by Antonio M. Perez, Chairman and C.E.O of Eastman Kodak Company and Paul Francis, the Director of Agency Redesign and Efficiency.
The SAGE Commission is conducting a comprehensive review of state government including its structures, operations and processes with the ultimate goal of saving taxpayers' money, increasing accountability and improving the delivery of government services. The Commission's final recommendations to the Governor will be delivered by June 1, 2012. Periodic progress reports will be delivered on an ongoing basis.
