Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that more than 85 New York State businesses have endorsed his proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15. Under the Governor's plan, New York State would adopt a phased-in $15 minimum wage in New York City by 2018 and 2021 in the rest of the state. The companies, comprised of both big and small businesses from the North Country to New York City, hailed the plan as an economic driver that would increase the standard of living for workers as well as stimulate demand for goods and services.
"Raising the minimum wage will help millions of New Yorkers and create stronger communities statewide," Governor Cuomo said. "Our $15 proposal helps restore dignity to hardworking people who have been left behind in this economy, and it will create a better environment for businesses overall. We believe in this state that a fair day's work should earn a fair day's pay, and we're going to lead the nation by enacting a $15 minimum wage this year."
