Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Fifth Anniversary of Hurricane Irene
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 26, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Five years ago, Hurricane Irene ravaged communities across New York, leaving a trail of destruction and immeasurable loss in its path. As terrible as Irene was, it brought out the best in New Yorkers as we came together to support one another, pick up the pieces and rebuild. In depths of despair, we showed the nation that New York's resolve and fighting spirit will always triumph in the face of adversity. We came together as one family and one community and we built back stronger and better than ever before.
"In the years that followed, we have hardened our infrastructure -- investing billions in improving the resiliency of New York's roads, bridges and tunnels. We have adopted a fundamentally new approach to community design, shifting commercial and residential clusters away from a revised flood plain, raising homes near waterways, and implementing advanced mitigation measures. Through this holistic approach, we have made New York a national leader in recovery and revitalization -- and we will continue to do everything in our power to prepare for the new normal of global climate change."
