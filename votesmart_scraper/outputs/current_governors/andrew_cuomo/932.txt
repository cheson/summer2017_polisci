Governor Cuomo Announces Latest Round of Rail Inspections
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 27, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the successful completion of another round of targeted crude oil tank car and rail inspections intended to improve public safety and reduce potential dangers associated with the transport of crude oil across New York State. Last week, state and federal teams examined 235 crude oil tank cars, approximately 195 miles of track and 72 switches as part of these inspections and uncovered and addressed six critical defects and 80 non-critical defects.
"This latest round of critical safety inspections shows that our process of identifying and addressing crude oil tank car and rail defects is making a difference by reducing the risk of potentially deadly accidents," Governor Cuomo said. "New York State will continue to enforce the highest safety standards for crude oil transport and provide peace of mind to New Yorkers who live, work or travel near these freight rail tracks."
