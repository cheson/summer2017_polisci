Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that New York State would contribute $1.5 million to help build a memorial to the 146 people who died in the historic Triangle Shirtwaist Fire in 1911 in Manhattan. The memorial will be affixed to the Greenwich Village building where the fire occurred, just off Washington Square Park and now used by New York University, to house biology and chemistry laboratories.
"The Triangle Shirtwaist Fire galvanized the labor movement in America and should never be forgotten," Governor Cuomo said. "New York State has always been a beacon for progressive government policies and while we honor the victims' legacy with this memorial, we must continue to improve workplace protections to ensure tragedies like this one are never repeated."
