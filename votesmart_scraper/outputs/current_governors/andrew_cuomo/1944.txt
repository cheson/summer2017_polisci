Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo - Yom Hashoah
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 27, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

As we commemorate Yom Hashoah and the Week of Remembrance, I join members of all faiths in remembering the more than six million victims who perished in the Holocaust. We honor their memories by teaching and practicing tolerance and inclusion towards people of all walks of life.

Let us redouble our efforts to see that our own communities are places where all people are welcome and free to express themselves and to live and worship in peace. Let this be our ultimate rebuttal to the hateful ideas that gave rise to the Holocaust. By internalizing this message of acceptance we will ensure that "never again" means never again.
