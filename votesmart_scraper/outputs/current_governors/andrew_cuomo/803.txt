Governor Cuomo Urges Preparations For Lake Effect Snow in Western and Central New York and the Mohawk Valley
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 17, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo urged residents in Western and Central New York and the Mohawk Valley to begin taking the necessary steps to prepare for freezing rain and drizzle tonight, which will transition to lake effect snow that will impact parts of those regions through Saturday evening.
The National Weather Service has issued Lake Effect Snow warnings, for Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, southern Erie and Wyoming counties in western New York, southern Jefferson, central and southern Lewis, northern and central Oswego counties in central New York and Oneida County in the Mohawk Valley. The forecast calls for storm totals of 8 to 15 inches of snow. Heavier snow bands in the Tug Hill Plateau could bring up to two to three feet of snow in some areas. Localized bands of heavy snow and gusty winds will make driving conditions dangerous due to slick roads, blowing snow, and low visibility.
"With snow and inclement weather on the horizon for parts of the state, New Yorkers in those communities should take the time now to prepare. Plan ahead for hazardous conditions, and, if you must travel, take your time on the roads," said Governor Cuomo. "My administration is actively monitoring the evolving forecasts, and we urge all New Yorkers to stay informed and use caution when traveling in order to have a safe and happy holiday season."
