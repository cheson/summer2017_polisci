Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on New York City's Bid to Host the 2016 Democratic National Convention
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 11, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"When it comes to hosting an event like the 2016 Democratic National Convention, there is simply no place quite like New York City. The Big Apple is an unparalleled destination with the infrastructure and amenities needed to support an event of this magnitude. Hosting the DNC would also be a significant boost to the regional economy, ultimately supporting jobs and economic activity in all five boroughs and beyond. As the selection committee continues evaluating the remaining proposals, I encourage them to envision just how successful a convention located in New York City would be."
