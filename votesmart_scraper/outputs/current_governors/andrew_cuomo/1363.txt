Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 14, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, President Obama granted a well-deserved honor to two New Yorkers who served their state and country with bravery during World War I. Sgt. Henry Johnson was an Albany native and a proud member of the 369th Infantry "Harlem Hell Fighters." He sustained multiple wounds in combat, and was even recognized by the French Army for his heroism. Sgt. William Shemin was a Bronx native and a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroic actions with the 4th Infantry Division. Both of these brave souls put the needs of our country before their own, and their example of valor and integrity lives on today. I am proud to see them awarded this long overdue and well deserved honor."
