Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the opening of Angry Orchard Cider Company's new Innovation Cider House, home to a small-batch cidery, tasting room, and hard cider research-and-development center. The cider house is located on Angry Orchard's 60-acre apple orchard in the village of Walden, Orange County.
"With hundreds of orchards growing amazing apples, it is not surprising that cideries are booming all across this state," Governor Cuomo said. "We welcome Angry Orchard to the Hudson Valley and wish them well as they join the extremely successful community of brewers, wine makers, distillers and cider producers that are creating world class products right here in New York."
