4th Proposal of Governor's 2016 Agenda: Grow the Economy and Strengthen Infrastructure in Communities Across New York State
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 5, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today unveiled the fourth signature proposal of his 2016 agenda: a series of investments and initiatives designed to continue growing the economy and building stronger, more vibrant communities across New York State. These proposals include significant tax relief for small businesses, increased funding to support municipal water infrastructure improvement projects, a new effort to revitalize and transform downtown areas in each region of the state, and a sixth round of the successful Regional Economic Development Council initiative. The Governor discussed these announcements -- which are a preview of signature policies from his upcoming 2016 agenda -- during an event today in Rochester.
"Over the past five years, we have redeveloped New York's economy and restored opportunity in communities across Upstate -- and now we are building on that momentum to make a difference that will last for generations," said Governor Cuomo. "We are going to make critical investments in infrastructure, cut taxes for small businesses, and invest in the regional approach to economic development that has made a difference across Upstate. Together we are going to continue moving this state forward."
