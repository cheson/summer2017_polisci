This evening, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo was presented with the "Champion for Working Families & Children" award by the Paid Family Leave Insurance Campaign of New York State. The Governor received the award at a victory celebration in Manhattan attended by a diverse coalition of advocates, business leaders and policy makers. In April, the Governor marked a major milestone in the fight for social and economic justice by signing the nation's strongest paid family leave into law.
Under New York's paid family leave plan, employees -- both men and women -- will be eligible for 12 weeks of leave when caring for an infant, a family member with a serious health condition or to relieve family pressures when someone is called to active military service. This program will be funded entirely through a nominal payroll deduction on employees, costing businesses -- both big and small -- nothing.
