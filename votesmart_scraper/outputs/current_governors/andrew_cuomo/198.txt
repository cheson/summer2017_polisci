Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 22, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"I learned this morning of the charges filed by the U.S. Attorney's office that include a former member of my administration. If the allegations are true, I am saddened and profoundly disappointed. I hold my administration to the highest level of integrity. I have zero tolerance for abuse of the public trust from anyone. If anything, a friend should be held to an even higher standard. Like my father before me, I believe public integrity is paramount. This sort of breach, if true, should be and will be punished.
"SUNY has rightly relieved Alain Kaloyeros from his duties and has suspended him without pay, effective immediately.
"This matter is now in the hands of the court, which is exactly where it belongs. My administration will continue to be fully cooperative in the matter as we have been since it began."
