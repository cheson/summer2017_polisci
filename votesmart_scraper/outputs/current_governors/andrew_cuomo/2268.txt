Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 30, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), at the request of the State of New York, has approved a 15-day extension to the Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) program beginning on September 1st. This new extension allows eligible survivors from Superstorm Sandy who cannot return to their homes to stay in participating hotels or motels.

The new checkout date for those in the TSA program is September 16, 2013. FEMA will call applicants eligible for the extension to notify them of the new checkout date.

"By extending the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program, we are continuing to secure an important resource for those victims of Superstorm Sandy that are still, after months, unable to return home," Governor Cuomo said. "This program provides vital assistance to those who are still feeling the terrible effects of the damage from the storm."

This is a short-term program that places families in hotels while they work toward a longer-term housing plan.
