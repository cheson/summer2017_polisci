Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $1.6 million in dam improvements at eight NY Works projects that will help control flooding and make New York State more resilient to storms.

"Through the NY Works program, we are making critical investments to create jobs and build a stronger and more resilient New York," Governor Cuomo said. "These projects will overhaul existing dams across the State, helping to control water levels, prevent flooding and ultimately ensure safer communities."

The projects, undertaken in regions across the state, include two work orders awarded by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and the State Office of General Services (OGS) and six work orders awarded by DEC and the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY).

Specific work includes: raising the height of some dams to increase storm water storage capacity, reinforcing and regrading embankments, installing rip rap to control erosion, expanding piping and adding or repairing outlet valves.

DEC Commissioner Joe Martens said, "Governor Cuomo's NY Works program provides funding for critical projects to upgrade New York's dams and flood control infrastructure to protect communities across the state. As these projects demonstrate, vital work is being done to improve the integrity of dams and enhance flood control to help make New York State and its communities more resilient to storms."
