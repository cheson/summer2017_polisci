Governor Cuomo announced that New York State is helping municipalities strengthen their water infrastructure through more than $114 million in zero and low-interest loans. These loans will support improvements at 16 wastewater facilities and four drinking water systems. Six of these projects will also make facilities and systems more resilient in the face of extreme weather.
"From Hurricane Irene to Superstorm Sandy and beyond, our state has felt the new reality of extreme weather -- and it is crucial that we strengthen our infrastructure to meet the challenges of the future," Governor Cuomo said. "With this funding, we are helping local government prepare for the next major storm through vital infrastructure projects that protect both New York's residents and water supplies."
