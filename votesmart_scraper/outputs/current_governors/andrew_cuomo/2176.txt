Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 11, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Throughout our state's history, New Yorkers have always answered the call of service and today we honor the more than 900,000 veterans who call New York home. From defending our nation abroad, to protecting our citizens here at home, the men and women of the armed services are America's heroes. On this and every Veterans Day we pause to salute their sacrifice and courage. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my sincerest thanks to our veterans, their families, and the service members who are deployed and in units preparing to deploy from New York in the upcoming year. Their selfless service has earned our deepest gratitude."
