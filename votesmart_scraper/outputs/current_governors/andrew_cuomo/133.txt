LEADING THE WAY TO COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY
It's time to make college tuition-free for middle class New Yorkers.
Higher education is a necessity to succeed in today's global economy.
Governor Cuomo is taking the lead on alleviating the burden of student debt. New York's tuition-free degree program, the Excelsior Scholarship, is the first-of-its-kind in the nation and will enable thousands of bright, young students to realize their dream of higher education.
Under this groundbreaking proposal, more than 940,000 middle-class families and individuals making up to $125,000 per year would qualify to attend college tuition-free at all public universities in New York State.
Let's make college a reality, not a dream for New York's middle class.
