Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 1, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Tonight, both houses of the Legislature have successfully passed the 2015-16 Budget spending plan to allow for the continued operation of government. This is a plan that keeps spending under two percent, reforms New York's education bureaucracy, implements the nation's strongest and most comprehensive disclosure laws for public officials and makes the largest investment in the Upstate economy in a generation.
"This is a Budget that every New Yorker can be proud of, and I look forward to continuing to work to move New York forward this legislative session and beyond."
