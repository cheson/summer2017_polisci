Statement

"Eric Garner was a husband, father and member of the New York family.
"The circumstances surrounding his death were nothing short of tragic. And while there will be people who disagree with today's grand jury decision, it is important that we respect the legal process and rule of law. At the same time, the justice system also allows for additional investigations and reviews, and it may be appropriate for the federal government to do so in this case. And if there are improvements to be made and lessons to be learned, we at the state level are ready to act to better the system.
"I stand with the Garner family and urge those wishing to voice their opposition to today's ruling to do so peacefully.
"My thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Garner's family and friends as they continue to grieve during this difficult time."
