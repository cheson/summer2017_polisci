New York has been a national leader in protecting and advancing individual rights and safeguarding the future of its citizens. To remain so, we must protect a woman's right to choose, achieve marriage equality, enact tough anti-discrimination laws, truly regulate Wall Street, attract the best and the brightest to government, leave our children a cleaner and greener world, and continue to oppose the death penalty.
