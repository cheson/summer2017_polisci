Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 2, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the launch of a clean energy competition for colleges and universities in New York State. The competition will challenge student-led coalitions across the state to develop creative ideas to aggressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions on school campuses and beyond. The three groups that propose the best ideas to invest in clean energy will each win $1 million to help implement their plans.
"Our State's college students have a pivotal role to play in building a cleaner and more energy-efficient future -- and with these awards, we hope to inspire the next generation to change the world," Governor Cuomo said. "Climate change has become one of the most defining issues of our time, and we must act now to address it. I encourage students across our state to dream big, and help New York continue to be a leader in changing the way we think about energy and the environment."
