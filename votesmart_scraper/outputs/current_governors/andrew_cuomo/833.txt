Date: Dec. 8, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that New York State Homes and Community Renewal has awarded nearly $11.3 million in funding for the construction of three affordable housing developments across New York. Together, these shovel-ready projects will create a total of 133 new apartments for low- to moderate-income households in Monroe, Tompkins and Westchester Counties.
"Today we are continuing our commitment to build quality, affordable homes and create vibrant communities throughout the state," Governor Cuomo said. "The Early Award process cuts through bureaucratic red tape and gets shovels in the ground quickly, so that families looking for affordable homes are not left waiting in the wind."
