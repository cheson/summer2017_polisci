Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 11, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today deployed New York State assets to Massachusetts to assist the state in its cleanup efforts following the historic snowfall in the region over the last several weeks. More than 60 personnel and 71 pieces of heavy equipment, including front end loaders, dump trucks and skid steers, left New York this morning and will begin operations immediately upon arrival. New York joins surrounding states in this effort including Vermont, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
"In times of adversity, neighbors help neighbors," Governor Cuomo said. "At Governor Baker's request, we are sending resources to assist in cleanup efforts in Massachusetts, just as they have done for New York in the past. We remain committed to helping them in the wakes of these storms."
New York State received a request from the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency for mutual assistance on Monday evening. The equipment departed New York on Wednesday at 8 a.m. for the City of Worcester and a staging area at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford. The deployment will last 7 days.
The New York State Office of Emergency Management coordinated with the NYS Thruway Authority and Department of Transportation to deploy the following resources:
66 personnel
18 loaders
19 dump trucks
15 skid steers
17 tractor trailers
2 pickup trucks
New York's assistance during this storm follows a long tradition of Northeastern states helping one another in times of need. Neighboring states have recently and repeatedly offered equipment and personnel to New York, including during Superstorm Sandy and last November's historic snowfall in Buffalo.
