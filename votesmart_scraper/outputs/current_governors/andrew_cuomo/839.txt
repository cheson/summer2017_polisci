Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 7, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the completion of Homesteads on Ampersand in the Town of Plattsburgh. The $14.3 million project is the first planned transit-oriented affordable housing development in Clinton County, offering easy access to public transportation and within a short walk to shopping, services, and SUNY Plattsburgh. The development is part of the Governor's $1 billion House NY program, the largest investment in New York State's affordable housing stock in at least 15 years. House NY is on target to create or preserve 14,300 affordable units by 2018.
"Every New Yorker deserves a safe, affordable and decent place to call home," Governor Cuomo said. "The completion of Homesteads on Ampersand is another example of the real progress we have made in generating opportunity for those in need through the House NY initiative and I am proud to see this project completed."
