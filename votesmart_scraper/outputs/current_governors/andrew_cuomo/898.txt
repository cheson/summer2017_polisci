Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 9, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the creation of a working group of industry leaders to recommend revisions to New York State's Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws. The group, which is a direct result of the 3rd Wine, Beer, Spirits and Cider Summit, will review existing statutory provisions and explore approaches to clarify and modernize the 80-year-old statute.
"This administration has worked hard to cut red tape and break down bureaucratic barriers in order to help this state's burgeoning craft wine, beer, spirit and cider producers thrive and create jobs," Governor Cuomo said. "This working group will help continue these efforts, providing both perspective and first-hand experience on how to bring our laws into the modern era and further aid in the growth of this great New York industry."
