Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on One Year Since Sandy Hook Elementary School Tragedy
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 14, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Today marks one year since the day this nation lost 26 innocent lives, when 20 children and six teachers became the victims of senseless gun violence at Sandy Hook elementary school. On this difficult day, the families and friends who lost loved ones at Newtown are in the prayers and thoughts of New Yorkers.

The tragic shooting at Sandy Hook was a horrific wake-up call that we must act on the issue of gun violence before another child's future is wiped away. All across the country, elected officials, parents and community leaders stood up together to call on their State and Federal governments to pass stronger laws that protect our neighborhoods from dangerous weapons. Here in New York, we passed the NY SAFE Act, comprised of common sense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of the dangerously mentally ill, ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines, and raise the penalty for killing a first responder on duty.

New York is proud to be home to some of the strongest gun laws in the nation. There is no better way to honor the memories of those we lost at Newtown than to make sure they did not die in vain and work together to pass long overdue gun laws to make this whole country safer. As Washington D.C. remains at a standstill on this issue, I urge our representatives in Congress to reach across the aisle and act now because we cannot have another tragedy like Sandy Hook."
