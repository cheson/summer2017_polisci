Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Moody's Revising New York's Outlook to Positive
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 22, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's action by Moody's Investors Service to revise our State's outlook from stable to positive is another strong affirmation of the progress we have made to put New York's fiscal house in order. After years of late budgets and legislative gridlock, we have been able to show that New York State is working again and confidence in government is being restored. Since taking office, my administration has delivered three on-time and balanced budgets, controlled government spending, and cut taxes for the middle class to their lowest levels in 60 years. New York has gained over 300,000 private sector jobs with more being added every day, and this momentum is leading us to fiscal stability and economic prosperity."
