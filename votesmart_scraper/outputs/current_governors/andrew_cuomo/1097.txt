Governor Cuomo Warns New York's College Students About the Dangers of Buying False Identification Documents on the Internet
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 26, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo issued a warning to college students returning for the fall semester that purchasing fake IDs is not only illegal, but also increases the chance of becoming a victim of identify fraud. In recent years, investigators from the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles have found dozens of examples of underage license holders becoming victims of identity theft after purchasing fraudulent identification online from overseas companies.
"The ripple effects of identity theft can last for years and more and more college students are opening themselves up to fraudsters by attempting to purchase a fake ID from the Internet," Governor Cuomo said. "Our message is simple: It's just not worth it -- both for the immediate consequences of getting caught with a fake ID and for putting their financial future at risk."
