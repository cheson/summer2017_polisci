By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 3, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"This evening, members of the Jewish community throughout New York will commence the observance of Yom Kippur, the most sacred day of the year on the Jewish calendar. Yom Kippur is a day of fasting, prayer, and atonement that brings to a close the High Holy Days. During this period of reflection, it is my hope that we can recommit to creating a more secure and peaceful future for all. To those observing, I extend warm wishes for a meaningful day and an easy fast. Gmar Chatima Tova."
