"I commend NASCAR for making a five year commitment to racing at Watkins Glen International. WGI has been a pillar of professional racing for decades and a major economic engine for Schuyler County that attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year and supports 2,000 permanent jobs. This decision is great news for racing fans and other New Yorkers alike, and I look forward to seeing the track play a central role in racing for years to come."
