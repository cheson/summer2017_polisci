Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the release of proposed regulations to limit spending for administrative costs and executive compensation at state-funded not-for-profit and for-profit service providers.

The proposed regulations are designed to implement Executive Order 38, issued by Governor Cuomo in January 2012 to limit excessive compensation and administrative expenses at service providers that receive state funds or state-authorized payments of federal funds.

When unveiling the 2012-2013 Executive Budget, Governor Cuomo highlighted cases of extreme compensation levels at not-for-profits that receive millions in taxpayer dollars. In one case, a provider receiving $19 million annually in public funds -- 99% of its annual budget -- had $3 million in administrative costs and paid its CEO more than $2.2 million in addition to $1 million in shareholder options.

"These regulations are designed to ensure that New York taxpayers are protected and the public's money is spent efficiently and effectively," Governor Cuomo said. "Our providers of services in New York State are the finest in the nation. To ensure public confidence in those hard-working providers that play by the rules, these regulations will allow the state government to identify and stop the few providers that pocket taxpayer dollars rather than use them to serve the public."¬ù

The proposed regulations cover providers that receive more than $500,000 in state support each year and receive at least 30% of their annual funding from the state.
Executive Compensation:

The proposed regulations block providers from spending more than $199,000 in state funds for the compensation of an executive. If a provider chooses to pay an executive more than $199,000 from other sources, the provider must keep compensation below the top 25 percent in the field, as determined by a compensation survey identified or recognized by the applicable state agency. Providers that pay an executive more than $199,000 must have the compensation approved by its board of directors, including at least two independent directors and must have performed a review of comparability data. In cases where competitive imperatives or the complexity of a provider's operations require compensation that exceeds the limits and in other instances, providers may apply for a waiver.
