Date: Aug. 10, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the state's multi-agency deployment is continuing to test for Legionella and canvass additional locations in the Bronx. Efforts over the past two days resulted in more than 500 building sites being canvassed. The State Mobile Command Center is open at Hostos Community College to lead the effort, and expanded outreach and testing efforts are taking place throughout the borough. Teams led by the State Department of Health will be focusing on high impact areas and providing information on Legionnaires' disease to members of the public as well as surveying additional buildings for cooling towers. Teams led by the New York State Office of Emergency Management and the Office of Fire Prevention and Control will be taking samples from cooling tower sites.
"We are taking every precaution to prevent the spread of Legionnaires' Disease," Governor Cuomo said. "This outbreak has been a source of great concern for people throughout the Bronx and the rest of New York City, but residents should know that we are doing everything necessary to protect the public health. The state is working closely with our federal and local partners, and together we will keep New Yorkers safe."
