Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the state's first-ever "Women's Building" will be developed to unite more than a dozen women-focused organizations, empowering generations of women to come. The former Bayview Correctional Facility, a 100,000 square-foot space in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, will be renovated by the NoVo Foundation and Goren Group to include dedicated working space for women-centric community service organizations, as well as a restaurant, art gallery, and additional office space for technology and innovation tenants. The Women's Building will create more than 300 new jobs and generate an estimated $43 million in annual economic activity.
"Today we are continuing our efforts to shatter the glass ceiling by taking down an institution of defeat and turning it into opportunity and social reform for women," Governor Cuomo said. "The Women's Building is an example of our strength and leadership as the capital of progressivism in this nation -- and when other states and look to New York, they will see yet another symbol of a community coming together to enhance the future and potential of its people."
