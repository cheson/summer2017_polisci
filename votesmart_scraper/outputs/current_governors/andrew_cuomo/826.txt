Governor Cuomo announced that $2.25 billion in economic and community development funding has been awarded through Round V of the Regional Economic Development Council initiative and the Upstate Revitalization Initiative. The Governor also announced that the four Upstate regions not selected as "URI Best Plan Awardees" will receive an additional $50 million to fund priority projects and further implement the regions' strategic plans for economic growth.
Governor Cuomo said: "Over the past five years, the Regional Councils have become an integral part of generating economic opportunity in communities statewide. By removing barriers to growth, controlling spending and cutting taxes, we have laid the groundwork for our Regional Councils to pursue projects in key industries that have turned their communities into local economic engines. This year's round of awards demonstrates the progress that has been made in changing the trajectory of our economy and continues our commitment to investing in the future of New York State."
