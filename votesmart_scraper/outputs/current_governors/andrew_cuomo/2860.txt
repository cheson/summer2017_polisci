Governor Cuomo Vetoes Bill To Extend Task Force On Retired Race Horses
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 21, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today vetoed a bill that would have extended the Task Force on Retired Race Horses, continuing his work to cut down on needless government bureaucracy and protect taxpayer dollars.
Established in 2005, the purpose of the Task Force was to address the future of retired race horses and make findings and recommendations to develop and promote their use and well-being. The Task Force's report was originally due in 2006. This deadline has subsequently been extended several times and the Task Force is now due to complete its work on or before December 31, 2011. This bill would have extended the life of the Task Force for two more years.
In his veto message, Governor Cuomo said, "Upon taking office, I pledged to New Yorkers that it was a new day in Albany. I promised that the days of the needless proliferation of government bureaucracy were over. Approving this bill -- for which there exists no compelling reason -- would be contrary to my pledge to the people of this State."
