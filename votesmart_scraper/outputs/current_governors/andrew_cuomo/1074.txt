Governor Cuomo Announces Suspension of Construction-Related Lane Closures During Labor Day Weekend
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 3, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today announced that temporary lane closures associated with road and bridge construction projects on New York State highways will be lifted from 6 a.m. on Friday, September 4, to 6 a.m. on Tuesday, September 8, in order to accommodate travelers during the Labor Day holiday weekend. Some work may continue behind permanent concrete barriers or for emergency repairs.
"This action puts drivers first and will help New Yorkers get to where they are going faster and with less aggravation during this busy Labor Day weekend," Governor Cuomo said. "I encourage everyone to stay safe, keep your eyes on the road and enjoy the holiday."
The prohibition of non-essential lane closures is in keeping with Governor Cuomo's Drivers First program, which prioritizes the convenience of motorists to minimize traffic congestion and travel delays due to road and bridge work.
AAA predicts that more than 35.5 million people will travel more than 50 miles from home this weekend, up slightly from last year. This weekend is expected to have the highest travel volume since 2008.
