"Christmas is a time for us to gather with our family and friends, appreciate the blessings in our lives and celebrate the spirit of the season.
"This holiday week is also an opportunity for us to pause and reflect on the Christmas message of peace, love and hope for the world around us. New York is strongest when everyone joins together, and this holiday I ask all New Yorkers to join me in pausing to remember NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos and offer support to their families any way we can.
"I encourage all New Yorkers to give back to communities in need across the Empire State, and keep in our thoughts the brave men and women who protect and serve our communities every day.
"From my family to yours, Merry Christmas."
