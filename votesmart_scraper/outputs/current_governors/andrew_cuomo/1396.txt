"The shooting of Officer Brian Moore over the weekend was a deplorable act of violence that has robbed New York of one of its finest. As a member of the NYPD, Officer Moore put the safety of his fellow New Yorkers before his own, and we will remember his service with gratitude and pride. I join with all New Yorkers in mourning his passing and send my deepest condolences to his friends and family."
