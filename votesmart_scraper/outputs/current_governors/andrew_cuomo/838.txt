Governor Cuomo Announces Latest Round of Rail Inspections
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 7, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the successful completion of another round of targeted crude oil tank car and rail inspections intended to improve public safety and reduce potential dangers associated with the transport of fossil fuels across New York. Last week, state and federal teams examined 541 crude oil tank cars, approximately 207 miles of track, and 80 switches. The inquiry uncovered four critical defects and 38 non-critical defects, which inspection teams took immediate action to correct and repair.
"Inspections of crude oil tank cars and the rail tracks they travel along are essential to maintaining the public safety and protecting all New Yorkers," Governor Cuomo said. "We will continue to work with our partners at the state and federal level to strengthen rail safety standards, increase response times and improve emergency preparedness."
