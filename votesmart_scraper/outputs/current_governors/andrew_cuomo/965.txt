Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the launch of Coaches Care, a new initiative aimed at educating teens about safe driving by encouraging coaches to openly discuss the issue with student athletes. The program's kick-off coincides with National Teen Driver Safety Week, a nationwide effort to raise awareness about keeping young adults safe on the roads, which runs from October 18-24.
"Coaches can have a significant and lasting impact on young adults, so we're enlisting their help to encourage teenagers to always drive responsibly," Governor Cuomo said. "Proper driving habits can make all the difference when it comes to preventing unnecessary tragedies. I encourage all schools and coaches to join us in this effort to keep everyone safe on the roads."
