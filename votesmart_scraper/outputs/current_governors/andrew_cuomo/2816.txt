Statement from Governor Cuomo Regarding LIPA
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 2, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"Hurricane Irene caused the greatest number of power outages on Long Island -- 523,000 outages at peak -- since Hurricane Gloria in 1985. While this response has been better than Gloria, it's not good enough. Today, tens of thousands of Long Islanders are still in the dark. I have also received numerous complaints about poor communication to LIPA's customers during the restoration effort. In the short term, National Grid and LIPA must do everything they can to restore power to the remaining customers without service and review how to more quickly restore service the next time a storm hits. In the long term, I will advise the LIPA trustees to consider this experience, and the utility's past performance responding to major storms, when National Grid seeks to renew its contract with LIPA. In short, if National Grid hopes to renew its contract, they better get the power on now."
