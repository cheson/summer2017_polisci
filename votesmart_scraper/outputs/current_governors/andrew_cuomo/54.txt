Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Regarding Anti-Drunk & Impaired Driving Protections Being Upheld by the Court of Appeals
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 9, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"The safety of New Yorkers is our top priority and this administration has zero tolerance for chronic drunk and impaired drivers whose reckless actions put themselves and others at risk.
"In 2012, we took action and put into place tough new regulations that denied licenses to the most dangerous drivers, with multiple impaired driving convictions -- keeping them away from the wheel and off our roadways.
"Today, the Court of Appeals upheld these important and groundbreaking standards, which have resulted in more than 13,600 relicensing application denials for these dangerous drivers.
"This unanimous and unequivocal ruling affirms this policy, which will help us continue our work to protect New Yorkers and prevent avoidable tragedies once and for all."
