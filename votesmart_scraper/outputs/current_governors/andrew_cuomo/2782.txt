Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Arrests Regarding LIRR Pensions
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 27, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"During my tenure as Attorney General, we investigated and, exactly three years ago today, held hearings that revealed systemic abuse of the federal railroad pension system involving LIRR workers in a practice we termed 'disability by appointment.'
These arrests continue to show that we have zero tolerance for waste and fraud when it comes to pension systems.
I want to thank U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and his team for pursuing this case and seeking these arrests."
