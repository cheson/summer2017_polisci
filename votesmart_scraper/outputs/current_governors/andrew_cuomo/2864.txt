Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today held a Cabinet meeting to outline the second phase in his plan to build a new New York. Phase I, which lasted through the legislative session, focused on improving government performance, restoring the public's trust in Albany, and laying an economic foundation for recovery. In Phase II, programs to redesign government will be combined with economic development initiatives to put people back to work and make the state function better for all New Yorkers.
"During my campaign and throughout my first six months in office, I repeatedly said that Albany must start performing better for the people of New York," Governor Cuomo said. "We have made great progress, but there is still a long way to go. It is essential that we build on the momentum, fix state government, and create jobs for New Yorkers across the state."
Phase I of Governor Cuomo's plan to build a new New York began at the State of the State in January, continued through the budget process, and ended with the close of the legislative session in June. This phase consisted of returning performance to government, earning back the trust of New Yorkers, and getting the state's financial house in order. In this period, among other accomplishments, the Governor:
* Closed a $10 billion deficit with no new taxes
* Passed a property tax cap
* Enacted tough ethics reform
* Passed a Power NY program
* Passed a SUNY2020 bill
* Extended and expanded rent regulations
* Reached historic agreements with labor
* Passed the Marriage Equality law
