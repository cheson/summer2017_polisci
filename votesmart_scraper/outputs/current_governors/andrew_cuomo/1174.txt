Dozens of Babies, Toddlers, and Young Children are Injured or Killed Each Year after Being Left in Hot Vehicles
Governor Cuomo reminded parents and caregivers to "look before you lock" and remain aware of the dangers of leaving children in hot vehicles this summer. As part of National Heatstroke Prevention Day, the Governor and several New York State agencies are raising awareness about the deadly consequences of leaving babies, toddlers, and young kids in cars, and encouraging all New Yorkers to play a role in keeping children safe from heatstroke.
"Warm temperatures and children in parked cars can be a deadly combination and has caused far too many preventable tragedies in New York," Governor Cuomo said. "As outside temperatures continue to rise, we are urging New Yorkers to take extra precautions and remain aware and alert so we can keep our children safe and out of harm's way."
