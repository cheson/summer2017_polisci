Governor Cuomo Launches Immigrant Entrepreneurship Training Series
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 8, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today launched the Immigrant Entrepreneurship Training Series to help immigrants across New York State start and grow businesses. More than 100 immigrant entrepreneurship seminars will be held throughout New York State in the coming year, with the first series beginning this month.
"This training program will help immigrants throughout the State open and lead thriving businesses that in turn create jobs," Governor Cuomo said. "Immigrants have long been the backbone of New York's economic success, and today we stand proud to lend a hand to those working to improve their communities and build a better life for their families."
The Immigrant Entrepreneurship Training Series is run jointly by the New York State Office for New Americans, Empire State Development (ESD) and the New York State Small Business Development Centers (SBDC). These unique "on-ramping" courses will provide budding and current immigrant entrepreneurs an overview of starting, running and growing a business. Participants will be assessed as to their level of business knowledge at the end of the seminar. Based on their knowledge, experience and standing in the business start-up and growth process, participants are offered follow-up one-on-one business coaching sessions or a more intensive multi-week course. At the end of either track, individuals will have completed a business plan or portfolio and gain access to various federal, state and private small business loan programs.
