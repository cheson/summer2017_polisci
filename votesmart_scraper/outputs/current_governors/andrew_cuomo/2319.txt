Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on U.S. Supreme Court's Decisions
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 26, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's decisions by the Court are groundbreaking civil rights victories for the LGBT community and a major step forward in our efforts to achieve full marriage equality in this nation.

"Two years ago, New York became the largest state to enact marriage equality, and since then we have seen a growing recognition across the country that all citizens deserve equal rights under the law, regardless of sexual orientation.

"From the Stonewall Riots 44 years ago this week, to the passage of marriage equality in New York, to today's decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act that originated from a case brought by a New York resident, this state has been at the forefront of this movement.

"It is my hope that today's breakthrough decisions will propel our nation forward and finally allow all Americans to be granted the same rights and protections under the law."
