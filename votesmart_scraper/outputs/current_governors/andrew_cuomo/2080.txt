Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the Citizen Preparedness Corps Training Program will take place on Saturday, February 8 in Oneida County. The program, highlighted in Governor Cuomo's State of the State Address last month and launched last week, aims to provide approximately 100,000 New Yorkers with the tools and resources to prepare for emergencies and disasters, respond accordingly, and recover as quickly as possible to pre-disaster conditions.

"Severe weather events are becoming more frequent and extreme and we need to make sure that our communities are safe, prepared and trained to respond," said Governor Cuomo. "The Citizen Preparedness Corps Training Program will train approximately 100,000 citizens to help provide crucial and critical assistance in their own homes or in their own communities whenever disaster strikes."
