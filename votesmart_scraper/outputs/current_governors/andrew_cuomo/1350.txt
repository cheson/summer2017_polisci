Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced new initiatives to streamline regulatory burdens currently placed on farmers in New York. The first-ever Strategic Interagency Task Force on Lessening Obstacles to Agriculture identified new opportunities for improving the regulations for pesticide registration and certification without compromising current environmental protections. Additional regulatory changes for the benefit of New York agriculture as a result of the Task Force will be rolled out in the coming weeks.
"This administration remains committed to supporting farmers and cutting red tape to make it easier for agricultural businesses to grow and thrive in New York," Governor Cuomo said. "Through this task force, we are implementing commonsense solutions that will improve business for our farmers and maintain this state's strong commitment to protecting the environment."
The Task Force is comprised of leadership from state government and representatives from the agriculture industry. It met five times during 2014, working together to develop recommendations to streamline the regulatory process for the state's robust agricultural economy to grow.
