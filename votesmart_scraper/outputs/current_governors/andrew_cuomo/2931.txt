Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 19, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today named members of the Spending and Government Efficiency (SAGE) Commission to modernize and right-size state government, improve performance, increase accountability and save taxpayers' money.
The Governor proposed SAGE in January and it was recently passed in the state budget. SAGE is the first major redesign of state government since Governor Alfred E. Smith in 1927.
Governor Cuomo named Antonio M. Perez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Eastman Kodak Company, to serve as Co-Chair of SAGE with Paul Francis, the Director of Agency Redesign and Efficiency.
"For decades, our state government has ballooned, evolving into the sprawling and inefficient bureaucracy we have today," Governor Cuomo said. "It is time to consolidate the web of state agencies, authorities, and commissions that have overlapping functions and missions and to make the remaining ones perform better and more efficiently. Antonio's business acumen and experience with best practices in the private sector will help us create a leaner state government that performs better for the people of New York."
Antonio M. Perez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Eastman Kodak Company said, "Improving the performance of state government has been one of Governor Cuomo's highest priorities, and I am honored to be part of the team that will make it a reality. Kodak began in New York, and continues to be headquartered in Rochester. We are transforming our company as we adapt to a new digital world. New York State government must also adapt to reflect current fiscal realities and take advantage of new technologies and ways of operating so that it can efficiently and effectively provide critical government services."
Governor Cuomo's administration is working with SUNY's Rockefeller Institute, which had received a grant for this purpose from the Rockefeller Foundation, and management consultants from McKinsey & Co. to redesign state government.
"I want to thank the Rockefeller Foundation and its President Judith Rodin, as well as our own Rockefeller Institute, for their generous support of this important effort," Governor Cuomo continued.
The SAGE Commission will conduct a comprehensive review of state government including its structures, operations and processes, with the ultimate goal of saving taxpayers' money, increasing accountability and improving the delivery of government services. The Commission's final recommendations to the Governor will be delivered by June 1, 2012. Periodic progress reports will be delivered on an ongoing basis.
With the passage of the 2011-2012 budget, the state has already begun the process of consolidating a number of state agencies, including:
* Merging Correctional Services and Parole to create the new Department of Corrections and Community Supervision
