Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the winners of the 2015 Governor's Cup wine competition. At an award ceremony held today in Canandaigua, Ontario County, Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul presented the 2015 Governor's Cup to Ventosa Vineyards from Geneva, NY for their 2011 Lemberger, Estate Grown. This ceremony followed the State's first-ever Taste NY Culinary Tour, which provided more than a dozen of the region's leading chefs and restaurateurs with a first-hand look at the quality and diversity of New York agriculture in the region.
"New York's wine and agricultural industries are among the best in the world, and when people get a taste of what they've been missing, they'll be sure to come back for more," said Governor Cuomo. "From the prestigious New York Wine & Food Classic to the first-ever Taste NY Culinary Tour, we are showcasing all that the Empire State has to offer. I am happy to congratulate the winners of today's Governor's Cup, and I encourage all New Yorkers to sample some of our state's best food and beverages. You won't be disappointed."
Lieutenant Governor Hochul said, "The Governor's Wine Cup Competition further illustrates Governor Cuomo's strong commitment to promoting and elevating the critically important wine industry in New York State. Today's winners represent New York's finest and further prove that our state's designation as one of the top wine regions in the world is a well-deserved honor."
