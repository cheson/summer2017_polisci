Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 20, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the New Farmers Grant Fund will provide more than $610,000 in grants to help support new and early-stage agricultural businesses across New York state. The fund, enacted in the 2014-2015 budget, will be used to assist early-stage farmers and encourage them to consider farming as a career, adding to the continued growth of New York's agricultural sector. This funding will allow these farmers to employ the use of innovative agricultural techniques on commercial farm operations throughout the state.
"Agriculture remains a vital part of this state's economy and today we are taking yet another step in developing the next generation of New York's farmers," Governor Cuomo said. "With this investment, we are creating opportunities for early-stage farmers that will increase future productivity on all farms and create long-term agricultural growth across New York State."
Empire State Development, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Markets, is administering the Fund and has received more than 100 applications for the program. Projects were scored competitively based on specific criteria, including demonstration of project readiness. Grant funds will be used for project costs associated with the expansion of production, construction of farm buildings, purchase of equipment and seed, or upgrades to increase efficiency and boost production.
