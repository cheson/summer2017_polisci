Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the start of construction on a $10.7 million supportive housing development for veterans in the Town of Canandaigua.

"These brave men and women defended our nation, and helping to ensure they have a safe, affordable and decent place to call home is one small way to thank them for their service," Governor Cuomo said. "I am proud to help create this housing for New York veterans in need and thank our local partners for this very important project."
