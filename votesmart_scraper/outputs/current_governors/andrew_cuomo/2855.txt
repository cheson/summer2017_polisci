Letter to New Yorkers: New York is Open for Business in the Mid-Hudson Region
Letter
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 27, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

From Long Island Sound up through the Hudson Valley, to the Adirondacks and west beyond the Finger Lakes, New York state comprises distinct regions that enjoy unique economic strengths and face individual challenges. Yet for too long, the state has imposed economic development plans that haven't offered the flexibility for regions to make their own decisions about their future.
No one knows their regions better than the people who live there and today, Governor Cuomo has taken a new approach by launching Regional Economic Development Councils, including one in the Mid-Hudson Region.
The Regional Councils represent a fundamental change in the state's approach to economic development, empowering specific areas like the Mid-Hudson Region to better support job creation and send a clear message that New York is once again open for business.
The state will work with the Regional Councils to eliminate unnecessary barriers to job creation, and streamline the delivery of government services and funds to help the Councils carry out their plans for development.
