Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today introduced a comprehensive package of legislation and new regulations to protect workers in the nail salon industry. This complements the work of the Governor's multi-agency task force, which has enforcement teams in the field to recover stolen wages and shut down the industry's worst offenders. Additionally, the Governor is launching a public education and outreach campaign to help workers understand their rights and ensure that business owners live up to their responsibilities and obligations under the law.
"Our point is simple: exploitation has no place in the state of New York," Governor Cuomo said. "The rights of nail salon employees must be respected, and we are launching an aggressive crackdown on the industry to make sure that happens. With new legislation and emergency regulations, a public outreach campaign in multiple languages, and a thorough investigation of the chemicals that are used, we are standing up for those who have been unable to stand up for themselves. Today New York State is sending the message loud and clear: we will not tolerate abusive or unsafe working conditions - period."
Today's announcement comes just days after Governor Cuomo announced his multi-agency Task Force to quickly correct and prevent unlawful practices and unsafe working conditions in the nail salon industry.
