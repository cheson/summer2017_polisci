Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

"Earlier today, across Israel, three terrorist attacks injured multiple people and resulted in the death of two more innocents. This is the latest in a senseless spree of terror that has shaken the people of Israel and claimed the lives of numerous civilians in recent weeks -- and the violence must stop. I have said many times before that friends stand together in times of crisis, and this remains true today. As we continue to pray for peace, my thoughts and prayers are with the people of Israel, especially those most affected during this troubling time."
