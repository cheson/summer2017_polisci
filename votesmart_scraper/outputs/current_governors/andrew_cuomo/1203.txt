Governor Cuomo Directs Flags to Half-Staff
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 21, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo has directed that flags on state government buildings be flown at half-staff beginning Wednesday, July 22, 2015 in honor of the victims of last week's shooting at the Navy Operational Support Center in Chattanooga, TN. Flags will remain at half-staff until sunset on Saturday, July 25, 2015.
"Last week's horrific shooting in Chattanooga claimed the lives of some of our nation's bravest young men," Governor Cuomo said. "While nothing can replace the lives that were lost, we will be neither defined nor divided by this kind of senseless violence -- instead, we remember the courage and selflessness of these five service members with gratitude. On behalf of all New Yorkers, my thoughts and prayers are with the families of these fallen heroes."
