Governor Cuomo announced that New York State will provide free Learn-to-Swim programs to 1,000 additional children this summer at State Parks across New York. The program is offered through a partnership among the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation; the American Red Cross; the National Swimming Pool Foundation; the Northeast Spa and Pool Association Foundation and the New York State Department of Health.
"The Learn-to-Swim program is a great way for kids to become acquainted with the water and enjoy the outdoors safely and responsibly," Governor Cuomo said. "Alongside our private and non-profit partners, we are more than doubling the program this year to reach more children across the state. I am proud to announce the expansion of this program, and I encourage anyone who is interested to sign up for free lessons this summer."
