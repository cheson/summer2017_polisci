Governor Cuomo Announces Flags at Half Staff to Commemorate 9/11 Anniversary
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 10, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that flags on state government buildings will be flown at half-staff on Friday, September 11 in remembrance of the nearly 3,000 men, women and children who lost their lives in the 2001 terrorist attacks.
"With the 14th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks upon us, we pause to remember the nearly 3,000 individuals who were taken far too early. They were mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, employees who just began their day and first responders who put their own well-being aside to aid complete strangers."
"As we observe their memory, I would also ask New Yorkers to remember the bravery and sacrifice of the members of the U.S. Armed Forces, who put their safety at risk day in and day out to preserve the freedoms and ideals that this state and nation were founded upon."
