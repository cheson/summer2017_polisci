Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Gateway Tunnel Project
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 12, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Building this new tunnel is absolutely critical to the long-term vitality of New York and the entire northeast region. We have been working to break the federal logjam and get the federal funding that this massive undertaking requires, and for the first time, with this agreement, our partners in Washington are putting real dollars -- not just loans -- on the table. New York and New Jersey's offer to pay for 50 percent of the project was meant to provoke federal action, and I also thank Senator Schumer and Senator Booker for their support in accomplishing that goal. As soon as the federal government delivers the funding we will proceed -- because our shovels are ready."
