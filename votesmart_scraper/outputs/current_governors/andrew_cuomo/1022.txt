Governor Cuomo announced $2 million in federal Homeland Security Grant funding to 12 local, FBI-accredited bomb squads across the state to sustain and enhance their capabilities. This marks the 10th consecutive year that New York State has provided dedicated federal homeland security funding to local bomb squads, with over $15 million being since its inception.
"The safety and security of all New Yorkers is our top priority, and this funding will help local law enforcement agencies be ready and equipped for what comes their way," Governor Cuomo said. "These officers are on the front lines and with these grants, we can help ensure they have what they need when confronted with these incredibly dangerous situations."
