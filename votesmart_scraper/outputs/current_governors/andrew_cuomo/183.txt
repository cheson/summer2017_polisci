Governor Cuomo Announces $250,000 in Rent Overcharges Returned to Rent Regulated Tenants in Brooklyn Building
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 13, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that more than $250,000 in rent credits has been returned to tenants who were unknowingly overcharged at 111 Lawrence Street in downtown Brooklyn. The Governor's Tenant Protection Unit flagged the owner's registrations for the rent regulated building known as "The Brooklyner" as being unusually high, and completed an audit that found unlawful rents and overcharges for 60 tenants, some dating back four years. Under the terms of an agreement with the owner, the TPU successfully negotiated the credits for the tenants, recouping their overpayments. To date, the TPU's audit and registration initiatives have returned over 52,000 units to rent regulation, and approximately $2.8 million in overcharge restitutions to tenants.
"This administration has zero tolerance for those who prey on renters and we created the Tenant Protection Unit to root out these bad actors, tackle tenant harassment and ensure their rights under the law are not violated," Governor Cuomo said. "This recovery of rent overcharges is the latest example of the TPU's success in cracking down on these unscrupulous practices, and we will continue working to ensure that all New Yorkers have a safe, decent and affordable place to call home."
