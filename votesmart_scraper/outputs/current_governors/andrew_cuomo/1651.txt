Date: Jan. 12, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the 2015-16 Executive Budget will be released and presented together with the 2015 State of the State Address. The 2015 New York State of Opportunity Agenda will be presented by Governor Cuomo on Wednesday, January 21, 2015 at 1:30 p.m. in the Empire State Plaza Convention Center in Albany to members of the Legislature and to the people of New York State. The January 21st release of the combined State of the State and Executive Budget will expedite the process of legislative budget hearings, giving the Executive and Legislature additional time ahead of the March 31st deadline.
"The challenges we face are daunting -- but the past four years are a testament to what we can achieve when we work together, and I believe we can keep that progress going," Governor Cuomo said. "This is what New Yorkers do: we take on the big challenges, get them done, and create an example for the rest of the nation to follow. I look forward to presenting the New York State of Opportunity Agenda to the members of the Legislature and people from across the Empire State on January 21st."
