Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 7, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises (MWBE) Opportunities Expo events, hosted by New York State, in Western New York, the North Country, and Mid-Hudson regions. These one-stop-shopping workshops will directly connect certified firms with contractors and various New York State agencies to increase opportunities for business growth and job creation.
"If we're going to rebuild the Empire State, we need to make sure the doors of economic opportunity are open to all," Governor Cuomo said. "The Opportunities Expo is one of the many ways we're connecting minority and women-owned businesses to up to $1 billion in contracting opportunities. I encourage businesses to take part in their nearest Expo and learn more about the benefits of doing business with the State of New York."
In addition to providing the opportunity to meet procurement officers, the event will also feature workshops and panel discussions to deliver important information about New York State MWBE certification and business development resources, as well as basic government procurement training. The Expo will also include the New York State MWBE BOOT CAMP, which will bring together local resources available for MWBE firms, such as the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) network, Professional & Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC) and the Entrepreneurial Assistance Program (EAP) center network in the region.
