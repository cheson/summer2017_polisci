Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo, Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and Mayor Bill de Blasio announced today that 128 landlords receiving lucrative tax benefits under Section 421-a of the New York Real Property Tax Law are now registering 1,823 market-rate apartments across New York City as rent-stabilized. As a result, affected tenants in all five boroughs will enjoy the protections of rent-stabilized leases on their apartments for the first time.
"We will not tolerate landlords who break the law -- plain and simple," said Governor Cuomo. "This announcement means that thousands of tenants throughout New York City will have the full legal protections that they deserve. This is an important step toward protecting New York's renters from overcharges and rent gouging, and we will continue working with our partners in state and local government to hold landlords accountable."
