Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Pedro Espada Federal Criminal Case
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

"As Attorney General, I brought an action against Pedro Espada for siphoning millions of dollars from a taxpayer funded not-for-profit and using the money to support a lavish lifestyle for himself, his family, and his friends, as well as for supporting his political operation. Mr. Espada was the prime example of government corruption.

"I worked with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York to initiate a criminal case, delegating my Deputy Chief of Staff, Mitra Hormozi, to become a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney in order to facilitate the criminal action. These efforts between state and federal investigators culminated in today's jury verdict, convicting Mr. Espada of multiple felonies.

"I commend the diligent work of the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in seeing that justice was done in this matter.

"Those who would abuse the public trust have a pointed lesson in the downfall of former Senator Espada. My comments at the time I filed the original charges bear repeating: in New York, we will have no tolerance for government corruption. As Attorney General and as Governor, I have fought to bring performance, integrity and pride back to what was, at one time, the best state government in the nation. We are making progress.

"Mr. Espada has made many accusations and comments about me since my actions began. Today the jury spoke loud and clear making Mr. Espada a convicted felon.

"The State Department of Health will continue to work with other area health care providers in the Bronx as well as the insurance plans that cover Soundview patients to ensure that those individuals will have ready access to quality health care."
