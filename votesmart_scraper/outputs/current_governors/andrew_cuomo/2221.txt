Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today joined with all Americans in wishing the United States Navy a happy birthday. The United States Navy has a long and proud tradition tracing its roots to the founding of the Continental Navy established on October 13, 1775. Since its birth, the Navy has been involved with more than ten major wars and countless battles in the effort to bring security, democracy and prosperity to the American people and to the international community.

"Today we recognize the birth of the U.S. Navy and offer our gratitude to the men and women who have served our nation," Governor Cuomo said. "New York's Navy veterans as well as those currently serving demonstrate the honor and commitment that characterizes this branch of the Armed Forces, and we thank them and their families for the sacrifices they have made to defend our nation and its interests around the globe."

The United States Navy is comprised of 323,225 Sailors on active duty and 109,837 Sailors in the ready reserve. There are over 4,000 members serving in the New York Naval Militia. The Navy recruits heavily from New York and New Yorkers answer the call.

The mission of the Navy is to maintain, train and equip combat-ready Naval forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression and maintaining freedom of the seas.
