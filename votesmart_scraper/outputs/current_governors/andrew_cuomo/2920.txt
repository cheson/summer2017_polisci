Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced he will kick-off his statewide "People First" campaign tomorrow at noon at Onondaga Community College in Syracuse.
The Governor will deliver his message of ethics reform, a property tax cap, and marriage equality to hundreds of Central New Yorkers and the local media.
"Our entire team is going to travel the state to speak directly to New Yorkers about the issues that can move this state forward, and it begins in Syracuse," Governor Cuomo said. "We need to pass a property tax cap, ethics reform, and marriage equality during this legislative session. The clock is ticking, but when the people speak, the politicians will listen. We will assemble a broad coalition of New Yorkers to support this agenda and work tirelessly to get it passed in Albany."
