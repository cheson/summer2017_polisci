Letter to New York Racing Association President and Chief Executive Officer Charlie Hayward
Letter
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 28, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today sent a letter to New York Racing Association President and CEO Charlie Hayward expressing his displeasure with a new contract with an Oregon telephone wagering company and asking that any activity under the contract be done by New York employees.
The text of the letter is as follows:
Dear Mr. Hayward:
It is my understanding that the New York Racing Association (NYRA) has entered into a contract to conduct NYRA's telephone wagering from a facility located in Oregon. NYRA's decision to locate these activities and the potential jobs out of State is extremely troubling given the extraordinary investment New York State has made to maintain NYRA's viability over the years.
My top priority as Governor is to create jobs in New York State. As such, I expect you to do everything possible to ensure that these telephone wagering activities are conducted within New York State by New York State taxpayers. The Empire State Development Corporation stands ready to help you to identify options for keeping these jobs within the State.
I would ask your full cooperation in this effort and look forward to a prompt response.
Sincerely,
Andrew M. Cuomo
Governor
