Location: Albany, NY

"The vote in the House of Representatives to approve federal aid for states affected by Hurricane Sandy is a welcome relief for New Yorkers and all homeowners, businesses, and communities that were hit by the storm.

"I want to personally thank the entire New York State congressional delegation. Since the day Sandy made landfall, members of the New York delegation have been on the front line fighting for communities devastated by the storm and putting the needs of our state ahead of politics. I would like to thank our Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand for all their hard work in the Senate and their unrelenting efforts to rally support for this aid. I would also especially like to thank Representatives Peter King, Charles Rangel, Nita Lowey, Gregory Meeks and Michael Grimm for their leadership and for tirelessly working together with the House Republican leadership to ensure this bill came to the floor and passed.

"On behalf of all New Yorkers, I thank the entire delegation for their cooperation in securing this much needed funding and look forward to the Senate passing the bill next week, so that New Yorkers can have the much needed assistance they expect and deserve."
