Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that New York motorists can now receive email reminders and text messages from the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) notifying them when their registrations or inspections are due to expire.

"In the past, long lines at the local DMV office were a symbol of an inefficient state government, but in the last three years, my administration has made it a priority to turn around that reputation and better serve New Yorkers," Governor Cuomo said. "This latest service offered by DMV is a step forward in those efforts, providing New York drivers with the opportunity to sign up for regular reminders that will help them keep track of their vehicle registration and inspection renewals. Today in the new New York, we will continue to make New Yorkers' customer experience the best it can be."

Customers can sign up quickly and conveniently online, by mail when they renew their registration, or at a DMV office counter or kiosk. DMV will also automatically enroll any customer who completed an online transaction in the past two years. Subscription information, such as cell phone number or email address, can be easily changed, and customers can also unsubscribe to this service at any time.

DMV Commissioner Barbara J. Fiala said, "Governor Cuomo asked the Department of Motor Vehicles to reconsider how we do business and to find ways to improve how we provide customer service. These reminders, like our expanded lineup of online services, are another way in which we are making use of technology to increase efficiency, be cost effective and better serve the people of New York State."
