Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

"Today's announcement that Standard and Poor's has upgraded Buffalo's General Obligation bond rating to an 'A+' is proof positive that our economic development strategy in Western New York is working. New York State is helping breathe new life into Buffalo and showing businesses that we are serious about revitalizing, rebuilding and remaking the Western New York economy. S&P cites "state-supported economic development' in their rationale for the upgrade, and we are pleased that the game-changing Buffalo Billion investment and the strategies of the Western New York Regional Economic Development Council have already helped set a new trajectory for jobs and growth. Today's upgrade is an important milestone, but the comeback of Buffalo has only just begun."
