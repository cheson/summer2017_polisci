Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

"Carey Gabay was an exemplary public servant who dedicated his life to improving the world around him. Through Carey's work, he stood up for equal rights and equal justice, created new opportunities for the disadvantaged, and changed the lives of countless New Yorkers. Carey's life and work also reminds us that we must recommit ourselves to fight against gun violence that continues to plague our streets and our cities. Carey's profound impact on the people of New York will never be forgotten, and I am proud to ensure his legacy lives on with the naming of Carey Gabay Way."
This afternoon, Counsel to the Governor Alphonso David attended the unveiling ceremony of Carey Gabay Way in Brooklyn. More information on the co-naming of Carey Gabay Way with Clinton Avenue between Myrtle Avenue and Willoughby Avenue is available here.
Carey Gabay grew up living in public housing and attending public school in the Bronx. After a successful high school career, he went on to graduate from Harvard University and Harvard Law School. He had a longstanding commitment to public service and giving back to those around him, and while at Harvard University, he ran to become the president of his undergraduate student body. More recently, he worked as an Assistant Counsel to Governor Cuomo and later as First Deputy Counsel for the Empire State Development Corporation. Today would have been Carey's 44th birthday.
