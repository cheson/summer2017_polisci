Governor Cuomo Announces Results of Latest Round of Rail Inspections
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 14, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the successful completion of targeted crude oil tank car and rail inspections initiated as part of his push to protect New Yorkers from the potential dangers associated with the transport of crude oil by freight rail companies. Last week, state and federal teams examined 445 crude oil tank cars, approximately 128 miles of track and 66 switches as part of these inspections and uncovered and addressed four critical defects and 91 non-critical defects.
"These inspections are critical to helping ensure these rail networks remain safe and that New Yorkers can work, travel and live near them without anxiety," Governor Cuomo said. "This partnership with the federal government and railroad companies is an essential piece in improving rail tracks and tank cars in virtually every corner of the state."
