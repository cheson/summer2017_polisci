Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 10, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today announced the opening of a new maintenance and repair hangar at the Albany International Airport in Colonie, Albany County. The $4.2 million hangar, funded mostly through a Regional Economic Development Council grant, will serve CommutAir and is creating approximately 100 well-paying, highly-skilled jobs.
"Albany International Airport is a key part of the transportation network for the Capital Region and beyond, and the completion of this project will ensure that it remains competitive for years to come," Governor Cuomo said. "Regional Council investments like this are creating good jobs, making the area more attractive to businesses and bolstering economic activity through transportation infrastructure improvements."
