Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced households that need help paying their heating bills this winter can begin applying for assistance from the Home Energy Assistance Program on Monday, November 16. The program provides financial assistance to help low-income and elderly New Yorkers keep their homes warm in the winter months.
"The Home Energy Assistance Program is vital to helping struggling households afford the costs of heating their homes during the cold New York winters," Governor Cuomo said. "It provides some much-needed relief, especially for low-income working families, as well as senior citizens on a fixed income. I encourage anyone in need of this assistance to apply before the coldest weather sets in."
