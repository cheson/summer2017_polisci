Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on U.S. Supreme Court's Decision on SAFE Act Victory
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 20, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"This decision is a victory for common sense gun control laws in New York and across the nation.
"From Orlando to San Bernardino to Sandy Hook and beyond -- senseless acts of violence continue to claim the lives of far too many Americans. In 2013, New York rose to the occasion and passed the toughest gun control laws in the nation. We came together, both Democrats and Republicans, to enact strict gun control measures because we fundamentally believed that we could both protect our communities while safeguarding the constitutional rights of law-abiding gun owners in our state. We continue to hold this view, which was validated by the U.S. Supreme Court's actions.
"New York set the example of what is possible -- and now, Washington must act. How many more lives must be cut short? How many more mass shootings must this nation endure? The time for Congress' silence and inaction is over. Thoughts and prayers are not enough -- they must show political will and muster the political courage to enact strong national gun safety laws for all Americans."
