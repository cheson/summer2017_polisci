Governor Cuomo and Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand today announced that $30.8 million in state and federal funding has been secured to implement significant flood resiliency improvements at the Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island, the borough's largest private sector employer.
"The effects of Superstorm Sandy continue to be felt throughout the region, but as this project shows, we continue to rebuild stronger than ever," Governor Cuomo said. "The maritime industry is critical to Staten Island's economic growth, and these types of resiliency projects are essential to maintaining the 300 jobs the facility and protecting those workers from future catastrophic weather events."
