Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 21, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that 12 recommendations made by the Council on Community Re-Entry and Reintegration, which remove barriers faced by New Yorkers with criminal convictions when attempting to re-enter their communities, will be fully implemented by his administration. The recommendations address issues ranging from employment to housing to health care, and make New York State a leader in the nationwide movement to successfully transition individuals who have served their time back into society, which saves taxpayers dollars and supports public safety.
"New York is a state of opportunity, where individuals from all backgrounds and circumstances are given a fair chance to pursue their goals," Governor Cuomo said. "The work of this Council increases the ability of our fellow citizens with criminal convictions to contribute positively to their families and communities, which creates a fairer and safer New York."
