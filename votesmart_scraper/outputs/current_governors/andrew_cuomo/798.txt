Governor Cuomo Signs Legislation to Revamp New York City's Troubled Public Assistance "Sanctions Process"
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 18, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today signed into law a bill that will revamp the "Sanctions Process" for public assistance recipients in New York City. This bill (S.3596/A.4250) creates a new "conciliation process" whereby a person on public assistance will have an opportunity to re-engage with their work requirements before being subject to debilitating sanctions.
"This is a sensible, much-needed measure that will help ensure people on public assistance are not unjustly penalized and forced to go hungry or live on the street," said Governor Cuomo. "This is another way that New York State is leading by example, striking the right balance between offering a robust work program and eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. I thank the sponsors and advocates for their work on this important issue, and am proud to sign it into law today."
