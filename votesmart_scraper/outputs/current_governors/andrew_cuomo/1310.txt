Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 2, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the groundbreaking of Thacher Park Center, a $3.8 million project that will provide a much-needed anchor for visitors who want to explore the 2,500-acre park on Albany County's Helderberg Escarpment. The center is a signature project in the Governor's NY Parks 2020 Plan to revitalize and transform the state park system.
"Thacher State Park is a true gem for the Capital Region, and we are committed to making it more accessible for families and visitors," Governor Cuomo said. "We are investing in our state parks to offer active, new recreational opportunities that will help make them year-round attractions. This project will provide a new setting for visitors to gather, learn, and enjoy the park's panoramic views of Hudson Valley, Adirondacks, Green and Berkshire Mountains."
The center, to be set next to the trailhead and picnic area for the popular Indian Ladder Trail, will introduce visitors to new park features, including an expanded trail network, as well as new opportunities for biking, rock climbing, caving, environmental education and an new high-ropes adventure course. The activities are part of the plan announced by the Governor to reinvigorate the park.
