Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 10, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today unveiled the twelfth signature proposal of his 2016 agenda: combatting poverty and reducing rampant inequality through the Empire State Poverty Reduction Initiative. The $25 million program will bring together state and local government, non-profit and business groups to design and implement coordinated solutions to increase social mobility in ten communities across upstate New York.
The proposal is the latest in the governor's anti-poverty agenda, a sweeping plan to restore economic promise and expand opportunity for all New Yorkers. Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul made the announcement this morning at True Bethel Baptist Church in Buffalo.
"Every New Yorker deserves a shot at the American Dream -- and this smart investment does just that,"Governor Cuomo said. "This is a complex problem, but through strong partnerships we will expand economic opportunity -- from Troy to Elmira -- and put all New Yorkers on a path to succeed. I look forward to working with these communities to break down barriers and create meaningful change for millions of hard-working families across the state."
