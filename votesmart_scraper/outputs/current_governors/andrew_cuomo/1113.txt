Governor Cuomo Announces End-of-Summer "Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over" Crackdown on Impaired Driving
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 20, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo directed New York State Police to ramp up enforcement efforts as part of a national crackdown on impaired driving. The 20-day campaign, Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over, runs from Aug. 21 to Sept. 7 (Labor Day) and is aimed at significantly reducing deaths and injuries caused by motorists driving drunk or impaired by drugs. The New York State Police, together with the important work of local law enforcement, will be vigilant in screening for impaired drivers.
"Driving drunk is both reckless and selfish, and we have seen too far too many avoidable tragedies that occurred after someone got behind the wheel when they shouldn't have," Governor Cuomo said. "I urge all New Yorkers to drive responsibly, and want everyone to know that impaired driving will not be tolerated in this state."
