Governor Cuomo Tours Winter Storm Conditions in Western New York
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 19, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today visited Western New York to tour the current storm conditions, where there is between three and four feet of lake effect snow already on the ground and an additional amount of up to two feet expected in the coming days. The State has been working around the clock to rescue motorists stuck on the Thruway and other state roads, as well as provide help to other New Yorkers affected by the storm. All occupants of passenger vehicles have been evacuated, and there are 98 commercial vehicles that are currently being addressed. State teams are individually checking on the occupants of these commercial vehicles to offer assistance, and urge anyone needing immediate help to call 911.
The Governor last night declared a State of Emergency for affected counties so that residents can receive as much assistance as possible. With a significant amount of snow expected again this evening, the Governor has instructed the National Guard, the New York State Police, and all state agencies to prepare to help affected residents and roadways.
"This storm is an extraordinarily difficult situation, with snowfall that may break records. We are prepared, but we need residents to stay off the roads so that first responders can do their work and keep people safe," Governor Cuomo said. "Although the sun may be shining, we are using this opening to clear roads before the snow begins falling again. This is an opportunity to be a good neighbor and check on your fellow New Yorkers to see if they need assistance, but I urge everyone to stay off the road."
