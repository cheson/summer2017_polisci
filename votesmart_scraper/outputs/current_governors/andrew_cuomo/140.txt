Governor Cuomo Announces Farm Distilleries Nearly Double in Two Years of Craft New York Act
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 13, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced, on the second anniversary of the Craft New York Act, the number of farm distilleries has nearly doubled since the law was implemented. This growth is a direct result of the Craft New York Act, which took effect December 13, 2014 and provided significant benefits to farm distillers. There are now 107 farm distilleries operating in New York State, with 50 new businesses opening over the last two years.
"By cutting red tape and easing regulations on farm distilleries, we are supporting the growth and expansion of small businesses that create new jobs and drive economic growth across New York," Governor Cuomo said. "From farm distilleries to breweries to cideries, the craft beverage industry is thriving, strengthening the agricultural and tourism industries, and providing real economic benefits to communities in every region of the state."
As a result of New York's leadership in supporting the industry, the growth of small craft beverage producers is leading to increased tax revenue, job opportunities, increased demand for farm products, such as corn, grains, and apples, and a bolstered tourism impact for the state. A full list of the new farm distilleries established in New York since December 2014 is available here. Overall, the number of farm-based distillery businesses in New York State has increased 10-fold since 2011, from 10 to 107.
Regulatory and legislative reforms implemented to support the development and expansion of New York craft distillers include the Craft New York Act, which provided New York farm distilleries with the opportunity to:
· conduct tastings and serve "by the bottle" and "by the glass;"
· increase the retail outlets where they can sell and offer samples of their products;
· lower the food requirement that must be met by manufacturers when offering tastings and consumption on premises;
· open offsite branch stores, eliminating the need for a separate license; and
· increase production by raising the annual manufacturing cap while maintaining low cost licensing fees.
