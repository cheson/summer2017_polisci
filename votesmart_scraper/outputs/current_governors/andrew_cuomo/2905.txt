"Today we honor the memory of those who lost their lives in the service of our country. Memorial Day is a time to reflect upon the sacrifices made by members of the armed services and express our gratitude for the protection they continue to provide. During this time of war, we must always keep in mind the families who will forever be separated from their loved ones. We mourn their loss and honor the sacrifice of heroes of all generations. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I would like to thank the brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, both from New York and across the nation, for their dedicated service."
