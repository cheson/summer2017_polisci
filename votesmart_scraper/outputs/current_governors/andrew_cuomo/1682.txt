Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 4, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today highlighted results from the first-ever Farm to Table Upstate-Downstate Agriculture Summit, which was introduced in the Governor's 2014 State of the State address. The purpose of the Summit was to explore ways of increasing access to fresh food for underserved populations and growing New York City markets' access to upstate agricultural producers as a means of boosting in-state production and consumption. Lieutenant Governor Robert J. Duffy presided over the first-of-its-kind summit, which took place today in New York City.
"One of New York's strongest economic drivers is the connection between the multi-billion dollar upstate agricultural industry and the many world-class restaurants and marketplaces in the New York City area. Today we laid out our plan to strengthen that relationship and take the State's agriculture and tourism sectors to the next level," Governor Cuomo said. "By keeping the revenue generated from our farms and tables right here in New York, we can create more jobs and opportunities in communities across the State, and I am proud to be joining with our business and community partners to grow this vital part of our State's economy.
