Governor Cuomo encouraged business owners, community leaders and other interested parties to register for New York State's Fifth Annual MWBE Forum, to be held October 1-2, 2015, at the Empire State Plaza Convention Center in Albany, New York. The Forum, the State's largest annual business event for minority-and women-owned business enterprises, helps small businesses from across New York navigate the State's available contract opportunities to grow their businesses.
"Minority- and Women-Owned Businesses play an important role in New York's business community, and this administration has taken unprecedented steps to ensure they have the tools, resources and information they need to succeed, grow and create jobs," Governor Cuomo said. "I encourage businesses to attend the 5th Annual MWBE Forum and learn what opportunities are available to help them succeed."
