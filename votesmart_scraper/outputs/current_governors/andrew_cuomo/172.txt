Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the expansion of addiction treatment and prevention services on Long Island with the groundbreaking of a $4.6 million community residence center in Brentwood, Suffolk County and New York's first bilingual adolescent substance use disorder clubhouse now open in Freeport, Nassau County.
"These new facilities are critical to saving and improving the lives of New Yorkers struggling with addiction," Governor Cuomo said. "The new women's facility and adolescent clubhouse will help Long Islanders in need on their road to recovery and are vital tools in this administration's fight against addiction."
"Across the State, I have heard incredible success stories attributed to the positive communities that surround individuals in recovery," said Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, who co-chairs Governor Cuomo's Heroin and Opioid Task Force. "By expanding treatment capacity in Brentwood, this new center will help women across Long Island begin a new chapter in their life."
