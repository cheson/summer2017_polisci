Public Statements
Tenfold Increase in Medical Emergencies from Synthetic Marijuana this Summer over Last Year
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 6, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the passage of emergency Health Department regulations combatting the sale of synthetic cannabinoids in New York State. The tougher regulations expand the existing list of banned substances to include new chemical compounds that drug producers have been making since Governor Cuomo first targeted so-called synthetic marijuana in 2012. Today's actions are in response to a dramatic and dangerous increase in medical emergencies across New York State this summer.
"The evolution of synthetic drugs is an alarming public health risk -- and we are on the front lines of the battle," Governor Cuomo said. "The state will continuously identify emerging compounds that put users in danger and aggressively chase down vendors in order to keep these drugs out of the hands of New Yorkers."
