Governor Cuomo today announced FuzeHub, a new statewide initiative to grow manufacturing companies that was officially launched in November, is proving successful in bringing solutions to businesses -- including two companies from the Capital Region.

"Supporting New York's manufacturers is vital to not only ensuring their long-term success, but to creating new economic opportunities in communities all throughout the State," said Governor Cuomo. "FuzeHub is proving to be a unique resource available to our manufacturing companies that pools the very best of the State's expertise to help entrepreneurs with technology commercialization, innovative solutions and business growth. I look forward to FuzeHub's continued role in assisting businesses across the State build a stronger, reinvigorated New York."
