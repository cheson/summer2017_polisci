Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 10, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's arrests again spotlight the failings of New York State government and highlight the urgent need for the legislature to pass comprehensive ethics reform - now. During the campaign, I made a commitment that we would either pass real ethics reform with real disclosure and real enforcement or I would form a Moreland Commission on public integrity. New Yorkers deserve a clean and transparent government comprised of officials who work for the people, not for the special interests and certainly not for their own corrupt self-interests. Today, I reaffirm my commitment to clean up Albany and state clearly that either ethics legislation will be passed or I will form a Moreland Commission by the end of this legislative session."
