"Today's report from the Comptroller's Office finds even more evidence to support the education budget I proposed. The report says all but roughly 100 of the State's 696 districts have enough reserves to cover the proposed reduction for this year. That's only reserves. This does not include any renegotiation of health benefits or salaries and it does not include rooting out waste or finding greater efficiencies. The oft-repeated scare tactic from various interest groups that teachers must be fired simply is not so. And what's worse, it uses students as pawns in a political game. School districts and the Albany bureaucracy must wake up, do what families across the State have done and adjust to the new economic reality: we must stop throwing money at our State's problems. We must think of performance for the students, not money for the bureaucracy and special interests. Right now, New York is number one in education spending and number 34 in performance. This is not the New York I know. It's a new day and we must find a new way."
