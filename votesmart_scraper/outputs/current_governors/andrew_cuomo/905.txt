Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 5, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced plans for a summit in conjunction with Governor Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla and 1199/SEIU to strategize ways to prevail upon Washington to address Puerto Rico's looming health care and economic crisis. The summit, which will be held in the coming weeks, will be the start of a national effort and include key stakeholders and activists on issues of government, health care and finance. This is the latest in a series of actions Governor Cuomo has taken to partner with Puerto Rico in their time of need and ensure fairness and parity from the federal government. Puerto Rico's crisis is becoming increasingly impactful not just for the local government, but the livelihoods of millions of U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico as well.
"Puerto Rico's problems are New York's problems, and we are going to be there for them 100 percent," Governor Cuomo said. "This crisis has been decades in the making, and we will not allow the situation to continue deteriorating simply because of a lack of political will in Washington. New York stands shoulder to shoulder with Puerto Rico in the fight for fairness and economic parity -- and the federal government should do the same."
