Statement From Governor Cuomo on Iranian Infant Banned from Entering The U.S for Life-saving Heart Surgery
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 3, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"As Washington seeks to close America's golden door and extinguish the torch on the Statue of Liberty, New York will remain true to the ideals that founded this nation.

"For all the disruption and hardship this misguided immigration policy has caused, one of the most unfortunate and egregious situations is posed by a four-month-old Iranian girl who needs a life-saving surgery that can only be performed in the United States.

"Bizarrely, the federal ban would prevent this child from receiving medical care and literally endanger her life. It is repugnant to all we believe as Americans and as members of the human family.

"This evening we were pleased to learn that the federal government has now granted Fatemeh Reshad and her family boarding documents to come to the United States. We will continue to work with the International Refugee Assistance Project and their partners to ensure this baby receives the treatment she needs, and fight for those being unfairly shut out of America's gates by this policy.
"I am also pleased to announce that the world-renowned pediatric cardiac surgical team at Mount Sinai Hospital, who has extensive experience in managing patients with this condition, has generously offered to provide the surgery and medical care at no cost to the family.

"Furthermore, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, LLP has agreed to underwrite the expense of bringing the family and the baby to New York and back to Iran, and all costs while in New York City."
