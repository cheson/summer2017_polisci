Governor Cuomo Encourages New Yorkers to Visit the Great New York State Fair For Final Weekend
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 4, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo reminded all New Yorkers that the Great New York State Fair, a 12 day celebration of New York agriculture, exhibits, rides and food, continues through Labor Day. The final weekend will feature several acts, completing the best free concert lineup of any fair in America, and a tremendous value on Labor Day, when admission and Midway rides are all $1.
"With this year's Great New York State Fair coming to a close, I encourage everyone to make the trip this Labor Day weekend to see the very best the Empire State has to offer," Governor Cuomo said. "New Yorkers and visitors alike will enjoy this long-treasured tradition that encompasses the very best of New York."
Labor Day also features $1 rides on the Wade Shows Midway. Wade Shows joined the Fair in 2014, bringing with them fresh new rides, a clean Midway with wide aisles, and the idea for Dollar Day. Last year's Dollar Day not only set a record for the number of rides provided in a day, it also produced record revenue from the Midway. Fair parking costs $5.
