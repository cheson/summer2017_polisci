Statement from Governor Cuomo on Transgender Day of Remembrance
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 20, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Today we honor the memory of all transgender individuals whose lives were tragically cut short by violence. Too many incredible people have been the target of vicious attacks because they were transgender, and many more continue to be victimized by hate -- and that must stop.
"For decades, our state has been a beacon to the nation on LGBT rights, and we will double down on our efforts against transgender violence until these horrific crimes are a thing of the past. Acceptance is at the heart of who we are as New Yorkers, and we will continue to build a safer and more inclusive society for all."
