Governor Cuomo announced that during recent inspections of ultraviolet tanning devices in Delaware, Greene and Otsego Counties, inspectors from the New York State Department of Health found safety violations in 70 percent of the devices they examined. These inspections are continuously conducted throughout the state and are vital to ensuring that tanning salon operators are in full compliance with the state's health and safety regulations.
"Exposure to UV radiation can be extremely harmful, especially when unsafe devices are in use and proper procedures are not followed," Governor Cuomo said. "Protecting New Yorkers is a top priority of this administration and we will continue to conduct these inspections to ensure these salons are following health and safety standards."
