Location: Albany, NY

In recognition of World AIDS Day, Governor Cuomo made a series of announcements regarding the next phase of New York State's Plan to End the AIDS Epidemic in the State. New York State is a national leader in providing high quality support services to individuals infected with HIV/AIDS, directing more than $2.5 billion annually to fight against the disease.
"New York was once the epicenter of the AIDS crisis -- but now we are showing the nation how to fight back and make this epidemic a thing of the past," said Governor Cuomo. "We are making rapid progress toward a future where more people know their status, medication is easily accessible, and new cases are more and more rare. As we mark World AIDS Day, we remember all those we have lost, and we recommit ourselves to ending this epidemic once and for all."
