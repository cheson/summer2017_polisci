Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Women's Equality Agenda
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 16, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"In 1848, the women's suffrage movement began in America at the first Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, New York. Since then, New York has been at the forefront of important social and legal movements that have advanced the equal treatment of all people. Today, I stand proudly in solidarity with the members of the 850 women's advocacy groups, and call on the leadership and members of both houses to introduce and pass all 10 points of the Women's Equality Act before the end of this legislative session. Each and every one of these issues is vitally important to the future of women in our state, and New Yorkers deserve to know where their elected representatives stand on all of them. New York is the last place where women's rights should be held back; it is the place where they must move forward."
