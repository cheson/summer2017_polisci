Statement from Governor Cuomo on Appellate Court Decision Regarding Home Care Workers
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 25, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"In New York, overtime pay and minimum wage rules are fundamental parts of fair compensation -- but for too long this basic premise did not apply to home health care workers in other states. Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit took a critical step to right this wrong.
"The Court's decision in Home Care Association of America v. David Weil will ensure that people in home health jobs across the country receive this important protection, and it is another step forward for our nation when it comes to safeguarding worker's rights. This case sends a clear message that the honest value of labor is inviolable and will be defended, and I commend Attorney General Schneiderman for standing up in this case and helping ensure that justice was served."
