BLITZER: He got close a couple years ago, but not close enough and I'm sure he was disappointed that not only Republicans, but some of his fellow Democrats voted against the legislation he wanted enacted.
Michelle, thanks very, very much.
Joining us now to discuss the breaking news, Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York.
Governor, thanks very much for joining us.
I know you have called for a national gun policy. What is stopping this from happening, because you see how angry the president is right now?
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK: Political courage, Wolf. I think that's what is stopping it, political courage by the elected officials in Washington and apathy by American people.
BLITZER: How do you change that?
CUOMO: I'm sorry?
