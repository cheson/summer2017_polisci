Statements from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and U.S. Senator Charles Schumer on the Alcoa Negotiations
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 5, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"At my direction, senior administration officials are actively working with Alcoa and Senator Schumer to continue the company's operation in Massena and the hundreds of jobs it supports. This plant is a vital part of the local community, and we are doing everything possible to identify an alternative scenario that both allows the facility to remain open and protects the taxpayer investments that have already been made. My thoughts are with every New Yorker who could potentially be impacted by Alcoa's actions -- and I want them to know that we are doing everything possible to retain these jobs."
