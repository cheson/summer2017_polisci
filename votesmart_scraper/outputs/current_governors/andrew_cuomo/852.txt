"Tonight, we are all heavy with sadness. Once again the nation must face an inexplicable tragedy.
"While we are still learning more about what has happened, one thing is clear: it is well past time for federal gun control. Too many innocent lives have been cut short, and yet Congress still has not been moved to act. Here, we are all stunned and are once again calling for attention to the endless list of families who have buried their loved ones. How can we rationalize this kind of inaction as 33,000 people are killed every year in the nation due to gun-related violence?
"Congress must find the political will to act. Gun violence is an injustice against the American people, and Washington's failure to address it is appalling and inexcusable. New York State set the example after Sandy Hook by passing the strongest gun control law in the nation. We proved the possibility. Congress must do the same.
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, we offer our prayers to the victims of today's horrific shooting in San Bernardino."
