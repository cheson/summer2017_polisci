"Today is a victory for the People of New York. As Attorney General, I launched the investigation that led to the conviction of Senate Majority Leader Pedro Espada Jr. for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars and violating the trust placed in him by the people of New York State. This sentence sends a clear and direct message that those who defraud this state's taxpayers will be held accountable and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Today, justice was served."
