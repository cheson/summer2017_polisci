"At approximately 11:20 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 rail cars traveling on the Norfolk Southern line derailed near the town of Ripley in Chautauqua County. While there is no fire or reported injuries at this time, three rail cars carrying hazardous liquids, including ethanol, were turned on their side, and one is confirmed to be leaking. As a result, emergency response officials evacuated several homes in the immediate vicinity and instructed other nearby residents to stay inside while authorities continue to assess the situation.
"I have directed the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Services' Office of Emergency Management, the Office of Fire Prevention and Control, the Department of Environmental Conservation as well as foam equipment to assist in suppressing the spill and provide support to hazmat teams that will be working to patch the leak.
"We will continue to respond to the situation as it develops and take all necessary actions to keep people safe."
