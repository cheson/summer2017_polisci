Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on First Hearing of the Wage Board for Fast Food Workers
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 20, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"The promise of the minimum wage is not unlike that of the American Dream -- if you work hard, you should be able to provide for your family and build a brighter future. Yet for tens of thousands of hardworking men and women in the fast food industry, that promise has been forsaken. When 60 percent of fast food workers in the Empire State have at least one family member on public assistance -- the highest rate of any industry in our economy -- it is clear that the minimum wage is not working.
"As we continue to fight for a higher minimum wage in Albany, I will not allow legislative inaction to hold us back. Today, let us send the message loud and clear: New York won't stop until we restore and preserve opportunity for all."
