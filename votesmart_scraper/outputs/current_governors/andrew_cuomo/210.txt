Governor Cuomo Announces Sales and Use Tax Exemption For Feminine Hygiene Products Now in Effect
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 1, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the sales and use tax exemption for feminine hygiene products sold in New York State took effect today. In July, Governor Cuomo signed legislation (A.7555-A/S.7838) instituting this exemption.
"Eliminating this regressive tax on women was a matter of fairness and I am proud to have signed this legislation to right that wrong," Governor Cuomo said. "With the law in effect, we have taken one more step toward a more just and more fair New York for all."
Feminine hygiene products have been taxable since the state sales tax was first instituted in 1965, even as a wide variety of other goods, such as dietary and family planning products, have been exempt.
New York is one of the first states to join the movement to exempt feminine hygiene products from sales tax, which is expected to save women purchasing tampons, and other similar products, an estimated $10 million a year.
On August 1, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance informed all retailers this exemption would take effect on September 1. If any New Yorker believes that they have been charged this tax, they should apply for a refund by submitting Form AU-11 and the receipt to the Tax Department. Retailers with questions about the exemption can contact the Tax Department between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at 518-485-1159.
