Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 27, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

In the wake of the devastating earthquake in Nepal, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today encouraged New Yorkers to consider providing support to organizations assisting in relief efforts. The region faces countless challenges in the days, weeks and years ahead as individuals and families -- many located in developing and rural areas -- rebuild from the disaster. New York State is home to one of the largest Nepalese populations in America.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families affected by the devastating Nepal earthquake," Governor Cuomo said. "As New Yorkers, we help our neighbors in their time of need, whether they are across the street, or across the globe. I urge those wishing to help to support the important work of legitimate charities responding to this disaster and be vigilant against opportunists who seek to capitalize on this tragedy."
