Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 17, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

Today the Department of Financial Services fined Excellus Health Plan, Inc. $1 million for violations of New York Insurance Law. More information is available here.
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued the following statement:
"Earlier this year, my administration took clear action to firmly secure access to reproductive rights in New York. Regulations now ensure that contraceptive drugs and devices are fully covered by health insurance policies.
"The steps taken today by the Department of Financial Services make good on our promise to women across the state and send a clear message that all insurance companies who attempt to deny or inhibit access to women's health care will be held accountable.
"Women deserve control over their health and reproductive decisions, and as Washington threatens to violate that right, it is more important than ever that New York - and states across the nation - stand up and demand women's rights to access safe, affordable health care."
