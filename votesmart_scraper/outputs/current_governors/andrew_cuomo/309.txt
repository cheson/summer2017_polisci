Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on James A. Fitzpatrick Nuclear Plant
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 13, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"The announcement this morning of negotiations on Exelon's potential acquisition of the James A. Fitzpatrick Nuclear Power Plant from Entergy is welcome news to New Yorkers. Over the past several months, my administration has been working closely with both companies to find a way to keep this vital energy resource operating. While there remains much work to be done, I am pleased that significant progress is being made."
"The benefits of the continued operation of the Fitzpatrick facility are critically important to the Oswego community, the region, and the rest of the state. Fitzpatrick provides over 600 high-skilled, well-paying jobs, and accounts for hundreds of millions of dollars in annual economic activity. Further, the plant helps avoid millions of metric tons of harmful carbon dioxide emissions each year and serves as a clean energy bridge to meeting the state's 50% renewable energy goal by 2030."
"I have directed various state entities to continue working with the parties involved to finish the job. I am hopeful that a definitive agreement will be reached to ensure these benefits to New Yorkers are realized."
