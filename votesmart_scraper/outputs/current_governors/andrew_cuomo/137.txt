Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a new regulation to prohibit insurance companies from refusing to provide commercial crime insurance coverage to New York businesses that employ people with criminal convictions.
The effort -- the first of its kind in the nation -- will make it easier for businesses across the state to hire formerly incarcerated individuals upon reentry, and helping them obtain the necessary coverage for any loss or damage caused by an employee with a criminal record.
"This first-in-the-nation action will further break down artificial barriers that prevent previously incarcerated New Yorkers from obtaining work and turning their lives around," Governor Cuomo said. "We are taking one more step to restore fairness and dignity to our society while also increasing public safety by providing opportunity and reducing recidivism."
With 2.3 million people in New York with a criminal conviction on their record, this new regulation now ensures employers are able to obtain this coverage, provided that they considered a set of factors outlined in New York State law governing the hiring of people with criminal convictions. These factors include whether the offense is related to the duties that the employee will perform, the time that has passed since the conviction, and evidence of good conduct by the applicant.
