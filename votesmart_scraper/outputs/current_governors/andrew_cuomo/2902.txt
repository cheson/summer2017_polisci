"Today, the representatives from Stony Brook University and key stakeholders in the region presented their NYSUNY 2020 plan. It is an innovative plan that has the potential to rejuvenate Long Island. I am committed to the project and will make sure that my administration concentrates their efforts in making this a reality. Stony Brook's plan of action addresses the major issues on Long Island and throughout the state. It will use public-private partnerships to create thousands of jobs, as well as reinvigorate the business climate across Nassau and Suffolk counties. In addition, it will ensure that Stony Brook becomes one of the country's most advanced public research facilities."
