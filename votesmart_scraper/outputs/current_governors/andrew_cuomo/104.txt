Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Arrest Related to Threats Against Jewish Community Centers
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 3, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"The recent increase in anti-Semitic threats and acts of intolerance is disturbing, unacceptable, and directly contradicts New York's core values of tolerance and diversity. Today's arrest sends a strong message that anyone who targets and instills fear in our communities will be brought to justice.
"New York State Police will continue to work in close partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement to aggressively pursue investigations into any reported hate crime in our state. We will remain vigilant in our efforts to hold those responsible for these reprehensible actions fully accountable under the law.
"With the Statue of Liberty standing tall in our harbor, New York has always been and will continue to be a beacon of unity and hope for all, and we will not allow anyone to threaten those values."
