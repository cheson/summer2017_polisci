Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on U.S. Supreme Court's Decision on President Obama's Immigration Plan
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 23, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's Supreme Court decision relegates millions of undocumented Americans to the shadows of our economy and society, leaving them to remain living and working in fear of deportation. We are talking about immigrants who came to this nation as children and don't know any country other than the United States. We are talking about hardworking, upstanding contributors to our economy in communities all across the country. We are talking about more than 300,000 of our neighbors here in New York State. When President Obama acted in the face of Congressional gridlock to begin fixing a broken immigration system, his executive order was a sensible and important step toward long-overdue reform. Today's deadlock was a devastating step backward."
