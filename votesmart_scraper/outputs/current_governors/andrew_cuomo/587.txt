Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 20, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

In the wake of the recent devastating earthquakes in Ecuador and Japan, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today encouraged New Yorkers to donate to reputable organizations assisting in relief efforts and to avoid scams seeking to capitalize of these tragic natural disasters.
"Our hearts go out to the victims and families affected by the devastating earthquakes in Ecuador and Japan," Governor Cuomo said. "In times of need, New Yorkers come together to help our neighbors, whether they be across the street or across the globe. I urge those wishing to assist to do so through a verified charity and to avoid those seeking to take advantage of these terrible international tragedies."
Fraudsters posing as charitable organizations commonly seek to prey on those willing to help in the aftermath of major disasters with solicitations that divert much-needed aid from those who truly need assistance. These scams can include efforts to solicit money via telephone calls, mailings, social media posts and e-mails that lead to convincing, yet fake, websites.
