Governor's Cabinet Travels to Rochester to Identify Opportunities to Combat Poverty, Strengthen Economy and Improve Community Infrastructure
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today traveled to Rochester to bring "Capital for a Day" to the Finger Lakes region. The Governor's cabinet met with community members, business leaders and partners in government to identify opportunities to combat poverty, strengthen the economy and improve the community's infrastructure. As a result of feedback received, the Governor announced a comprehensive 41-point plan to advance the Finger Lakes region which includes $12 million to support a high-tech commercialization partnership at the Rochester Institute of Technology and a $6 million City of Rochester Opportunity Initiative to further drive efforts in combatting poverty.
"Today was about seeing and understanding the needs of Rochester, Monroe County and the Finger Lakes as a whole, and then designing plans to meet those needs," Governor Cuomo said. "From our anti-poverty initiative to the exciting investment in RIT, this was a prime example of how the State is partnering with local officials and business leaders to open doors for the local community. It was a very productive day, and we are going to continue that momentum in the future to continue to create opportunity in the region."
