Governor Cuomo Rallies for Parental Choice in Education Act
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 17, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"This is about fairness and this is about parents choosing the school that is right for their children," Governor Cuomo said. "We must reward donations to support public schools, give tax credits to teachers who pay for classroom supplies out of pocket, and ease the financial burden on families who exercise choice in sending their children to a nonpublic school. I am pleased to join with local leaders who support these critical issues and understand how we need to get this done."
The Act provides for $150 million in education tax credits annually that will provide:
Tax credits to low-income families who send their children to nonpublic schools,
Scholarships to low- and middle-income students to attend either a public school outside of their district or a nonpublic school,
Incentives to public schools for enhanced educational programming (like after school programs); and,
Tax credits to public school teachers for the purchase of supplies
400,000 students, or approximately 15 percent of all students in New York State attend nonpublic schools which provide an important educational alternative in virtually every corner of New York State -- and especially so in communities where the existing public schools are failing. There are currently 178 failing public schools in New York State -- many of which have been failing for ten years or more.
Despite their importance as alternative options for parents and students in failing schools, many parochial schools in New York State are experiencing financial hardship, and parents can face steep costs to enroll their children in such schools. Statewide, more than 75 parochial schools have closed in just the last five years, and average tuition can reach as high as $8,500 per student annually.
Therefore, the Parental Choice in Education Act will support important alternatives for parents across the state -- especially important for low-income families.
