Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced three new NY Green Bank deals which will allow private sector partners to provide and improve access to cleaner and more affordable energy for their residential, commercial and agricultural customers. NY Green Bank, a core initiative of the Governor's Reforming the Energy Vision plan, is providing a total of $49 million for the three transactions and leveraging up to $178 million in additional private capital from private sector partners and financial institutions.
"These investments further cement New York's position as a global leader in clean energy development, as well as in the fight against climate change," Governor Cuomo said. "These three projects will not only help improve access to renewable energy for residents and businesses, but will also help stir economic growth by enabling these industries to grow in New York State."
