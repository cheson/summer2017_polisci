Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Regarding Puerto Rico's Debt Crisis
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 2, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, as we continue waiting for Congress to help Puerto Rico find an attainable path out of debt, three million Puerto Rican families saw their government slip further into debt, with seemingly no end in sight. It is well past time for the federal government to act. To allow this untenable situation to continue to deteriorate is unacceptable, and I am urging all members of Congress to come together and pass a reasonable financial restructuring plan -- one that puts the local government on a path to prosperity without jeopardizing the livelihoods of the people of Puerto Rico."
