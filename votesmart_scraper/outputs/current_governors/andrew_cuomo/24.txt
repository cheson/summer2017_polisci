Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 3, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"My heart goes out to the victims of the shocking incidents in London. These apparent terrorist attacks are cowardly and senseless acts that go against everything we believe in, and a sad and sobering reminder of the threats we face today. In the wake of this horrific violence, New York stands with the people of Britain -- as they have always done for us.
"The safety and security of New Yorkers is our top priority, and we will continue to remain vigilant. We are in close contact with federal and local officials, and I have directed state law enforcement officials to step up security and patrols at high-profile locations across New York, including our airports, bridges, tunnels and mass transit systems."
