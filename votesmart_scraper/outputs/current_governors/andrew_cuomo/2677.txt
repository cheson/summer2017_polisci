Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on One World Trade Center Becoming New York City's Tallest Skyscraper
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 30, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"Today marks a milestone for One World Trade Center as the building becomes New York City's tallest skyscraper, reclaiming its place in the skyline and showing to the world the resilience of the people of our state and nation. With today's achievement, we pause to recall the heinous acts of terrorism that brought down the twin towers and claimed the lives of thousands of Americans, and we also honor the extraordinary courage of our first responders. The new World Trade Center is more than just a skyscraper: it is a symbol of the enduring spirit of the City and State of New York, representing our commitment to rebuilding stronger than before. One World Trade Center will be the hub of new economic growth in Lower Manhattan and for the entire metropolitan region, attracting major businesses from across the globe and providing a workplace for thousands of New Yorkers. I thank the many contractors, iron workers and laborers for their hard work, without which this milestone would not have been possible."
