Governor Cuomo Issues Consumer Alert to Car Buyers About the Dangers of Online Scams
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 16, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo issued a consumer alert advising New Yorkers to exercise caution when making used car purchases from private sellers over the internet following an increase in the number of complaints about online used car scams received by New York State Department of Motor Vehicles investigators. Each year, these state investigators, working with other federal, state and local officials, recover as much as $1.5 million in stolen vehicles and parts purchased online.
"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is," said Governor Cuomo. "Many of the protections afforded to consumers who buy from licensed dealers do not apply to private sales, making the Internet a target-rich environment for fraudsters. I advise all New Yorkers to know the facts and thoroughly research what you're about to purchase in order to avoid becoming a victim of a scam."
