Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Martin Luther King Day
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 20, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, we honor the legacy of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. -- a man who devoted his life to ending discrimination in this country and creating a more just society. He believed in the inherent and fundamental equality of all people -- that every man, woman and child should be treated fairly no matter the color of their skin.

Here in New York, Dr. King's teachings have continued to guide social progress and reminds us that there is still more that must be done to make our communities safer and fairer for all. We have a civil rights crisis today in this state where 16- and 17-year-olds are still tried as adults. Changing this practice has to be a priority in the legislative session. We still have inequality in our schools where the only pieces of technology in some are metal detectors. This year, I am proposing an education bond to fund the latest technology in our classrooms because all of our students deserve it.

I join with all New Yorkers in remembering the life of this great leader, not only today but every day."
