Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a contract for the installation of 300 electric vehicle charging stations at public locations across New York. The New York Power Authority Board of Trustees accord supports the Governor's ChargeNY program's goal of 3,000 charging stations online in the state by 2018 and helps New York achieve its goal for a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
"New York is a national leader in promoting green technology and developing the clean energy economy, and these new charging stations will support the growing increase in electric vehicle use across the state," Governor Cuomo said. "With our unyielding commitment to cleaner, greener, and more efficient energy solutions, we are building a stronger New York for all."
ChargeNY is a core initiative of the Governor's Reforming the Energy Vision strategy to build a cleaner, more efficient and resilient energy system for all New Yorkers. In addition, reducing emissions from the transportation sector is critical to achieving Governor Cuomo's goal of reducing New York State's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2030 from 1990 levels and ensuring 50 percent of electricity consumed comes from renewable energy sources by 2030.
