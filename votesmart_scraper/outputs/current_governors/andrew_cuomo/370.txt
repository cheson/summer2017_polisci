Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 27, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"For decades the Supreme Court has made it unequivocally clear that every woman has the constitutional right to choose. It belongs to every woman in this country, regardless of race, ethnicity or economic status. Today's ruling correctly asserts that rights in name only are meaningless and therefore wisely rejected Texas' empty and hollow attempt to undermine a woman's choice through draconian laws.
We cannot strip away the fundamental right to choose. With this decision, the Supreme Court has struck down unnecessary and unfair regulations in Texas which effectively prevented women from accessing quality medical care in their communities. This ruling not only protects women's health, but places the Court on the right side of history and advances freedom and equality for years to come."
