Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Contract Renewal of the New York State Police Investigators Association
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 22, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"The New York State Police Investigators Association last night ratified its contract that extends through 2018. The Investigators Association represents more than 1,000 members of the State Police whose work is invisible to many, yet provides some of the most vital services in the security and justice for millions of New Yorkers. The talent of these Troopers is diverse as it is deep -- from investigating child abuse and organized crime, to assisting local police departments in times of need. I applaud President Quick and members of the Association on getting the contract done, and extend my gratitude for their commitment to the safety of all New Yorkers."
