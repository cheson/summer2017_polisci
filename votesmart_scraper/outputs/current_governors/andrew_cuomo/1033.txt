Statement

"It is with profound sadness that we learn of the passing of Carey Gabay.
"Carey was the epitome of an outstanding public servant. He held a tremendous commitment to his community, and he chose to use his many talents to better the lives of others. New York is undeniably a better place today because of his service. He was also a friend and role model to the many people who were blessed to have known him, and he will be greatly missed.
"Today, the State of New York has lost one of its finest young men.
"I thank the doctors, nurses and medical professionals who did everything they could to care for Carey. I also am incredibly appreciative to the men and women of the NYPD who stood watch over Carey and his family day in and day out since his shooting.
"I ask that all New Yorkers please join me in keeping Carey's family in their thoughts and prayers -- especially his wife Trenelle Gabay, his mother and stepfather Audrey and Rupert McNaughton, his sisters Crystal Gabay Nurse and Stephanie Gabay Smith, his brother Aaron McNaughton, and his mother-in-law Rosemarrie Campbell. No one should have to experience the pain of losing someone they love to random gun violence, and his family is in our thoughts during this incredibly difficult time."
