Governor Cuomo announced nearly $710,000 in state grants to 51 police departments and sheriffs' offices across the state for the purchase of electronic fingerprinting equipment. This new equipment will replace existing devices that either malfunction or are obsolete.
"Fingerprinting is a proven and highly effective crime-fighting method -- which drives us to help law enforcement agencies record and share fingerprints as efficiently as possible," Governor Cuomo said. "These grants will help departments across the state, regardless of size, maintain a vital form of equipment, and I am proud that the state is able to help our local partners in this way."
