"Today we celebrate the essential contributions that the American workforce has made to our country. While workers throughout the entire nation are honored on this day, the Labor Day holiday has its roots right here in New York. The nation's first Labor Day was celebrated in New York City in the nineteenth century, and just a few years later, the first bill to create a state-recognized holiday was introduced in our state legislature. Through the generations that have followed, the progress achieved by organized labor has benefited all of our state's workers and, by extension, all New Yorkers. Today, we celebrate that history, we honor the strength and spirit of our workforce, and we give thanks to the working men and women who have given so much to move our society forward."
