Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Regarding Terror Attack in Nice
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: July 14, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"The horrific rampage in Nice is a direct attack on the universal values our two countries have long championed and upheld. As the French people came together to celebrate liberty and unity on their independence day, extremists sought to undermine it with hate and intolerance. They will not succeed. New York stands united with France and all our allies in the face of terror. This is not only an attack on France, but an attack on democracy.
"I have directed state law enforcement officials to step up security at high-profile locations around the state, including our airports, bridges, tunnels and mass transit systems. The Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Services' Office of Emergency Management Watch Center will be on heightened alert, monitoring world events. DHSES regional staff have all been notified to maintain a heightened state of awareness at mass gathering events. The New York State Police and the Joint Task Force Empire Shield have deployed additional troops in the New York metropolitan region. Public safety is paramount, and New York will continue to work aggressively with all local and federal partners to keep residents and visitors safe.
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest condolences to the people of France, the families who have lost loved ones, and all those grieving around the world."
