Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that Strategic Networks Group, a world leader in broadband econometrics, ranked New York State number one in the nation for broadband activity and investment. "The 50 States of Broadband" study surveyed broadband investment activities on a state-by-state basis and determined that New York State ranked first overall in availability, adoption, driving meaningful use, growth investment, and regulation.
"The New NY Broadband Program is laying the groundwork for a strong economy by connecting households and businesses in every corner of the state, enabling New York businesses to compete on the world stage," Governor Cuomo said. "We are proud to be home to the most robust broadband program in the nation and this ranking further emphasizes our role as a leader in next-generation high-speed internet infrastructure."
SNG conducted its study from February through March 2016 and provided states with an online survey to complete. 48 states participatedand each responder was asked to report on five key dimensions of broadband: availability, adoption, meaningful use, growth investment, and regulation. Responses were used to rank states on these dimensions and develop a composite overall ranking.
"The Broadband Program Office is excited that New York State was selected as the overall leader in broadband capability in the nation," said Empire State Development Executive Vice President of Broadband and Innovation Jeffrey Nordhaus. "This acknowledgement underlines the Governor's commitment to broadband, which is the boldest and most ambitious in the nation. While we are proud of the recognition, the BPO continues to be focused on delivering results for New Yorkers and looks forward to the results of the Phase One auction."
