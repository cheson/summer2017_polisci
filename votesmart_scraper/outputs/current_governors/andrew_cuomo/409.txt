"Today's agreement is an important step forward for CUNY and the Professional Staff Congress. CUNY plays an integral role in developing New York's next generation of leaders, and for too long, its employees have been working without a contract. I commend both sides for negotiating in good faith and coming to an equitable resolution that will help ensure CUNY's continued success."
