Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Teacher Evaluations
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 31, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"Teacher evaluations are critical to ensure our kids have high quality teachers in the classroom because performance counts.
I am disappointed that agreements could not be reached to impose teacher performance evaluations at some of our troubled school districts across the state.
Students lose twice because of this failure. First, the failure to reach agreements on teacher evaluations forces these schools to continue to operate without true accountability, which would ensure students receive a high quality education from high quality teachers. Second, these schools will also lose out on millions of dollars in much needed federal aid.
I urge all involved to get back to the table immediately, put their differences aside and put the kids first. They should agree on an evaluation system that improves performance and prevents the loss of more than one hundred million dollars this year for these schools across the state."
