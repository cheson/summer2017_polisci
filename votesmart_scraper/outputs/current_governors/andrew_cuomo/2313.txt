Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the State Department of Health has sent an additional 200 doses of tetanus vaccine to Herkimer and Mohawk, two communities hit hard by the recent flooding. The Governor directed the additional shots to be sent to the local communities after visiting the Village of Mohawk on Tuesday evening. State Health Commissioner Dr. Nirav R. Shah will be at the Mohawk Fire Department today at 1:00PM to administer shots.

"We promised local officials that the state would send any resource needed to help communities and New Yorkers recover from this storm," Governor Cuomo said. "When the Village of Mohawk Mayor James Baron told me that he needed more tetanus shots, I immediately picked up the phone and called State Health Commissioner Nirav Shah to get more of these critical vaccines to those who need them here in Herkimer and Mohawk."

The free tetanus shots will be administered by Herkimer County Public Health staff from 9am-noon this morning at the Salvation Army in Herkimer; 431 N Prospect St, Herkimer, NY 13350; and then from 1pm-3:30pm at the Fire Station in Mohawk Village, 28 Columbia St, Mohawk, NY 13407.
