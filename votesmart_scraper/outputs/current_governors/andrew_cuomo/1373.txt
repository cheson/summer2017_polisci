Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today issued the following update on this weekend's transformer fire at Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant in Westchester:
"Our investigation of this weekend's incident at Indian Point is ongoing as we continue the containment and clean-up phase. The State Department of Environmental Conservation and New York State Police are working closely with the U.S. Coast Guard to monitor the situation and determine the series of events leading up to the transformer fire, as well as the totality of the environmental impact. I thank the responders who are on the ground working around the clock to ensure a thorough cleanup of the area. We will share more information about our investigation as it becomes available."
The following steps are being taken to address the incident:
Under the close oversight of the State Department of Environmental Conservation and the U.S. Coast Guard, power plant operator Entergy and its contractors continue to clean up the oil spill both on and off site at Indian Point. Contractor Clean Harbors removed the foam that was observed at the plant site and contractor Miller Environmental is replacing booms on the river today.
DEC and U.S. Coast Guard staff have begun to evaluate the environmental damage, including to the Hudson River. To assist with this effort, the New York State Police conducted an overflight with a U.S. Coast Guard observer this afternoon. While DEC spills responders have observed sheens on both the east and west sides of the Hudson River, no recoverable amounts have been noted at this time.
DEC anticipates having an estimate of the amount oil recovered from the Hudson River by the end of the week. Some oil burned during the transformer fire or dispersed before containment was in place in the river.
