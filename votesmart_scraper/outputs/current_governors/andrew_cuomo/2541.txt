Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 19, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that $738 million has been awarded through Round Two of the Regional Economic Development Council initiative.

A centerpiece of the Governor's strategy to jumpstart the economy and create jobs, the Regional Councils were put in place in 2011 to redesign the state's approach to economic development from a top-down model to a community-based, performance-driven approach. The initiative empowers community, business, and academic leaders, as well as members of the public in each region of the state, to develop strategic plans specifically tailored to their region's unique strengths and resources in order create jobs and support economic growth.

As part of the second round of the Regional Council process, Governor Cuomo, Lieutenant Governor Robert Duffy, and a Strategic Implementation Assessment Team composed of state agency commissioners with Brookings Institution and senior staff, traveled to every region of the state to view progress on projects that have received state funding, as well as assess projects included in the region's 2012 application.

"For the second year in a row, the Regional Councils have been on the forefront of rebuilding New York State's economy," Governor Cuomo said. "For too many years, top-down economic development policies have failed communities across the state and not truly invested in the unique resources and strengths of each of New York's regions. The strategic plans created during this process have given each region a comprehensive, locally created plan for future economic growth. With this second round of Regional Economic Development Council awards, the state is recognizing the creativity and innovation of each strategic plan, while investing hundreds of millions of dollars to put New Yorkers back to work and rebuild our economy."

Lieutenant Governor Robert Duffy, Chair of the Regional Economic Development Councils said, "Together with Governor Cuomo, we have traveled to every region of the state, listened to local business and community leaders, and seen firsthand the progress that has been made and potential for future growth. Under the Regional Economic Development Councils, it is clear that New York State is on the path to building an economy made for the 21st Century. I commend each of the Co-Chairs and their teams for the countless hours that went into these plans, and congratulate them on their hard work and achievements."

Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos said, "The Regional Councils are one of the many ways New York is working to attract and promote business growth and investment, and proving that it is once again open for business. I applaud Governor Cuomo and Lieutenant Governor Duffy for their hard work and vision, and for making this a truly collaborative process. I congratulate the winners on putting forward plans that will create jobs and enhance communities -- both small and large -- across the state."

Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said, "The Regional Economic Development Councils are developing job growth plans that are tailored to fit each area's unique resources and competitive advantages. The strategic decision-making is a collaborative effort among community leaders who most clearly see what each region needs to spur economic growth. This is how smart, 21st Century economic development is done and I am so pleased to see this working in New York."

Consistent with the Governor's Executive Order to increase Minority and Women Business Enterprise (MWBE) participation in state contracting, all projects awarded grants through this initiative must use best efforts to reach the goal of 20% MWBE participation.
