"On Yom Hashoah, we pay tribute to the more than six million Jews and countless others whose lives were tragically lost during the Holocaust.

"Last month, on a solidarity and economic development mission to Israel, I had the privilege of touring Yad Vashem with Israeli President Rivlin. Standing in the Hall of Names was one of my most emotional moments as governor, and something that stood out to me was the hebrew word "zachor' or remember. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I laid a wreath in honor and memory of all those who were killed -- children, families and loved ones -- during of one of the darkest and most horrific periods in history.

"As New Yorkers, we must recommit ourselves to the ideals of acceptance, freedom of expression and the right to worship. This is what defines us as a state. Let us honor the memories of the victims by continuing to speak out against hate and intolerance, improving the world around us and building a stronger, brighter future for us all."
