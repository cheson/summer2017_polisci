Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 3, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"One World Trade Center serves as a symbol of the resilience of the people of New York. Today, as we open its doors for the first time, we remember that strength and courage will always conquer weakness and cowardice, and that the American spirit, defended by proud New Yorkers, will not be defeated. That lesson and that example live on today as powerful as they were 13 years ago. This is a tremendous day for all New Yorkers, proving once again that the spirit of resurgence and community lives on stronger than ever before."
