"The Hunts Point Terminal Produce Cooperative will be staying in the South Bronx and will continue to provide goods to countless New Yorkers. This positive economic news for both the city and state is the result of true collaboration between local, state and federal governments, wholesalers and taxpayers. I want to thank Mayor Bloomberg, his team and the leadership of the New York State Economic Development Corporation for their hard work to forge this agreement. The Co-op will continue to be an integral part of the South Bronx community and will benefit the entire city's economy for years to come. I applaud the Hunts Point Terminal Produce Cooperative for its commitment to the community, city and state, and look forward to seeing it continue to thrive in the Bronx.
