Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Nov. 12, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Transit Wireless have launched the Phase 4 expansion of wireless, public safety and Wi-Fi services to 21 underground subway stations in the Bronx and 16 in Manhattan. In addition, Transit Wireless has initiated design and construction work on the fifth phase of the seven-phase project to wire all 279 underground MTA stations. When completed, Phase 5 will bring another 37 stations online by mid-2016, including the first stations in Brooklyn.
"More and more, access to high speed internet is a necessity and many New Yorkers cannot afford to be blacked out while trying to get from point A to point B," Governor Cuomo said. "By ensuring that subways stations throughout the city offer full Wi-Fi capabilities, we are not only improving rider experience, but also making public transportation a more viable option for those who work in and around our city."
