By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

"Congratulations to Dr. Kristina M. Johnson on her appointment as the 13th Chancellor of the State University of New York. Dr. Johnson is an exceptional talent who brings an extensive record in higher education, the sciences, and the private sector to the SUNY community.
"From her groundbreaking research and her experience at some of the nation's finest academic institutions to her service as Under Secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy, she has a proven track record of leadership and innovation. I applaud the Board of Trustees for this outstanding selection. New York is leading the way in public higher education, and Dr. Johnson will help maintain the upward trajectory of one of the nation's largest systems of higher education.
"I would also like to thank Chancellor Nancy Zimpher for her tremendous contributions to SUNY over the last eight years. She was a fearless advocate for the SUNY system who worked tirelessly to turn it into the world-renowned institution that it is today. Nancy has left her mark not only on SUNY, but its excellent faculty and staff, its outstanding students, and all New Yorkers."
