Governor Cuomo Announces State University System to Raise Minimum Wage For Its Employees to $15 An Hour
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 4, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo unveiled the first signature proposal of his 2016 agenda -- his push to restore economic justice by making New York the first state in the nation to enact a $15 minimum wage for all workers. While highlighting this proposal, the Governor announced that the State University of New York will raise the minimum wage for more than 28,000 employees. This increase for SUNY employees will mirror the phased-in schedule for fast food workers secured last year, as well as State Workers announced in October.
The Governor made this announcement at a rally in New York City, where he was joined by US Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez, Actor Steve Buscemi, 1199 President George Gresham, 32BJ President Hector Figueroa, Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer, NYC Public Advocate Letitia James, more than 40 state and local elected officials, union leaders, clergy members and other advocates to kick off the campaign for his $15 all-industry minimum wage proposal.
"This state thrives when every New Yorker has the opportunity and the ability to succeed. Yet the truth is that today's minimum wage still leaves far too many people behind -- unacceptably condemning them to a life of poverty even while they work full-time," said Governor Cuomo. "This year, we are going to change that. We are going to raise the minimum wage to bring economic opportunity back to millions of hardworking New Yorkers and lead the nation in the fight for fair pay."
