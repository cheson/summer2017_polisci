Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the Department of Financial Services has published a Consumer Bill of Rights for New Yorkers facing foreclosure. Additionally, DFS has also finalized a regulation protecting communities from the blight of "zombie properties" by requiring banks and mortgage servicers to report and maintain vacant and abandoned properties.
Both actions follow legislation the Governor signed in June that curbs the threat "zombie properties" pose to communities by expediting foreclosure proceedings, improving the efficiency and integrity of the mandatory settlement conferences, and obligating banks and mortgage servicers to secure, protect and maintain vacant and abandoned properties before and during foreclosure proceedings.
"These reforms help ensure New Yorkers at risk of foreclosure know their rights, that banks and mortgage servicers are held to their obligations, and that neighborhoods across the state are protected from the blight of zombie properties, which threaten property values, as well as public safety," Governor Cuomo said. "These steps will help protect the quality of life in our communities and preserve the American Dream in New York."
