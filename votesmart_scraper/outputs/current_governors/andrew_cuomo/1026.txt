Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 18, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that $30 million has been awarded to 34 high-need school districts to increase access to high-quality pre-kindergarten for a total of 3,295 students in communities across the state. The funding, which was originally committed by Governor Cuomo in his 2015 Opportunity Agenda, supports the expansion of pre-k for both 3- and 4-year old students for the first time in more than a decade. This combined approach is part of the State's ongoing efforts to promote early education, specifically in high-needs districts where such programs can be most beneficial in increasing academic outcomes for students.
"Access to a quality education from a young age can unlock a student's potential and put them on a path to success years into the future," said Governor Cuomo. "That's what this funding is all about -- it's an investment in the future of thousands of children across the state, and I am proud that we are able to help those students begin learning early on."
