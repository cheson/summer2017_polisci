Governor Cuomo Announces New York's Intent to Sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Over Eastern Long Island Sound Disposal Site Designation
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 6, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that New York intends to sue the United States Environmental Protection Agency and challenge EPA's decision to designate the eastern Long Island Sound as a permanent disposal site for dredged materials. In a letter filed today, New York informed the federal government that the EPA's designation of the eastern Long Island Sound as a disposal site is a direct violation of the designation criteria outlined in existing federal law, referred to as the "Ocean Dumping Act."
"As I have said time and again, New York is deeply concerned with the EPA's efforts to designate a permanent dumping site in the eastern part of the Long Island Sound," Governor Cuomo said. "Continuing to use this precious economic and ecological resource as a dumping ground is unacceptable and -- on behalf of current and future generations of New Yorkers -- we intend to fight this decision using any and all legal means."
New York's notice of intent to sue comes on the same day as the EPA's publication of its final rule designating the disposal site. The State must now wait 60 days from the date of the letter before filing a legal claim against the EPA under the Ocean Dumping Act.
