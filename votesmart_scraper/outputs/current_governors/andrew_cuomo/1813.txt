Location: Albany, NY

"It is with great sadness and anger that we learn of the death of journalist Steven Sotloff at the hands of ISIS terrorists. His execution is a shocking and unacceptable act of evil that is beyond reprieve. As a member of the media, Mr. Sotloff worked to increase awareness of the problems faced by people in other parts of the world, and his death is a terrible tragedy. As New Yorkers we are especially sensitive to the pain and loss caused by terrorism and we understand we must actively confront this growing threat. And we will.

"My heart goes out to Steven Sotloff's family and friends during this difficult time."
