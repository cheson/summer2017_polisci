Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 12, 2016
Location: New York, NY

Earlier today, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo marched in the National Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City.
While at the parade, the Governor delivered brief remarks on the importance of New York State's relationship with Puerto Rico. A rush transcript of these remarks is at the bottom of this release.
The Governor also reacted to the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. At the Governor's direction, all flags on State buildings will be flown at half-staff and State law enforcement agencies are on heightened alert and actively increasing patrols in the downstate region.
A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks on Puerto Rico is below.
"This is the Puerto Rican Day parade. It's a great high spot for New York. New Yorkers stands together with Puerto Rico. We're proud of our association. As Governor of New York, I've worked very closely with Puerto Rico during their time of difficulty. We've lobbied Congress. New York can be a great political ally to Puerto Rico because they need political support.
"They have a terrible financial problem and frankly, this nation has been slow to give them the support that they need. New York can be a very strong political partner for Puerto Rico and we should be and I've urged our Congressional delegation to stand up and fight for Puerto Rico and I want New York to be the number one champion, politically, for Puerto Rico, both on national matters and here in the state. The House has passed the financial package, that's good for Puerto Rico. Not ideal. We want the Senate to act."
