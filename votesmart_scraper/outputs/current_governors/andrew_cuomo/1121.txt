Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 17, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the creation of "NY Responds" -- a comprehensive new approach for coordinating and strengthening the State's emergency preparedness. As part of NY Responds, for the first time ever, every county in New York State will have access to universal emergency management software. This software -- provided at no cost to localities -- will enable both local governments and state agencies to submit and share vital disaster-related information, ranging from incident reports and resource requests to real-time tracking of assets and weather conditions.
Additionally, Governor Cuomo announced the state is supplementing its stockpile of emergency response resources with an additional $50 million worth of equipment in advance of the winter storm season. This will include 130 SWAT plow trucks, 62 tow blowers, 16 snow plows, 16 loaders, 11 graders, 10 medium dump trucks with plows, eight truck blowers, and two high axel vehicles.These announcements correspond with the Governor's Emergency Planning Summit, held today at the State's Emergency Management and Training Academy in Albany.
"When disaster strikes, we must be able to respond quickly and effectively in order to keep New Yorkers safe, and that is what today is all about," said Governor Cuomo. "Through NY Responds, every county in this state will have access to first-class emergency management technology, which will help both local and state officials stay as informed and coordinated as possible when responding to difficult situations. This is part of how we are building this state to be stronger and smarter than ever before."
