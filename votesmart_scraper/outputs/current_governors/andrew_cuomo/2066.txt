Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today directed state agencies to prepare winter storm fighting assets and personnel for an impending Nor'easter winter storm that is expected to hit New York State from late Wednesday through Thursday. As the storm approaches the state, the Governor reminded citizens to prepare properly and avoid unnecessary travel.

"I have again directed state agencies to prepare and coordinate resources for the Nor'easter that is forecasted for late tonight and into Thursday," Governor Cuomo said. "As we have done in previous storms this season, the State is directing necessary resources to the areas in greatest need, and we will be flexible in our ability to redirect equipment and personnel as the storm reaches the state. I urge all New Yorkers to take appropriate steps to prepare for the storm, check on their families and friends, particularly the elderly and vulnerable, and to avoid any unnecessary travel. The best way to stay informed is to pay attention to local media outlets and heed any advice from local professional emergency management personnel."
