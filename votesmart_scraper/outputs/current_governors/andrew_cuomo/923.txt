Governor Cuomo today announced seven winners in the third round of the New York State Pathways in Technology Early College High School partnership awards. These new public-private educational partnerships add an additional 1,500 students to the nearly 9,000 New York high school students from rounds one and two who are preparing for high-skill jobs in technology, manufacturing and healthcare-related fields. Students will earn an associate degree at no cost to their families and will be first in line for jobs with participating companies when they graduate.
"This program is transforming our education system by giving students the skills and experience they need to succeed in the competitive global workforce," said Governor Cuomo. "These P-TECH awards are enabling our partner organizations to make a real difference in the lives of children across the state. I am proud to be supporting them and helping some of our brightest young minds prepare for the opportunities of the future."
