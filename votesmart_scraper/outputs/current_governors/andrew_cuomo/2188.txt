Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that New York State has won a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) SunShot Initiative Rooftop Solar Challenge II award to support NYSolar Smart, a project to streamline the solar installation process in the state and lower the cost of solar using innovative financing mechanisms and information technology (IT) solutions, which was developed by the City University of New York (CUNY) under the Governor's NY-Sun initiative.

"We are advancing a statewide clean energy economy that protects the environment and provides new solar energy to businesses and residents," Governor Cuomo said. "This award from the U.S. Department of Energy will help move our NY-Sun initiative forward as we collaborate with local government and organizations to establish best practices on solar installation, develop innovative information technology tools and reduce the cost of solar energy. I thank the federal government for their support as we continue to make New York State a clean energy leader."

NYSolar Smart is a collaborative effort among CUNY; New York Power Authority (NYPA), which will match the $1.4 million federal award with $500,000; the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), which will provide a $100,000 match; 16 cities, towns and villages representing more than 50 percent of New York State residents, which will provide $390,800 to the effort; and more than 30 organizations representing utility companies, installers, government agencies and industry leaders.
