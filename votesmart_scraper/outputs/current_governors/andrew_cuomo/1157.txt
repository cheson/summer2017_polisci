Governor Cuomo announced the on-time completion of construction on one of the main bridges over Cattaraugus Creek. The $14.6 million project worked to realign the intersection of NY Routes 5 and 438 with U.S. Route 20 in the towns of Hanover in Chautauqua County, Brant in Erie County and the Cattaraugus Territory of the Seneca Nation of Indians.
"Maintaining our infrastructure is critical to the well-being of our State. We are committed to improving our older bridges, which still serve as vital links across counties and regions for commerce and recreation," Governor Cuomo said. "With enhanced safety measures and increased access for motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians, this reconstructed bridge will serve Western New York for years to come."
