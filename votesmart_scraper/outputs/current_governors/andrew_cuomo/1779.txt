On Wednesday morning, Rob Astorino gave a policy speech before the Association for a Better New York. And he was asked again about debates with Cuomo.
"All of the sudden we get a surprise this weekend from the Governor who says that they have accepted and agreed to two debates. We had zero discussions between the two campaigns," Astorino said.
On Saturday the Cuomo campaign announced it had agreed to two debates. We asked if there had been any negotiations at all between the two campaigns on the terms or format for those debates.
"There was some email traffic back and forth and we've talked to the campaign manager since then. We got two invitations, we accepted them," said Democratic Party consultant Peter Kauffman.
But a series of emails provided by Astorino's campaign show that negotiations between the two campaign managers were fairly one-sided.
Astorino's campaign manager Mike Lawler first reached out to Cuomo's campaign manager Joe Percoco in August. He never heard back. The conversation resumed September 18 when Lawler sent Percoco an email which read, "I'd like to discuss the debate schedule and format."
