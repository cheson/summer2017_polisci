Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the wildfire in Sam's Point Preserve in Ulster County has been fully contained. More than 2,000 acres were consumed during the course of the incident, and more than 300 first responders from state and local agencies helped fight and contain the wildfire, but no homes or major structures in the region were impacted.
"Over the past week, hundreds of first responders from Ulster County and beyond came together to battle this blaze," said Governor Cuomo. "They rose to the challenge -- putting themselves in harm's way in order to keep their fellow New Yorkers and their communities safe -- and we owe them all a debt of gratitude. I am pleased to see this wildfire fully contained, and I thank all of the brave men and women who worked tirelessly to make it possible."
Over the past week, Governor Cuomo deployed more than 110 state emergency personnel to contain this wildfire.
