Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 1, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today celebrated the opening day of trout and salmon season and announced new funding in the 2014-2015 State Budget to expand fishing opportunities across the state by improving public access to fishing sites and investing in critical infrastructure at the state's hatcheries. The funds support the NY Open for Fishing and Hunting Initiative to improve recreational activities for in-state and out-of-state sportsmen and sportswomen and to boost tourism opportunities throughout the state. The Governor also encouraged anglers to buy their fishing license online at http://licensecenter.ny.gov.
"The fishing industry in New York supports an estimated 17,000 jobs and brings in hundreds of millions in tourism dollars," Governor Cuomo said. "Upgrading facilities, opening up new recreational opportunities, streamlining licensing and reducing fees all work to support the significant economic value these activities bring to the entire state."
State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Joe Martens said, "Once again Governor Cuomo has demonstrated his commitment to creating vast opportunities for fishing and hunting in New York State. Improvements to the state's hatcheries will allow DEC to ensure New York's waterways are stocked for anglers to enjoy as we embark on opening day and throughout the fishing season."
