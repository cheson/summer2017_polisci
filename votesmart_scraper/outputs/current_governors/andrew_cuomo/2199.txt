Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the availability of $1 million in state funding to assist law enforcement agencies in smaller urban, suburban and rural communities in Upstate New York with their efforts to reduce, solve and prevent crime.

"With these Operation IMPACT Tools grants, the State is providing assistance to smaller communities in fighting crime," Governor Cuomo said. "This program aims to help law enforcement agencies with limited resources by encouraging initiatives such as partnerships and data and information sharing. These grants will help make our streets and neighborhoods safer, and I encourage local agencies to apply for this funding."

Operation IMPACT Tools grants are available to law enforcement agencies in 40 Upstate counties that are not otherwise covered by Operation IMPACT, which provides funding to reduce gun and other violent crime in the 17 counties that account for 80 percent of the reported crime in the state outside of New York City. Agencies within the 17 IMPACT jurisdictions not already funded through that program are also eligible to apply for Tools grants.

Operation IMPACT Tools aims to encourage law enforcement agencies in smaller jurisdictions to use the four basic components of the Operation IMPACT program -- active partnerships; timely, accurate crime data; sharing of information; and effective strategies -- to reduce violent crime in their communities. Both programs are administered by the state Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS).

Agencies can apply for up to $50,000 in grant funding. Initiatives that would be considered for IMPACT Tools funding include:
Enforcement/Investigative Operations: Includes requests for overtime funding for operations and patrols such as directed patrols and warrant sweeps;
