"Global climate change is one of the defining issues of our time -- and today marks a monumental step toward addressing its challenges. The agreement in Paris establishes an important framework for addressing the costly and tragic effects of severe, unprecedented storms like Super Storm Sandy and the devastating impacts of sea level rise.
"New Yorkers stand ready to do their part. We are committed to requiring that 50 percent of the power used in our state is from renewable resources by 2030. We are also demonstrating through our work with the RGGI consortium that collaboration between governments can have a real impact in reducing harmful carbon emissions.
"I congratulate the participants of the Paris talks for their hard work and courage in moving this agreement forward, and I also thank Richard Kauffman, our Chairman of Energy and Finance for representing all New Yorkers in Paris. Together, we will continue to advance a renewable vision for the future."
