Governor Cuomo Announces Housing Extension for Sandy Victims
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 7, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), at the request of the State of New York, has approved a 14-day extension to the Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) program, which allows eligible survivors from Hurricane Sandy who cannot return to their homes to stay in participating hotels or motels.

The new checkout date for those in the TSA program is March 24, 2013. FEMA will call applicants eligible for the extension to notify them of the new checkout date.

"This extension for the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program will give New Yorkers hit hardest by Sandy more time and a place to stay so that they can get back on their feet soon as possible," Governor Cuomo said.

This is a short-term program that places families in hotels while they work toward a longer-term housing plan.

To be eligible for TSA, survivors must first apply for federal assistance through FEMA by:
Registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov;
Registering via smartphone or tablet by using the FEMA app or going to m.fema.gov; or
Registering by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362) (TTY 800-462-7585). For 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 800-621-3362.
