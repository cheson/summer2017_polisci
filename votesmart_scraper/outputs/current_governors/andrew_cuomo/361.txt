Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced Taste NY partnerships with five Minor League Baseball teams in New York, who will now offer Taste NY branding and locally-made goods and beverages from Taste NY vendors throughout their stadiums. Following a successful partnership with Tri-City ValleyCats in 2015, Taste NY is expanding its partnership with Minor League Baseball to increase the promotion of New York agricultural products at ballparks across the state.
"New York grown and made food and beverages are second to none and building upon the great success of the Taste NY program, we are partnering with local baseball stadiums to expose even more New Yorkers to these great Empire State products," Governor Cuomo said. "When New Yorkers buy New York products from New York businesses, the home team wins every time."
The Tri-City ValleyCats, Batavia Muckdogs, Auburn Doubledays, Staten Island Yankees, and Rochester Red Wings will now serve Taste NY products throughout the season. Together, these stadiums see approximately 820,000 seasonal visitors and those fans will be treated to the same great ballpark staples, such has hot dogs, hamburgers, and ice cold beer -- now sourced from some of New York State's best agricultural producers. Taste NY has helped vendors triple their gross annual sales from 2014 to 2015, and with this increased promotion, they are on track to doubling those sales in 2016.
