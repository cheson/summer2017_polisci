Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that, with New York State's assistance, the Buffalo Zoo broke ground on its new $14 million state-of-the-art habitat for polar bears and other Arctic species. With the assistance of $750,000 from the Governor's NY Works program, the planned Arctic Edge exhibit will create a new home for the zoo's popular polar bear cubs.

"Today's groundbreaking on a new state-of-the-art habitat for Buffalo's polar bear cubs is the culmination of efforts by the State, Erie County and the City of Buffalo," Governor Cuomo said. "As the most visited tourist destination in Erie County, the Buffalo Zoo is a major asset in our efforts to boost tourism in Upstate New York. This new exhibit will help attract even more visitors to Buffalo, while enhancing visitors' experience to the Zoo. We are pleased to be able to keep Luna and Kali in Buffalo and welcome New Yorkers and tourists to come visit their new home."

Buffalo Zoo President Donna Fernandes said, "We are extremely grateful to Governor Cuomo for his support of the Arctic Edge exhibit. We appreciate his recognition of the important role the Buffalo Zoo plays for bringing hundreds of thousands of people to Western New York. Our deepest thanks go out to the Governor for helping make today's groundbreaking possible and ensuring that our bears will remain in Buffalo."
