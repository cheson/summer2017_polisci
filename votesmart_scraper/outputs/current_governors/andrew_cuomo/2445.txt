Statement from Governor Cuomo on New York's Improving Fiscal Outlook due to On-Time Budgets
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 21, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"For the first time in almost three decades our state is poised to pass its third on time fiscally responsible budget in a row, a feat that is restoring public and investor confidence in our state's finances and economic future. The dysfunction in Albany created a fiscal mess for our state that seemed impossible to overcome but now, by making government function, cutting taxes and controlling spending, New York is seeing its highest investor confidence since 2009 as measured by the rally in our bonds. This past month S&P reaffirmed the positive rating that it gave the state last year. New York is back on the right fiscal track and, with the passage of our third on-time balanced budget which cuts taxes for the middle class and holds the line on spending, our future has never been brighter."
