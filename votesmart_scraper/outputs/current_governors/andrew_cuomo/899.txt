Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the Medal of Honor awarded posthumously to Sgt. Henry Johnson, an Albany resident, for his heroism during World War I is now on display in the War Room of the New York State Capitol.
"Sgt. Henry Johnson was a hero and a patriot who for far too long was denied the recognition and honor he deserved," said Governor Cuomo. "I'm proud to host his long overdue Medal of Honor at the Capitol and I thank Senator Schumer and Sgt. Johnson's many supporters for their efforts to right this historic wrong. As we approach Veterans Day, I encourage New Yorkers to visit this display and learn more about Sgt. Johnson's incredible life, as well as take a moment to acknowledge the many brave men and women who have served in defense of our nation and its ideals."
