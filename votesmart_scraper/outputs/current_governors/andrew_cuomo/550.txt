Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that New York State seeks to file an amicus brief in support of overturning a discriminatory North Carolina law that infringes upon the civil rights of LGBT people. The law, House Bill 2, bars transgender individuals from using restrooms appropriate for their gender identities, excludes sexual orientation and gender identity from state anti-discrimination protections, and prohibits municipalities from extending those protections to LGBT citizens. The Governor's amicus brief will be filed in support of litigation filed by four organizations -- Lambda Legal, the ACLU, the ACLU of North Carolina and Equality North Carolina -- challenging the law in federal court.
"Discriminating against people on the basis of their gender identity is not just wrong, it is undeniably illegal," said Governor Cuomo. "This kind of divisiveness cannot be allowed to stand. I urge the court to overturn HB2 and uphold the basic principle of equality and justice for all."
Governor Cuomo's announcement of the amicus brief follows yesterday's letter from the U.S. Department of Justice informing North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory that HB2 violates Titles VII and IX of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person's sex.
In March, following the enactment of HB2, Governor Cuomo signed an executive order banning non-essential state travel to North Carolina.
