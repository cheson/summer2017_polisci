Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today issued the following statement in response to the announcement of support of the New York State and New York City Bar Associations for his proposal to require state lawmakers to fully disclose all outside income they receive.
"The bottom line is that New Yorkers will never trust government until they know the who, what and where of outside employment and unprecedented reforms put forward by this administration and the New York State Assembly will do just that. The New York State and New York City Bar Associations' affirmation that our proposal does not conflict with attorney-client privilege eliminates any excuses as to why this should not be law.
"These organizations uphold the highest standards in their profession, and their support of this proposal is greatly appreciated. I look forward to working with them and with my colleagues in both houses of the legislature to pass these reforms and restore trust in our state government."
