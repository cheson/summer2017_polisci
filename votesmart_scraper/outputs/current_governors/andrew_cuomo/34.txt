Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Ramadan
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 26, 2017
Location: Albany, NY

"Tonight, many New Yorkers will join with family and friends to begin the holy month of Ramadan, a sacred time to reflect while fasting and practicing exceptional discipline and patience.
"Ramadan is a holiday that encourages gratitude and generosity, to appreciate all we have and to remember to put the needs of the less fortunate first.
"At a time when those who practice the Muslim faith are unfairly targeted, we must defend the right to free religious expression more than ever before. We must stand up to those who seek to divide us, because, as New Yorkers, our diversity is our strength.
"To those who observe, I wish you a blessed and peaceful Ramadan."
