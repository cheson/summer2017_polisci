"Thanksgiving is an opportunity to express appreciation for all that we hold dear -- to gather with friends and family and celebrate life's blessings. It is also an opportunity to recommit ourselves to giving back to those around us.
"New Yorkers have always been known for generosity and selflessness in times of need. I saw that firsthand in Western New York last week, where everyone from neighbors on the same block to first responders from across the State came together to help dig out from one of the worst snowstorms to hit the region in years. That spirit of giving is what defines us as a state, and it is one of the many things for which I am thankful. As we celebrate Thanksgiving, I encourage all New Yorkers to give back to their communities and help those in need.
"From my family to yours, I wish all a happy and safe Thanksgiving."
