Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 8, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today unveiled the ninth signature proposal of his 2016 agenda -- a Municipal Consolidation and Efficiency Competition designed to reward local governments that take real steps to make living and working in New York State more affordable.
The competition will challenge counties, cities, towns and villages to develop innovative consolidation action plans yielding significant and permanent property tax reductions. The consolidation partnership that proposes and can implement the greatest permanent reduction in property taxes will receive a $20 million award.
"We've made tremendous progress over the past five years to make New York more affordable, and this year we are going to keep that momentum going from the ground up," said Governor Cuomo. "This competition will help local governments find innovative ways to reduce costs and lower taxes for their constituents -- which will make it cheaper to live, work and thrive in their communities. This is about building a stronger and more prosperous New York over the long haul, and I am eager to help our local partners across the state move forward."
