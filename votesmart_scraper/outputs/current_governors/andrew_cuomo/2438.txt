Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 25, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Tonight, families and communities all across New York will celebrate the first night of Passover. Passover is a holiday that commemorates the freeing of the Jewish people from slavery. It is a story of courage and redemption which, to this day, inspires people all across the world.

As New Yorkers gather with family and loved ones during this time, let us reflect and strengthen our efforts to create a better future and equal society for all. My best wishes for a happy and joyous Passover.
