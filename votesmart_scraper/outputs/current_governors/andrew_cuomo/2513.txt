Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), at the request of the State of New York, has approved a 14-day extension to the Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) program and a 30-day extension for the Individual Assistance (IA) program. This action will allow eligible survivors from Hurricane Sandy who cannot return to their homes to stay in participating hotels or motels and enable eligible individuals the ability to receive federal assistance for repairing their damaged properties.

The new TSA extension will allow applicants to remain in participating hotels until February 9, 2013. FEMA will call applicants eligible for the extension to notify them of the extended 14-day period and the checkout date of February 10, 2013.

The IA extension will provide an additional 30 days for individuals and businesses to apply to FEMA for assistance for home repairs and other needs and to the Small Business Administration for loans.

"We remain committed to assisting all victims of Hurricane Sandy, ensuring that they have the shelter they need, especially in this cold weather,¬ù Governor Cuomo said. "The Transitional Sheltering Assistance program will continue to provide shelter to those New Yorkers who do not have homes to return and help others with critically needed funding to rebuild.

TSA is short-term program that places families in hotels while they work toward a longer-term housing plan. Individuals must be checked in to the program by January 26, 2013 to be eligible.

To be eligible for FEMA Programs, survivors must first apply for federal assistance through FEMA by:

Registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov;
Registering via smartphone or tablet by using the FEMA app or going to m.fema.gov; or
