Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 2, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the approval of $6.2 million to support seven economic development projects in the Finger Lakes, Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley, Mid-Hudson and Long Island regions. These projects will directly retain nearly 1,600 existing jobs. The funding, approved by Empire State Development's (ESD) Board of Directors, will leverage more than $51 million in private and additional public investments to support business expansions and lay the groundwork for future economic growth and job creation in the medical, manufacturing construction, energy and education industries.
"Targeted state investments are creating jobs and supporting major economic development projects in communities across the state," Governor Cuomo said. "By supporting these seven projects, we are creating new opportunities for New Yorkers with essential funds for new jobs, new facilities and new tools to improve their business operations. With more than 440,000 new private sector jobs created since 2010, New York's economic progress is moving in the right direction, supported by the lowest business and middle class tax rates in a generation and a state investment strategy that is working."
"The funding will help businesses and communities continue to grow across New York State, and that means more jobs for New Yorkers," said Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Kenneth Adams. "Our goal is to help businesses find new ways to invest and expand, which results in a stronger economy statewide."
