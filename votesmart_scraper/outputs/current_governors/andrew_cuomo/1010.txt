Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced the start of construction on $35 million in projects to make Roberto Clemente State Park's Harlem River waterfront greener and more storm-resilient. The projects will strengthen the park and surrounding neighborhood against flooding, as well as renovate the park's upper plaza to create a more welcoming gateway for the park's 1.3 million visitors.
"The work underway at Roberto Clemente State park is yet another example of our work to strengthen vital infrastructure and make our communities more resilient in this new reality of extreme weather," Governor Cuomo said. "This project will improve a critical coastal protection measure for the Morris Heights neighborhood, helping to protect the area's residents, businesses and parks from the impact of future storms and flooding."
