Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Tentative Agreement Between the NFL and Terry and Kim Pegula to Purchase the Buffalo Bills
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 9, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"From day one, keeping the Bills in Buffalo has been one of our administration's top priorities, and reports that Terry and Kim Pegula have been chosen as the team's new owners highlight a tremendous step toward making that goal a reality. The Bills are an integral part of Western New York, from its economy to its culture, and as the team's new owners the Pegulas will ensure that the Bills remain at the core of the region's identity -- just as the late Ralph Wilson, Jr. did for 54 years. Terry and Kim have already shown their commitment to the region through the Buffalo Sabres and the construction of the HarborCenter development, and I look forward to working with them in the years to come to keep the Bills in Buffalo, where they belong."
