Governor Cuomo Attends First NY Rising Community Reconstruction Meeting in Town of Jay
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 4, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today attended the New York Rising Community Reconstruction Planning Committee's inaugural meeting for the Towns of Jay and Keene, where planning experts, community officials, and residents gathered to kick off the long-term rebuilding process following the major storms over the past two years. The meeting was held at the Jay Town Hall today.

The New York Rising Community Reconstruction Program -- launched earlier this year by the Governor and funded by the federal recovery dollars -- is designed to empower communities that suffered significant damage in recent storms to create and implement locally-oriented strategies to rebuild and better prepare for future extreme weather. The Towns of Jay and Keene are eligible to receive up to $3 million each to help prepare a comprehensive plan to guide their recovery and long-term rebuilding.

"The New York Rising Community Reconstruction Program empowers communities across the state that have been hit hard by extreme weather over the last few years to come together and build back stronger and smarter," Governor Cuomo said. "This program pairs a ground-up approach that utilizes local expertise with state-level support, allowing communities to develop their own plans to repair critical infrastructure and strengthen essential services. The end result is one that benefits the whole state's future -- communities that are not only rebuilt, but reconstructed to be more resilient and prepared for any future storms."

Located in 102 communities across the state, New York Rising Community Reconstruction Planning Committees are comprised of community leaders, experts, and officials who incorporate their community's unique needs into their redevelopment strategies. Communities have eight months to prepare and submit their plans. Grant amounts will be based on FEMA assessed damage levels as well as applications for new infrastructure and other mitigation, and will be awarded once the community's plan is complete and submitted to the State for approval. The communities will be eligible to share in more than $500 million of funding made available through the federal supplemental appropriation the Governor worked with Congress to obtain earlier this year.

The State will also award at least $250 million of the State's FEMA-funded Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) to New York Rising Communities to implement eligible projects contained in their plans. In addition, a $3 million bonus will be awarded for best plans in several categories, including community involvement, use of technology in planning, and best regional collaboration.
