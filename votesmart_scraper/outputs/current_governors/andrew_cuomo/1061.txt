Governor Cuomo Announces New Yorkers Have Scheduled 700,000 DMV Online Reservations Since 2013
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 9, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that New Yorkers have scheduled more than 700,000 reservations to visit state-operated Department of Motor Vehicles offices since introducing the service on its website in 2013. Customers who make reservations online ahead of office visits, reserving a day and time convenient for them, are able to avoid wait times. Those wait times have decreased dramatically since the launch of DMV's Customer Service Initiative, which the agency began at Governor Cuomo's direction in 2012 to increase efficiency and streamline services.
"This innovation has resulted in dramatically reduced wait times at the Department of Motor Vehicles and is part of this administration's efforts to create a smarter, more efficient state government," Governor Cuomo said. "By using the latest technology to handle the most commonly required services at the DMV, we are providing a better customer experience and I encourage all New Yorkers to take advantage of this timesaving resource."
As part of the Customer Service Initiative, DMV made improvements to its offices, its website, and its call centers, where new technology expedites the 4.5 million calls the agency receives each year. At most state-run offices, employees with tablets greet customers upon arriving to ensure they can efficiently navigate the office with the correct documents in hand, and self-serve kiosks allow customers to complete transactions and bypass lines, saving them time. DMV averages more than 300,000 transactions at kiosks per year.
