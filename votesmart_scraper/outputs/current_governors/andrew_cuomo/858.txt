Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the State is launching new security measures at Planned Parenthood sites across New York State. The State Police began increase patrols at Planned Parenthood locations across the state on Friday and on Monday will visit the more than 60 Planned Parenthood clinics and locations throughout New York to assist with security and emergency planning measures.
"Friday's shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic was a senseless act of violence that has left us shocked and heartbroken. While we are still learning more about what led to this horrendous attack in Colorado, we are taking appropriate precautions and doing everything possible to prevent similar tragedies from taking place in our state," said Governor Cuomo. "The State Police will be patrolling clinics across New York on Monday, and our administration is working closely with dedicated Planned Parenthood staff and our local partners to ensure the safety of these health centers throughout the state. My thoughts and prayers are with all who were injured in Friday's attack, as well as the loved ones of those who died in that terrible tragedy."
