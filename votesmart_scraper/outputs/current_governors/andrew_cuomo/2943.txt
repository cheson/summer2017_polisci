By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

"The Pepsi Bottling Company's decision to recommit to Westchester for its headquarters - and preserve the more than 900 jobs there - is tremendous news for the region's economy, and illustrates our state's appeal to global corporations. Job creation and retention are vital components to building a new New York, and my administration is committed to the statewide reforms necessary to improve the state's business climate in order to retain and attract economic development opportunities."
