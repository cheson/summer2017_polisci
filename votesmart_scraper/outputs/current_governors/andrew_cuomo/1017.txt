Given the uncertainty of U.S. Department of Energy operations at its American Centrifuge Project in Piketon and cleanup activities at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Governor John R. Kasich has directed state agencies to put in motion efforts to assist potentially impacted workers. Kasich is also working with members of Ohio's Congressional delegation from the region to see what can be done to address the Obama Administration's disappointing decision.
"Ohioans working on these federal projects in southern Ohio must feel as if the rug has been pulled out beneath their feet by the Obama Administration's failure to keep their promises to help make loan guarantees available and ensure the future prosperity of this community," Kasich said. "We share their disbelief and are sympathetic to those who might be displaced by the Obama Administration's short-sighted and misguided decision to move centrifuge research to Tennessee and we are standing by ready to assist any impacted workers. We also stand ready to assist those workers that may be impacted as Department of Energy considers further funding cuts that would slow needed cleanup efforts at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant."
