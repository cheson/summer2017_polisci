New York State of the State Address 2012
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 4, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

Following is a transcript of Gov. Andrew Cuomo's (D) 2012 state of the state address:
One year ago -- almost to the day -- I delivered my first State of the State address as your Governor.
I said last year that New York was at a crossroads.
New Yorkers were hurting. The economy was causing hardship and anxiety. People needed help. But our State government was mired in scandal, ineffective, and rife with partisanship.
One year ago, we were divided as a state: Upstate and Downstate, millionaires and the middle class, gay and straight, Democrats and Republicans.
Our state had a deficit. And not just a fiscal deficit, but even worse, a trust deficit, a performance deficit, and an integrity deficit.
New Yorkers deserved better -- and New Yorkers knew it.
For me, the Capitol building itself was a symbol of the deterioration, decline, and dysfunction of State government. It had been under renovation for eleven years, and it was scheduled to take an additional four. By the time they were done with the repairs, we would have had to start all over again!
The situation was grim. Our people had problems, and our government did not have the capacity or the credibility to help.
New Yorkers had a choice to make. We could remain dysfunctional and divided, or we could come together, reestablish our government, and rebuild our great state. We made the right choice.
