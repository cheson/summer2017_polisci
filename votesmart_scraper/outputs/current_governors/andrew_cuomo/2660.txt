"I commend the Senate for unanimously passing legislation that will help give more than one million New Yorkers with disabilities and special needs the protections and justice they deserve. Now both the Senate and Assembly need to work towards a final agreement so we can create the Justice Center for the Protection of People with Special Needs this year. New Yorkers who have been the victims of abuse or mistreatment cannot afford any delay in action."
