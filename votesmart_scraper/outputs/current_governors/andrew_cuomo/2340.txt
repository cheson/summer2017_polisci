Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Decision by Court of Appeals Upholding Hail Act
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 6, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's unanimous decision by the Court of Appeals is a resounding victory for fairness and for the seven million New York City residents in the outer boroughs and Upper Manhattan who have limited access to transportation. This is particularly important for those with disabilities who cannot easily use other forms of mass transit. Now that this issue has been resolved, it is my hope that we move swiftly to implement the HAIL Act and further strengthen New York City's vital transportation infrastructure."
