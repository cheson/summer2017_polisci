Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Demanding that Congress Close the Terror Gap
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 6, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"As if it weren't common-sense enough, it is clearer now than ever that members of Congress can no longer sit on their hands and shirk their responsibility to protect the American people -- they must close the terror gap. This loophole does nothing more than help radical people kill innocent Americans, and it must be closed. The fact that reform continues to languish illustrates the stranglehold the NRA has over Washington, and it's time for our elected leaders to show the political courage to vote for the safety of the American people.
"I stand with Senator Schumer and demand that Congress close the terror gap."
