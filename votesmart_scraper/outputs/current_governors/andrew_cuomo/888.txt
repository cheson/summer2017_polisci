Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today joined Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at the grand opening of the company's two new buildings at its headquarters in Tarrytown to announce the company will be expanding even further to grow its Research and Development capacity. Regeneron now occupies more than one million square feet of space and has committed to invest an additional $150 million to further expand its Tarrytown campus, which will result in at least 300 more jobs.
"Today we are continuing to show that New York is a great place to do business," said Governor Cuomo. "This expansion is proof that New York's support of businesses like Regeneron is continuing to grow the economy and create jobs in communities across the State. I look forward to seeing the biotechnology sector continue to thrive in New York in the years to come."
