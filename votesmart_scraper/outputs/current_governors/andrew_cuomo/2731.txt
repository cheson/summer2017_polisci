Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 24, 2012
Location: Albany, NY

"In his 2012 State of the Union Address, President Obama put forward a bold vision to strengthen the national economy, grow America's middle class, and protect consumers. The President is right to put private sector growth at the center of his agenda to create jobs, and his address laid out specific steps to build our country's economy not just for today but for future generations as well.
"Here in New York State we have seen the effectiveness of public-private partnerships at jumpstarting economic growth. I applaud the President's proposal to work with private industries to rebuild America's manufacturing sector and his call for tapping into alternative energy sources to power our economic recovery. As we in New York work to transform our state's education system, I welcome President Obama's call for a renewed focus on making sure all students receive the education and training they need to be successful in today and tomorrow's economy.
"Our top priority must be jobs, jobs, jobs. When the national economy improves New York benefits, and I look forward to continuing to work together with the President and our federal representatives to grow our economy."
