Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Buffalo Bills
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 3, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"As the process of finding a new owner for the Buffalo Bills moves forward, one thing is clear -- the Bills belong in Western New York. I have been in touch with the NFL and the team's potential buyers to make sure this message is heard, and I will continue to work with all interested parties until the sale is finalized. The Bills support hundreds of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in the region annually, and by being located in Western New York they benefit from the most dedicated group of fans in the NFL. Few things are as culturally, historically and economically ingrained in Buffalo as the Bills, and we intend to keep it that way."
