Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 17, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today urged all New Yorkers, in honor of The National Weather Service's Flood Safety Awareness Week, to learn the risks associated with flooding to better protect their families, businesses and communities from this type of natural disaster.

"New Yorkers have seen firsthand the devastating impact that flooding can have on our communities, but we can help prevent these effects with the proper awareness and advance preparation," Governor Cuomo said. "This week, I urge all New Yorkers to take proper precautions to better ensure the safety of our families and property."

New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Jerome M. Hauer stated, "Flooding can occur sometimes with very little warning at any time of the year. Knowing the risks associated with flooding and taken precautionary steps such as having a family emergency plan will help you and your family survive a flood if it happens in your community."

Learning the threats associated with flooding and building or updating emergency supply kits for homes and vehicles are vital steps toward being prepared that can be taken this week. For information to help prepare for and take action during a flood, please visit the New York State Office of Emergency Management's webpage at http://www.dhses.ny.gov/oem/safety-info/flood/index.cfm. New Yorkers can also get daily tips from the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services twitter feed at @NYSDHSES.

Knowing your flood risk, how to prepare for and actions to take before, during and after a flood can save lives, time and money. More information on National Flood Awareness Week can be found on the National Weather Service website at www.floodsafety.noaa.gov.
