"I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Edward Cardinal Egan. Throughout his life, Cardinal Egan encouraged others to devote themselves to the greater good. His thoughtful and compassionate stewardship helped New Yorkers grieve and recover following the events of September 11, 2001. Cardinal Egan had a powerful and positive impact on our state and the world that will continue to be felt for years to come. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest condolences to the Cardinal's family and friends, as well as the greater Catholic community throughout New York State."
