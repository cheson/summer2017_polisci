Governor Cuomo announced $75 million in grants to support 45 drinking water and wastewater infrastructure improvement projects throughout New York State. This funding will leverage more than $440 million in total project costs to improve New York's infrastructure and is expected to save local taxpayers over $284 million through a 59 percent reduction in municipal costs.
"New York invests more to protect water-quality and strengthen water infrastructure than any state in the nation," Governor Cuomo said. "These grants will make it easier for localities to make the critical upgrades that ensure their water systems continue to provide New Yorkers with safe, high-quality water."
