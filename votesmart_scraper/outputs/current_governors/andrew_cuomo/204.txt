Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced actions taken to safeguard water quality on Long Island, including the designation of a Superfund Site at Gabreski Air National Guard Base and $5 million in funding to support the development of emerging contaminant treatment systems at SUNY Stony Brook's Center for Clean Water Technology.
In addition, the Advanced Oxidative Process, a cutting-edge drinking water treatment, will be approved by the state and soon be used for the first time in New York in a pilot program to treat 1,4 dioxane contamination. These actions further the efforts of the Governor's Water Quality Rapid Response Team, launched on Long Island in February to swiftly address water quality issues across the state and develop new policies, programs, and technologies to ensure clean water for all New Yorkers.
"Ensuring that all New Yorkers have access to clean drinking water is a top priority and the Water Quality Rapid Response Team continues to take action across the state to stay ahead of this emerging challenge," said Governor Cuomo. "Working together with environmental experts, elected officials, and community stakeholders, we are holding polluters accountable, investing in water treatment technologies to keep our natural resources safe, and laying the ground work for a cleaner, brighter future for the state of New York."
