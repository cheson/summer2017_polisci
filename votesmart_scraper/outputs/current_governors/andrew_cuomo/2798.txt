"As New Yorkers around the state gather with their families and friends to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, I extend my best wishes to them for a healthy and prosperous New Year.
Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the High Holy Days, a time for both reflection and celebration. As communities come together to rejoice in the New Year, we must also be thankful for all we have and remember those in need.
These next few days also serve as an opportunity to make sure that we as New Yorkers and global citizens commit ourselves to a better future.
On behalf of all New Yorkers, I wish all those celebrating a New Year a Shana Tova Umetukah."
