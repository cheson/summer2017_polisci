Governor Cuomo announced an aggressive action plan to assist the government of Puerto Rico during a time of crisis related to its health care system and economy. The Governor and members of a solidarity delegation, which includes more than a dozen elected and industry representatives from New York, discussed the plan at the University of Puerto Rico's Medical Sciences Campus in San Juan in front of an audience of roughly 400 medical students and local residents. The plan was announced during the final hours the delegation's trip to Puerto Rico at the invitation of Puerto Rico's Governor, Alejandro García Padilla.
"This trip is about fighting to achieve fairness and parity for Puerto Rico," said Governor Cuomo. "The federal government needs to step up for Puerto Rico, and I am proud to have joined Governor Garcia Padilla to highlight the problem and help his administration find a path back to prosperity. New York and Puerto Rico have always shared a strong bond, and together we can make a difference in the lives of millions of people."
"The fiscal sustainability of Puerto Rico depends in no small part on Washington providing equitable healthcare treatment. I thank Governor Cuomo and other New York officials for standing with the people of Puerto Rico in demanding that the American citizens of Puerto Rico be treated fairly," said Governor Alejandro García Padilla. "We look forward to collaborating with our colleagues in New York as we seek to gain equitable treatment from the federal government and modernize our healthcare system."
