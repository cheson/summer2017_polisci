Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today ordered state agencies to prepare winter storm fighting assets and personnel for an impending winter storm that is expected to cover a wide portion of New York State from Tuesday through Wednesday. As the storm approaches the state, the Governor reminded citizens to prepare properly for the storm and avoid unnecessary travel.

"At my direction, state agencies are continuing to prepare and coordinate resources all across the state for the next winter storm that is forecasted to begin today," Governor Cuomo said. "The State is directing necessary resources to the areas in greatest need, and we will be flexible in our ability to redirect equipment and personnel as the storm unfolds across the state. I urge all New Yorkers to take appropriate steps to prepare for the storm, check on their families and friends, particularly the elderly and vulnerable, and to avoid any unnecessary travel. The best way to stay informed is to pay attention to local media outlets and heed any advice from local professional emergency management personnel."
