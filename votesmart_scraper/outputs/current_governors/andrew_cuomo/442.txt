"I commend state, local and federal investigators for their diligent work and tireless pursuit of justice that resulted in three arrests connected to the exploding package that seriously injured Alan Dobransky in Floyd, Oneida County on May 29. In particular, I thank the members of the FBI and the ATF, as well as the New York State Police and New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, for their assistance to Oneida County Sheriff's Office during this investigation.
"My thoughts and prayers remain with Mr. Dobransky, a 26-year DOCCS employee and retired member of the New York Air National Guard, and his family during this difficult time. I join all New Yorkers in wishing him a full and speedy recovery."
