Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $35.3 million in grants for capital projects at higher education institutions across the state. This funding is from the Higher Education Capital Matching Grant Program, which provides matching grants to private colleges and universities for the construction, rehabilitation or repair of classrooms, laboratories and other facilities. The program requires grantees to match approximately three dollars for every dollar provided by New York State.
"New York's colleges and universities are among the best in the nation -- and with this funding, we are helping them make big investments that will benefit students in both the near and long-term future," said Governor Cuomo. "I'm proud to be supporting these important projects, because they will ensure a stronger and more competitive higher education environment in New York for years to come."
The three-member Higher Education Capital Matching Grant Program Board is appointed by the Governor, with one member appointed upon the recommendation of the Temporary President of the Senate and another upon the recommendation of the Speaker of the Assembly. The current members are Robert F. Mujica, Assembly Member Deborah J. Glick and Lisa Clare Kombrink.
Gerrard P. Bushell, President & CEO of the Dormitory Authority, which administers the program, said: "These colleges and universities are major employers that help drive the New York State economy and provide critical education to the next generation. The Higher Education Capital Matching Grant Program leverages private investment with public dollars to stimulate the economy and keep New York competitive."
