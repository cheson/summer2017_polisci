"Today we held productive negotiations with representatives of the Hungarian government on the status of Central European University, a world-class institution that is accredited in New York State.
"We met to discuss a new law that threatens CEU's continued presence in Hungary and the urgent need to preserve academic freedom. We made good progress in talks with Krist√≥f Altusz, Deputy State Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
