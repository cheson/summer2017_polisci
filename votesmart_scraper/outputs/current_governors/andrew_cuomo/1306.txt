Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $11 million in grants to build, improve and preserve affordable housing for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. The 61 awards across the state's 10 regions were given to municipalities and not-for-profit organizations to help support community priorities, keep people in their homes and expand local opportunities for affordable housing.
"Everyone deserves a safe, affordable and decent place to live, and this funding will help some of our most vulnerable New Yorkers maintain their independence as well as stay in their homes," Governor Cuomo said. "We will continue to work with local partners and organizations to support affordable housing and help build stronger communities all across New York."
Counties, cities, towns and villages, as well as not-for-profit organizations, applied to the New York State Homes and Community Renewal for funding, which was available for new homeownership and housing rehabilitation. Subsequently, homeowners can apply to their local municipality or not-for-profit organization where they will be screened for eligibility for the program based on income criteria.
The awards were made through four Homes and Community Renewal affordable housing programs: (1) the Affordable Homeownership Development Program administered by the agency's Affordable Housing Corporation; (2) Access to Home; (3) Access to Home for High-Cost Medicaid Recipients Program, and (4) Residential Emergency Services to Offer Repairs to the Elderly (RESTORE).
