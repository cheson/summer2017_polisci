Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today unveiled the 13th signature proposal of his 2016 agenda: launch a "Right Priorities" initiative to further New York's status as a national leader in criminal justice and re-entry reforms. The Governor's proposal will help at-risk youth find positive opportunities in their communities, while also providing citizens who enter the criminal justice system the opportunity to rehabilitate, return home, and contribute to their communities.
"For all the progress we have made, far too many of our young people end up trapped in our criminal justice system with no path out -- and it's time that changed," said Governor Cuomo. "It can't be that every door is closed except the revolving one back into prison. We must break this vicious cycle for the betterment and safety of our communities and countless families across the state."
