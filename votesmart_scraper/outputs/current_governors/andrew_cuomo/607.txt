Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on the Passage of the 2016-17 State Budget
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 1, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Passage of this groundbreaking state budget is proof positive of government's ability to improve the lives of millions of people by being both socially and economically progressive and fiscally responsible.
"For the past six years we have defied the odds -- cutting taxes and limiting the growth of government after decades of financial mismanagement, and investing wisely in schools, infrastructure, and Upstate communities at levels never seen before. We led the way for the nation on marriage equality, gun control, and environmental protection while others simply debated. This year, we are tackling another one of the greatest issues of our time by reclaiming economic justice for hard-working people and their families.
"We have created a new promise of opportunity for the working men and women of New York by passing a $15 minimum wage statewide and the strongest paid family leave program in the nation. Now in New York, if you work hard you will have the opportunity to succeed.
"This budget shows what we can achieve when we rise above partisan politics, fear and division. In New York, we have our political differences, but we are not divided on the importance of doing what's best for our state. Instead we work together to create an economy and a society where we all can succeed."
