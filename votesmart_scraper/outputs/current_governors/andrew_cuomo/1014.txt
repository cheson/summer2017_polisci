Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that more than 195,000 New Yorkers, more than 53,000 of which were registering for the first time, have registered to vote at dmv.ny.gov using the Department of Motor Vehicles automated online system, MyDMV. The service is the first and only online voter registration process in New York State. The deadline to register to vote in the upcoming November general elections is October 9.
"These online services are bringing the voter registration process into the 21st century and knocking down the barriers that have prevented many from participating in the democratic process," Governor Cuomo said. "This is another example of our administration's efforts to create a more efficient government and I encourage eligible New Yorkers to take advantage of these services and have their voices heard."
