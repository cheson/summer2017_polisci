Governor Cuomo announced a sweeping new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policy for the State University of New York. Adopted today by the SUNY Board of Trustees, the plan includes a Chief Diversity Officer for every SUNY campus as well as strategic plans to increase diversity among students, faculty, and staff. In addition, there will be a new tool to provide students with an opportunity to voluntarily self-identify their sexual orientation and gender identity.
"New York has a long and proud history of embracing diversity, and our world-class SUNY system is no exception," Governor Cuomo said. "With this new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policy, we are once again sending a strong message that the Empire State is a national leader and a beacon of inclusion for all students."
