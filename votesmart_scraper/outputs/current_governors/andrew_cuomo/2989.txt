Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the launch of the Mandate Relief Redesign Team's Web site to invite the public's participation in the process of reviewing and reforming underfunded and unfunded mandates across the State.

The Web site, http://governor.ny.gov/mandaterelief, includes electronic forms for Mandate Relief stakeholders and the public to suggest reforms to the system. The Web site will be an integral component to the reform process, which includes the Mandate Relief Redesign Team, created through an Executive Order by Governor Cuomo. The Web site will also include listings of the Team's public meetings and prepared reports.

"This Web site is an important tool which will enable the public and stakeholders to participate in the process of providing mandate relief and saving taxpayers' money," Governor Cuomo said.

The Team is charged with reviewing existing unfunded and underfunded mandates imposed by the New York State government on school districts, local governments, and other local taxing districts. These mandates are typically legal requirements that a local government provide a program, project, or activity on behalf of the State.

The Team includes representatives from private industry, education, labor, and government and will look for ways to reduce the costs of mandated programs, identify mandates that are ineffective and outdated, and determine how school districts and local governments can have greater ability to control expenses. The Team is chaired by Senior Advisor to the Governor, Larry Schwartz.

The Team will submit a first set of recommendations to the Governor by March 1, 2011 for consideration in the Fiscal Year 2011-12 budget process. The Team will continue its review until the end of Fiscal Year 2011-12.

The members of the team are as follows:
* Stephen Acquario, Executive Director, NYS Association of Counties
* Maggie Brooks, Monroe County Executive
* Peter Baynes, Executive Director of the New York Conference of Mayors
* Sam Teresi, Mayor of Jamestown
* Jeff Haber, New York State Association of Towns, Executive Director

* Assemblyman Marc Molinaro. Assemblyman Molinaro was recommended by the Minority Leader of the Assembly.

Unfunded and underfunded mandates drive up costs of schools, municipalities, and the property taxes that support them. Due in part to these mandates, New York now has some of the highest taxes in the nation. For example:

New York has the highest local taxes in America as a percentage of personal income - 79 percent above the national average;
* New York has the second highest combined state and local taxes in the nation;
* Median property taxes paid by New Yorkers are 96 percent above the national median;
* Property tax levies in New York grew by 73 percent from 1998 to 2008 - more than twice the rate of inflation during that period;
* When measured in absolute dollars paid, Westchester, Nassau, and Rockland are respectively the first, second and fifth highest-taxed counties in the nation;
* When property taxes were measured as a percentage of home value in 2009, nine out of the top ten counties in the nation were all in Upstate New York.
