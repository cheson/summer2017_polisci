New Yorkers encouraged to visit 'Strong Families, Strong New York' website to learn more and get involved
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that several of the state's leading women's advocacy groups, including the National Organization for Women, the Campaign for a Pro-Choice New York and the League of Women Voters of New York State, have joined the "Strong Families, Strong New York" campaign to fight for passage of paid family leave in New York State. These groups are endorsing the Governor's proposal for 12 weeks of paid benefits, funded by employees, to allow workers to care for new children or seriously ill relatives. The Governor's proposal would benefit millions of New Yorkers -- especially women, minorities and low-income workers who need it most -- in addition to businesses and the economy overall, and would be the most robust such policy in the nation.
"Ensuring that all working men and women have access to paid family leave isn't just good policy, it's the right thing to do," Governor Cuomo said. "New Yorkers should be able to be with their families in times of need without having to put their economic security at risk and that's exactly what this plan ensures. Family and community are two defining characteristics of this state and its time that we start living that way again."
