Statement From Governor Andrew M. Cuomo - Toys with Toxic Chemicals
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 22, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"Stores should not be promoting toys that contain toxic chemicals, and removing them from shelves is the appropriate step to take to ensure these items stay out of children's hands. I thank Dollar Tree for acting quickly to voluntarily remove an unsafe toy from their inventory and prevent future sales of this product."
