Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $56 million in funding to ensure healthier communities across the State through the Vital Access/Safety Net Provider Program (VAP), which supports healthcare services for New York State's fragile, elderly, and low-income populations. This round of funding brings the program's total to $157 million, and will be used primarily to improve community care, including expanding access to ambulatory services, opening urgent care centers, expanding services in rural areas, and providing more effective services that meet community needs. These awards support multi-year projects submitted by hospitals, nursing homes, free standing clinics, and home health providers.

"Creating healthier communities is one of my administration's highest priorities, and ensuring that New York's most vulnerable populations have access to quality medical services is vital to fulfilling that goal," said Governor Cuomo. "This funding will improve health care in communities across the state by providing the necessary support to these facilities, and allow them to continue delivering much-needed services to New Yorkers."

The Department of Health works with all of the awarded facilities to establish goals to measure the program's success and to identify financial, operational, and quality metrics to track progress toward these goals. In addition, the Department is working closely with the Federal Government to secure additional VAP funding from the MRT Waiver to help support more than 150 applications totaling $1.2 billion received to date.
