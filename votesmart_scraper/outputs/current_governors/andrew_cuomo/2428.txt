Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Passage of Connecticut Gun Law
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 4, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

"I applaud Governor Malloy and the Connecticut legislature for taking bold new action to protect the people of their state. Today, Connecticut joins New York and a growing collection of states that are proving we can pass tough, common sense gun control laws that protect our citizens and make us safer. The horror of the Newtown tragedy instilled a new urgency across our entire nation that we can no longer accept the unforgivable violence caused by allowing deadly weapons to fall into the hands of the most dangerous elements of our society. Now we need Congress to show the same courage as Connecticut, Colorado and New York, as well as follow the will of the American people, by taking strong action to stop these tragedies in our country."
