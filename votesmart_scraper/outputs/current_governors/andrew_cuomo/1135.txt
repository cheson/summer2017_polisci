Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo today congratulated a Cortland County farm as the recipient of New York's top environmental award -- the 2015 Agricultural Environmental Management Award. Each year, the award honors the outstanding efforts of a farm to protect soil and water quality. McMahon's E-Z Acres Farm was recognized, along with the Cortland County Soil and Water Conservation District during a ceremony at the Empire Farm Days in Seneca Falls. The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, the Empire State Potato Growers, and the American Agriculturist Magazine presented the award to E-Z Acres Farm for its environmental ethics, progressive production practices, and community service work.
"The protection and conservation of our soil and water is increasingly important to farms across the state and I applaud the ongoing efforts to ensure they are being good stewards of the environment," Governor Cuomo said. "I congratulate the McMahon Family and the Cortland County Soil and Water Conservation District for receiving the Agricultural Environmental Management award. These types of forward- thinking solutions are helping to not only ensure agricultural sustainability but also increase economic opportunity."
