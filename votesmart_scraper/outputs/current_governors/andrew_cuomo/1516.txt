Governor Cuomo Urges New Yorkers to Take Precautions Against Flooding
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: March 16, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo urged all New Yorkers to learn about staying safe in dangerous flood conditions, which impact families, businesses, and communities every year. With milder temperatures approaching in the coming weeks, communities may experience heavy flooding. Sign up for NY Alerts at https://users.nyalert.gov/ to get immediate alerts on flood warnings and severe storms.
"Being prepared can make all the difference in an emergency," Governor Cuomo said. "By paying attention and planning accordingly for the possibility of flooding due to warmer temperatures and spring showers, people can help prepare for what Mother Nature has in store for them. I encourage all New Yorkers to take the time to organize, sign up for NY Alerts and stay informed."
The Governor also proclaimed this week as Flood Safety Preparedness Week, which asks New Yorkers to take a simple preparedness step each day or to set a daily goal to prepare for a severe weather event. Taking the New York State Citizen Preparedness Corps training is one way to prepare for any emergency or disaster. The Corps gives residents the tools and resources to prepare for any type of disaster, respond accordingly and recover as quickly as possible to pre-disaster conditions. Visit www.prepare.ny.gov for a list of current in-person trainings happening across the state.
New Yorkers can also visit this website to take a condensed version of the training online.
Below are flood preparation safety tips:
- Learn the safest route from your home or business to high, safe ground should you have to leave in a hurry.
- Develop and practice a 'family escape' plan and identify a meeting place if family members become separated.
- Make an itemized list -- as well as potentially photo and video documentation -- of all valuables including furnishings, clothing and other personal property. Keep the list in a safe place.
- Stockpile emergency supplies of canned food, medicine and first aid supplies and drinking water. Store drinking water in clean, closed containers.
- Plan what to do with your pets.
- Have a portable radio, flashlights, extra batteries and emergency cooking equipment available.
- Keep your automobile fueled. If electric power is cut off, gasoline stations may not be able to pump fuel for several days. Have a small disaster supply kit in the trunk of your car.
- Find out how many feet your property is above and below possible flood levels. When predicted flood levels are broadcast, you can determine if you may be flooded.
Keep materials like sandbags, plywood, plastic sheeting and lumber handy for emergency water-proofing.
- Check on your insurance coverage. Homeowners' insurance policies generally do not cover flood damages. Only flood insurance can protect your home against flood damages. You can purchase flood insurance whether or not you live in a mapped flood zone.
New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Acting Commissioner John Melville said, "Weather in New York State can be very unpredictable and dangerous and it's up to all of us to make sure we know the risks associated with a flooding event where we live, go to school and work. Taking steps such as having a family plan, stocking up on emergency supplies, food and water and having an emergency "go-bag" for each member of your family will go a long way when a disaster strikes."
