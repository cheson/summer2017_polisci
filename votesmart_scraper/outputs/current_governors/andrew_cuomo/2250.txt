Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 21, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today participated with Billy Joel in the 20th annual Oyster Bay Cleanup Day in Nassau County. He was also joined by Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano and Oyster Bay Town Supervisor John Venditto. Governor Cuomo also issued a proclamation to Paul DeOrsay, Executive Director of Friends of the Bay, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the cleanup initiative.
"Protecting and preserving New York's beautiful natural resources is all of our responsibilities," Governor Cuomo said. "The people of Oyster Bay have exemplified this spirit for the past 20 years, and I applaud their commitment to leaving the community better than they found it. I encourage all New Yorkers to join in the spirit of volunteerism and find ways to better the world around them."
Each year, tons of paper, food, plastics and other litter are left on beaches or dumped overboard from recreational and commercial vessels and the debris can take years to disintegrate. Accordingly, the Town of Oyster Bay, the North Oyster Bay Baymen's Association (NOBBA) and Friends of the Bay marked September 21st by once again joining forces to sponsor the annual Oyster Bay Harbor Fall Cleanup Day.
Oyster Bay Harbor plays in important role in the local fishing economy. The harbor consists of approximately 2,900 underwater shellfish lands, roughly 2,000 of which are open for the harvest and direct market of shellfish year-round round, with the exception of temporary lane closures.
The Cleanup Day Program is now in its 20th year and features a partnership between town employees and local volunteers who both walk along the shoreline to collect debris and work from boats to pick up trash to help preserve the harbor ecology
