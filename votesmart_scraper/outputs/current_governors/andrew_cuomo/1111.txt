Governor Cuomo announced a new accessible boardwalk and trail are now open to the public at Stewart State Forest in Orange County. Two new 400-foot sections of the boardwalk spanning the Great Swamp have been completed, providing visitors increased access to view the swamp habitat and wildlife. The $434,000 project was funded by the NY Works program.
From fishing and hiking to biking and cross-country skiing, New York provides a wealth of opportunities for people to enjoy the great outdoors," Governor Cuomo said. "The new trail and boardwalk at Stewart State Forest will provide even greater access to this area's natural beauty, making it a prime destination for residents and visitors alike. I urge everyone to come and experience this great part of the Hudson Valley for themselves."
"Only 60 miles from New York City, Stewart State Forest is one of the most intensively used forests in the state with abundant large and small game that attract hunters from all over New York," said Acting DEC Commissioner Marc Gerstman. "In the winter, cross-country skiers and snowmobilers flock to State forest's many trails. This beautiful boardwalk, new kiosk and trails will help visitors access and enjoy some of the more distinctive features of Stewart."
Senator Bill Larkin said, "Governor Cuomo and I both believe that the new boardwalk is an important enhancement for the Stewart State Forest. Greater accessibility will turn this local landmark into a national destination for sportsman and tourists. The breathtaking sights have never been this accessible for our residents and I look forward to more families enjoying all that it has to offer."
