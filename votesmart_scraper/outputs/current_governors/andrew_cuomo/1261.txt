Green Lakes Improving Visitor Experience With Renovations to Central Areas of Flagship Park
Governor Cuomo announced major progress in signature revitalization projects at Verona Beach State Park and Green Lakes State Park. Made possible by a $13 million investment from the NY Parks 2020 initiative, the improvements include the completion of a new bathhouse and pavilions in time for the summer swim season at Verona Beach and ongoing campground upgrades and a renovation of the golf clubhouse at Green Lakes.
"New York has some of the nation's best locations for outdoor recreation, and through the NY Parks 2020 program we are transforming them to be better than ever," Governor Cuomo said. "I am proud to see the progress at Verona Beach and Green Lakes moving forward, and I encourage New Yorkers to check out a state park near them this summer."
State Parks Commissioner Rose Harvey said: "It's exciting to watch our state park system progress to what we know it can be, and we have the opportunity to see that happening at Green Lakes and Verona Beach State Parks where projects are transforming the visitor experience for the better while protecting the parks' natural resources. We're continuously grateful for Governor Cuomo's investment and commitment to our state park system."
The work, which ranges from the construction of new facilities to much-needed upgrades to park infrastructure, underscores Governor Cuomo's commitment to improving and expanding access to outdoor recreation. NY Parks 2020 is a multi-year commitment to leverage a broad range of private and public funding to invest approximately $900 million in State Parks from 2011 to 2020. The 2015-16 State Budget includes $110 million toward this initiative.
