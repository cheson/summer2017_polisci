"The sentencing of Hank Morris serves as a strong signal that it's time to clean up Albany and the culture of corruption must and will end. The pay-to-play special interest culture is always unethical and often illegal. Morris claimed that his actions were business as usual in Albany. Let that serve as a warning. I applaud Ellen Biben and Linda Lacewell who worked on this groundbreaking case for three years. I also thank Attorney General Schneiderman for his professionalism and courtesy in allowing Biben to continue the case."
