Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Regarding the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Indian Point
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: May 4, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

"Today's decision by the NRC Commissioners to reverse an earlier administrative ruling, and to require a reexamination of the impacts caused by severe accidents at Indian Point and potential upgrades reaffirms our long-standing position that the aging nuclear power plant needs to be retired. Clearly, this facility poses too great a risk to the millions of people who live and work nearby. We will work closely with NRC staff and continue to monitor Indian Point's daily operations to ensure that a proper analysis is done regarding any unacceptable dangers to ensure that the public is protected at all times."
