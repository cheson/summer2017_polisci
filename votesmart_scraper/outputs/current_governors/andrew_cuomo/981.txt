Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 7, 2015
Location: Genesee County

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that 1366 Technologies, a manufacturer of technologies for the solar energy industry, will establish its first large commercial Direct WaferÂ™production plant and significantly grow its workforce at the high-tech Science and Technology Advanced Manufacturing Park in Alabama, Genesee County. Construction of the manufacturing facility will require two phases during which the company will create at least 600 new, full-time jobs over the next five years. 1366 expects to eventually create more than 1,000 new jobs in Upstate New York's Finger Lakes region.
"This $700 million investment is an enormous vote of confidence in the Upstate economy and sends the message that there is opportunity in every corner of this state." Governor Cuomo said. "Today's announcement is an example of how we are combining this region's natural strengths with our vision to develop New York's entrepreneurial future and make the Empire State a true leader in developing the clean energy technologies of tomorrow. I am proud to continue building on Upstate's economic resurgence and I am pleased to have 1366 helping us lead the way forward."
