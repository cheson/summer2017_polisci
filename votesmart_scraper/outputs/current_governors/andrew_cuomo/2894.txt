Statement From Governor Cuomo on State Legislature's Bipartisan Passage of Ethics Reform Legislation
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: June 13, 2011
Location: Albany, NY

"I applaud the State Legislature for its bipartisan passage of the Public Integrity Reform Act of 2011. Government does not work without the trust of the people and this legislation will help clean up state government and give New Yorkers confidence in their elected officials. I commend Majority Leader Skelos, Assembly Speaker Silver, Minority Leaders Sampson and Kolb and their respective conferences for promptly passing this bill. It is time that we once again have a government that is as good as the people of this state."
