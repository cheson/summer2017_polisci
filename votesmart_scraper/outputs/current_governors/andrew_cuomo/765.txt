Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Jan. 7, 2016
Location: New York, New York

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today unveiled the seventh signature proposal of his 2016 agenda: dramatically expand and improve the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to stimulate the regional economy. The proposal will expand the Javits Center by 1.2 million square feet, resulting in a fivefold increase in meeting and ballroom space, including the largest ballroom in the Northeast. A four-level, 480,000 square foot truck garage capable of housing hundreds of tractor-trailers at one time will also be constructed to improve pedestrian safety and local traffic flow. The proposal's total projected cost is approximately $1 billion, paid for by the Javits Center within existing resources. Construction is expected to begin in late 2016. A full album of renderings is available here.
"The Javits Center has long been an economic generator for this state, but we want to build and expand it to ensure it remains a premier venue for the next generation," Governor Cuomo said. "Through one of the most aggressive development plans in the history of the State of New York, we are transforming one of our largest convention centers into an unparalleled, world-class venue. The new Javits Center will continue to garner millions in economic activity, create jobs and keep New York's economic momentum moving forward."
