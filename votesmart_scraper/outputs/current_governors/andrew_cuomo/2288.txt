Governor Cuomo Announces Housing Extension for Sandy Victims
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 5, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), at the request of the State of New York, has approved an extension in two phases to the Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) program.

FEMA will continue to review the remaining 84 households still utilizing the TSA program and the new extension will include the first phase to August 16th and the second to September 1st. The extension allows eligible survivors from Superstorm Sandy who cannot return to their homes to stay in participating hotels or motels.

"The Transitional Sheltering Assistance program continues to be an important resource for the victims of Superstorm Sandy," Governor Cuomo said. "Extending this program is the right thing to do for displaced homeowners who continue to pursue stable housing plans for the future."

This is a short-term program that places families in hotels while they work toward a longer-term housing plan.
