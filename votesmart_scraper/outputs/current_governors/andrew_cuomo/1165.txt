Governor Cuomo Announces Expansion of Free Wi-Fi to Robert Moses State Park
Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 4, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that free Wi-Fi is now available at Robert Moses State Park, a popular Long Island beach with over 3.4 million visitors each year. The free wireless service, which was installed at Fields 2, 3, 4 and 5, is in thanks to a partnership between the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Toyota, and American Park Network, and builds on the free Wi-Fi installed last year at Jones Beach, Niagara Falls, Saratoga Spa and East River State Park.
"New York is the proud home to some of the best and most beautiful parks in the nation, and this Wi-Fi expansion will attract more visitors to the great outdoors--boosting tourism and growing the Long Island economy," Governor Cuomo said. "We will continue to develop these partnerships to make our state park system better than ever before, and I encourage all New Yorkers to explore a new park this summer."
The service, called "Oh, Ranger!" Wi-Fi, is part of a program made possible through the support of Toyota: Let's Go Places, with the equipment, installation, maintenance and monitoring being provided at no cost to taxpayers. Visitors at the participating parks access the Wi-Fi in two easy steps: users simply select Oh, Ranger! Wi-Fi under available Wi-Fi networks on their device, accept the standard terms and conditions, and will then be on their way to free Internet access.
In addition to providing free connectivity for the millions of visitors, Oh, Ranger! Wi-Fi also can identify park visitation patterns, generate awareness of upcoming programs and events, promote volunteerism and support parks friends groups like the Natural Heritage Trust, which supports New York State Parks. Oh, Ranger! also produces the annual New York State Parks Guide.
State Parks Commissioner Rose Harvey said, "Under Governor Cuomo's leadership, we are improving the visitor experience and continuing our commitment to upgrading our facilities. We are grateful for our partnership with Toyota and American Park Network to enhance the park's amenities with this much sought-after service. Whether opting to use Wi-Fi to share real-time photos of friends and family exploring our parks, or accessing apps and maps, having access to this technology is another way to draw people to spend precious leisure time at our parks."
Dionne Colvin-Lovely, Director, Traditional and New Media, Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A, Inc. said, "Toyota is thrilled to partner with American Park Network and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to help expand the presence of Oh, Ranger! Wi-FiÂ™. Over the past year, millions of New Yorkers have visited these connected parks and adding Robert Moses State Park to the network is a natural extension. Toyota welcomes the opportunity to make a difference in local communities by helping to enhance the visitor experience at some of the most treasured open spaces in all of New York State."
American Park Network Publisher & Editor-in-Chief Mark Saferstein said, "Toyota has set an amazing example of the benefits of public/private partnership. We're thrilled that their continued support has made it possible to expand this successful collaboration with New York State Parks. Our collective goal is to encourage everyone to get outdoors by providing connectivity at America's parks, something the public has come to view as an expected utility, just like electricity and running water. We hope other companies will follow Toyota's lead."
Under Governor Cuomo's leadership, New York State remains committed to improving and expanding access to outdoor recreation. The Governor's NY Parks 2020 program is a multi-year commitment to leverage $900 million in private and public funding for State Parks from 2011 to 2020. The Governor's 2015-16 Executive Budget allocates $110 million toward this initiative.
