Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today directed that flags on state government buildings be flown at half-staff on Sunday, December 7 in honor of Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. During the attack, more than 2,400 Americans were killed, including 40 from New York.
"Today, I join with all New Yorkers to pause in observance of the 73rd anniversary of the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor," Governor Cuomo said. "The events at Pearl Harbor changed the course of our nation's history, and it is important that we continue to honor those who were lost. My thoughts and prayers go out to the loved ones of those who passed that day, and I offer my gratitude to the brave men and women currently serving to protect our country."
The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor occurred the morning of December 7, 1941. Following that day, nearly 1.7 million New Yorkers-- more people than from any other state in the Union--would go on to serve in World War II. Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day honors all of the World War II Veterans but especially those Marines, Sailors, Soldiers, Airmen and civilians who lost their lives while serving that fateful day.
Flags on all state buildings will be lowered to half-staff on Sunday in tribute to New York's own service members as well as those stationed in the State who are killed in action or die in a combat zone.
