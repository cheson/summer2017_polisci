Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo

Location: Albany, NY

"I was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of my dear friend Geraldine Ferraro. Through her life in the public arena, Geraldine's accomplishments served as a milestone in our country's acceptance of equality and diversity. She is proof that a person can make a difference, and make a difference is what Geraldine did throughout her life. "She made a difference as a young prosecutor in Queens, as a congresswoman, as the first woman and first Italian-American to run for vice-president on a major party line and as a lawyer in private practice. As a role model for women across the world, she demonstrated that glass ceilings can be shattered. I had the honor and privilege to work with Geraldine for many years and I learned a great deal about courage and leadership from her. "Over the last few years, as Geraldine has struggled with illness, she demonstrated every day what it means to be courageous, to be strong and, no matter what the circumstance, to fight for what you believe. Simply put, our nation is stronger because of her service and our lives are enriched by the lessons she taught us."
