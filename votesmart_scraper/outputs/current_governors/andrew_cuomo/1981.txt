Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced awards totaling $1.1 million for five clean-energy training programs that will help prepare high school students for post-secondary education and careers in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and advanced technology. The funds are in line with the vision to scale-up clean energy and foster a clean energy workforce by supporting Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) training.
"New York has been investing in the industries of tomorrow and now we are preparing our students for the jobs of tomorrow," Governor Cuomo said. "These training programs will give young New Yorkers a path to exciting employment opportunities here in our state. This program will continue to make New York a national leader in the clean energy and technology industries."
The STEM-based training incorporates diverse approaches to delivering STEM-focused energy content for high school students, including career and technical education experiences, Early College High School (ECHS) programs and career exploration programs in energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced technology. The awards were made through a competitive solicitation and are administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).
CEO of NYSERDA John B. Rhodes said, "This funding will help strengthen the academic pipeline from high school to college to career and provide more opportunities for students interested in the field of clean energy. These programs highlight how the State, under Governor Cuomo, is making STEM education a priority and acknowledging the importance of it in helping our students succeed in the 21st century global economy."
