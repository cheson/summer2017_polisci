By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Sept. 14, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that $16.7 million in economic development funding has been approved for 25 projects that are spurring growth and opportunity statewide. The funding, approved by Empire State Development's Board of Directors, supports projects that are creating 333 new jobs and retaining 227 existing New York State jobs -- many of which have already been created or retained. This funding will also leverage over $50 million in private assets and other public funding to support local businesses and projects that are building a strong foundation for future economic growth and job creation.
"From Long Island to the North Country, these targeted investments are creating jobs for New Yorkers and strengthening key industries that are spurring economic growth statewide," Governor Cuomo said. "Under this administration, great strides have been made to encourage business growth and jumpstart local economies, and these funds will help continue our work to build a healthier business climate across New York."
