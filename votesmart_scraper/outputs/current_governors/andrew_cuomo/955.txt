Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 20, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced that two new public service announcements are now airing on television stations and music streaming services across the state in an effort to warn residents about the dangers of synthetic drugs and prescription opioid abuse. This is the latest in New York's multi-pronged effort to combat drug and prescription opioid abuse.
"These PSAs spread the simple message that these drugs are harmful, addictive, and simply not worth it," Governor Cuomo said. "This administration will continue to do everything in our power to combat opioid abuse in New York as well as take on the emerging threat of synthetic drugs in our communities."
