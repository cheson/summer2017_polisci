Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 3, 2013
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $80 million in grant funding to strengthen local emergency preparedness capabilities in municipalities across the State. The combined state and federal grant funds are distributed through the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (DHSES).

"New York has seen some of the nation's worst disasters in recent years, and this $80 million will go a long way to strengthening the network of locally-based emergency response infrastructure across our state," Governor Cuomo said. "First responders are often the initial line of defense in any critical incident, and supporting their communication abilities is an important way for the state to help safeguard our communities during a crisis. My administration is committed to providing our emergency personnel with the assistance they need to serve their communities."

DHSES Commissioner Jerome M. Hauer said, "Each year, with Governor Cuomo's leadership, DHSES distributes critically important grant funds to local municipalities and first responders that help them fortify their disaster preparedness and response capabilities. Following a comprehensive technical review process that brings together federal, state and local experts, the grant funds are released to applicants who have demonstrated their ability to meet established criteria and will utilize the available grant funds to provide the most efficient and effective protective services to their communities."

This round of grant funding includes $75 million from the annual DHSES Statewide Interoperable Communications Grant (SICG), which provides critical support to local governments to enhance vital emergency communications systems. Through this grant, local governments are improving the ability of first responders to effectively communicate with neighboring counties in a disaster and thus taking all the necessary steps in responding quickly to any emergency, maintaining a high level of interagency communication and providing maximum public safety. Over the three rounds of SICG, including this current round, 53 counties across the State will benefit from a total of $197 million that has been awarded. A breakdown of this year's $75 million SICG funding by county is as follows:

Allegany: $5,951,039
