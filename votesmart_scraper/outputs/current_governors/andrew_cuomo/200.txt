Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today directed the State Police and National Guard to deploy an additional 1,000 uniformed officers out of an abundance of caution to high-profile locations across the state following an explosion in Chelsea on Saturday night. At the Governor's direction, state agencies, including the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, the New York State Police, National Guard, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will remain on a heightened state of alert.
The Governor also announced that after a rigorous inspection, MTA and PATH train service has been restored and both systems suffered no structural damage. All trains running on the E, F lines will continue to bypass 23rd street station and trains running on the No. 1 line will not stop at 23rd or 28th street stations. The Governor visited the site of the explosion this morning and delivered an update on the scene, touring the subway system with state transportation officials.
"Protecting the safety of New Yorkers and our state's visitors is priority number one," Governor Cuomo said. "After thorough inspection, train service has been restored and we continue to work closely with our local and federal partners to monitor the situation. Out of an abundance of caution, we are increasing security at high-profile locations across the city, and all state agencies continue to remain on alert."
