Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today directed activation of New York State's Emergency Operations Center in preparation for heavy and blowing snow of up to 16 inches that is expected throughout the New York City area, the Hudson Valley, the Capital Region, and the Mohawk Valley. The National Weather Service has issued Winter Weather Watches and Warnings in and around these areas, with the storm predicted to move south to north beginning early today and continue through Thanksgiving on Thursday.
"As New York faces another winter storm, the Emergency Operations Center will ensure that resources are made available to keep residents, as well as visitors, safe as they travel for the Thanksgiving holiday," Governor Cuomo said. "I urge motorists to avoid unnecessary trips but, if you must drive, to exercise caution and to check your route before leaving."
Governor Cuomo has activated the New York State Emergency Operations Center in Hawthorne through Thursday. This morning, the Governor visited the Emergency Operations Center and was briefed by representatives of agencies reporting for this activation: the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, Office of Emergency Management, Office of Fire Prevention and Control, Department of Transportation, Department of Environmental Conservation, New York State Thruway, State Police, Information Technology Services, and the Public Service Commission.
The State has prepared 911 snow plows, more than 1,800 plow operators and more than 130,000 tons of road salt between New York City and Albany to respond to the storm.
