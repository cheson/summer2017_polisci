Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the release of a Request for Information to help finalize guidelines for the New NY Broadband Program, which has undertaken the ambitious goal of substantially expanding high-speed broadband service in New York State by the end of 2018. Earlier this year, Governor Cuomo made the Nation's largest and most aggressive state investment in broadband with the commitment of $500 million in capital for the Program.
"High speed internet access has become an essential ingredient of any strong economy and New York is leading the nation to close the broadband gap," Governor Cuomo said. "With this action, we are engaging providers, municipal leaders and other stakeholders to help ensure the New NY Broadband Program leverages the State's investment in the best way and fulfills its goal of providing access to high speed Internet to every New Yorker in every corner of this state."
