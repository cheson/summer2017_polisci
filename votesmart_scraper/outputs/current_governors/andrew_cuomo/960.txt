Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Decision By U.S. Court of Appeals Regarding NY SAFE Act
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Oct. 19, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"Today, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld what we have long known to be true -- that the core provisions of the NY SAFE Act do not violate the Second Amendment. Today, common sense prevailed.
"When we passed the SAFE Act, just days after the tragedies in Newtown and Webster, New York proved to the nation that it is possible to enact sensible gun control that coexists with the Second Amendment. We showed that it can be done with bi-partisan support from both urban and rural communities. And we took a fundamental step forward to help end the stream of senseless killings by keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill.
"This case validates a simple, fundamental truth about gun control: that it is possible to have strong laws that keep our communities safe, while at the same time respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners. New York has set the example -- and it's far past time for Washington to follow suit and pass a sensible national gun control policy."
