Governor Cuomo Urges New Yorkers to Exercise Caution as Nor'easter Winter Storm Approaches the State
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Feb. 12, 2014
Location: Albany, NY

"As we continue to prepare for the Nor'easter that is expected to hit parts of New York State tonight and tomorrow, I urge New Yorkers in the affected regions to consider staying home," Governor Cuomo said. "During the storm, snow is projected to accumulate at a rate of two to three inches per hour, which will make it challenging for plow crews to keep roads clear. Drivers should stay off of the roads if at all possible, and exercise extreme caution if they absolutely must travel. Remember to check on your neighbors and loved ones throughout the storm, monitor local news reports to stay informed and heed the advice of emergency management professionals."

State offices, facilities, and operations will remain open on February 13, 2014. However, non-essential employees, in light of the expected weather conditions in the Long Island, New York City, Hudson Valley and Capital District regions, may absent themselves from work with charge to appropriate leave credits and supervisory approval.
