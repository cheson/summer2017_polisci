Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that 55 organizations from across the state, including statewide and local nonprofits, advocacy organizations and labor groups, are joining the Enough is Enough campaign to combat sexual assault on college campuses. Many of these organizations represent countless victims of sexual violence, and today they are adding their voices to the growing coalition of supporters of the Governor's proposal to codify uniform sexual assault prevention and response protocols for all colleges and universities -- public and private -- in New York. The adoption of this proposal will make New York a leader in the fight against on-campus sexual violence and will better protect the State's 1.2 million college students.
"New York is taking a stand by proposing the strongest measures in the nation to combat sexual assault on college campuses," Governor Cuomo said. "This wide-ranging group of local and statewide organizations is joining our call to action to fight this growing epidemic. Together, we are saying enough is enough -- it's time for New York to lead the charge to end this scourge on our colleges now."
