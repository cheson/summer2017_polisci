Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that $28.7 million in federal funding is available to help communities eliminate barriers to traditional transportation services and enhance public mobility alternatives for seniors and New Yorkers with disabilities.
"New York remains committed to enhancing transportation mobility, especially for seniors and individuals with disabilities -- and with this federal funding, we will increase access to safe, reliable transportation in communities across the state," Governor Cuomo said. "I encourage local governments and organizations to apply for funding, help improve public transit, and support our efforts to improve the lives of New Yorkers in every region of this state."
This new grant opportunity will enable private not-for-profit organizations and municipal governments to:
Purchase accessible buses and vans;
Implement mobility management programs;
Provide travel training and assistance to users; and
Improve the accessibility of bus stops, including sidewalks, curb-cuts, and updated signage or wayfinding technology.
These funds, made available to the state through the Federal Transit Administration and administered by the New York State Department of Transportation, are provided through the Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Program (Section 5310). The program will provide up to 80 percent of capital project-related costs and 50 percent of operating assistance and mobility management activities, with the remaining non-federal share provided by project applicants.
