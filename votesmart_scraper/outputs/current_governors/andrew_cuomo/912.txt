Governor Cuomo announced $67.5 million has been awarded to nine organizations across the state for the development of programs that support the family members who care for the nearly 380,000 New Yorkers living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. The awards are part of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo's Alzheimer's Caregiver Support Initiative, which was announced earlier this year as part of the 2015-16 Executive Budget.
"Alzheimer's Disease affects thousands of New Yorkers each year and takes a devastating toll on both patients and the caregivers," Governor Cuomo said. "This investment will provide a wide range of support and respite services for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's and similar diseases."
