Statement from Governors Christie, Corbett, Cuomo and Perdue Urging Congress to Put Aside Politics on Disaster Assistance
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo Chris Christie Bev Perdue Tom Corbett
Date: Sept. 23, 2011
Location: Raleigh, NC

Our states have been hit hard by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. While the flood waters have receded and the storms are passed, the damage to communities, businesses and infrastructure remains significant. Billions of dollars in loss and destruction pose a serious threat not only to local and regional economies, but to the nation's economic recovery.

Our states' governments and our citizens are doing their part to restore and rebuild.

The federal government must also do its part.

Federal assistance for the victims of storms and floods should be beyond politics. Within 10 days of Hurricane Katrina, Congress passed and the President signed over $60 billion in aid for the Gulf Coast. It's been 28 days since Irene and Lee started battering our states. We urge this Congress to move swiftly to ensure that disaster aid through FEMA and other federal programs is sufficient to start rebuilding now.
