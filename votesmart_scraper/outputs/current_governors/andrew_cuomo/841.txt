Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Federal Highway Bill
Statement
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 4, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

"The expected passage of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act is tremendous news for New York State. From helping to rebuild outdated bridges in Upstate New York to preventing massive funding cuts that would have hurt millions of public transit riders, this bill provides important support to our State's infrastructure. And with more stable and long term funding than New York has seen in previous years, it is an important investment in the Empire State's future. I commend Senator Schumer for his dedicated efforts to make this bill possible, other members of the conference committee -- Congressmen Nadler and Katko -- as well as all the members of our Congressional delegation who supported these efforts, and I look forward to seeing a stronger New York in the years to come."
