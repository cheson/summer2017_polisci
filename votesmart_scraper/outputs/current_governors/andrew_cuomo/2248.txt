Press Release

Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) has awarded a $12 million grant to New York State's first Pay for Success Project, an initiative to reemploy formerly incarcerated individuals. This award delivers on the Governor's commitment in the 2013 State of the State to develop innovative programs to reduce recidivism while saving money for New York taxpayers.
"This federal grant will allow New York State to implement our first Pay for Success project to help formerly incarcerated individuals find jobs and reduce recidivism rates in our communities," Governor Cuomo said. "Under this initiative, we are using an innovative public-private partnership to meet social needs and protect taxpayer dollars by ensuring results are delivered by private investors. These efforts will benefit the whole state because by connecting New Yorkers with jobs, it will mean safer and more prosperous communities for all of us."
The $12 million grant to New York State was the largest award made by the USDOL under its national competition for Pay for Success.
A Pay for Success Project, also known as a Social Impact Bond, is a contract between government and one or more private entities. Under the contract, objectives are set by the State, and private investors finance and manage the program. If the program fails to meet agreed-upon savings and performance targets, the government does not have to pay.
For this Pay for Success Project, New York State is partnering with the Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO) to increase employment and reduce recidivism among New Yorkers recently released from prison -- a population with an unemployment rate that stands at at least 53% statewide, but can reach as high as 69% in certain communities.
