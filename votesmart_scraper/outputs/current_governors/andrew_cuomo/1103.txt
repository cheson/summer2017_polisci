Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Aug. 24, 2015
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Cuomo announced today that the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved the release of $312,642 under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program to the Essex County Soil and Water Conservation District to remove a portion of the William Petro Dam. The portion of the dam is identified as a high-level hazard in the Essex County emergency plan, and its removal will mitigate the severity and impact of flooding to the residents of Port Henry.
"As New Yorkers across the state know all too well, extreme weather is the new reality and it's important we repair critical infrastructure and make it resilient against whatever Mother Nature has in store," Governor Cuomo said. "This project will help mitigate flooding caused by severe storms and ensure the Port Henry community is better protected against severe storms and the flooding that come with it."
To complete this project, a 30-foot wide portion of the William Petro dam will be removed, protected from future erosion, and stabilized. The project is expected to be completed by August 2018.
