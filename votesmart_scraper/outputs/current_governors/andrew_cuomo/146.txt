Press Release
By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: Dec. 1, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a series of groundbreaking new initiatives in the fight against AIDS -- building on the state's successful blueprint to end the epidemic by 2020. Earlier this week, the Governor signed comprehensive legislation to eliminate barriers to HIV testing and other sexually transmitted infections, increase access to prevention and treatment, and expand research capabilities. Governor Cuomo also called on the federal government to authorize $45 million in Medicaid matching funds for critical programs supporting the battle against AIDS.
Additionally, Governor Cuomo proposed a series of nation-leading statewide initiatives, including expanding access to life-saving HIV services to youth and setting a goal of zero AIDS mortality and zero HIV transmission through injection drug use by the end of 2020.
These latest actions build on major milestones achieved by the state, including zero cases of HIV transmission from mother to child for an 18-month period, and in just one year, an increase in the number of New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS who reached viral suppression by 6,000.
"The new AIDS Memorial is a tremendous tribute that serves as a painful reminder of all the lives we have lost to this horrible disease and as inspiration to keep fighting to end the AIDS epidemic once and for all," Governor Cuomo said. "The Ending the Epidemic Initiative has achieved historic gains, and with these aggressive new actions and new, far-reaching goals, we will continue to do everything in our power to end the AIDS epidemic in New York and forge a path for the rest of the world to follow."
