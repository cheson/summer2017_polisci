Governor Cuomo announced a crackdown on underage drinking and fake identification documents at summer concerts and other underage hotspots, which will last through Labor Day weekend. The enforcement will occur unannounced at various concert venues and places where young adults congregate across the state, and will be carried out by the Department of Motor Vehicles' Division of Field Investigation in partnership with law enforcement agencies.
"Underage drinking and the bad decisions that follow can have devastating and life-altering consequences," Governor Cuomo said. "By targeting fake IDs and increasing enforcement at summer concerts, we will help avoid needless tragedy and will send the message that this reckless behavior just isn't worth it."
