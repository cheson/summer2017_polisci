By: Andrew Cuomo
Date: April 6, 2016
Location: Albany, NY

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced more than $25 million has been awarded for seven supportive housing projects that will create 286 units of supportive housing for homeless and low-income New Yorkers, including veterans, adults recovering from substance abuse and those living with disabling mental health conditions.
"This funding will help ensure that some of the most vulnerable New Yorkers have a safe place to call home," said Governor Cuomo. "Supportive housing is crucial to helping these individuals overcome institutional and societal barriers and achieve greater independence. I am proud to be making this crucial investment to build stronger communities across the state."
The awards include $3 million from the Governor's Medicaid Redesign Team, allocated to the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance for the development of housing projects targeted specifically to homeless persons with disabilities who are also high-cost users of Medicaid.
The funds were awarded through the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance's Homeless Housing and Assistance Program and will support projects in the Bronx and Brooklyn, as well as in Franklin, Onondaga, Westchester and Yates counties.
