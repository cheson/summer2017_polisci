"My heart goes out to all those impacted by the shooting that took place this morning near Moneta, Virginia. Like all of you, I am shocked and saddened by the senseless murder of two members of the media who were doing nothing more than their jobs.
"This morning's tragedy is the latest in seemingly endless, painful reminders that we must confront the rampant gun violence in our communities.
"On behalf of all New Yorkers, my thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and co-workers of those who died. They will be remembered."
