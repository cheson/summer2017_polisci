Governor Gina M. Raimondo visited South County Hospital today to highlight innovative new approaches to build healthier communities through local partnerships to prevent chronic diseases, improve birth outcomes, and improve the social and environmental conditions in 11 different regions in Rhode Island.
"With our new Health Equity Zones, we are making a commitment to invest in the health of our communities, and we're setting a national model of innovation and collaboration that other states can look to," said Raimondo. "I'm proud that Rhode Island continues to be a leader in driving change that can improve outcomes and lower costs across our healthcare system. Healthy Rhode Islanders make up a healthy workforce and create a healthy economy."
