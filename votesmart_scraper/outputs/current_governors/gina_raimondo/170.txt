Rhode Island government's annual State Employee Charitable Appeal (SECA) campaign raised $431,887 in 2015, General Treasurer Seth Magaziner announced today.
More than 1,600 employees from across State government participated in last year's charitable campaign, raising funds to support the work of 549 organizations serving thousands of Rhode Islanders.
"The $431,887 we raised for community organizations helped to provide vital services to our fellow Rhode Islanders and people in need across the nation," said Treasurer Magaziner, honorary chairman of the 2015 SECA campaign.
"I thank the more than 1,500 employees in all participating State departments and agencies who contributed during the 2015 SECA campaign -- particularly in the Office of the General Treasurer, where we raised $11,248; a $4,939 increase over the 2014 SECA campaign," Magaziner continued. "I have no doubt that the generosity of all our State employees will make this year's SECA campaign just as successful."
The State Employee Charitable Appeal enables State employees to make a significant impact on their community by directing contributions from their paychecks to local and national nonprofits of their choice. All agencies have been vetted as legitimate 501c(3) organizations as designated by the I.R.S.
