Public Statements
Raimondo's Jobs Plan: Skills that Matter, Jobs that Pay
Press Release
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: Feb. 2, 2016
Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today submitted her Fiscal Year 2017 budget. Rhode Island created more than 8,000 jobs last year, the most created in a single year since 2000, and our unemployment rate fell more than any other state in the nation. The Governor's proposal seeks to build on that progress by making significant investments in growth to build a new economy where everyone can "make it in Rhode Island."
"Last year, I worked closely with House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed, and leaders in both chambers to grow our economy," Raimondo said. "The General Assembly overwhelmingly supported a suite of economic development tools focused on putting people back to work -- those efforts are starting to show results. However, more remains to be done. We need more skills, more jobs, and higher incomes."
For the second year, the Governor proposed a balanced budget that:
* includes no broad-based tax increases;
* invests in strengthening neighborhood schools and in building skills that matter;
* makes it cheaper and easier to do business in order to attract new businesses and help our existing businesses grow;
* makes work pay for Rhode Island families;
* protects the health and safety of our residents;
* and modernizes government.
"For too many years, Rhode Island has seen a decline in advanced industries and the wages of hardworking Rhode Islanders shrink. Meanwhile, across the country, advanced industries are adding jobs, and wages are going up, too," Raimondo added. "If we want Rhode Islanders to have a shot, then we have to build a new Rhode Island economy based on advanced industries. To do that, we need skills that matter and jobs that pay - and these must go hand-in-hand."
The Governor's proposed budget closes an estimated shortfall of $49.5 million, down from the FY 2016 deficit of $190.4 million. A combination of last year's reforms to control cost and grow stronger revenues have improved the state's fiscal situation.
"Our economy is making progress, but there is much more work to do to create growth that includes everyone," Raimondo said. "If we remain committed to growing 21st century businesses and attracting high-wage, high-skill jobs, I am confident that we will achieve our shared goal of creating jobs and expanding opportunity for all Rhode Islanders."
