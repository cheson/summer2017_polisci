Press Release

Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today announced Richard Culatta as Rhode Island's first Chief Innovation Officer. Culatta will lead an effort to find better approaches to provide more opportunities for all Rhode Islanders, and improve government services, while reducing costs and increasing transparency.
"Part of creating opportunities for all Rhode Islanders is putting their needs first, and turning away from how government has always done things," Raimondo said. "We need new approaches, both in the way government operates, and in the types of businesses we attract and nurture here. The role of the Chief Innovation Officer will be about opening up government and using data to solve problems."
