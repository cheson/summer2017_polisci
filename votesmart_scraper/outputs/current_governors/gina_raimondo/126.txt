The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that SunOpta, Cliff Bar, General Mills (Nature Valley), and Stop and Shop are recalling sunflower kernels and sunflower kernel-containing products because of potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.
The products being recalled include energy bars, protein bars, trail mix bars, and granola bars, in addition to sunflower kernels. The SunOpta recall is an expansion of a previous recall. This has prompted companies that use its sunflower kernels (such as Cliff Bar, General Mills, and Stop and Shop) to initiate their own recalls.
The specific products being recalled can be identified by their UPC codes and best-by dates. * SunOpta - details of products being recalled * Cliff Bar - details of products being recalled * General Mills (Nature Valley) - details of products being recalled * Stop and Shops - details of products being recalled RIDOH is working to ensure that these products are pulled from the shelves of local retailers.
Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Consumers who have purchased these products should discard them.
