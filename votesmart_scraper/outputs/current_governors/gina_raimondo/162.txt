The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Dakota Style Foods is recalling a number of sunflower kernel products because of potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination.
The Dakota Style products being recalled are: * 16 ounce Roasted and Salted Sunflower Kernels * 3.5 ounce Roasted and Salted Sunflower Kernels * 32 ounce Roasted and Salted Sunflower Kernels * 4 ounce Savory Bacon Sunflower Kernels * 8 ounce Savory Bacon Sunflower Kernels * 4 ounce Salted Caramel Sunflower Kernels
The affected lots have the lot codes: 8B6M02, 8B6M09, 8B6M17, 8B6M18, 8B6M24, 8B6M25, 8C6M02, 8C6M08, 8C6M10, 8C6M28, 8C6M31, and 8D6M01. The items' packages bear the company logo and product name with the lot code located on the back right hand panel of the consumer package.
These products were shipped by Dakota Style Foods between February 15, 2016 and May 17, 2016. They were distributed to outlets nationwide.
Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
No illnesses have been confirmed to date. The recall resulted from notice by SunOpta, one of Dakota Style's sunflower kernel suppliers, that SunOpta expanded a voluntary recall of certain lots of sunflower kernels. Dakota Style has identified the lots that may have included ingredients received from SunOpta and is actively working to return all affected products.
Consumers who purchased the recalled products should return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact Dakota Style Foods at 1-800-446-2779.
