Our plan proposes record investments in K-12 schools, but more funding alone isn't enough.
We need to ensure that our schools are preparing kids to succeed and get ready for attending college or pursuing a career. Only by working together to strengthen our neighborhood schools will we be able to create opportunities for everyone to make it in Rhode Island. Every kid deserves to succeed, and a neighborhood school that prepares them for their future.
