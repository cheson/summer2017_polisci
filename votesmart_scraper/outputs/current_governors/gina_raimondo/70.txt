Raimondo Directs U.S. and Rhode Island Flags Lowered
Statement
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: July 8, 2016
Location: Providence, RI

In accordance with a Presidential Proclamation, Governor Gina M. Raimondo has ordered U.S. and Rhode Island flags to be flown at half-staff at all state facilities and buildings. The flags will remain at half-staff until sunset on July 12, 2016 in honor of the victims of the shooting in Dallas.
"It is time to say enough," Raimondo said. "Enough violence. Enough hate. Enough tragedies. It is a time for healing, time for peacefulness, time for unity.
"Let's commit to being a community that rejects violence and poverty, and embraces diversity and civility. I believe we can be bolder. I believe that our families, neighborhoods, state and country can do better, and I believe we can move forward together.
"Today our emotions are raw. We are all filled with a mix of shock, anger, frustration. If anything good can come of these horrific killings, let's replace these emotions with respect, unity and action to bring about a more just, equal and peaceful Rhode Island."
Raimondo also asks Rhode Islanders to lower their flags as a mark of respect for all who lost their lives too soon in the violent events this week.
