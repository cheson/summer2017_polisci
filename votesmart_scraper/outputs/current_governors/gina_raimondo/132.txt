Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea is reminding registered voters, especially those who voted in the April Presidential Preference Primary, to check their party affiliation ahead of the disaffiliation deadline on June 15.
"Many independent voters headed to the polls in April, but those voters may now be affiliated with the party they voted in unless they choose again to disaffiliate," Secretary Gorbea said. "I want to make sure that every registered voter has the opportunity to vote in the September primary of their choice."
Rhode Island has a semi-closed primary meaning registered Democrats must vote in the Democratic primary and registered Republicans must vote in the Republican primary. Only unaffiliated voters are allowed to vote in either party primary this September.
Voters wishing to disaffiliate must contact the local board of canvassers where they are registered by Wednesday, June 15, 2016. Registered voters may also use the Department of State's Voter Information Center at vote.ri.gov to ensure that all of their voter registration information including name, address, and party affiliation is correct. This tool is also available for mobile devices and content is available in English and Spanish.
For more information on the September Primary or any other information related to elections and voting in Rhode Island, please visit the Rhode Island Department of State's Elections Division online at www.sos.ri.gov/elections or call (401) 222-2340.
