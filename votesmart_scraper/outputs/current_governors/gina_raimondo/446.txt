We did it. The people of Rhode Island elected me the next governor of our state and I'm ready to get to work.

So many of you had a hand in this victory, and I want you to know: your help mattered. This would not have been possible without you. If you knocked on a door, made a phone call, donated any amount of money, talked to friends and family or contributed to this campaign in any way, I can't thank you enough.
