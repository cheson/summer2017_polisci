Rhode Island Joins United States Climate Alliance
Press Release
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: June 2, 2017
Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo announced today that Rhode Island will join the United States Climate Alliance. The Alliance, formed yesterday by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, California Governor Edmund G. Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee, is a coalition that will convene U.S. states committed to upholding the Paris Climate Agreement.
"President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement was a tremendous mistake. Rhode Island may be a small state, but climate change can have a big impact on our communities," said Governor Raimondo. "We are determined to fight climate change from the front lines so that we can preserve our environment - including our Narragansett Bay - for future generations and create good-paying, future-proof jobs in the process. I'm proud to join Governors Cuomo, Brown and Inslee in this effort and hope other governors - from both parties - join as well."
Rhode Island is home to the nation's first and only offshore wind farm. Under Governor Raimondo's leadership, the state has set ambitious goals to increase clean energy resources by 1,000 percent by 2020. The Governor has also set a goal to double the number of Rhode Islanders working in the green economy. In 2015, the state passed a net metering law which is making it easier for Rhode Island businesses and homeowners to install solar panels.
In partnership with the General Treasurer's Office, Governor Raimondo has supported the Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank which has invested over $17 million in municipal infrastructure projects which will save cities and towns $20 million in energy costs.
