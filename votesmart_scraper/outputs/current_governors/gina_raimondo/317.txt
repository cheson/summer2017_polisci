Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.
"The drop in the unemployment rate is encouraging, but we are still lagging the rest of our country and have to remain laser-focused on growing our economy. Construction jobs are down 1,300 from last August. That's the biggest over-the-year drop among all employment sectors. And we haven't recovered all of the middle- and high-wage jobs that were lost in the recession.
"That's why my top priority is creating jobs and expanding opportunity so everyone can make it in Rhode Island. Just in the past week, we launched the state's new Business Navigation Center, a one-stop-shop for companies to make it easier to do business in Rhode Island; I spoke with employers building partnerships through Real Jobs RI to train workers for jobs that actually exist now; and I met with some of the 6,000 students who received more aid to go to college this fall through Rhode Island's Promise. These measures are only the start. It will take time, but I am confident that if everyone pitches in, we will spark Rhode Island's comeback."
