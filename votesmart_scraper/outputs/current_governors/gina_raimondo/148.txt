"Today, the Rhode Island Senate voted 36-0 to approve the Rhode Island Lobbying Reform Act (S.2361 Substitute A). When I first entered office, I identified the need for a comprehensive reform of the state's lobbying laws. This legislation is the result of our efforts to clarify, streamline and strengthen the lobbying laws in our state. I thank Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed; the bill's sponsors Senators Lynch Prata, Goldin, and Lombardi; and the entire Senate for their overwhelming support and collaboration."
