The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that TreeHouse Foods and Creative Snacks Co. are both voluntarily recalling products potentially impacted by sunflower seeds contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.
Products from both manufacturers were distributed nationwide. No illnesses have been reported to date.
The specific products being recalled can be identified by their UPC codes, product descriptions, and their best by date codes.
RIDOH is working to ensure that any of these products that were distributed in Rhode Island are pulled from retailers' shelves.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Customers who purchased TreeHouse Foods products can call 1-800-756-5781 with questions. Customers who purchased Creative Snacks Co. products can call 336-668-4151 with questions.
