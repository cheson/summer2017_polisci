Press Release

The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Hostess Brands, LLC is voluntarily recalling 710,000 cases of select snack cakes and donuts as a direct result of the recent recall by its supplier, Grain Craft, of certain lots of its flour for undeclared peanut residue.
The Hostess Brands products subject to the recall were produced using the Grain Craft flour that has now been recalled and, as a result, these products may contain low levels of undeclared peanut residue. (See the link below for the list of products.)
While those who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to peanuts run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume products containing peanut allergens, the amount of peanut exposure from use of the flours and affected products is considered to be low and is not expected to cause adverse health effects in the vast majority of peanut allergic consumers.
