Governor Gina M. Raimondo and the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation announced the unanimous approval Greystone of Lincoln, Inc. to enter into the first Qualified Jobs Incentive Tax Credit agreement, which will lead to the creation of 25 manufacturing jobs.
Greystone is a manufacturer of high volume, precision computer numerical control (CNC) tuned parts, with an 83-year Rhode Island legacy. Currently employing 226 associates in Lincoln, RI, they are proposing to hire 25 new, full-time, employees with a median annual salary of $52,000 and expand one of its facilities by approximately 10,000 square feet to accommodate new machinery and staff.
"The Qualified Jobs Incentive Act is beginning to make it easier for businesses to grow here," said Raimondo. "By choosing to expand in Rhode Island, Greystone is helping us improve our economy by adding high-quality manufacturing jobs. We look forward to continuing to work with the General Assembly to find more ways to support companies like Greystone to grow and thrive in Rhode Island."
