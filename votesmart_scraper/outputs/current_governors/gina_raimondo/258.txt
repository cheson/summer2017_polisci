Statement

Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate.
"We have made progress. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since August 2007 and we added 300 jobs since last month. But there is much more work to do - we need the economy to create more jobs, and we need the economy to create more high-paying jobs. That's why I am relentlessly focused on making it cheaper and easier to do business here, improving our schools and worker training initiatives, and making our economy more innovative so we get more 21st century companies to invest in Rhode Island."
