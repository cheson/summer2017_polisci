In accordance with a Presidential Proclamation, Governor Gina M. Raimondo has ordered the U.S. and Rhode Island flags to be flown at half-staff at all state facilities and buildings in memory of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away this weekend. The flags will remain at half-staff until sunset on the day of his interment.
"On behalf of all Rhode Islanders, I send my deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's loved ones in this difficult time," Raimondo said. "As a member of the Supreme Court, he served honorably as a dedicated and loyal public servant."
Raimondo also asks Rhode Islanders to lower their flags as a mark of respect.
