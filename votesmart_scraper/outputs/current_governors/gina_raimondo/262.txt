Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's latest economic data.
"We still have a tall hill to climb to turn this economy around. However, we have momentum. Just yesterday, Citizens Bank announced that it will renew its investment in our state with a new corporate campus in Johnston. I will continue to hustle every day - listening to employers' needs and working closely with the General Assembly - to invest in growth, attract new businesses, and rebuild the Rhode Island economy."
