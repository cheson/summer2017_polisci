The Rhode Island Department of Transportation is reminding those planning to attend this weekend's Rhode Island National Guard Open House and Air Show on June 11 and 12 about the availability of free trains to one of Rhode Island's most popular and most attended events of the summer season.
Those going to the Air Show can catch the train at either Providence Station, 100 Gaspee St., Providence, or T.F. Green Station, at 700 Jefferson Blvd., Warwick. There will be two train departures per station to the Air Show, with three return trains stopping at both stations. Train fares will not be collected, and attendees will be asked to consider making a donation to Hasbro Children's Hospital when they arrive at the Air Show.
In this debut year of Air Show train service, the capacity of the trains is limited and is first come, first served. Free parking will be available at the State Offices parking lots and at the T.F. Green Station/Interlink parking garage. Parking is also limited at both locations.
RIDOT will post signs and use its electronic highway message boards to direct attendees to the parking areas. RIDOT also will use its electronic message boards to indicate if the lots and trains are full. As always, parking is free at the Air Show. During the event, RIDOT will provide updates on train availability and traffic conditions on its social media sites on Facebook (www.facebook.com/RIDOTNews) and Twitter (@RIDOTNews).
The latest schedule, which includes a slight change for return trains to better align with the end of the show and to reduce waiting times, is the same for both days of the Air Show and is as follows:
