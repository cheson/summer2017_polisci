Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today encouraged Rhode Islanders to continue to stay inside and off the roads.
"Driving conditions are treacherous this morning, and I urge everyone to stay off the roads," said Raimondo. "The high winds, blowing snow, and extremely cold temperatures make it even more difficult than normal to keep the roads clear. We want to keep Rhode Islanders safe, and we want to give crews and public safety officials space to safely do their jobs."
"I also want to remind Rhode Islanders that even after the snow stops today, we are still expecting dangerous conditions outside due to the severely cold wind chills," added Raimondo. "Please be careful, limit your time outside, and check on loved ones and neighbors to make sure they have what they need to stay warm."
Wind chills are expected to drop to -10 to -20 degrees across the state during the day today. The bitter cold will continue tonight into Monday morning, with wind chills expected to fall to -20 to -30 degrees.
Across the state, Rhode Islanders are reminded to observe parking bans and prepare for possible bridge closures. Drivers should check real-time travel conditions throughout the state before getting on the roads: http://www.dot.ri.gov/travel/cameras_metro.php
