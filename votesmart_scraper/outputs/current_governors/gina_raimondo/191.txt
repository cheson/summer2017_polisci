"I want to thank Chairman McCaffrey and the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for passing legislation this evening that will provide for a comprehensive reform of our state's lobbying laws. Senate Bill 2361, Substitute A, sponsored by Senators Lynch Prata, Goldin and Lombardi, will clarify, streamline and strengthen the lobbying laws in our state. I urge the entire Senate to pass this important piece of legislation."
