Governor Gina M. Raimondo today welcomed LaunchCode, a tech talent placement nonprofit and Real Jobs RI job-training partner, to Rhode Island. She discussed how the state is helping employers meet their IT skills shortages and helping workers build the skills they need to compete for these open positions.

The Governor was joined by Senate President M. Teresa Paiva Weed, Pawtucket Mayor Donald R. Grebien, Department of Labor and Training Director Scott R. Jensen, Dean Lori Ciccomascolo of the University of Rhode Island's College of Continuing Education, officials from LaunchCode and TechHire Rhode Island - the state's tech talent pipeline - and Kenzan, a cutting-edge software engineering and professional services firm in Pawtucket.
"Our economy is shifting rapidly and is increasingly driven by technology," Raimondo said. "Our priority is helping Rhode Islanders build the skills they need to get good paying jobs. As part of this effort, we are participating in President Obama's TechHire initiative and working with LaunchCode to prepare people to compete for open positions in the IT sector in our state."
"LaunchCode's launch in Rhode Island adds to the momentum that our economy is experiencing, in part because of the partnership between Governor Raimondo and the General Assembly on enacting policies and legislation that are focused on putting Rhode Islanders back to work," Senate President Paiva Weed said. "The more we can do to build skills that are in demand by employers in sector after sector, the stronger our workforce, companies, economy and quality of life will become."
LaunchCode will help Rhode Island build a tech talent pipeline and a 21st-century workforce that will connect nontraditional job-seekers to high-paying tech jobs. Raimondo awarded LaunchCode, a nonprofit organization that places qualified candidates into apprenticeships and jobs in tech, a $350,000 implementation grant through her Real Jobs RI job-training plan in November. Rhode Island is LaunchCode's fourth national hiring hub.
During the event, the Governor, Senate President, and Mayor received a coding lesson from two apprentices at Kenzan.
"This is a prime example of how partnership and collaboration between the private sector, public sector and non-profit sector can benefit Rhode Island's businesses and the economy," Mayor Grebien said. "I want to commend LaunchCode for the invaluable work that they do preparing people for the evolving job market and would also like to congratulate Kenzan, a valued member of the Pawtucket business community, for seeking innovative ways to fill their tech talent needs."
"People need pathways to good jobs and companies need talented employees," LaunchCode Executive Director Brendan Lind said. "LaunchCode can address both of these problems while supporting Rhode Island businesses and strengthening the community. We've already seen tremendous interest from local companies that are looking to fill tech jobs. Rhode Island's investment in building a tech ecosystem makes it a natural fit for LaunchCode."
"TechHire Rhode Island is excited to have LaunchCode join our state's tech talent pipeline," said Damian Ewens, an executive of the national non-profit Opportunity@Work and Project Director for TechHire Rhode Island. "LaunchCode's ability to quickly assess and place new tech talent will be a valuable asset for Rhode Island companies."
"Kenzan has gained so much from the tech community in Rhode Island and we are looking to provide a space for the next generation of software developers to grow and to hone their craft," Kenzan President Larry Samuels said. "We feel we can provide the foundation of technical expertise and mentorship that is so integral to the success of LaunchCode's candidates."
"URI's College of Continuing Education is dedicated to delivering curricula and programs that create an intentional effort to help nontraditional learners who seek to initiate a career change or advancement, or to complete a degree to enter or re-enter the workforce," Dean Ciccomascolo said. "We are pleased to partner with LaunchCode to build a bridge between student learning and more favorable employment outcomes."
LaunchCode will be offering a free coding boot camp starting May 9 at URI's Downtown Providence Campus.
"DLT's mission is helping workers find good jobs and helping employers find good workers," Jensen said. "Through our Real Jobs RI partner, LaunchCode, we will help equip Rhode Islanders with 21st century IT skills and better serve companies like Kenzan, whose clients include some of the best-known brands in the world."
