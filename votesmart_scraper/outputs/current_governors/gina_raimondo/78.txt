Press Release

Fifteen years after the passage of gender expression protections in Rhode Island, Governor Gina M. Raimondo announced today that the state employee health plan will cover gender transition services.
In May 2001, Rhode Island became the second state in the country to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or expression, protecting transgender people in employment, housing, credit, and public accommodations.
"Rhode Island is a place that embraces all people and celebrates our diversity," Raimondo said. "I am proud of our state's long tradition of freedom and tolerance. At a time when there is so much divisiveness across the country, we know we are strongest when we come together to make our state a place of opportunity for everyone."
