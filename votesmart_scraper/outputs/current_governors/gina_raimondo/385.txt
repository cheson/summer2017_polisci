Statement
By: Gina Raimondo

Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.
"While I'm pleased that the state's unemployment rate decreased and we created some jobs, our state's economy - and too many Rhode Island families - are continuing to struggle. The ongoing sluggishness in Rhode Island - coupled with lackluster national numbers - underscore the need for bold action to spark an economic comeback. That's why my jobs plan is focused on putting cranes in the sky, making it easier and less expensive to do business in Rhode Island, and training Rhode Island workers."
