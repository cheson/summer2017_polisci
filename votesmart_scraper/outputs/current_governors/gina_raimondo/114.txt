The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) recommends reopening Barrington Town Beach for swimming. This recommendation is based on results from water samples that show bacteria counts at a safe level. RIDOH had recommended that the beach be closed on June 7th because of high bacteria counts. RIDOH will continue to monitor water quality at the beach regularly to ensure safe bathing throughout the season.
The status of a beach may change daily. The most up-to-date beach information is available through a recorded message on RIDOH's beaches telephone line (401-222-2751) and online.
