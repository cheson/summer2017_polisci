The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) is stocking 20 ponds and rivers across Rhode Island with some 6,000 trout in advance of Memorial Day weekend - a popular time for recreational fishing.
As part of a larger network of recreational opportunities in the state, fishing plays an important role in connecting people with nature, promoting health, attracting tourism, and supporting a treasured tradition for Rhode Island families. According to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, there are approximately 175,000 recreational anglers (age 16+) in Rhode Island. And recreational fishing contributes more than $130 million to the economy each year.
Water conditions and temperatures will determine which locations are stocked. For a list of stocked waters, contact DEM's Division of Fish and Wildlife at 789-7481. A current fishing license and a Trout Conservation Stamp are required to keep or possess a trout. The daily creel and possession limit for trout is five from April 9, 2016 through November 30, 2016.
The use of external felt soled or any natural or synthetic porous material capable of absorbing water in any freshwaters in Rhode Island is strictly prohibited. This includes any waters shared with adjacent states in which Rhode Island fishing regulations apply. For more information or to purchase a license, visit www.dem.ri.gov.
