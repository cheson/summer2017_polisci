Press Release
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: July 19, 2016
Location: Providence, RI

In accordance with a Proclamation issued by President Obama, Governor Gina M. Raimondo has ordered U.S. and Rhode Island flags to remain at half-staff at all state facilities and buildings. The flags will remain at half-staff until sunset on July 22, 2016 in honor of the victims of the attack on police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
"Our country has experienced one tragedy after another and too much senseless loss of life," said Raimondo. "It is time to come together and stand up for peace. We must move forward with greater unity in every community and greater compassion for one another."
Raimondo also asks Rhode Islanders to lower their flags as a mark of respect.
