"I applaud Speaker Mattiello and President Paiva Weed for introducing and supporting legislation to restore the RI Ethics Commission's jurisdiction over the General Assembly. Upon passage, it empowers Rhode Island voters to amend our constitution on Election Day to ensure that our state is run ethically and the rules of engagement are clear. This legislation, along with my proposed lobby reform legislation, are historic steps toward restoring Rhode Islanders' confidence in their government."
-Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea
