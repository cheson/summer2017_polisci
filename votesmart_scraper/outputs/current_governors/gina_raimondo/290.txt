Governor Gina M. Raimondo, working with the leadership of the Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority (RIPTA), is encouraging the RIPTA board to consider new alternatives to the proposed fare increases for the elderly and people with disabilities.
"When it comes to our most vulnerable riders of public transit, we must make sure we are weighing all options because mobility is an important part of being able to live independently," Raimondo said. "I am grateful to the leaders at RIPTA for working with our health and human service agencies to find a solution that balances the needs of these riders with RIPTA's fiscal constraints."
