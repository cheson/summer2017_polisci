Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on Rhode Island's latest jobs and unemployment data.
"Today's labor force data is proof that our work to strengthen Rhode Island's economy is paying off. For the first time in almost 12 years, our state's unemployment rate is below the U.S. rate. Private sector employment in Rhode Island is at an all-time high. The economy has added more than 10,000 jobs since I took office. We have clear momentum, and will continue working to create jobs and ensure that Rhode Islanders get those jobs by providing them with the education and skills they need to get ahead."
