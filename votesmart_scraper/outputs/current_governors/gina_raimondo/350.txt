Raimondo's Statement on Rhode Island's Unemployment Rate
Statement

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.
"While Rhode Island's unemployment rate continues to improve, we are still not recovering at pace with the rest of the country. Looking at this latest report, I'm particularly concerned with how much our construction sector continues to struggle. We lost 700 construction jobs in June - a time when good weather should be stimulating this industry. This is largest over-the-month loss in this sector since October 2008.
"The jobs plan I recently signed into law is focused on putting shovels in the ground, training workers, and making it easier to do business in Rhode Island. This is an important start - but everyone has a role to play, and we must all pitch in to make our state's comeback a reality."
