Governor Gina M. Raimondo released the following statement on the announcement of the state's latest economic data.
"Our economy's gain of 1,400 jobs last month is encouraging. Our labor force has experienced two months of strong growth and we've gained 5,000 jobs this year. This encouraging jobs news comes on the heels of a new national report that shows Rhode Island ranks higher than every other New England state for advanced industry job growth. It is good to see Rhode Island moving in the right direction as we put people back to work by supporting local companies with green finance programs, investing in infrastructure, and making Rhode Island a more attractive place to do business. My administration will continue to do more to grow our economy and create 21st century jobs."
