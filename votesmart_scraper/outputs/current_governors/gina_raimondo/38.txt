Real Jobs Rhode Island is designed to ensure that employers have the talent they need to compete and grow while providing targeted education and skills training for workers. This initiative will put employers at the center of job training.
The mission of Real Jobs Rhode Island is to put people to work and by making job-training efforts employer-centered, everyone wins. It's a win for employees who will have a job once their training is complete. It's a win for employers who will have a pipeline of trained workers. And it's a win for Rhode Island as the state looks to attract and grow more companies here.
