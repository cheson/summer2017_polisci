Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on Rhode Island's latest jobs and unemployment data.
"Job growth has been our focus since day one. With this month's growth, the Rhode Island economy has regained all private sector jobs that were lost during the Great Recession and private sector employment is at an all-time high. Along with our new Small Business Assistance Program - which will give microenterprises, minority and women-owned businesses, and other small businesses access to capital in order to grow - this very positive milestone shows momentum. We will continue to build a strong economy that invests in the skills of our workers and the competitiveness of our employers."
