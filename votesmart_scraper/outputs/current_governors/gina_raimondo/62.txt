Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's latest economic data.
"Our economy's gain of 1,700 jobs is welcome news but we still have significant room for improvement," Governor Raimondo said. "This week alone, I have seen some of our initiatives at work. I met a young woman who is pursuing a career at Electric Boat. In the coming years, thousands more will join her. We highlighted the upcoming expansion of another local company - Alexion. With so many workers and families still trying to gain their footing in this evolving economy, I will continue to focus on putting people back to work by strengthening our schools, matching people's skills with employers' needs, and making it cheaper and easier to do business here."
