Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Division of Elderly Affairs Director Charlie Fogarty today issued the following statements in recognition of the 80th anniversary of the Social Security program:
"My top priority is expanding opportunity so everyone has a chance to make it in Rhode Island," said Raimondo. "For 80 years, Social Security has served as an economic lifeline for millions of Americans, and a cornerstone of the commitment our nation has made to its hard-working men and women. The program continues to play an essential role in our state's comeback, providing hope and helping the one in five Rhode Islanders who receive benefits access the services they need to live healthy, secure and independent lives."
"Since President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935, the program has enrolled over 435 million people," said Fogarty. "Almost every Rhode Islander will benefit from Social Security at some point in their lives -- whether it be to maintain financial security during retirement, get assistance to live independently with a disability, or help put a roof over a child's head after the death of a family member. At the time of its passing, the program was considered quite innovative, and its 80th anniversary is a wonderful time to recognize Social Security as the important social covenant that it is, while looking ahead to future innovations in health and welfare that help preserve the dignity and independence of Rhode Islanders for years to come."
