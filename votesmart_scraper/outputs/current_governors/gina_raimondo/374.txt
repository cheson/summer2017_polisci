Governor Gina M. Raimondo, Rhode Island Senate President M. Teresa Paiva Weed and Director of the Department of Environmental Management Janet Coit today officially opened the new public pier at Fort Adams State Park. Construction on the pier began in April 2014 to improve public access to Narragansett Bay.
"Increasing public access to Narragansett Bay is a great way to attract visitors to one of our beautiful state parks," Governor Raimondo said. "Completing this type of project demonstrates Rhode Island is ready to welcome residents and tourists alike to enjoy all our state has to offer."
"This investment in a new pier enables us to attract world-class events to Newport and enhances public access to the Bay," said Senate President Paiva Weed. "Fort Adams State Park is an asset that promotes economic development and tourism, and this investment benefits the community of Newport and the State of Rhode Island."
"Expanding the park's ability to welcome more boats of varying sizes is important as we work to attract even more visitors and water-related events," said Director Coit. "This strategic investment will help promote Fort Adams as an accessible and welcoming destination for years to come."
Funded through the state's annual capital improvement program, the new North Pier is one of several capital improvements at Fort Adams State Park.
The 240-foot long pier - with seven rows of floating docks and a public pump out station - was designed by Louis Berger architects and St. Jean Engineering, both of Providence. Middletown based construction group Reagan Construction completed the work.
