Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.
"Although it is encouraging to see Rhode Island's unemployment rate fall below six percent, there are still far too many families struggling. It's particularly concerning that we are not seeing more growth in the construction industry, especially as we move into the warmer weather when work should be picking up significantly. That's why it is critical we move quickly to put people back to work repairing our roads and bridges and strengthening our economy in the process.
"Every day, I hear from families who are unemployed, underemployed, and just not earning enough to make ends meet. The comprehensive jobs budget approved unanimously by the House this week is a great step, but we have to stay focused and keep moving forward."
