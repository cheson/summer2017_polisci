Governor Gina M. Raimondo today launched the School Building Authority, a component of her Jobs Plan, that includes conducting the first statewide school construction assessment as well as a new funding mechanism for public schools with immediate renovation needs. "We know our kids can't learn in crumbling school buildings and that they must have access to a learning environment that inspires them to do their best," said Raimondo. "Today, we are hitting our school building challenges head on. With this plan, kids and teachers will get better schools and our construction crews will get back to work."
