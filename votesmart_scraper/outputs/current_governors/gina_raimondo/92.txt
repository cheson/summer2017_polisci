The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Kellogg Company is recalling more than 20 products because they may contain undeclared peanut residue.
The products include certain varieties of Mother's, Keebler, Kellogg's Special K brownies, Murray, and Famous Amos snacks and cookies. Products details for the items being recalled are available online.
Kellogg initiated the recall after its supplier, Grain Craft, recalled wheat flour that has the potential to contain low levels of peanut residue.
While consumers with severe peanut allergies should avoid the recalled products, the FDA has stated that the amount of peanut exposure from the flour is low and not expected to cause adverse health effects in the vast majority of peanut allergic consumers. The company has received no reports of related illness to date and is taking this action out of an abundance of caution.
People who purchased the recalled products should discard them and contact Kellogg for a full refund. Consumers can contact Kellogg at 1-800-962-1413.
