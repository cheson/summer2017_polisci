Governor Gina M. Raimondo today announced her choice of Dr. Peter V.

Dr. August, along with the other board members, were confirmed by the Senate in June.
Dr. August is a distinguished professor in URI's Department of Natural Resources Science and is past Director of URI's Coastal Institute. His research and hands-on work with students highlight his dedication to the stewardship of Rhode Island's marine and terrestrial resources.
"I believe this group of dedicated professionals will help Rhode Island develop real world solutions to address the impact climate change has in our state," said Raimondo. "I want to thank Dr. August for committing his time and knowledge to help protect our state's most important resources for generations to come."
