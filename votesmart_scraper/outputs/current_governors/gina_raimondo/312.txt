Statement
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: Oct. 8, 2015
Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the first Rhode Island Cybersecurity Commission ("the Commission") report, making the state one of only a handful to take a leadership role on this critical national security issue. In the first of two expected reports, the Commission provides an assessment of the state's cybersecurity infrastructure with recommendations to enhance the resiliency of government operations within all executive branch agencies. Based on the Commission's recommendations, the state has already begun to strengthen network security by deploying sensors, putting 24/7 monitoring in place, and conducting a real-time threat analysis.
"Rhode Island's already existing strong cybersecurity assets put us in a unique position and being one of a select group of states to have a Cybersecurity Commission only adds to our state leading the country in protecting its citizens from cyber-attacks," said Raimondo. "We all need to work together to maintain the security of our cyberspace and, thanks to the Commission, Rhode Island has already begun to strengthen the security of our networks and engage law enforcement, academia and the private sector in this critical mission. Together, we are developing a strong ecosystem to create jobs and to improve the safety of Rhode Island."
