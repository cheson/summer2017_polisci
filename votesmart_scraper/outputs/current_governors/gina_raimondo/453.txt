Interactions with our state government can often be burdensome and confusing. And the decision-making process can seem arbitrary and opaque. We will fix the way our state bureaucracy works with citizens, assuring top-quality customer service.
We will set up systems for quickly fixing the way our government provides customer service to the public by:
Reviewing regulations department by department
Streamlining overlapping regulations
Establishing single sourcing for permits, mandatory time limits for turning around applications
As treasurer, I implemented a streamlining management strategy called Lean Management. With this effort, my Treasury team eliminated a 900-claim backlog in the Crime Victims Compensation Program and streamlined processes and workflow in the Unclaimed Property Program shortening claim processing time from six to eight weeks to about two weeks. During my tenure as treasurer, we have returned more than $8 million to Rhode Islanders through that program. These techniques can be expanded across state government.
