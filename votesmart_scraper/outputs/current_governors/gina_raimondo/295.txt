Governor Gina M. Raimondo, along with Secretary of Commerce Stefan Pryor, today launched three new innovation-focused incentive programs aimed at jumpstarting Rhode Island's economy. Applications for the Innovation Vouchers, Industry Cluster Grants and Innovation Network Matching Grants are now available online.
"We are pursuing an ambitious economic strategy that will put Rhode Island back in the game," said Raimondo. "With these new tools, we are joining a select group of pioneering states offering these creative options to businesses. Encouraging collaboration across our research institutions, enterprising companies, and state government will make sure we are moving ahead at full speed."
