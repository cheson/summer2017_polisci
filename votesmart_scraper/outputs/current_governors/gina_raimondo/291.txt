As part of her efforts to reduce the effects of climate change and transition to a cleaner, low-carbon energy economy, Governor Gina M. Raimondo today signed an Executive Order to task state agencies with reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions throughout their facilities.
"Developing a strategy that supports a transition to clean energy is a key ingredient to reducing our state's high energy costs," Raimondo said. "As we continue to grow our clean energy economy, it is important that state agencies lead by example and work together to secure a clean and affordable energy future. This Executive Order empowers our State agencies to implement innovative solutions to reduce our state's carbon footprint, address climate change, and make government more efficient."
