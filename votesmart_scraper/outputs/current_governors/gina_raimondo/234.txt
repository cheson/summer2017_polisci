Governor Gina M. Raimondo today announced her intent to nominate Diane Mederos and Dr. Isadore "Izzy" Ramos to the Rhode Island Board of Elections. Raimondo will submit their names to the Rhode Island State Senate for confirmation this week.
"The Board of Elections is important to our democracy, and we need to have strong leadership," Raimondo said. "Last month, I was proud to sign into law legislation that will allow Rhode Islanders to register to vote online. This is just one way we are working hard to make it easier for people to engage with government so that our state becomes a place of opportunity for all. I am confident that Diane and Izzy understand these priorities and will serve our state well, bringing their management experience and commitment to public service to this Board."
"I also want to thank Frank Rego and former Senator Rhoda Perry for their years of service on the Board, and I wish them the very best," added Raimondo.
"It is an honor to have been selected to join the Board of Elections," Mederos said. "I am excited to get to work."
"I look forward to serving on the Board of Elections, and thank Governor Raimondo for her dedication to protecting the integrity of the electoral process," Dr. Ramos said.
Diane Mederos is the former Town Administrator of Bristol. She served in that role from 2004-2012. She also previously worked as District Director for Congressman David Cicilline and as Bristol Town Clerk. Mederos holds a Master of Science degree in public administration from the University of Rhode Island, a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from Roger Williams University and a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and elementary education from Rhode Island College. She lives in Bristol.
