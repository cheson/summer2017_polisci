"Today, the Senate voted to approve the House version of the Lobby Reform Act (H.7388 Substitute A), which now will be sent to the Governor. When I first entered office, I identified the need for a comprehensive reform of the state's lobbying laws. This legislation is the result of our efforts to clarify, streamline and strengthen those laws. I thank House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, Senate President M. Teresa Paiva-Weed along with bill sponsors Senators Lynch Prata, Goldin, and Lombardi, Representatives Jacquard, Williams, Ruggiero, and McEntee; and the full House and Senate for working with me to reinforce Rhode Island's commitment to transparency and effective government."
