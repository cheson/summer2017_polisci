Last night, while serving as the featured guest at Common Cause Rhode Island's annual meeting, Governor Gina M. Raimondo announced her decision to petition the court for the release of documents collected during the grand jury investigation into 38 Studios once the civil lawsuit is completed. Below is a statement from Governor Raimondo:
"Rhode Islanders were hurt by the 38 Studios deal and they rightfully demand and deserve transparency. It was a bad deal for taxpayers and I was against it from the very beginning. Like most Rhode Islanders, I remain frustrated by the lack of information that can be shared publicly from this tax-payer funded investigation. Therefore, at the conclusion of the Superior Court civil case, I will be petitioning the Court to authorize the release of all documents and materials associated with the grand jury investigation."
