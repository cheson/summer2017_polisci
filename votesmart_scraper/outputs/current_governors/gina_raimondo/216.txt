The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Schulze and Burch Biscuit Co. is voluntarily recalling a variety of Millville Protein Chewy Bars because of potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination.
The Millville Protein Chewy Bar products were nationally distributed through Aldi stores. The specific products begin recalled can be identified by their UPC codes, product descriptions, and best by dates.
Schulze and Burch Biscuit Co. became aware of the potential contamination when informed by their supplier about sunflower seeds potentially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals may suffer short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Consumers who purchased any of the recalled products are urged to dispose of or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions should call (888) 886-3879.
