Press Release
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: Feb. 5, 2016
Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo urges Rhode Islanders to take caution as heavy, wet snow continues to fall across the state.
"As you prepare for the commute home, please keep in mind that our area continues to experience heavy snow and strong winds," Raimondo said. "We are also aware of power outages across the state, and are asking for patience as crews work quickly. Stay off the roads if you can to leave room for plows and allow public safety officials to do their jobs. Remember to check on your loved ones and neighbors."
The Governor is in contact with state agencies as well as National Grid to monitor the storm. Rhode Islanders should expect strong winds and heavy snowfall, both of which have already caused power outages in some areas. Governor Raimondo also encouraged residents to notify National Grid of power outages at 1 (800) 465-1212.
Safety & Preparedness Reminders:
* Remove all snow from your vehicle before driving.
* Keep a shovel, windshield scraper, flashlight, food & water in case of an emergency
* If you come across traffic lights with no power, treat those intersections as a 4 way stop (as applicable).
* Keep your gas tank full.
* Install good winter tires with adequate tread.
* Check your windshield wiper fluid.
* Plan trips carefully, listening to the news for the latest weather forecasts and road conditions.
* If you come across a downed wire, do not touch. Always assume downed wires are live. If the wire poses a threat, call 911 immediately.
* Snow is heavy and wet. When shoveling snow, take frequent breaks to avoid overexertion, which could lead to heart attack. Additionally, remember to clear nearby fire hydrants when shoveling out.
* Check on your neighbors and loved ones to make sure they are prepared for cold weather and snow.
