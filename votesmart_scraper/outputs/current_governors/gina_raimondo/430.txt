Governor Gina Raimondo today announced six nominations for the I-195 Redevelopment Commission as a first step in advancing efforts to revitalize the vacant parcel in Providence. Raimondo is submitting the six nominees for consideration to the Rhode Island Senate for confirmation. "We're focused on expanding opportunity and creating jobs for Rhode Island families, and the 195 land can be a key lever to attract businesses and boost economic growth," Raimondo said. "We are grateful to Colin Kane and the other former commissioners for their public service to the people of Rhode Island, which helped lay the groundwork for our efforts. I want to thank Joe, Bob, Beppie, Melissa, Ed and Sandra for their commitment to this critical project, which has the potential to move our state forward and create real economic opportunities for Rhode Islanders."
