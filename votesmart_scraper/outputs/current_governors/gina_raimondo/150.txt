In an effort to make it easier for families to visit the Rhode Island National Guard Open House and Air Show, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) for the first time is offering free train service to the show -- one of the most popular and most attended events of Rhode Island's summer season.
RIDOT, working in conjunction with the R.I. National Guard, the National Guard Association of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, the Quonset Development Corporation, Seaview Railroad, and the MBTA, will offer two trains in each direction to the Air Show, which takes place at Quonset State Airport in North Kingstown on June 11 and 12. In this debut year of Air Show train service, the capacity of the trains is limited and is first come, first serve.
Those going to the Air Show can catch the train at either Providence Station, 100 Gaspee St., Providence, or T.F. Green Station, at 700 Jefferson Boulevard, Warwick. There will be one train per station to the air show, but the return trains will stop at both stations. Train fare will not be collected, and attendees will be asked to consider making a donation Hasbro Children's Hospital when they arrive at the Air Show.
"The Air Show is one of the most beloved events of the summer, and draws tens of thousands of people," RIDOT Director Peter Alviti, Jr. said. "We're pleased to provide a transit option for the show for visitor convenience and to help reduce long traffic jams we typically see on highways leading to the show."
