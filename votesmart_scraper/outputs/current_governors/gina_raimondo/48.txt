Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on Rhode Island's latest jobs and unemployment data.
"Today's report reinforces the need to remain tirelessly focused on building a strong and innovative 21st century economy by investing in the skills of our people and the competitiveness of our employers. Just yesterday, we launched Skills for Rhode Island's Future, a model based on the success of Skills for Chicagoland's Future, which will make direct connections between the workers we are training and the businesses that are hiring.
"Participating employers, including Electric Boat, CVS Health, and Bank of America, have already committed to hire 150 unemployed workers through this initiative, and I encourage all Rhode Island employers to join them. The more employers who sign up, the more unemployed Rhode Islanders will get back to work and onto promising career pathways at quality companies. This is the type of collaboration we need to keep growing our economy."
