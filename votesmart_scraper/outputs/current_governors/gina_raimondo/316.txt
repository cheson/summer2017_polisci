Statement
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: Sept. 22, 2015
Location: Providence, RI

Governor Raimondo is working with emergency management officials from the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency (RIEMA), Department of Health (RIDOH), Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), State Police (RISP), Department of Transportation (RIDOT), and Division of Public Utilities and Carriers (RIDPUC) to prepare for Hurricane Joaquin as it moves its way up the Atlantic Coast.
"My number one priority through every storm is making sure Rhode Islanders are safe," said Raimondo. "As the state continues to monitor Hurricane Joaquin, I urge everyone to prepare. Now is an excellent time to go over your family's emergency communications plans and put together a disaster-supply kit. Please check the news and social media for updates, and make sure to take extra caution on the roads as the rain and winds continue over the next few days."
