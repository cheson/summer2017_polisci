Statement
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: May 2, 2017
Location: Providence, RI

Governor Raimondo issued the following statement in response to news that the Block Island Power Company this morning transferred the island's electrical system from diesel generators to energy generated from offshore wind turbines.
"Rhode Island has always led by example. We started America's industrial revolution and built the first textile mill in the country. Now, as Block Island transitions to wind power, we're leading again in the renewable revolution. I'm proud to be Governor of the only state with steel in the water and blades spinning over the ocean. Because of our leadership and innovation in the renewable energy sector, we are putting Rhode Islanders back to work and Rhode Island back in the game."
