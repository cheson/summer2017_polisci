Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.
"The decrease in the unemployment rate is encouraging, but we were down 2,700 jobs between January and February. This report underscores what we already know: we urgently need to reignite Rhode Island's economy," said Governor Raimondo. "We need to create a friendlier, less burdensome environment for businesses to grow. And we need to make smart and targeted investments in education, workforce training, and in efforts to attract businesses to come invest in Rhode Island."
