The National Endowment for the Arts today announced that ten Rhode Island organizations, including the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, will receive $1,084,500 in federal grants through the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). These grants will support activities in communities throughout Rhode Island that effect our state's economy, quality of life and educational programs.
National Endowment for the Arts Chairman Jane Chu said, "The arts are all around us, enhancing our lives in ways both subtle and obvious, expected and unexpected. Supporting projects like the ones in Rhode Island offers more opportunities to engage in the arts every day."
Randall Rosenbaum, Executive Director of the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, applauded the federal arts funding agency for its support. "We have seen clear evidence that the arts contribute dramatically to the Rhode Island economy and to the education of our children," Rosenbaum said. "This federal support, matched with state dollars, helps to ensure that we continue to be a creative state, able to compete on the national stage with young people who learn through the arts to be the imaginative thinkers and problem-solvers of the twenty-first century."
A list of the projects receiving funding is below:
