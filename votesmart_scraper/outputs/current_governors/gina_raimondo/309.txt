As part of her continuing effort to make it easier and less expensive to do business in Rhode Island, Governor Gina M. Raimondo today met with business leaders at Amica to hear how the elimination of the sales and use tax on commercial energy is putting money back into the pockets of local companies.
"I am focused everyday on how we can work together to create jobs," said Raimondo. "A key component to that mission is making it easier and less expensive for our companies to operate here. Eliminating this tax will put over over $20 million this fiscal year back in their pockets for investment and growth."
