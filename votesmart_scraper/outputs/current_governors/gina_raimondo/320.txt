Governor Gina M. Raimondo today continued to highlight recent investments in education by focusing on increasing college access and affordability. The Rhode Island's Promise scholarship will help students with proven academic performance to tackle the gap between their financial aid package and the actual costs of college.
"My dad took advantage of the GI Bill and became the first person in our family to go to college. That enabled him to get a good job. One person going to college changed all of our lives," said Raimondo. "Now more than ever, higher education can be the ladder to the middle class. Rhode Island's Promise will open the door of opportunity for so many Rhode Islanders."
