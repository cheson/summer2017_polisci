Press Release
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: May 31, 2016
Location: Providence, RI

The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) announced today mosquito larvicide will be available to communities tomorrow to help control mosquito populations statewide.
WHEN: Wednesday, June 1 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
WHERE: Building #75, East Farm; University of Rhode Island Route 108, South Kingstown
Larviciding is recommended as part of the state's action plan for West Nile Virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and considered an effective strategy to reduce mosquito populations and related disease risk. The larvicide is placed in underground stormwater catchment basins which are prime breeding areas of mosquitoes that carry West Nile Virus. Four Star, a briquette that releases environmentally-benign bacteria over a 90-day period, will be distributed. Only one application is required per season.
It is recommended that cities and towns treat all underground catchment basins with larvicide. While DEM will provide communities with a limited supply free of charge tomorrow, additional product is available for purchase directly from the distributor. Funding for tomorrow's distribution is provided by DEM and the Rhode Island Department of Health. For more information, call Al Gettman at 789-6280.
