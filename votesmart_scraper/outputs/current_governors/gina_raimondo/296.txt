Raimondo Statement on Syrian Refugees
Statement

Location: Providence, RI

"On behalf of all Rhode Islanders, I send my deepest condolences to those impacted by Friday's tragic violence in Paris. Our thoughts and prayers are with the French people. We stand together.
"We haven't received any requests to assist the settlement of refugees from Syria, so there's nothing to decide at the moment. If a request is made, we will coordinate closely with the White House and with the State Police. Anything Rhode Island may do in the future to support our nation's efforts to respond to this humanitarian crisis and help those in need must include robust background checks and security procedures to keep Rhode Islanders safe."
