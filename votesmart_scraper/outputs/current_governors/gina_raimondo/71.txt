Date: July 7, 2016
Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo visited Roger W. Wheeler State Beach recently to sign an Executive Order announcing Sunday, July 24 as Governor's Bay Day. She also highlighted new, reduced state beach parking fees and encouraged all Rhode Islanders to enjoy the state's natural resources.
Governor's Bay Day will include free parking at all Rhode Island state beaches, as well as fishing in Rhode Island's saltwaters without a fishing license. The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) will also waive the roundtrip fare on all service to South County Beaches on Route 66 (URI/Galilee). Service to the beach will be provided on a first come, first served basis.
"I encourage all Rhode Islanders to enjoy our great beaches and parks every day, but especially on Governor's Bay Day," Raimondo said. "We are lucky to live in a state where some of the best fishing, hiking and boating are in our backyard, and now our beaches are more accessible and affordable. I hope to see many of you at the beach!"
"Our family loves going to the beach every summer, and Governor's Bay Day is the perfect opportunity to show off the beautiful natural resources we have here in the Ocean State," First Gentleman Andy Moffit said. "As the chair of the Outdoor Recreation Council, I encourage everyone to get outside and enjoy all our state has to offer."
Parking will be free at all state beaches:
* Charlestown Breachway, Charlestown, RI
