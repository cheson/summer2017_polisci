Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement reminding Rhode Islanders to prepare for severe winter weather.
"The National Weather Service has issued a Blizzard Warning for all of Rhode Island for Monday night through Wednesday morning. We are hard at work tracking the path of the storm, positioning our assets, and preparing to respond. I will remain in regular communication with all of the appropriate agencies, as well as with our municipal and federal partners. Rhode Island will be as ready as possible, but make no mistake: this could be a very severe and dangerous weather event. We will continue to keep you updated before, during, and after the storm.
"I urge all Rhode Islanders to also take the steps necessary now, ahead of the storm, to be prepared. This includes making sure to have sufficient food, water, and fuel for the next few days. You can find more information on this below, and please continue to follow the news for new updates."
