Press Release

Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today announced a collaboration with the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program to support her ongoing efforts to get Rhode Islanders back to work. Brookings, with its strong track record in developing successful economic strategies in Buffalo, New York and Chicago, Illinois, among other places, will work to identify economic development initiatives that can benefit all Rhode Islanders, with a special focus on the state's advanced industries.
"Our mission is to get Rhode Islanders back to work," Raimondo said. "Every day I am focused on implementing all the best tools to jumpstart our economy and grow jobs. The jobs plan passed in June is a strong start, but we can't stop there." Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor, who is spearheading the Brookings collaboration for the State, said, "Given the recent passage of our jobs plan, we are looking forward to working with Brookings to determine how best to target our new tools. In addition, we aim to develop a high-impact strategy that builds upon Rhode Island's strengths and advances our economy."
