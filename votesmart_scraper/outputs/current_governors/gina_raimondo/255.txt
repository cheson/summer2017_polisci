Governor Gina M. Raimondo and the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation on Monday announced the launch of the state's new integrated tourism and business-attraction campaign. This statewide strategic campaign is designed to supercharge Rhode Island's economic engine and put Rhode Islanders back to work.
"Rhode Islanders know our state is a great place to live, work and visit, and now we are moving forward with an exciting plan to make sure everyone else knows that, too," said Raimondo. "By coordinating our resources and working together to highlight Rhode Island, we will attract new visitors, families and businesses and help make our state a place of opportunity for everyone."
"Rhode Island: Cooler and Warmer" aligns the state's best resources--its unparalleled quality of life, tourism appeal and business-friendly environment--to drive economic growth.
"This campaign is an important part of our ongoing effort to revitalize Rhode Island's economy," said R.I. Secretary of Commerce Stefan Pryor.
"For too long, Rhode Island was inconsistent in telling our story and was not front and center in conversations that determine where businesses decide to grow and where tourists decide to visit," said R.I. Commerce Corporation Chief Marketing Officer Betsy Wall. "We have conducted extensive market research to develop an innovative and lively plan to reclaim what has always been our story--that of a dynamic place to live, work and visit."
This integrated effort strengthens Rhode Island's commitment to tourism and business attraction, thanks to budget funding proposed by the Governor and passed by the General Assembly last year. This past fall, the Commerce Board engaged a team to design a campaign aimed at raising the state's profile and advancing economic growth.
