Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the PARCC scores:
"As we continue to focus on growing the Rhode Island economy and preparing young people for the challenging careers of the 21st-century, we have to develop and support great schools and a world-class public education system. Today's PARCC results show that our scores are moving in the right direction, but I am not satisfied with the results, and we cannot afford to take our foot off the gas. We have a great deal of work ahead of us and we need to stay focused to ensure that every Rhode Island student graduates from high school ready for college and career. We all have a role to play. Our students work hard every day and our teachers and parents are committed to their success. As we start a new school year, we must all recommit to building a brighter future for every Rhode Island student."
