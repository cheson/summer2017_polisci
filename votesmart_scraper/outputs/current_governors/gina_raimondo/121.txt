The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Brown & Haley, Maranatha, and Kashi are all recalling sunflower kernel-containing products because of possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.
The recalled products include trail mix, granola, sunflower seed butter, and snack bars. All three of the companies' recalls are related to an expanded recall issued by their supplier of sunflower kernels, SunOpta.
The specific products being recalled can be identified by their UPC codes and best-by dates.
Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Consumers who have purchased these products should discard them.
