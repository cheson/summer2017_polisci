Location: Providence, RI

The Rhode Island Jobs Plan will create thousands of family-supporting jobs by putting shovels in the ground, making it easier and less expensive for companies to invest in Rhode Island, and training Rhode Island workers.
Our economy is making progress, but there is much more work to do to create growth that includes everyone. If we remain committed to growing 21st century businesses and attracting high-wage, high-skill jobs, I am confident that we will achieve our shared goal of creating jobs and expanding opportunity for all Rhode Islanders.
