Over the last decade, state spending on our criminal justice system has increased dramatically. Rhode Island has made important improvements to the system in recent years, but more must be done. Supporting our comeback includes making sure our criminal justice resources are going towards strategies most likely to protect the public and promote stronger, healthier communities.
The Justice Reinvestment Working Group will advise on ways to improve Rhode Island's criminal justice system, with the overarching goals of protecting public safety, reducing recidivism, addressing racial disparities, promoting stronger, healthier communities, and reducing cost.
