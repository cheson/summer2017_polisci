Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on Rhode Island's latest jobs and unemployment data.
"Eleven hundred more Rhode Islanders are employed this month than last month, and more Rhode Islanders are working today than at any point since June 2008. We need to keep doing more, but this is encouraging news and shows that businesses are taking a fresh look at Rhode Island. Since January, the Commerce Corporation's real estate incentives, including Rebuild RI, have leveraged nearly $400 million in private investment and the Qualified Jobs economic incentive is helping to create nearly 500 jobs in the state.
"Other initiatives are helping position Rhode Island for sustained, long-term growth. Our effort to bring computer science to every school in Rhode Island by the end of 2017 is working. More than half of our schools already have a program in place - putting us five months ahead of schedule. And just yesterday we set a goal that by 2025, when the kids who were born this year hit third grade, three out of four third graders will be reading at grade level - double the current rate. This is the momentum we need to keep going to drive better results for our economy and our state's future."
