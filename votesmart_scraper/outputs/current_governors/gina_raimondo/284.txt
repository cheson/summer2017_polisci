Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement applauding the Rhode Island General Assembly for their efforts to establish the Good Samaritan Overdose Prevention Act of 2016:
"Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in Rhode Island and touches every community in our state," Raimondo said. "The Good Samaritan Overdose Prevention Act of 2016 is an important tool to combat this public health crisis. Rhode Island's response to the overdose crisis must first and foremost be focused on saving lives. I applaud the General Assembly for taking swift action early in the session to encourage Rhode Islanders to call 911 in an overdose emergency. I also look forward to working with the legislature to pass a comprehensive plan based on the recommendations from the Overdose Prevention and Intervention Task Force."
