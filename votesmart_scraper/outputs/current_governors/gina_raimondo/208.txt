Governor Gina M. Raimondo unveiled today an action plan aimed at reducing the number of overdose deaths in Rhode Island over the next three years. She also urged the General Assembly to pass the $4 million funding proposal in her FY 2017 budget which expands access to peer recovery and supports medication-assisted treatment at the Department of Corrections.
"We have a single focus in our work to address the overdose crisis: save lives," Raimondo said. "We can't work fast enough across the state to help those most directly affected by this crisis. As a parent, my heart breaks for the hundreds of Rhode Island families who have lost loved ones to addiction and overdose. We must continue to demand action and make swift change to promote prevention, treatment and recovery, and end the stigma of addiction."
What they're saying:
"Our family's loss is sadly not unique. We appreciate Governor Raimondo's efforts to end the stigma of addiction and take meaningful steps to help prevent addiction, promote treatment and save lives. The overdose epidemic that's gripping Rhode Island and the rest of the nation is a public health crisis. Rhode Island's detailed action plan and the Governor's proposed investments in treatment and recovery are critically important and essential steps toward ending the crisis in our state and ensuring that everyone has an opportunity to live a healthy, productive life."
