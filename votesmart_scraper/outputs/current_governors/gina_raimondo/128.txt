The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Kashi Company and Quaker Oats Company are recalling products because of potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.
Kashi is recalling Trail Mix Chewy Granola Bars and Bear Naked Soft Baked Granola: Cinnamon + Sunflower Butter with specific UPC codes and best-by dates. Quaker Oats is recalling Quaker Quinoa Granola Bars with specific UPC codes and best-by dates. All of the recalled products contain sunflower seeds from the supplier SunOpta, which could have been contaminated.
Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Consumers who have purchased these products should discard them. Kashi customers with questions should call 1-877-747-2467 for more information. Quaker Oats customers with questions should call 1-800-856-5781 for more information.
