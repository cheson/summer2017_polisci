Issue Position
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: Jan. 1, 2017
Location: Providence, RI

One year after Governor Raimondo established the Working Group to Reinvent Medicaid, Rhode Island is positioned to expand and improve access to quality care and reduce costs.
The state is projected to achieve over $100 million of annual Medicaid savings without cutting eligibility or reducing benefits.
These reforms protect and expand vital health services and shift the state's Medicaid system toward a structure that rewards better outcomes, better coordination and higher-quality care.
