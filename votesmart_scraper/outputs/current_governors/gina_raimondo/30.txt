In order for Rhode Island's economy to thrive, state government needs to operate at the speed of business. All state employees, from the front line to upper management, need the tools and resources to think strategically and make state government more customer service-oriented, predictable, and efficient for our taxpayers.
One tool proven to work in the manufacturing industry is Lean, a business process improvement method that leads to the elimination of waste, added value, and a culture of continuous improvement. Embedding tools such as Lean methodology throughout state government will foster innovation and creative problem solving by all of our employees.
