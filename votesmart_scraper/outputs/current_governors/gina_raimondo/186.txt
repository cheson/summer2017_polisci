The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Dr. Prager's Sensible Foods, Inc. is voluntarily recalling various not-ready-to-eat frozen food items due to possible Listeria monocytogenes contamination.
The recalled products were distributed to stores in Rhode Island, including Stop and Shop, Aldi, and Trader Joe's. A listing of product descriptions and lot numbers being recalled is available online.
This voluntary action is being undertaken in cooperation with the Food and Drug Administration because these products contain vegetables that are part of the recent CRF Frozen Foods recall. No illnesses have been reported in association with recalled items.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals may suffer short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Consumers who purchased any of the recalled products are urged to dispose of or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions should call (877) 772-3437.
