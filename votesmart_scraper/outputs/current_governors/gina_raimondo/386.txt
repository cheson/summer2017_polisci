Raimondo, Pryor Statements on Stadium Proposal
Statement
By: Gina Raimondo

Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor today released the following statements regarding the proposal to build a minor league baseball stadium in Providence.
"The PawSox are an important institution in Rhode Island and our goal is to keep them in the state," said Raimondo. "The idea of a stadium in downtown Providence that can be used for multiple purposes is exciting. That said, my top priority is getting Rhode Islanders back to work, and we have very limited resources to invest in economic growth - especially in the face of a large structural deficit. I am committed to working with Mayor Elorza, the Speaker, and the Senate President to evaluate whether this project is in the best interest of Rhode Island, and whether we can afford it."
"We hope and aim to keep this treasured team in Rhode Island," said Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor. "The project has the potential to enhance the vitality of a key district within our capital city. At the same time, this proposal involves a significant request for public resources. In collaboration with the City of Providence and the General Assembly, we will review this proposal in order to determine whether it makes financial sense and whether it will help catalyze the I-195 corridor."
