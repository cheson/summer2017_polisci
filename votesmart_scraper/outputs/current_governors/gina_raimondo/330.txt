Governor Gina M. Raimondo, along with the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency (RIEMA), Department of Environmental Management (DEM), and Department of Health (DOH) urges Rhode Islanders to use caution, stay cool, and check on elderly neighbors during periods of extreme heat.
In the wake of the weekend temperatures reaching above 90 degrees, temperatures also reached 90 degrees this afternoon. According to the National Weather Service, when the outside temperature reaches 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above for three or more days, it is a heat wave.
"During periods of extreme heat, I urge Rhode Islanders to stay cool and hydrated," said Raimondo. "Extreme heat can pose numerous threats, especially towards older adults, young children, and those with chronic health conditions. Check on your family, friends, and neighbors and make sure they are taking the proper precautions to stay cool."
Some Rhode Island communities have public cooling centers available for those who need to temporarily escape from the heat. For a list of cooling centers near you, visit the RIEMA website at www.riema.ri.gov/coolingcenters/ for an up-to-date list, or contact your local municipalities for more information.
