Location: Providence, RI

The Rhode Island Department of Revenue today released its FY 2015 Local 1.0 Percent Hotel Tax Collections Report for March 2016. The Local 1.0 Percent Hotel Tax Collections Report, which is issued on a monthly basis, compares the collections from the state's local 1.0 percent hotel tax on a month-to-month, year-over-year, and fiscal year-to-date over fiscal year-to-date basis. The local 1.0 percent hotel tax is collected on the rental of rooms in the state and remitted, in full, to the municipality in which the room rental was located.
Highlights from the report as noted by Director of Revenue Robert S. Hull were * Month-to-month increase in local 1.0 percent hotel tax collections was 39 percent, more than double the growth recorded between March 2015 and February 2015; * Year-over-year increase in local 1.0 percent hotel tax collections for March 2016 was robust at 29.4 percent and significantly higher than the 4.0 percent year-over-year increase posted in March 2015; * Year-to-date FY 2016 local 1.0 percent hotel tax collections through March rose to 12.2 percent over the same period last fiscal year and 4.4 percentage points higher than for the year-to-date over year-to-date growth rate recorded for FY 2015 through March.
The entire report can be found on the Department of Revenue's web site at http://www.dor.ri.gov/revenue-analysis/2016.php under the Local Reports tab. The full report includes the break down by municipality of local hotel tax collections on a month-to-month, year-over-year, and fiscal year-to-date over fiscal year-to-date basis.
Questions or comments on the report should be directed to Paul Grimaldi, Chief of Information and Public Relations by e-mail at paul.grimaldi@revenue.ri.gov or by phone at (401) 574-8766.
Expansion of the Local Hotel Tax Base to Vacation Rentals and Hosting Platforms: The March 2016 report may include FY 2016 local 1.0 percent hotel tax receipts generated from the expansion of the local hotel tax base to include the reselling of lodging by online travel companies, the unlicensed rental of accommodations via internet platforms and other media, and vacation home rentals. At this time, the Office of Revenue Analysis is unable to determine the amount collected from each of these local 1.0 percent hotel tax base expansions and thus an unknown amount of receipts from these expansions may be included in this report.
