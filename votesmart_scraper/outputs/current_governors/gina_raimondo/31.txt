Innovation in cybersecurity will help drive Rhode Island's economy forward. While an increasing reliance on technology poses its own challenges, Rhode Island has a tremendous opportunity to build on a robust network of cybersecurity innovators and expertise to foster resiliency and economic development.
The Rhode Island Cybersecurity Commission will develop a clear strategy to capitalize on the state's ability to grow a thriving cybersecurity industry sector and to continuously improve protections from cyber disruptions in the public and private sector.
