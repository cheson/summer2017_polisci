To encourage kids to choose healthy eating options, Governor Gina Raimondo and First Gentleman Andy Moffit today announced the RI Kids' Healthy Recipe Challenge. In partnership with the RI Community Food Bank and Eat Drink RI, the contest asks for kids in grades 5- 8 to create and submit healthy and affordable food recipes.
"Andy and I always want to be sure that our kids are getting a proper balanced diet, and a lot of that comes from cooking healthy and delicious foods together," said Raimondo. "Healthy kids and families create healthy communities and a stronger economy."
