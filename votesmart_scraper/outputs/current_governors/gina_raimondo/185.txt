"I want to thank Chairman Keable and the members of the House Judiciary Committee for passing legislation this evening that will provide for a comprehensive reform of our state's lobbying laws. House Bill 7388, Substitute A, sponsored by Representatives Jacquard, Williams, Ruggiero, and McEntee, will clarify, streamline and strengthen the lobbying laws in our state.
With overwhelming support from both House and Senate Judiciary Committees, I urge the entire General Assembly to pass this important piece of legislation."
