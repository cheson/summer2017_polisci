Fulfilling a key element of Governor Gina M. Raimondo's plan for jumpstarting the economy and supporting schools, the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education this evening (Tuesday, October 20) unanimously approved funding to kick off school-renovation projects that will spur the Rhode Island economy and ensure the health and safety to schoolchildren.
"These projects will put people to work, and provide safer, healthier, better learning environments for about 30,000 students and their teachers," said Governor Raimondo. "In addition, these projects all are 'shovel-ready' and can get under way immediately. They will create jobs in the construction industry, which will benefit Rhode Island families and will advance our economy. Let's get shovels in the ground and repair our schools!"
