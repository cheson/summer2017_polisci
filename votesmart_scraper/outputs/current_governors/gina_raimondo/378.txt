Raimondo Statement on the PawSox Proposal
Statement
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: April 27, 2015
Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement:
"I would love it if the PawSox stayed in Rhode Island, and the idea of a multi-use stadium in downtown Providence is exciting. But it's my job to look out for Rhode Island taxpayers, and I take that job very seriously.
"From what I understand of the owners' initial proposal, it appears that Rhode Island taxpayers would pay most, if not all of the cost of building the new stadium, yet the owners would stand to receive all of the profits. That isn't fair for Rhode Islanders.
"We look forward to receiving much more information about alternative financial proposals, and I remain committed to working with Mayor Elorza, the Speaker, and the Senate President to evaluate whether we can find a framework with the team's owners that will benefit Rhode Island."
