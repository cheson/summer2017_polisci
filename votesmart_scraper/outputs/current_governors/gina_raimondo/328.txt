Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.
"I am pleased that Rhode Island's unemployment rate continues to decrease and we are gaining back the jobs that have been lost. While I am encouraged by the 3,300 jobs created in June, we must not lose sight of the fact that Rhode Island continues to have the highest unemployment rate in New England and we have a long way to go on the road to economic recovery. With so many families still struggling, we must continue to focus on creating jobs and expanding opportunity. During a time of good summer weather, it is concerning that high unemployment rates and slow job growth continue to persist within the construction industry.
"I am committed to sparking Rhode Island's comeback and although these problems will not be fixed overnight, my jobs plan puts Rhode Island on a path to economic success."
