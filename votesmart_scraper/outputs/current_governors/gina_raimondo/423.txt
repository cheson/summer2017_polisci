As part of her continuing efforts to attract new businesses to Rhode Island and to encourage our existing businesses to expand and grow, Governor Gina M. Raimondo today signed an executive order to improve the state's regulatory process and make Rhode Island more business-friendly. The goal of the order is to make sure that regulations do not impose unnecessary burdens on businesses and residents.
"I wake up every morning focused both on expanding opportunity for Rhode Islanders, and encouraging businesses to create jobs here," Governor Raimondo said. "We're going to take direct aim at Rhode Island's reputation as a difficult place to do business. Today's action is just one step we're taking to improve our regulatory climate in order to attract businesses to Rhode Island, and to encourage our existing companies to expand and grow."
The executive order outlines the following:
Before any new regulation is written by an agency, this agency has to submit a draft to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Executive Office of Commerce (EOC).
When submitting a draft regulation to OMB and EOC, the agency also has to prepare a cost-benefit analysis.
This review process and the guidance associated with it will also set new standards for plain language in regulation, quality of analysis, and cooperation with state agencies.
Key members of Raimondo's administration were involved in the creation of the executive order including: Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor, Director of Environmental Management Janet Coit, Director of Business Regulation Macky McCleary, Director of the Office of Budget and Management Jonathan Womer, and Director of Regulatory Reform Erik Godwin.
