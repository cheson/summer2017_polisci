Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Director of the Office of Management and Budget Jonathan Womer today announced the findings of the RhodeWorks economic impact study conducted by Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI).
"Rhode Island cannot afford to sit on the sidelines while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate," said Raimondo. "This study again confirms that RhodeWorks is a smart approach to fix our crumbling infrastructure, create thousands of jobs, and accelerate our economic comeback by putting millions of dollars into the pockets of Rhode Islanders. It's time to stop dragging our feet and start taking action."
