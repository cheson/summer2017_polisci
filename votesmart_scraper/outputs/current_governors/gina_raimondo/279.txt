Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate.
"Rhode Island's economy is on better footing than it was a year ago. In the past year, Rhode Islanders have driven down the unemployment rate 1.7 percentage points -- from 6.8% to 5.1% -- and our economy created 8,400 jobs. This is the most jobs our economy has created in a single year since 2000. But make no mistake: we have a lot more work to do. The Brookings report that came out this week highlights how important it is that we do even more to give Rhode Islanders 21st century skills, and to invest in growing advanced industries here. We have some momentum, but we have much more to do in order to put people back to work, jumpstart our economy, and ensure that everyone can make it in Rhode Island."
