OM16-09 Hodge v. Rhode Island Department of Health -- No Violation
Press Release
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: April 28, 2016
Location: Unknown

The Complainant, a member of the Board of Examiners for Interpreters for the Deaf ("Board"), alleged various allegations, many of which were outside the purview of the OMA. With respect to the OMA, the Complaint alleged that the Board's February 12, 2014 and June 11, 2014 minutes were not timely posted to the Secretary of State's website, and that the Board's July 23, 2014 minutes did not contain an item that Complainant wanted memorialized within those minutes. Rhode Island General Laws ยง 42-46-8(b) prohibits the filing of a complaint by this Department after 180 days from the date of the public approval of the meeting minutes at which the alleged violation(s) occurred. Complainant's OMA allegations were filed with our office on March 30, 2015, outside of the 180-day statute of limitations for our Office to review those allegations. Therefore, we decline to address the merits of Complainant's allegations.
