Location: Providence, RI

As an expression of Rhode Island's sincerest condolences to all those touched by the tragedy at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, S.C., Governor Gina M. Raimondo has directed that Rhode Island flags be flown at half-staff at state facilities and buildings from Friday, June 26 to Monday, June 29.
"This evil and senseless attack stole nine innocent worshipers and has shaken our nation," said Raimondo. "In remembrance of the victims and as a symbol of Rhode Island's support for the Charleston community, I am ordering all Rhode Island flags be lowered to half-staff this weekend. In addition, I commend the members of the General Assembly who recently issued resolutions offering their deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and condemning acts of hatred and prejudice. My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this unthinkable attack."
