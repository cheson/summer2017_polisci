General Treasurer Seth Magaziner today provided the following statement regarding funding in the proposed FY17 State budget for stronger debt management and oversight:
"I am pleased the proposed FY17 State budget includes many of the new tools I proposed to strengthen the management and oversight of public debt in Rhode Island. These resources will enable us to perform the first comprehensive review of State debt policies and targets since the 1990s, and improve oversight of debt issued by municipalities and quasi-public agencies. I thank Governor Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, Senate President M. Teresa Paiva Weed and the members of the House and Senate for their strong commitment to addressing Rhode Island's debt management challenges."
