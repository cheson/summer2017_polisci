As part of her continued efforts to build healthy communities and showcase our state's beauty to the world, Governor Gina M. Raimondo today established the Rhode Island Outdoor Recreation Council. The council will be responsible for increasing awareness about the use and enjoyment of recreational and environmental assets. Raimondo was joined by First Gentleman Andy Moffit, as they both lauded Rhode Island's natural resources and the importance of engaging in outdoor activities as a way to instill healthy habits in children.
"All Rhode Islanders should have the chance to enjoy the countless outdoor recreational opportunities in our beautiful state, and take advantage of these resources as they fulfill New Year's resolutions and lead healthier lifestyles," Raimondo said. "Rhode Island's natural assets are unmatched, with amazing beaches, parks, campgrounds, bike paths, the bay and waterways. The State can do more to encourage use of these resources and promote this critical sector of Rhode Island's economy."
