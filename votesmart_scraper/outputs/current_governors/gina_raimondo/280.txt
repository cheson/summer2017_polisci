Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the report, "Rhode Island Innovates: A competitive strategy for the Ocean State" prepared by the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings:
"This report is a deep, under-the-hood look at what has driven Rhode Island's economic decline -- and how we can act with urgency to move our state forward. It's clear we must tap into our strengths and come together to foster growth in high-skill, high-wage jobs to build the opportunities Rhode Islanders deserve. With an all-hands-on-deck effort, we can move Rhode Island to a strong and vibrant innovation economy."
