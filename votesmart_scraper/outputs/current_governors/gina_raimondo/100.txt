Press Release
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: June 12, 2016
Location: Providence, RI

In accordance with a Presidential Proclamation, Governor Gina M. Raimondo has ordered U.S. and Rhode Island flags to be flown at half-staff at all state facilities and buildings. The flags will remain at half-staff until sunset on June 16, 2016 in honor of the victims of the shooting in Orlando.
"We woke up this morning to horrific news - a senseless, cowardly mass shooting in Orlando. It's an act of terror. It's an act of hatred. And it has no place in our communities. Like so many, I feel incredible sadness and outrage," Raimondo said.
"Our prayers are with the victims and their loved ones, but we must do more than pray. It is time to take greater action to keep America safe," Raimondo continued. "I also want our LGBT brothers and sisters in Rhode Island to know that our hearts are with you - we will redouble our efforts to keep you safe and free from fear, and commit to building a more peaceful, more tolerant society."
There are no specific threats in Rhode Island at this time, but the Governor remains in close touch with Colonel O'Donnell of the State Police, and security efforts will be increased around Pride festivities.
Raimondo also asks Rhode Islanders to lower their flags as a mark of respect.
