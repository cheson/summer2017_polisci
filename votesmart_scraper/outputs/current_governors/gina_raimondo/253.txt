Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate.
"Today's jobs report is encouraging. Not since September 1997 has the Rhode Island economy added this many jobs - 2,700 jobs - in one month. We need to keep going. We will continue to act with urgency to build skills, strengthen our neighborhood schools, make it cheaper and easier to do business, invest in growth, and move to a new economy with high-wage jobs so everyone can make it in Rhode Island."
