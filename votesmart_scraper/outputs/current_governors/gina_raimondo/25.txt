Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on Rhode Island's latest jobs and unemployment data.
"Our unemployment rate and number of unemployed Rhode Islanders are at their lowest levels in almost 10 years. Our economy remains strong, still having regained all the private sector jobs lost during the recession. But as I said on Tuesday night, our economy has changed in ways that are causing real challenges. How we meet these challenges will determine our future. We've already made great progress in rebuilding our economy, and we need to keep the momentum going with bold, innovative solutions like investing in advanced manufacturing and making college more affordable. By standing and working together to meet our challenges, we can ensure that there is opportunity for every Rhode Islander who is willing to work for it."
