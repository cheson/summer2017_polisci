Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today announced that the state has reached a final agreement with SEIU District 1199 New England regarding family child care providers who are a part of Rhode Island's Child Care Assistance Program. SEIU members voted unanimously last night to ratify the two-year agreement. The agreement was reached pursuant to legislation the General Assembly enacted in 2013 establishing collective bargaining rights for family child care providers.
"Investing in our kids, and the systems that care for them, is essential to ensure everyone has an opportunity to make it in Rhode Island," said Raimondo. "Providing quality, affordable child care removes a critical barrier to getting and keeping a job for many of our hardworking families, improves the development of our kids and prepares them for success in the classroom. I am pleased that we have reached an agreement with SEIU to enhance our commitment to high-quality child care and support working families."
