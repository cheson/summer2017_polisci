Raimondo, Pryor to Embark on "Make it in RI" Visit to Daniele Food, Inc.
Press Release
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: Jan. 21, 2015
Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Commerce Secretary Nominee Stefan Pryor will visit Daniele Food, Inc. for their first "Make it in RI" site visit. The stop will give them a sneak peak of Daniele's new facility, opening in April 2015.
"We will create opportunities for Rhode Islanders by building skills, attracting entrepreneurs, and fostering innovation," Raimondo said. "The Dukcevich family's story of hard work and effort, along with their dedication to the state, proves entrepreneurs can 'make it' in Rhode Island."
The new facility has "green" features and will connect to the existing facility at the Burrillville Commerce Park, which will double production capabilities and make the process of dry-curing Italian meats and packaging more efficient.
"Daniele, Inc. is one of the largest prosciutto factories in the world and has recently made a $62 million investment in Rhode Island," said Secretary Nominee Pryor. "I look forward to getting a sneak peak of their state-of-the-art facility and hearing their recommendations about ways we can grow our food industry, making Rhode Island even more of a destination for food-related businesses and culinary innovation."
The Governor and Secretary Nominee are reaching out to employers, business groups, and other stakeholders who are partners in getting Rhode Island back to work as part of the administration's economic growth agenda.
