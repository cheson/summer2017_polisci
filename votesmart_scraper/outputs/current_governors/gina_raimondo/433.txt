Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement following the announcement of the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.
"I am pleased that Rhode Island's unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since March 2008. However, Rhode Island's unemployment rate remains significantly higher than other New England states and the national average. Too many people are still struggling -- we must do more to create opportunity and make sure that everyone can make it in Rhode Island. We will build the skills of our people, create the conditions to attract entrepreneurs and to encourage our existing businesses to grow, and foster innovation throughout the state."
