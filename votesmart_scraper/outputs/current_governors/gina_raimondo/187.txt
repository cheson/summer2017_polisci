The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Quaker Oats Company is voluntarily recalling a small quantity of Quaker Quinoa Granola Bars due to possible Listeria monocytogenes contamination.
The Quaker Quinoa Granola Bars were distributed in Rhode Island. The specific products being recalled are:
6.1-ounce boxes of Quaker Quinoa Granola Bars Chocolate Nut Medley; UPC code 30000 32241; best before dates of 10/16/2016 and 10/17/2016
6.1-ounce boxes of Quaker Quinoa Granola Bars Yogurt, Fruit & Nut; UPC code 30000 32243; best before dates of 10/10/2016 and 10/11/2016
Quaker Oats Company became aware of the potential contamination when informed by their supplier about sunflower seeds potentially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. No illnesses have been reported in association with recalled items.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals may suffer short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Consumers who purchased any of the recalled products are urged to dispose of or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions should call (800) 856-5781.
