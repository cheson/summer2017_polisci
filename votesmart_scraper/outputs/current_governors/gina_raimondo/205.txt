The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers of a recall of certain walnuts and walnut-containing products due to possible Listeria monocytogenes contamination. The products were sold under the names Nature's Promise, Woodstock, Market Basket, and Woodfield Farms.
The lot numbers being recalled, as well as product descriptions, are available online. The lot numbers are printed on the back of each retail bag. The products were shipped to retailers and distributors in limited quantities throughout the United States. Any remaining product with the recalled lot numbers should be discarded.
The recall was issued as a precaution because a single sample in a finished product yielded a positive result for Listeria monocytogenes. No illnesses have been reported in association with the recall and no other walnuts or products under the brands are being recalled.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune symptoms. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Retailers and consumers with questions should call Melissa McCullough at Woodstock Farms Manufacturing customer service at 732-650-9905.
The recall was initiatied by United Natural Trading LLC (also known as Woodstock Farms Manufacturing), which purchased the Gibson Farms.
