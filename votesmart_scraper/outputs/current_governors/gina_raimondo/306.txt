Statement

Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today launched the state's first formal review of the state's education funding formula in an effort to achieve better outcomes for our students, educators and taxpayers.
"A significant part of jumpstarting our economy and creating opportunity for everyone is making sure our kids have access to the best education," Raimondo said. "Rhode Island has a strong formula and it is model for other states. However all key public policies benefit from regular review. After five years, it is time to for a fresh look to review our education funding structure."
