Governor Raimondo recently released the following statement on GE's selection of Boston for its corporate headquarters:
"We worked diligently to recruit GE's headquarters to Rhode Island -- and we'll remain relentless in our efforts to bring jobs to the state. We are thrilled by the great interest GE expressed, particularly in our new economic development tools. We remain in active discussions with GE about the potential to locate other operations jobs in Rhode Island, and we are hopeful that the company's move just up the road will improve the chances of that happening."
