The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Frito-Lay is recalling select Rold Gold Tiny Twists, Rold Gold Thins, Rold Gold Sticks, and Rold Gold Honey Wheat Braided due to a potential undeclared peanut allergen.
This recall is the direct result of a recent recall by a Frito-Lay supplier of certain lots of flour for undeclared peanut residue. The Rold Gold products subject to the recall may have been produced using the recalled flour and, as a result, these Rold Gold products may contain low levels of undeclared peanut residue. More information about the flour recall is available online.
The affected Rold Gold packages are sold throughout the United States, and have "guaranteed fresh" dates ranging from June 28, 2016 through August 23, 2016 on the front of their packages. Directly underneath the "guaranteed fresh" date is a 9-digit manufacturing code that includes the numbers "32" in the second and third positions (example: x32xxxxxx).
The following products with the "guaranteed fresh" dates and manufacturing codes listed above are impacted:
* Rold Gold Tiny Twists - 1 oz. , 2 oz., 16 oz. and 20Â½ oz. * Rold Gold Thins - 4 oz. and 16 oz. * Rold Gold Sticks - 16 oz. * Rold Gold Honey Wheat Braided - 10 oz.
The Rold Gold Tiny Twists are also included in select multipack offerings. The impacted multipacks have "use by" dates on the front of the package. Directly next to or underneath the "use by" date is a 11-digit manufacturing code that includes the letter combination AM, TO, QH, QC, or SW in the second and third positions (example: xAMxxxxxxxx). The impacted products have varying "use by" dates, including:
* 20 count Baked & Popped Mix - "use by" dates ranging from May 31 to July 26, 2016 * 20 count SunChips & Rold Gold Mix - "use by" dates ranging from June 14 to August 9, 2016 * 32 count Fun Times Mix -- "use by" dates ranging from June 14 to August 9, 2016 * 30 count Baked & Popped Variety Pack - "use by" dates ranging from June 14 to August 9, 2016 * 30 count Home Town Favorite Variety Pack - "use by" dates ranging from May 31 to July 26, 2016
To date, Frito-Lay has received no reports of illness related to the products covered by this recall.
