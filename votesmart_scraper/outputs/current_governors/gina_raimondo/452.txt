In a state as closely-knit as Rhode Island, we are all each other's neighbors. That's why it's critically important that we all feel safe in our communities. It goes without saying that our children cannot grow and learn if there are guns in their schools and gangs on their streets, and our businesses cannot thrive if citizens of all ages don't feel safe in our cities and towns.
None of us will ever forget tragedies like Newtown and Aurora. But if there is anything to be learned from these heartbreaking moments, it's that we need to come together as a community and pass measures to ensure that our state is the safest it can possibly be.
As governor, I will work to ensure that guns do not fall into the hands of the wrong people, and to restrict the number of guns on the street by banning the sale and purchase of military-style weapons, as well as high-capacity magazines.
