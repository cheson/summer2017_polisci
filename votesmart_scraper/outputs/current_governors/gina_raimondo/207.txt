Location: Unknown

As part of an ongoing bridge preservation project, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) will be temporarily closing Metro Center Boulevard to southbound traffic from Kilvert Street to just north of 100 Metro Center Boulevard (the area over the Airport Connector) in Warwick. The closure is scheduled to begin Monday morning, May 16 and continue through August 2017.
The Metro Center Boulevard Bridge will remain open for northbound traffic. Southbound traffic will need to follow the signed detour using Jefferson Boulevard South to Route 113 (Main Avenue) West to Route 5 (Greenwich Avenue) North and back to Metro Center Boulevard.
Work at the Metro Center Boulevard Bridge, anticipated to cost $750,000, includes repairs to the deck, joint replacement, steel beam repairs, and repainting the bridge. During construction, crews will typically be working weekdays from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. The painting will most likely occur during the overnight hours from below on the Airport Connector. Lane closure information will be available at www.dot.ri.gov/travel/traveladvisories.php.
The Metro Center Boulevard Bridge work is part of a larger $8 million bridge preservation project, with a budget contingency of $400,000, encompassing repairs to the Airport Connector, seven bridges, and the resurfacing of a portion of Route 2 in Warwick.
Visit www.dot.ri.gov or follow RIDOTNews on Facebook or Twitter for timely information on construction projects and traffic conditions across the state. All work is weather-dependent and subject to change.
