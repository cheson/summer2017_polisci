Public Statements
Raimondo to Launch Web-Based Open Budget Tool
Press Release
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: March 12, 2015
Location: Providence, RI

As part of her first budget presentation, Governor Gina M. Raimondo will launch the state's first web-based budget tool this evening to help Rhode Islanders better navigate and understand the many ways this proposal will create jobs and opportunities for all Rhode Islanders.
"We need all Rhode Islanders to be a part of sparking our comeback, and I am hopeful this online tool will help engage them in the process," Governor Raimondo said. "I am committed to fostering innovation across state government and providing greater access and transparency to the taxpayers."
"One of the Governor's priorities is finding new ways to present complex information to help engage constituents," said Thom Guertin, Rhode Island's Chief Digital Officer. "My team led this effort in collaboration with the Governor's Office and the Office of Management and Budget to give Rhode Islanders a user-friendly way to interact with the budget."
With this tool, the state is able to publish budget and spending data dating back to 2008 in a quick, user-friendly way. Rather than wading through hundreds of pages of scanned documents of legal and financial information, Rhode Islanders can search the budget and spending information through charts and data. This web portal will be updated throughout the budget process and will be accessible from mobile devices.
This web tool will launch at 7p.m. on Thursday, March 12, 2015 at http://openbudget.ri.gov/#/.
The Governor will deliver her Budget Address, and share many more details, today, March 12th at 7:00 p.m. The Governor's Office will be using #comebackRI and #JOBSbudget on social media.
