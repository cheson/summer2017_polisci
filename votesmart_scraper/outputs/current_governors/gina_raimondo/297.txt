Today, Governor Gina M. Raimondo released the following statement on PARCC results:
"The PARCC results released today are disappointing, but not surprising. The results confirm what we already know from Rhode Island's NAEP scores, our high school and college graduation rates, and our remediation rate: too many of our children do not have the skills they need to succeed in today's economy. Our kids deserve better. Improving our schools is essential to turning our economy around. The only way young people will be able to succeed in today's economy is if they have the skills necessary for high-quality, family-supporting jobs.
"Over the past year, we've expanded early childhood education, increased students' access to college credit while in high school, and worked to make college more affordable for more families. I am working closely with our state's education leaders to build on this progress, and on our ongoing effort to review the funding formula, with an action plan to help our students thrive and have the opportunities for success that they deserve."
