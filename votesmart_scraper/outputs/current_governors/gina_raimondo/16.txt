Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on Rhode Island's latest jobs and unemployment data.
"Rhode Island's unemployment continues to trend downward, our labor force is growing, businesses are giving Rhode Island a fresh look and thousands more people are working today than two and a half years ago. Because of the investments we've made in education, workforce training and economic development, Rhode Island's economy is on the move. This month's jobs report, though, is a reminder that there is still a great deal of work left to do. The Rhode Island Promise Scholarship proposal and our proposed Rhode Island Manufacturing Initiative will help ensure that Rhode Islanders get the good-paying jobs Rhode Island businesses of all sizes are creating."
