Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on the announcement of the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.
"Since January, the Rhode Island economy has added over 6,000 jobs. These numbers are encouraging, but we still have a long way to go to create high-wage, high-skill, family-supporting jobs. As we look ahead to 2016, we remain committed to growing our existing companies and attracting new businesses, and helping everyone make it in Rhode Island."
