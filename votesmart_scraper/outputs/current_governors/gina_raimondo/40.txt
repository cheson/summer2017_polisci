Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement on Rhode Island's latest jobs and unemployment data.
"Jobs are up and the unemployment rate is down, building on the last report in a steady, upward trend," Raimondo said. "Rhode Island is on the move - just this week, we made two major economic development announcements. Wexford Science and Technology, the Cambridge Innovation Center, and Brown University's School of Professional Studies have come together for a deal that will support more than 1,000 construction jobs, create more than 1,000 permanent, good-paying advanced industry jobs, and ultimately become an innovation complex that will power the Rhode Island economy for years. And today, we announced that the global company Virgin Pulse is expanding in Rhode Island - opening a new office in Providence and creating about 300 new jobs over the next five years. The company will begin hiring in the coming months and is already seeking applications for open positions. Along with this month's positive economic data, we are heading into the New Year with strong momentum to grow jobs and make the state a place of opportunity for everyone."
