Raimondo Statement on Twin River's Tiverton Proposal
Statement
By: Gina Raimondo
Date: April 21, 2015
Location: Providence, RI

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today released the following statement:
"With competition from casinos in Massachusetts posing a real threat to an important source of revenue in Rhode Island, we need to examine ways to remain competitive. This is especially true since we have a $190 million budget shortfall this year; we are under-investing in critical areas like workforce development, business-attraction, and infrastructure; and anticipated gaming competition could worsen our budget challenges in the years ahead. This is a proposal that could be beneficial for the state. We look forward to learning more details, and to engaging with the Town of Tiverton about it."
