Governor Gina M. Raimondo today signed an executive order strengthening municipalities for future growth and success. This order will help cities and towns reduce costs and property taxes, helping Rhode Island families and encouraging businesses to grow jobs.
"The Lieutenant Governor and I are committed to exploring innovative ways to strengthen our cities and towns so we can grow our economy and create opportunities for everyone to make it in Rhode Island," Raimondo said. "I am optimistic that this initiative will foster collaboration with our city and town leaders to streamline government services and deliver better value to taxpayers."
"As a former Mayor with experience consolidating government services in the best interest of the taxpayers, I am looking forward to working with our municipalities on this important initiative," Lt. Governor McKee said. "I would like to thank Governor Raimondo for her leadership and I look forward to our continued progress in the months and years ahead."
The executive order empowers the Lt. Governor's office to develop, in consultation with cities and towns and the Governor, best practices to address growing municipal costs. The order also charges the Lt. Governor's office with assisting in identifying and addressing unfunded and underfunded state mandates and diversifying sources of revenue.
