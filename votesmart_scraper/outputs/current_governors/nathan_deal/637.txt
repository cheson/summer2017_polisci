Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise to join my colleague in support of S. 793, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008. This legislation reauthorizes important grant programs, which assist States, territories, and the District of Columbia in establishing and expanding coordinated services of community-based services and support for those with traumatic brain injuries.
Traumatic brain injuries, TBI, can happen to anyone, and occur when someone experiences brain damage from externally inflicted trauma to the head. While these injuries can impact children, teenagers and adults, TBI has been described as the signature wound of the war in Iraq.
This legislation, first authorized in 1996, was reauthorized in 2000. With the large number of troops returning from the battlefield afflicted by this injury, it is important that we continue the activities authorized by this legislation.
The bill ensures that we are working to improve treatment through research at the National Institutes of Health and are able to gather information about the incidence of TBI and the prevalence of TBI-related disability.
