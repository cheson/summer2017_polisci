Gov. Nathan Deal today previewed findings by an independent, nationally recognized transportation firm, which conclude that new infrastructure investments statewide will improve safety, reduce congestion and have a positive economic impact on Georgia. The final study, performed by Cambridge Systematics and scheduled for release later this month, analyzed the potential impact of 11 planned projects throughout the state over the next decade.
"These results are a testament to the positive impact this investment will have on Georgians in the near future and in the long-term. This report confirms what we've been saying all along--that these projects will move the needle when it comes to driver and freight mobility," said Deal. "As Georgia's economy and population continues to grow, we will now boast a transportation system that keeps pace.
"Members of the General Assembly demonstrated courage and foresight in addressing this critical need with passage of the Transportation Funding Act of 2015. Their action, along with the expertise and efforts of Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) Commissioner Russell McMurry and GDOT Planning Director Jay Roberts, will improve the quality of life for all Georgians. Together, we will continue to ensure that Georgia remains the No. 1 place in the nation in which to do business, to raise a family and to live."
