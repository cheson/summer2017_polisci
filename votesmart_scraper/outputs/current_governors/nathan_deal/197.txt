Gov. Nathan Deal today signed HB 429, which includes the autism coverage requirement known as Ava's Law.
"In Georgia, 1 out of every 64 children is diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder," Deal said. "For boys, the risk is more prevalent, with 1 in 39 diagnosed with some form of autism. For these vulnerable young minds, daily interactions that most of us take for granted are a challenge. Treating children at early stages of development, however, makes it more likely he or she will achieve meaningful progress.
"That's why I instructed the Department of Community Health to include autism treatment coverage in state health plans last year. This legislation, named for Ava Bullard, builds upon that model. I commend Lt. Gov. Cagle and the General Assembly for their efforts on behalf of our youngest, most vulnerable patients. Moving forward, this law will increase access to treatment for children struggling with autism while lessening the financial burdens it imposes on families."
HB 429 also provides protection for patients diagnosed with terminal illnesses by prohibiting insurance carriers from dropping coverage or declining treatment.
