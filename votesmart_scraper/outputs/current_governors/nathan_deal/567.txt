Gov. Nathan Deal today signed his first piece of legislation as the CEO of Georgia. The bill, HB 104, required an expedited signature by the governor and deals with sales tax distribution in Carroll County. It is now Act 1.
"I was encouraged by the responsible leadership of the Carroll County community to expedite this important legislation on behalf of their local school systems," said Deal. "I look forward to working with local governments around the state as they work hard to better their communities."
HB 104 is local legislation allowing an E-SPLOST renewal for Carroll County. Absent action prior to March 15, the E-SPLOST was scheduled to sunset this year and required a signature by the governor in order to be renewed. The bill remains consistent with current law that proportionally divides the revenues between the Carroll County School System, Carrollton City School System and the Bremen City School System. Rep. Tim Bearden requested the expedited signature on the legislation due to the time sensitive nature of the referendum as early voting has already begun.
