Gov. Nathan Deal today applauded the Senate for passage HB 951, which designates tax holidays for "back-to-school" shoppers as well as those purchasing energy efficient products. The bill also includes an economic development incentive aimed at helping Georgia attract major sporting events by waiving sales taxes on those tickets. The measure passed the House last month.
"Consumers across the state will benefit from the passage of this legislation," said Deal. "I commend the General Assembly for their leadership on this issue and for their action on behalf of Georgians everywhere. This legislation not only provides tax relief for consumers and families, but will help make our state more competitive nationally. I'm confident that the economic impact of this legislation will pay dividends and further cement our reputation as a top state in the nation in which to live, raise a family and do business."
