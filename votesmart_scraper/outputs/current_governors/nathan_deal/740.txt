Issue Position
By: Nathan Deal
Location: Unknown

Deal has worked as a strong advocate for public education throughout his career in public service. Both of his parents and his wife worked their entire careers as Georgia public school teachers. It's no surprise that Nathan treats our public educators like family.
As a husband who stayed up at night with his wife grading papers, he knows that politicians' rhetoric on education doesn't always, if ever, reflect what happens in real Georgia classrooms. As governor, Nathan will take power away from education bureaucrats and empower local leaders to cater their plans to their local needs and resources. He will also support more options for students in our state and give parents greater choice for public education. Nathan will continue the fight to produce well rounded students in public education that are life, work and college ready.
