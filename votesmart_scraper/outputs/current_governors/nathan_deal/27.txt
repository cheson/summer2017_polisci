Gov. Nathan Deal today announced five grant awards for the Georgia Rural AP STEM Initiative to support the implementation of AP programs in Computer Science and Statistics. This initiative is the result of a partnership between the Governor's Office of Student Achievement and the College Board and is designed to create a vertical pathway to student success in AP STEM courses in high-need, rural areas throughout Georgia.
"Georgia is home to many global technology leaders, and between now and 2020, STEM field occupations will bring an estimated 79,000 new jobs to our state," said Deal. "These grants help us motivate and prepare our students for success in the modern workforce and help Georgia maintain its position as a leader in technology. With initiatives like this one, we are working toward providing every Georgia student with an innovative and enriching educational experience."
Each grant winner will receive up to $30,000 to aid in the successful implementation, creation and strengthening of rigorous STEM courses in middle and high schools in collaboration with the College Board. Grant funds can also be utilized to encourage students to participate in these courses and to promote ongoing, professional learning for Pre-AP and AP teachers.

Funding from this initiative will provide awarded districts with teacher professional learning and mentorship in one of three following AP STEM courses: AP Computer Science, AP Computer Science Principles or AP Statistics.
The grant award winners, along with their selected AP STEM pathways, are listed below.
Appling County: Computer Science
Baldwin County: Computer Science
Colquitt County: Computer Science
McDuffie County: Statistics
Thomas County: Computer Science and Statistics
