DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 14, 2007)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I realize it's late, and I'll be brief.
We've talked about a lot of things today. I'd like to talk about horses and mules for a few minutes. Under the current law, when a horse or a mule is deemed no longer fit for service in agencies such as the Border Patrol or Customs, the law requires that they either be turned out to pasture on Federal lands, where they usually are subject to predators, or that they be destroyed. This amendment would simply say that they would be allowed to be adopted by their handlers.
This is an animal equity amendment, Mr. Chairman. We do the same thing for dogs who have been in the service and are allowed to be adopted by their handlers. This would simply allow the handlers of horses and mules to do exactly the same thing. And I would urge the adoption.
