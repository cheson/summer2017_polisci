Gov. Nathan Deal today named the members of the Georgia Ebola Response Team, which was created by executive order to assess current state health and emergency management procedures and produce necessary recommendations to minimize any potential impact of the disease in Georgia.
"Those that have been chosen to serve on the panel are leaders in their respective fields, and I'm confident that their combined talents and experience will allow them to effectively examine state preparedness and provide all necessary recommendations," said Deal. "By opening up lines of communication between the private and public sector, Georgia is uniquely positioned to combat the risks of Ebola should the need arise and protect the health of the people of our state. An informed public and a prepared group of first responders and health care professionals can save lives. Let me reiterate: As a state, we are taking every precaution to make certain Georgia stands prepared."
The Ebola response team will be chaired by Brenda Fitzgerald, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health. A full list of team members below:
