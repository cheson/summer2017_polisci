RYAN WHITE HIV/AIDS TREATMENT MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2006 -- (House of Representatives - September 28, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6143, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006, because I believe that we must reform the unacceptable status quo for the benefit of those suffering from HIV/AIDS across our great Nation.
As my colleagues are aware, the Ryan White CARE Act was first authorized in 1990 and was reauthorized in 1996 and 2000. And although the legislative authority expired on September 30, 2005, the program continues to operate at its current funding level.
The outcomes and treatments for HIV and AIDS have changed over the years, and so have the needs of those who suffer from the disease. For example, persons with HIV now live longer due to advances in drug therapies.
However, many patients are on waiting lists for these life-saving drugs, because Ryan White funds are being spent on nonmedical services. Those include services not covered for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, including buddy and companion services, dog walking, therapeutic touching, and housing assistance.
Dog walking? Therapeutic touching? Is this what the Federal Government really wants to pay for? The Ryan White CARE Act program is designed to provide needed medical services to people suffering from HIV/AIDS. If we do not pass this bill, the status quo will remain.
