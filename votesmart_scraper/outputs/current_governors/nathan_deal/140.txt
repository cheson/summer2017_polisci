Acting on a recommendation from the state's Emergency Operations Command following severe weather, Gov. Nathan Deal today signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for Fannin, Gilmer and Pickens Counties.

"Following severe weather that resulted in flooding, damage to roads and properties and downed trees, the state is working to ensure the affected counties have access to the resources necessary for response efforts," Deal said. "Georgia is expected to receive more severe weather through Christmas Day and we will continue to closely monitor this situation. Additional counties may be included in this declaration as needed."
