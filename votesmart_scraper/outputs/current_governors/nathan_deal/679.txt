ALTERNATIVE PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL THERAPIES ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2006)
BREAK IN THE TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.
I rise in support of this legislation, which will allow funding for research that is already showing some real promise and, at the same time, avoids the moral and ethical perils of research involving the destruction of human embryos.
Pluripotent cells have the ability to grow into any cell in the body. Like other stem cells, pluripotent cells are used in the treatment of debilitating conditions where the replacement of damaged or malfunctioning cells is needed. Using adult stem cells drawn from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood system cells, scientists have discovered new treatments for scores of diseases and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, juvenile diabetes, and spinal cord injuries. Thousands of people have already benefited from these advances; and with continued research, thousands more stand to benefit in the near future.
The success of these treatments shows the merit of adult stem cell research and demonstrates the need for further research.
Last year Congress took action in this area by passing the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005. As a cosponsor of that legislation, it was a bill which expanded the number of stem cell options available to Americans suffering from life-threatening diseases.
Today's legislation will allow us to take another step forward and open up even more avenues for promising research for individuals and families.
