AMENDING PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT TO MODIFY PROGRAM FOR SANCTUARY SYSTEM FOR SURPLUS CHIMPANZEES -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5798, a bill modifying the authorities of the chimpanzee sanctuary system.
A few years ago, Congress enacted a law offered by former Congressman Greenwood of Pennsylvania to provide for sanctuary for chimpanzees that have been used for research purposes at the National Institutes of Health. I believe this legislation and the resulting sanctuary system have been very successful. The bill before us today would modify the existing law to eliminate a provision that could have, under very limited circumstances, allowed for the removal of the chimpanzees from the sanctuary system for further research.
H.R. 5798 strikes an appropriate balance between the need for medical research and the need to provide safeguards for the subject animals because it would still allow for non-invasive behavioral studies and medical and longitudinal studies based on information that could be obtained at the same time as information gathered for veterinary care. Thus, the simple items like blood samples or imaging studies could, under certain circumstances, be provided within the sanctuary system, so long as such studies involved minimal physical and mental harm, pain, distress and disturbance to the chimpanzee and the social group in which the chimpanzee lives.
In particular, we now have the ability to non-invasively look inside brains of living individuals, including chimpanzees, to find the changes associated with aging, cognitive decline and changes in immune system function.
