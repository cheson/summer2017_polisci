Gov. Nathan Deal today announced the five winners of this year's Innovation in Teaching Competition, a recognition and reward opportunity for teachers who utilize innovative instructional strategies to advance student achievement. This year's competition rewarded teachers in the following priority areas: applied learning with a focus on STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education, language and literacy skills, blended learning and innovative practices to close the achievement gap. Funding for the program is provided by Georgia's Innovation Fund, a competitive grant program.

"Effective, engaging teachers are our most vital asset in providing every Georgia student with a world-class education," said Deal. "That's why we should celebrate and reward our most outstanding teachers who bring innovation to the classroom, more efficiently and effectively preparing their students for the workforce or higher education. As we continue building upon success in our classrooms, our communities grow stronger as a result."
