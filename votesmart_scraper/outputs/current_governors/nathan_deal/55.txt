Gov. Nathan Deal today announced that Georgia has been named the No. 1 state in the nation in which to do business for the third consecutive year by Area Development, a leading corporate site selection and relocation magazine.
"Once again, Georgia has been named the top state for business, reflecting our success in growing Georgia's thriving economic environment," said Deal. "In the last year, global manufacturers, innovative technology companies, film companies, growing small businesses, international firms and industries of all kinds decided to open operations in Georgia, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs for families and investing millions in our communities. With our economic and workforce development initiatives, Georgia leads the way in providing a business-friendly environment and a highly qualified workforce to support growing businesses. This ranking is not only a testament to Georgia's business climate, but it also speaks to the commitment and support from our industry partners, communities and the people of Georgia."
In addition to being named the top state for business, Georgia is ranked No. 1 for cooperative and responsive state government as well as workforce development programs. Georgia ranks second for its competitive labor environment, regulatory environment and speed of permitting.

"The fact that these site consultants ranked us No. 1 for cooperative and responsive state government and for our leading workforce development programs is a testament to Governor Deal's leadership and the pro-business environment he has created here in Georgia," said Georgia Department of Economic Development Commissioner Chris Carr. "These rankings highlight our overall economic development package and solidify Georgia's role as a leader in the global marketplace."
Area Development's 2016 Top States for Doing Business rankings reflect the results of a recent survey that asked site consultants to provide their top state picks in 10 categories that impact companies' location and facility plans. The responses were weighted with their No. 1 choice in each category receiving three points, No. 2 choice receiving two points and runners-up in each category receiving one point. States were ranked based on the total of weighted scores from the following categories:
* Overall Rank
* Corporate Tax Environment
* Business Incentive Programs
* Access to Capital & Project Funding
* Competitive Labor Costs
* Leading Work Force Development Programs
* Cooperative & Responsive State Government
* Favorable Regulatory Environment
* Speed of Permitting
* Most Improved Economic Development Policies
