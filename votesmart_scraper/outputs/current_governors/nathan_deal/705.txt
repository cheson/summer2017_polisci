DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT EXPANSION ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for allowing us to consider the Drug Addiction Treatment Expansion Act, S. 45.
In 2000, Congress passed the Drug Addiction Treatment Act which has resulted in improved access to drug abuse treatment. This law has allowed qualified practitioners to prescribed addiction treatment medications from their office settings so long as the number of patients to whom the practitioner provides such treatment does not exceed 30 patients.
However, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act also limited the number of patients a group practice could treat to 30 as well. This limitation has created an unnecessary barrier to access to drug addiction therapy. Under current law, a practice of 500 doctors would still be limited to treating only 30 patients in the same way as a single physician. This policy effectively limits the ability of patients to get access to treatment for their drug addictions.
This legislation before us today would lift the 30-patient limit for group practices, but would still keep in place the 30-patient limit for individual physicians.
I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Souder) for his leadership on this legislation that further expands access to needed addiction therapy. The Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on the Judiciary have both favorably reported companion bills to S. 45, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation today.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
