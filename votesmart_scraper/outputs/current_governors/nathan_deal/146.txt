Major aluminum systems supplier to establish southeastern U.S. presence in Georgia

Gov. Nathan Deal today announced that Constellium, a global leader and manufacturer of aluminum products and solutions for a broad scope of markets--including the automotive industry, will establish a facility in Bartow County. This project represents the creation of 150 new jobs and an overall investment of $32 million in the local community.

"Georgia has a long-standing reputation for attracting leading manufacturers in the automotive industry," said Deal.
