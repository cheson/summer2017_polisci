COSTELLO: The governor of Georgia, Nathan Deal, is a big Gingrich supporter and he's here with me now. Welcome.
GOVERNOR NATHAN DEAL (R), GEORGIA: Thank you, Carol. Nice to be with you.
COSTELLO: Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it. So Newt Gingrich has to win big in Georgia. I mean, he can't win with like 35 percent or 40 percent. He has to win 50 percent of the vote. Do you think he can do it?
DEAL: Well, he has to win 50 percent to get all of the 76 delegates. Obviously, it's a proportional if you are less than that percentage.
We think he's doing extremely well, the polls indicate that. The weather is beautiful in Georgia today so there's no excuse for people not to get out and vote. We're hoping that he's going to have a big win here.
COSTELLO: What if he doesn't though. Will he remain in the race?
DEAL: Well, that's certainly his decision and not mine. But I do think that it will show that he has significant support for people who know him the best. That's the people in Georgia where he represented our state for 20 years, brought the speakership to our state, which is a huge distinction.
COSTELLO: Is this the strangest Republican primary that you can remember?
