Democrat Passed Healthcare Bill Puts Women's Health At Risk

Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Ga., today stood up for women's healthcare and against government rationing of life-saving preventative cancer screenings, once again defending the freedom of Americans to control their own healthcare decisions.
This week new controversial recommendations released by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government entity under the Department of Health of Human Services, recommended against regular mammography tests in women aged 40 to 49. The guidelines also stated that women in their 50's receive mammograms routinely every two years, instead of annually.
"Here is another reason why the Democrat healthcare bill is bad for the American people, said Deal. "If enacted into law, controversial recommendations from a governmental entity will dictate how doctors should treat their patients, thus putting women's health directly at risk."
Section 206 of the Democrat House-passed bill specifically states:
"The Secretary shall ensure that screening provided for under this paragraph complies with the recommendations of the [United States Preventive Services] Task Force with respect to: (A) frequency; (B) population to be served; (C) the procedure or technology to be used; (D) evidence of effectiveness; and (E) other matters that the Secretary determines appropriate."
Rep. Deal goes on to state; "As a husband, a father of three women and grandfather of four beautiful girls, I will continue to fight against government-controlled healthcare which empowers bureaucrats to dictate the type of care doctors should provide women."
