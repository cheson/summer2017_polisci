SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE AWARENESS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 982, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Peripheral Arterial Disease Awareness Week.
While not as well known as many other vascular diseases, peripheral artery disease is a serious illness that affects millions of Americans. It occurs when narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs. The disease increases the risk of heart attack and stroke and is also a leading cause of lower limb amputation in the United States. But perhaps the most alarming statistic of all is that most people who suffer from peripheral arterial disease have no symptoms and do not know that they have the disease.
This resolution, with the goal of raising awareness of this deadly disease and its warning signs, was authored by my friend and colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health, Mrs. Capps of California. I would like to thank Mrs. Capps and her staff for their leadership and work on this important resolution. I look forward to hearing more about the disease and its impact on our Nation's cardiovascular health.
I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
