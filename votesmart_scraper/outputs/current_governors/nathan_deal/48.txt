Gov. Nathan Deal today announced the members of the law enforcement task force, who will examine the Basic Law Enforcement Officer Training Course and establish competency-based standards for any course revisions deemed appropriate. The task force is comprised of law enforcement officials, judges, legislators and community leaders throughout the state and will equip officers with the critical thinking and tactical skills needed to face the challenges of policing in a modern society. Deal announced his intention to create the task force in September as phase three of his law enforcement reform package.
"Every day, law enforcement personnel of all levels and ranks are asked to do a very difficult job, one that requires significant skill and a strong dedication of purpose," said Deal. "Protecting our citizens is one of the fundamental roles of government and we must continue to strengthen the ties of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
"To that end, I have charged the task force with reviewing the Basic Law Enforcement Training Course and providing any necessary recommendations. The unique experiences and diverse perspectives of the task force members will help guide our efforts as we seek to improve public safety for all citizens. I look forward to meeting with them to discuss how we can continue to improve outcomes for Georgia."
