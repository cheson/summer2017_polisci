Following today's Supreme Court ruling that legalizes gay marriage in all states, Gov. Nathan Deal said Georgia will follow federal law.
"While I believe that this issue should be decided by the states and by legislatures, not the federal judiciary, I also believe in the rule of law. The state of Georgia is subject to the laws of the United States, and we will follow them."
