The state of Georgia's net revenue in April rose $35 million or 2.6 percent as compared to net revenues in April 2010, Gov. Nathan Deal reported today. This marks the 10th consecutive month in FY 2011 that there was an increase in net monthly collections.
"Our consistently strong revenue growth combined with a fiscally conservative budget for 2012 should put state finances on a strong footing in the coming year," Deal said. "We're encouraged by the positive trends, but we'll keep working hard until our job growth is just as strong as our revenue growth."
The following changes within the various tax categories led to the overall revenue increase:
