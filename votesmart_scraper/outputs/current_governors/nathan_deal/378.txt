Under Obamacare, Georgians have suffered among the nation's highest health insurance premium increases. The failed federal takeover of health care has already led to higher taxes and millions of policy cancellations. Governor Deal refused to waste state resources and taxpayer money to create an insurance exchange and remains opposed to expanding Medicaid.
"Georgia cannot afford billions in spending over the next 10 years," Deal said. "The Affordable Care Act and its many broken promises have already left hard-working families and sick patients on the hook. We are a state that balances our budget and one of the few states to have a growing rainy day fund. We must continue practicing common-sense fiscal responsibility."
Deal believes in patient-centered reforms that will bring the health care decisions out of the hands of Washington and back to doctors and families. He cast his final vote as a Member of Congress against Obamacare.
