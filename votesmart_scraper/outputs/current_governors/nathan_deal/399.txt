Gov. Deal would like to remind Georgians that the state's "back to school" sales tax holiday will be held this weekend (Aug. 9-10). During the tax holiday, consumers may purchase clothing items less than $100 and computers less than $1000, without paying a tax.

"The sales tax holiday is an opportunity for Georgia families to fulfill some of their needs as our students go back to school," Deal said. "While our state's economy continues to grow, we will continue to work in a pro-family and pro-business manner to lessen the burden on Georgia taxpayers. This tax exempt holiday could not have been possible without the responsible leadership of the General Assembly, and it is my hope that Georgians get out this weekend and take advantage of this opportunity."
