Governor Deal is an unwavering supporter of our Second Amendment rights. As a congressman, Deal consistently received an "A' rating from the NRA.
"His constant and unapologetic support for gun rights demonstrates a strong commitment to the rights of law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen," stated Chris Cox, Chairman of NRA-PVF.
As governor, Deal has signed every pro-gun rights bill to reach his desk. Sticking to his conservative principles, he will not support any changes to Georgia's Stand Your Ground law. In his second term, Nathan Deal will continue to support pro-gun legislation and will always fight to protect our Second Amendment rights.
