To Propose A Tax Increase For The War Effort Is Wrong
Statement

Location: Washington, DC

Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Ga., today released the following statement in response to President Obama's address at the United States Military Academy on the way forward for the war in Afghanistan.
"I support the President's decision to deploy additional troops to Afghanistan, but will be interested to hear what Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen and General McChrystal have to say as to whether the President is proposing sufficient forces to achieve success in Afghanistan. Any increase in troop strength comes with a price, but as an opponent of all tax increases, I will fight any effort of the majority party to levy a "war tax." To propose a tax increase for the war effort, while spending trillions of dollars on unnecessary social programs, is just plain wrong."
