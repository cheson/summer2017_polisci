Governor: Legislation will protect rights of licensed concealed carry permit holders
Gov. Nathan Deal today signed into law House Bill 60, legislation that protects law-abiding, licensed Georgia citizens' Second Amendment rights.
"For decades now I have staunchly defended our Second Amendment rights as both a legislator and as governor," said Deal. "This legislation will protect the constitutional rights of Georgians who have gone through a background check to legally obtain a Georgia Weapons Carry License. Roughly 500,000 Georgia citizens have a permit of this kind, which is approximately 5 percent of our population. License holders have passed background checks and are in good standing with the law. This law gives added protections to those who have played by the rules -- and who can protect themselves and others from those who don't play by the rules.
"Our nation's founders put the right to bear arms on par with freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Georgians cherish their Second Amendment rights, and this law embodies those values."
