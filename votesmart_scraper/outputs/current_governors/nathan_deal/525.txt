The Office of Gov. Nathan Deal said today that the state will appeal a federal court's ruling to enjoin two sections of Georgia's new immigration law.
"Gov. Deal is disappointed that the court enjoined two sections of Georgia's immigration law," said Brian Robinson, the governor's deputy chief of staff for communications. "Curiously, the court writes "all illegal aliens will leave Georgia' if the law is enforced, as if it is appalled at the thought of people attaining visas before coming to our nation. The federal court's ruling, however, will crystallize for Georgians and other Americans our underlying problem: Beyond refusing to help with our state's illegal immigration problem, the federal government is determined to be an obstacle. The state of Georgia narrowly tailored its immigration law to conform with existing federal law and court rulings. Georgians can rest assured that this battle doesn't end here; we will appeal this decision."
