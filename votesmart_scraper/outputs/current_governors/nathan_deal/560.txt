The Honorable Takuji Hanatani
Consul General of Japan

Atlanta, Georgia 30326
Dear Mr. Hanatani:
On behalf of the citizens of the State of Georgia, Sandra and I express our heartfelt condolences on the tragedy unfolding in Japan. The images of the destruction caused by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami are unbelievable and astonishing in scope. Yet the Japanese people have always shown a resilient spirit, and I am confident that Prime Minister Kan's call to unite and rebuild the country will be met by your countrymen and women.
Our own state representative in Tokyo, Ms. Yumiko Nazakono, and her associate, Mayumi Sato, are both safe. We have heard from them repeatedly throughout the weekend. Our relationship with Japan -- economically, diplomatically, culturally, and educationally -- is so critical to the State. We remain fully committed to it. This challenging time will not diminish the ties that bind us, rather strengthen that bond.
