BREAST CANCER AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I think one of the better things that is contained in this legislation is that it does create an interagency coordinating committee to coordinate the activities on breast cancer research that are being conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Defense Department and other agencies that are actively engaged in cancer research. By removing the barriers which restrict cross-institutional information sharing, we will be able to bring America's best scientists together to collaborate and work together in pursuit of a cure.
The bill also increases the overall authorization of the NIH by $40 million to further aid their mission in this research.
I think it is a good step in the right direction, and I am glad to see the House taking the legislation up today.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
