Georgia is home to a scenic environment that farmers, producers, sportsmen and nature enthusiasts are proud to call their own. As Governor, Nathan Deal has protected Georgia's environment for both its ecological and economic worth. Our state's natural resources support agriculture, tourism, jobs, and businesses alike. In his second term, Governor Deal will continue to protect our environment and natural resources to ensure its positive economic impact.
Governor Deal is committed to bringing new water supplies online, because we must prepare for growing population and droughts. That's why Georgia has already pledged $300 million to begin building water supplies in strategic locations throughout the state. In addition, Governor Deal has continued water conservation efforts and will protect Georgia's water from outside entities.
