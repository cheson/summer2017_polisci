Gov. Nathan Deal's conference call with GOP lawmakers this morning was less of a defense of his office's role in the fallout over the ethics memo and more of an impassioned plea for fellow Republicans to regroup against Democrats mounting a growing threat to their political supremacy.
Trailing in fundraising and lagging in a recent poll behind Democrat Jason Carter, Deal suggested that the ethics memo has given his campaign a jolt. He said he's been "somewhat deferential" during the long runoff period to avoid distracting attention from GOP races for Senate and superintendent, but that will change with tomorrow's contest.
"If you don't think I'm willing to fight, let me remind you of my background," he said, recounting 15 election victories since 1980. "I have never lost and I do not intend to lose now. This is my last race. I am looking for no higher office."
He told more than 50 GOP legislators that they would suffer if Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, were to wrest control of the governor's mansion. Said Deal:
"He will use the bully pulpit of the governor's office to beat you into the ground and you will have no opportunity to respond. He will pick you off, one by one if necessary, until he regains control of the Legislature Â… He will set you up as the target of demagoguery."
And he added: "If we have a Governor Carter, do you not believe he will immediately start to follow his grandfather's footsteps so he can be a second President Carter?"
