The state of Georgia's net tax collections for the month of October totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of $67 million or 5.4 percent compared to October 2010, Gov. Nathan Deal reported today. Through four months of FY2012, net revenue collections totaled $5.36 billion, an increase of $339 million or 6.8 percent over the prior year through October.
"The positive trend of year-over-year growth continued for a 16th consecutive month in October as total net revenues remained relatively strong," said Deal. "However, the more recent trend of softening revenues since August only reaffirms our stance of cautious optimism with respect to the overall economic outlook for the state."
