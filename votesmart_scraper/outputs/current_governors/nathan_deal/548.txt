In consultation with GEMA Director Charley English, Gov. Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency in Catoosa, Floyd, Dade and Walker counties tonight. The governor expects to expand the list of counties as the night progresses and the storm moves east through the state.
"The state of emergency designation releases all state resources to respond to dire needs in the affected counties, and it empowers Director English to bring together all the resources at our disposal so that we can take the lifesaving actions needed at this hour," Deal said. "Right now, we're seeing fatalities, injuries and serious property damage in northwest Georgia and we've seen terrible damage to the west in Alabama from these same storms. Of course, President Obama has declared a federal state of emergency for parts of Alabama.
"The state began preparation for this emergency yesterday by coordinating with local authorities in the projected path of the storm. With the storms ongoing, we're focusing our attention on immediate lifesaving actions, and we'll begin to assess damage and plot our next steps once the storm passes through. We encourage Georgians to take every precaution tonight, and we will keep those who have suffered greatly in our thoughts and prayers."
