Gov. Nathan Deal announced today that Georgia organizations will receive more than $12.5 million from the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to fund grants and education scholarships for 909 AmeriCorps members serving in 17 nonprofit and public agencies.
"Service is an essential part of the resolution to many challenges facing our state," said Deal. "These funds will provide AmeriCorps with the means to train new members and retain experienced personnel, so they are equipped to meet pressing needs and strengthen their communities. I commend this outstanding organization, and thank those who serve through AmeriCorps."
These agents will address critical areas including education, homelessness, the environment, veterans, natural disasters, healthcare and career development.
Of the total funding amount, AmeriCorps will grant $3,452,514 to the Georgia Commission for Service and Volunteerism, a part of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) that awards grants to nonprofit organizations and public agencies across the state.
"DCA is proud to have the Georgia Commission for Service and Volunteerism as a vital member of our team in providing resources to Georgia's citizens," said DCA Commissioner Camila Knowles. "The funding provided by AmeriCorps helps us continue to support job creation and to sustain the great quality of life we enjoy in Georgia, all while giving AmeriCorps members invaluable training in leadership and service."
In regards to education scholarships, AmeriCorps will receive $4,509,510 in Segal AmeriCorps Education Awards from CNCS to distribute among members. After completing a full term of service, AmeriCorps participants are eligible to receive an award of $5,730 to use as payment for college or student loans.
AmeriCorps engages 75,000 members in intensive service annually to serve through nonprofit, faith-based and community organizations at 25,000 locations across the country. Since 1994, more than 900,000 Americans have provided over 1 billion hours of service addressing critical challenges from poverty and hunger to disasters and the dropout crisis. More than 17,000 Georgia residents have served more than 24 million hours and have qualified for education awards that reach a total greater than $50,350,000.
"AmeriCorps members make a powerful impact on the toughest challenges facing our nation," said CNCS CEO Wendy Spencer. "Building on Georgia's strong tradition of neighbor helping neighbor, AmeriCorps members will improve lives and strengthen communities across the state. As they serve others, AmeriCorps members will also expand opportunity for themselves -- gaining skills and experience to jumpstart their careers."
Due to the strong demand by organizations seeking AmeriCorps resources, the current year's AmeriCorps grant cycle was highly competitive. The 2015 competition prioritized investments in economic opportunity, education, veterans and military families and disaster services.
