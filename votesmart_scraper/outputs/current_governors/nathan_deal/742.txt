With a state unemployment rate exceeding 10 percent, Georgians are hungry for high-quality jobs in Georgia. Only conservative Republican Nathan Deal has a detailed, specific plan to bring new jobs to our state in order to put Georgia back to work. Fostering a pro-growth, business-friendly economic environment is fundamental to this goal. Through comprehensive regulatory and tax relief, Nathan will lead our state toward private-sector job creation and growth, and as a result, to better days ahead.
All of the candidates for governor speak to their goals to bring jobs to Georgia, but only Nathan has put together a plan to make job creation and economic growth a reality. "Real Prosperity" focuses on essential tax relief for families and small businesses and puts the building blocks in place to fuel growth and development. "Real Prosperity" would boost Georgia's tax competitiveness with other states from 29th in the nation to 16th.
Nathan will go to work every day as governor to create jobs, cut waste and ensure a better future for Georgia's families.
