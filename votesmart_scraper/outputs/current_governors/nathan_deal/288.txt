Gov. Deal last week celebrated the grand opening of Drew Charter School Junior and Senior Academy in Atlanta. The school, previously serving only elementary and middle-school aged children, will now expand to serve older students as well.
"Drew Charter School is a prime example of the innovation-driven environment that can be found in many of Georgia's charter schools," said Deal. "With this expansion, students can now stay on pace at Drew Charter, helping to increase graduation rates and prepare students for higher education and the workforce."
Last week, the governor also spoke to students and teachers at Chamblee Charter High School. This DeKalb County school is ranked as the 11th best school in the state by U.S. News and World Report.
When future of DeKalb County School's accreditation was threatened in 2012, Deal took action to save the system and the value of its students' degrees by replacing six members of the school board.
"If Chamblee Charter had lost its accreditation, these hard-working students would have had worthless degrees," said Deal. "I am proud that we have taken the necessary steps to give more Georgia parents control over their children's education."
