Statement
By: Nathan Deal
Date: Nov. 1, 2016
Location: Washington DC

As a result of the Colonial Pipeline explosion, Gov. Nathan Deal today issued an executive order waiving regulations for commercial truck drivers transporting motor fuel in Georgia. The executive order is effective Nov. 2 through midnight Nov. 15.
"Following the Colonial Pipeline rupture and explosion, I have issued an executive order suspending rules limiting drivers' operating hours, per 49 CFR 390 et, seq. This measure is intended to help ensure uninterrupted fuel supply in Georgia as we await more information from Alabama officials. Until normal pipeline production resumes, I urge the public to maintain regular consumption levels and travel schedules."
