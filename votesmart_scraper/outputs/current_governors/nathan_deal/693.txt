NATIONAL UNIFORMITY FOR FOOD ACT OF 2005 -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2006)
Mr. Chairman, I must rise in opposition to the amendment. I believe that Mr. Waxman is well-intentioned in the amendment language that he has offered, and it is a matter of perspective as to whether or not this amendment would cure or would create more problems. It is my opinion that it would do the latter.
The last thing that any of us want, I think, is to create anything that will create more bureaucratic wrangling between the States and the Federal Government and pointing of fingers back and forth in a time of disaster, and especially in an event such as a terrorist attack or something that would contaminate our food supply.
I believe the language we have just adopted in the Rogers amendment, which requires that the Secretary of HHS consult with the Secretary of Homeland Security and certify that this bill does not in any way impinge on or interfere with the ability to deal with a threat to public health, is an adequate safeguard. I think this amendment is unnecessary.
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. Chairman, this amendment would exempt three categories of warnings and standards from a national uniformity standard: those relating to risks of cancer; those relating to reproductive or developmental toxins; and, third, those sulfiting agents in bulk foods.
Warnings on food should apply in all 50 States. If a warning is justified, consumers in all States should get the information. If food is not safe in 49 States, then it should also not be safe in the other, or vice versa. If a warning is not justified, then consumers should not be confused by different warnings in different States.
