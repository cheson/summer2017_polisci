Georgia Welcomes Supreme Court decision

Gov. Nathan Deal applauds the U.S. Supreme Court's decision today to seek input from the U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli before allowing Florida to move forward with its water-related lawsuit against Georgia.
"Florida's previous unsuccessful lawsuits cost both states millions of dollars and obstructed meaningful natural resource planning for more than 20 years," Deal said. "After more than two decades, we are finally on the verge of having the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers formally update water control manuals, which will inform how best to operate the federal reservoirs to the benefit of upstream and downstream communities alike. Florida is yet again trying to circumvent this process. The Supreme Court's decision to look carefully into this matter before granting Florida's motion is good news for Georgians, as I am hopeful that Solicitor General Verrilli will agree that at a minimum the water control manuals be updated first. Florida's decision to take this aggressive action in the Supreme Court is premature at best, and we welcome the opinion of Solicitor General Verrilli going forward."
