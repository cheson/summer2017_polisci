HOPE Scholarship
*When Deal took office, HOPE scholarship was on the brink of bankruptcy. He worked closely with the General Assembly to save the scholarship, one of the most generous in the nation, for future generations. The HOPE Scholarship, a merit-based program for four-year college students, helps keep Georgia's best and brightest students in the state. Students who graduate in Georgia are more likely to begin their careers in Georgia, which strengthens the state's workforce and promotes economic growth throughout a variety of industries.
HOPE Grant
*The HOPE Grant is a merit-based scholarship for students attending technical colleges in Georgia. Deal recently expanded a program that pays 100 percent technical school tuition for students pursuing training in high-demand fields. This includes commercial truck driving, diesel mechanics, welding, early childhood care and education, film set design, computer programming, precision manufacturing and certified engineering assistants.
