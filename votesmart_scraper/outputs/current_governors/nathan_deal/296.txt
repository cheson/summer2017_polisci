Gov. Nathan Deal congratulated the Republican primary runoff winners tonight, urging everyone to unite behind the Republican ticket to ensure victory in November.
"My congratulations to David Perdue, Jody Hice, Buddy Carter and Barry Loudermilk on their victories. I look forward to campaigning vigorously with them, as well as our state and local candidates, throughout every corner of Georgia," Deal said. "Each of these individuals will bring conservative principles and fresh perspective to Washington, D.C., our state capitol, county courthouses and city halls. They will fight for Georgians and represent us well.
"I would also like to recognize each of the challengers in these hard-fought races. I have known Rep. Jack Kingston personally for decades. He has spent a lifetime in service to Georgians and has been instrumental in securing funding for the Port of Savannah. Most importantly, Sandra and I are proud to call Jack and Libby dear friends.
"Republicans historically run spirited campaigns, but we are truly at our best when we unite together. Georgia is a red state, and we will work tirelessly together to keep it that way. All of our candidates fought the good fight and finished the race. Now, together, we focus on victory in November.
