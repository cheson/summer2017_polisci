Acting on the recommendation of the State Board of Education, Gov. Nathan Deal today suspended six members of the DeKalb school board. Deal announced that he has appointed a panel to nominate replacements and has tapped Brad Bryant, a former DeKalb school board member, to act as his liaison to the DeKalb board and Superintendent Michael Thurmond.
"The stakes in this case are high; the future of almost 100,000 students hangs in the balance," Deal said. "Therefore, I have accepted the unanimous recommendation of the State Board of Education to suspend six members of the DeKalb school board. I have met with Superintendent Michael Thurmond, and I believe he can play a vital role in getting the system back on track. I look forward to a positive working relationship with Superintendent Thurmond on behalf of the children of DeKalb County."
