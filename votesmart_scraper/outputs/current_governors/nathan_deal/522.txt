The state of Georgia's net revenue in June rose $87.5 million or 6.2 percent as compared to net revenues in June 2010, Gov. Nathan Deal reported today. The strong finish to FY 2011 punctuates a year of improvement in which all 12 months showed positive growth in monthly net collections relative to FY 2010.
"We saw numbers that were above trend for 12 consecutive months in FY 2011," Deal said. "The upward movement in Georgia's revenue numbers is a clear indication that our state can and will advance as long as we continue the practice of maintaining a fiscally conservative state budget."
