Press Release

In response to a letter sent by Gov. Nathan Deal, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack determined that, due to the ongoing drought and excessive heat, 150 Georgia counties suffered production losses great enough to warrant a secretarial natural disaster designation.
"I am grateful for Secretary Vilsack's timely response on this important request for our state," said Deal. "With this designation, farmers and their businesses will qualify for much-needed relief. It is my hope that this aid will relieve some of the burden this drought has caused the No. 1 industry in our state.
"I also extend my appreciation to Georgia's congressional delegation for their support of my request to Secretary Vilsack."
