Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
I would like to join my colleague in supporting H.R. 1198, the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2008.
This legislation reauthorizes the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program, which was first enacted in 2000 to help States develop newborn hearing screening and early intervention programs. This program has successfully improved newborn screening for hearing loss, which allows many children to benefit from early detection. This provides enhanced opportunities for language and communication skill development.
Unfortunately, children experiencing hearing loss who are not identified early can have delays in speech, language, and cognitive development. Through grant programs, this legislation helps ensure infants with hearing losses are identified and receive appropriate follow-up care. The bill also establishes a post-doctoral fellowship program to improve early hearing detection research.
This legislation moved through our committee in a bipartisan fashion, and I would urge its adoption.
I reserve the balance of my time.
