Joined by a bipartisan group of legislators, Gov. Nathan Deal today signed the Enduring HOPE legislation.
"With today's signing, we have closed a $300 million shortfall in the next year, we have pulled HOPE and Georgia Pre-K from the brink of bankruptcy and we have preserved our state's elite status for having the most generous benefit programs in the nation," said Deal. "Georgians are blessed to have legislative leaders who put aside politics to craft a new law of generational importance."
