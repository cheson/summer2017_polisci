SUPPORTING GOALS OF NATIONAL MARINA DAY -- (House of Representatives - July 21, 2004)
Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 647) supporting the goals of National Marina Day and urging marinas to continue providing environmentally friendly gateways to boating.
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would say, if the gentleman would come to Lake Lanier in north Georgia, we have some fish big enough to ride in Lake Lanier. We will provide the saddles. Fishing rodeos are big business, and they attract a lot of people to the sport of fishing.
On August 14, we will celebrate the third annual National Marina Day. This annual celebration promotes the United States' 12,000 marinas and strives to educate all of us, politicians, civic leaders and the public, about the important roles that marinas play in the waterfront communities across America.
During the first year, 80 marinas in 23 States participated in National Marina Day. Last year, the celebration spread to 150 marinas in 25 States. This year again marks another significant opportunity to recognize marina operators and their industry's role and contributions to America's water recreation.
National Marina Day offers local marina operators the opportunity to host events to bring tens of thousands of people to our country's marinas. These marinas are gateways to boating and help maintain the natural environments that we enjoy.
