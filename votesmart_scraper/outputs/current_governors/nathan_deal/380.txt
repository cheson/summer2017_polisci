Deal believes that government should have a limited role in the lives of its citizens.
"We should provide the services they demand, provide them in an effective and efficient manner, and then get out of the way so Georgians can live their lives the way they see fit," said Gov. Deal. "I promised Georgians a smaller government, and I have delivered on that promise."
Since taking office, Deal has balanced the budget each year, streamlined state agencies, and eliminated wasteful spending. He cut bureaucratic spending and reduced the number of government employees to the lowest level in more than a decade while increasing education and public safety funding.
