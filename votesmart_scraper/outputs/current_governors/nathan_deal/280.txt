Gov. Nathan Deal today announced that 150 schools were awarded medals in the 2013-2014 Governor's SHAPE Honor Roll program. This program began in 2012 as a way to promote Georgia SHAPE, an initiative launched by Deal that calls on Georgians to help combat childhood obesity. The Honor Roll program specifically challenges schools to make improvements based on three main criteria: physical activity, nutrition and wellness. These schools met benchmark measurements in all three categories, earning them a medal.
"I would like to thank the families, faculty and staff of each of these schools for their continued commitment to promoting an active lifestyle among students," said Deal. "By partnering with schools, academic institutions, agencies and businesses across the state, we are seeing signs of improvement in the health of Georgia's children through the SHAPE initiative."
Georgia aims to provide every child the opportunity and resources needed to live healthy and active lives. Children and their parents benefit from fitness-level knowledge included in their FITNESSGRAM reports and can begin to develop and implement strategies for personal improvement.
Statewide, 29 received platinum medals, 38 schools received gold medals, 67 schools earned a silver medal and 16 were awarded bronze medals. Seventy-five schools are previous award winners. Extensive participation in this Honor Roll program speaks to the fact that Georgia schools are committed to offering assistance and opportunity to achieve a greater level of overall fitness.
