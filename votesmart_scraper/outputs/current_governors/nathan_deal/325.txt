Religious leaders to advise on challenges to re-entry in communities across the state
Gov. Nathan Deal today announced the creation of the Governor's Interfaith Council, comprised of religious leaders across Georgia, to expand upon recent criminal justice reforms. These advisers will work to identify areas in which faith-based ministries, private organizations and state agencies can partner to address prisoner re-entry.
"Faith communities and religious leaders are critical to ensuring the success of our criminal justice reform initiatives," Deal said. "On any given day, their houses of worship minister to prisoners, give comfort to family members and provide assistance to returning citizens. These council members are on the front lines in Georgia communities, and their perspective and experience are invaluable. I'm grateful for their willingness to serve."
