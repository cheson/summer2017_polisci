Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, today the House is set to pass legislation reauthorizing the Animal Drug User Fee Act, also known as ADUFA. This legislation represents a compromise between the parties, the administration, and the industry.
Development of animal drugs can take years and cost millions of dollars. A predictable review process is important to make sure that these products are approved in a timely way. Since the passage of ADUFA in 2003, the review times for new animal drugs went from 295 days in Fiscal Year 2004 to 180 days in Fiscal Year 2008.
We need to reauthorize this program before we leave for the August recess. If we fail to do so, the FDA may have to begin issuing reduction in force notices to its employees. The bill before us today will provide financial stability for the program and improve the health information infrastructure for drug review. It will also provide more user revenue for the program.
Along with ADUFA, for the first time, Congress is set to pass legislation which would create the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act, or AGDUFA. AGDUFA will allow the FDA to collect user fees, thereby improving the times necessary for generic drug approval. This will not only bring generics to the market more quickly, but will also lower costs for consumers. If AGDUFA is authorized, approval times could be reduced from 700 days in Fiscal Year 2009, to around 270 days in Fiscal Year 2013.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the passage of both of these pieces of legislation in the bill that is before us today.
I would reserve the balance of my time.
