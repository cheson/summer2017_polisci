Gov. Nathan Deal's office today announced that his longtime deputy chief of staff for policy, Erin Hames, will leave the governor's office at the end of August to pursue opportunities in the private sector. As a consultant, Hames will continue to play a leading role for Deal's education reform efforts.
"Erin Hames brings unparalleled knowledge and passion to education policy issues; she was the right person at the right time for my administration as those issues played a critical role in my agenda for the past five legislative sessions," Deal said. "This move will allow her to focus her full attention on improving classroom outcomes so that every child has access to a great education, and it will allow organizations that share her vision to also benefit from her talents. I'm glad that the governor's office will continue to be one of those organizations benefiting from her expertise and work ethic. On a personal note, Erin is a dear friend and a valued member of this team who has done great work for the people of Georgia. We'll miss having her here every day, but she'll always be part of the Deal family."
