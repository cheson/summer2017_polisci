Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I do rise in support of H.R. 2063, the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2008.
Many children face life-threatening food allergies which dramatically impact their lifestyles and make an ordinarily safe place like a school cafeteria a place filled with potential dangers. However, despite this threat and the growing prevalence of these food allergies, many schools struggle to establish effective guidelines to protect the health and well-being of students with food allergies.
I had the occasion this past year to visit with neighbors and constituents of mine whose children have these kind of allergies, one of the children having a very severe food allergy problem. It is truly remarkable the degree of care that children and parents must take and the life-changing events that occur as a result of these food allergies.
This legislation seeks to address this problem by requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to establish voluntary guidelines and policies to manage the risks of food allergy in a school setting. This policy will take into account the important role played by parents and the individual needs of students with differing allergies. Hopefully, this legislation will provide important Federal guidelines, which, when implemented, will provide peace of mind for parents of children with food allergies when they send their children to school every day.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
