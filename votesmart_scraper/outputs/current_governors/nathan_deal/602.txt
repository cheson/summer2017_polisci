Rep. Deal Votes NO' On Healthcare Reform In The Energy And Commerce Committee
On Friday, July 31st, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce passed H.R. 3200, the Democrat healthcare overhaul legislation. Congressman Deal, the Ranking Republican of the Subcommittee on Health within the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, joined all of his Republican Colleagues and five Democrats in opposition to the healthcare overhaul package. Unfortunately, H.R. 3200 was favorably passed out of the Committee by a vote of 31 -- 28.
Representative Deal states, I voted against the package considered by the Energy and Commerce Committee, and will continue to voice my opposition to a federal takeover of healthcare and the destruction of the freedoms and liberties of the American people. As this legislation proceeds through the House, I will remain active in the debate and look forward to working with my Colleagues on both sides of the aisle to develop solutions which work for my constituents, as well as all Americans.
