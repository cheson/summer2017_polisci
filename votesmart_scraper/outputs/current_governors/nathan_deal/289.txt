Gov. Nathan Deal today broke ground for the Bostick Nursing Center, a new 280-bed geriatric care facility, creating 225 jobs in Baldwin County. The privately developed project will primarily serve special populations with limited access to skilled nursing and intermediate care services.
"Georgia's health care industry bolsters economic development while providing quality care to those in need," Deal said. "This new Bostick Nursing Center will bring much-needed jobs to the Milledgeville area, improve quality of life and set the foundation for further growth and revitalization of the Central State Hospital Campus."
The 16-acre nursing center, valued at more than $20 million, is being developed by CorrectHealth LLP, an Atlanta-based, physician-owned and operated company specializing in correctional healthcare, in partnership with the Central State Hospital Local Redevelopment Authority (CSHLRA). This is the first private project at the former Central State Hospital Campus, which consists of 200 buildings and more than 2,000 acres of land.
The CSHLRA was created in 2012 by Georgia House Bill 815 with the specific mission of planning for and executing the redevelopment of the Central State Hospital Campus in Milledgeville.
