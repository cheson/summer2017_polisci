Georgia Republican nominee for governor Nathan Deal praised the federal approval of Georgia's voter verification system, calling it a victory for the rule of law.
"The integrity of our elections process undergirds our democracy, and each state has the right to implement a system that assures that all voters are legal voters," Deal said. "Georgia has a responsible and fair system that protects the rights of the legal residents of our state. Secretary of State Brian Kemp and former Secretary of State Karen Handel have fought for this program. They led on behalf of all Georgians, and today that hard work has paid off."
In Congress, Deal was a leader on citizenship verification efforts. Deal authored the law requiring citizenship verification for government health care benefits, saving taxpayers billions of dollars in fraud. In Georgia alone, Medicaid rolls dropped by 160,000 recipients the year after the law took effect.
"The state of Georgia has the duty to assure that voters are who they say they are," Deal continued. "Voter fraud disenfranchises Georgians. Today's decision confirms that basic truth. My only regret is that this decision took so long and our state was forced through bureaucratic hurdles by the federal government. Georgia is enforcing the rule of law fairly and equitably, and we shouldn't be treated differently than any other state."
