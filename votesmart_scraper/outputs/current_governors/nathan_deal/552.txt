Kia Motors' West Point manufacturing plant received the equipment necessary for its expansion yesterday. The equipment, which arrived in the Port of Savannah from Pyeongtaek, Korea, last week, was transported 300 miles to Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia, Inc. Some pieces of the machinery weigh up to 170 tons and required special arrangements for their transportation across the state. A fleet of trucks and trailers were used for the largest pieces. The equipment will now be assembled by its manufacturer and will stamp steel into 17 different types of vehicle body panels, including hoods, doors and fenders.
"We congratulate Kia on its expansion, and welcome the 1,000 jobs Kia expects to create as it continues down the road to record success in the United States," said Gov. Nathan Deal. "The efficient, multiload delivery of massive equipment for Kia's new production line via Georgia's transportation network symbolizes the critical role our logistics system plays in creating jobs in Georgia and the importance of investing in our infrastructure. We welcome Kia's growing presence in our state and are proud to contribute to the company's success."
