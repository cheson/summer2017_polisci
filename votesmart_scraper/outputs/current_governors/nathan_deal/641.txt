Wakefield Act
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 2464, which reauthorizes the Emergency Medical Services for Children program. It is, indeed, the only Federal program dedicated to improving emergency care for children. Since its inception in 1984, death rates due to pediatric injury have dropped some 40 percent.
The program provides grants to States to improve existing medical emergency services systems, and to evaluate pediatric emergency care data to improve future treatment efforts. Many emergency centers do not have all of the necessary supplies to treat pediatric emergencies, despite the fact that 18 percent of emergency department patients are children.
The legislation also increases the authorization for this program by 5 percent annually for the next 5 years starting at $25 million in FY 2009. The bill also extends by 1 year the period that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services may award grants under the program. The bill had broad bipartisan support in the committee, and I would urge its passage.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
