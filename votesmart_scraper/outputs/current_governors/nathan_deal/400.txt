Yesterday, Gov. Deal traveled to conferences in Savannah and Jekyll Island where he thanked prosecutors and law enforcement personnel for working diligently to keep the people of Georgia safe. At both conferences, Deal highlighted reforms in the state's criminal justice system that implement "smart on crime" policies that save tax dollars and promote public safety.
"Changes to our justice system have pushed us in the right direction," Deal said. "By identifying low-risk, nonviolent offenders and more effective ways to rehabilitate them, we are steering these offenders away from a life of crime. We are reserving our limited, expensive prison beds for offenders that society can no longer tolerate."
Previously, prison crowding and habitual offenders were unchecked problems of Georgia's legal system. Since taking office in 2011, Deal has had a hand in the development of justice reforms designed to fix these problems and they are already showing signs of success.
"As a former lawyer and judge, our justice systems have received special attention from me, and we have made great strides in this area," Deal said. "We have found ways to make improvements, and we are taking the necessary steps to do so."
