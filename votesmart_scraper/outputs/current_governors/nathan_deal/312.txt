Arts Learning Task Force will work to make Georgia a leader in education innovation, governor says
Gov. Nathan Deal today announced the creation of the Arts Learning Task Force to improve student achievement through the creation of robust arts learning environments. This task force will provide recommendations regarding the implementation of arts education into k-12 classrooms and conduct an examination of existing model arts education initiatives in Georgia and other states.
"Students need to embrace the power of creative thinking and innovation in order to attain 21st century skills and become globally competitive and culturally literate," Deal said. "Businesses depend on our education system to produce candidates that are college and career ready, and I am confident that this task force's recommendation will effectively improve academic achievement and workforce readiness."
The Georgia Department of Economic Development's Georgia Council for the Arts will be the administrative entity for the task force.
