Gov. Nathan Deal, along with University System of Georgia Chancellor Hank Huckaby and Technical College System of Georgia Commissioner Ron Jackson, yesterday announced Georgia's "Go Back. Move Ahead." campaign. The campaign will encourage many of the more than 1 million Georgians who have completed some college to return and finish their degrees.
"In order for Georgia to remain economically competitive, we must have an educated work force, and focusing on college completion is one way we intend to do that," said Deal. "'Go Back. Move Ahead.' provides resources for prospective students and makes it easy for any Georgian who has started college to go back to school and earn a degree or certificate."

Go Back. Move Ahead. is a part of Gov. Deal's Complete College Georgia initiative, which launched in 2011.
