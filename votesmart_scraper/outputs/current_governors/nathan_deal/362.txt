Gov. Nathan Deal today signed into law the elections bill, moving primary elections for state offices from July to May 20. House Bill 310 aligns state office primaries with the date of the primary for federal offices, which was set by a federal judge.
The court moved the date for federal elections earlier after ruling that the state's runoff period must last at least 45, to provide time for military ballots. The primary runoff will occur July 22.
"The General Assembly acted swiftly on this issue, and I have as well, so that local election officials and candidates can prepare," Deal said. "Given the federal mandate that we move up our primary date for federal elections, this is the best move for voters' time and taxpayers' money."
