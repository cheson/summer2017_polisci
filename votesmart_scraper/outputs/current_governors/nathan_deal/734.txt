By: Nathan Deal
Location: Unknown

Voters expect those who they send to elected office to act with their best interests in mind, not his or her own. That is exactly the commitment to public service Nathan Deal will bring to the office of the governor. Throughout Nathan's 17 years in the Congress he maintained a no gift policy for himself and his staff. He will carry this policy into the office of the governor and will put his personal assets into a blind trust to ensure conflicts of interest do not exist.
