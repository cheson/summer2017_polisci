BORDER PROTECTION, ANTI-TERRORISM, AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CONTROL ACT OF 2005 -- (House of Representatives - December 16, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague for bringing this amendment and for yielding me time. He brings an important aspect of enforcement to the table, and that is interior enforcement.
Many people believe that only the problem exists along the border, and that is not true. My State of Georgia, Congressman Norwood's State of Georgia, is one of the fastest growing in terms of population of illegal aliens in the country. In fact, in my congressional district in north Georgia, two of the five fastest growing populations of illegal immigrants are in my congressional district.
Now, if we want to get serious about enforcement, let us look at what the facts are. You heard Congressman Norwood say there are 500,000 criminal aliens in our country that are waiting to be apprehended. In our State of Georgia, one of the fastest growing in illegal populations in the country, I am told we only have three enforcement agents. In our adjoining State of Alabama, they only have one.
Are we really serious? Why not tap into the 700,000 State and local law enforcement officers who are available and trained to enforce the law.
