Gov. Nathan Deal announced today that Forsyth County School Superintendent Dr. L.C. "Buster" Evans will join the Department of Corrections as the assistant commissioner of Education effective July 1. In his capacity as assistant commissioner, Evans will lead education initiatives within the department and assist in the implementation of the governor's criminal justice reforms.
"With 7 out of every 10 Department of Corrections inmates lacking a high school diploma or GED, it is of the utmost importance that while individuals are in our criminal justice system, we do a better job of raising their education and skills to an adequate level," Deal said. "If an offender has been equipped to enter the workforce upon release, that person will stand a greater chance of avoiding relapse. Buster has been a leader in our state's education system for more than a decade, and I applaud his continued service to Georgia. His years of experience and commitment to education will serve Georgians well in his new role at the Department of Corrections."
"I am grateful to Governor Deal for his confidence in me and for the opportunity to serve my state at the Department of Corrections," Evans said. "While the decision to retire as Forsyth County school superintendent was not an easy one, I look forward to helping nonviolent offenders achieve the kind of quality education that will allow for new growth and prosperity in Georgia's workforce."
