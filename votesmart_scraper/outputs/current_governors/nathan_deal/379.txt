A strong education system leads to a strong economy. Both Governor Deal and Sandra's parents were teachers, so improving education has been and always will be a top priority for Georgia.
When Governor Deal took office, Georgia's Pre-K program and HOPE scholarship were on the brink of bankruptcy. Deal worked closely with Republicans and Democrats in the General Assembly to save the HOPE scholarship--one of the most generous in the nation--for future generations. Under Deal's leadership, HOPE is thriving once again. Deal was also able to restore our universal Pre-K to a full-day program, ensuring Georgia's youngest scholars would continue to receive a high-quality education.
Governor Deal also supports state charter schools, which give parents and students more flexibility and education options. State charter schools promote competition, encourage innovation in the classroom, and they give parents in underperforming school districts a choice.
