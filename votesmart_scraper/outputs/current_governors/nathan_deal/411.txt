Gov. Nathan Deal today signed into law the Fiscal Year 2014 budget, which takes effect upon the start of the fiscal year on July 1. This marks the third year in a row the governor successfully and conservatively balanced the state's budget while reducing government spending by implementing austerity cuts, without raising taxes, and preserving Georgia's coveted AAA bond rating.

"The General Assembly and I have once again enacted a budget that holds the line on spending, while funding the priorities that continue to help make Georgia the No. 1 place in the country in which to do business and create jobs," Deal said. "Even with improving revenue numbers, state government faced another round of cuts because of the growth of expenses in education and in our Medicaid program. I commend the General Assembly once more for its responsible work, which focuses on the core functions of state government."

Deal took a conservative approach in setting the revenue estimate given the national uncertainty with the federal debt limit and budget negotiations that could impact state revenues. In order to meet reduced revenue estimates and growth needs in K-12 and Medicaid, agencies again took 3 percent budget cuts, with the exception of select public safety and human services agencies.
