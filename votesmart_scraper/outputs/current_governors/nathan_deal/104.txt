Gov. Nathan Deal today signed legislation that expands students' and service members' access to postsecondary education and jobs skills training.
"Investing in education at every level -- from our youngest minds to graduating high school seniors to returning service members and military veterans -- has been, and remains, one of my top priorities," said Deal. "With the help of the General Assembly, we've demonstrated our commitment to students, teachers and education initiatives each year. To that end, the 2017 budget includes an additional $300 million intended for teacher salary increases, $26.2 million more for pre-K teacher pay raises and another $29.4 million for Move on When Ready programs.

This legislation will help cement Georgia's reputation for the top-notch quality of our workforce, the strength of our economy and the vibrancy of our communities."
