Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed two bills on Tuesday. The following are his veto messages.
HB 911 -- Putnam County; change compensation for certain officials
House Bill 911 contains specific language providing additional compensation for the sheriff of Putnam County and various officials of the Putnam County State Court. I am vetoing this legislation because of the lack of justification provided for such increases in compensation for these officials. Accordingly, I VETO HB 911.
HB 975 -- Habersham County; relating to homestead exemption for school district ad valorem taxes
Both the sponsor of this legislation and the Habersham County Commission requested that I veto this legislation. Accordingly, I VETO HB 975.
