Georgia's next governor will be instrumental in protecting our state's right to water. The development of additional reservoirs within our state is critical to addressing the long-term water needs of Georgia and this must be done without reliance on Washington. Opportunities exist for the state to work hand-in-hand with local governments to permit the construction of needed additional reservoirs and to ensure funding is available for these projects through the Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority (GEFA). As the elected representative of the largest reservoir in the ACF river basin, Nathan is uniquely aware of the issues involved in the ongoing water dispute. As governor, he will take his experience with water issues to work cooperatively with the next governors of Florida and Alabama to reach a resolution that protects Georgia's right to much-needed water.
