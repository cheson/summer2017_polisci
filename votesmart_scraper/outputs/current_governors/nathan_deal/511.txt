Deal, Olens say state will drop suit if districts receive preclearance from Department of Justice
Gov. Nathan Deal and Attorney General Sam Olens announced today that the state of Georgia has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking federal approval, or preclearance, of the newly drawn state legislative and congressional plans. Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, Georgia must receive approval from the federal government before any changes in election practices or procedures are implemented. States can seek that approval from the U.S. Department of Justice or the District Court for the District of Columbia. In a joint statement, Deal and Olens expressed confidence that the new plans will be approved.
"Today we filed a lawsuit in the D.C. District Court seeking preclearance of our new state legislative and congressional plans. These plans were carefully drawn by the General Assembly to ensure that Georgia's growing population is fairly represented, and we are confident that they meet the requirements for federal approval.
"Like several other states, including Louisiana, Virginia and Alabama, Georgia will also submit the plans to the Department of Justice for administrative approval. If Georgia obtains administrative preclearance of the three plans, the state will dismiss the lawsuit."
