CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES EXPORT REFORM ACT OF 2005 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (S. 1395) to amend the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to provide authority for the Attorney General to authorize the export of controlled substances from the United States to another country for subsequent export from that country to a second country, if certain conditions and safeguards are satisfied.

Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, S. 1395, the Controlled Substances Export Reform Act of 2005, is simply about allowing companies to better compete in the global marketplace.
Under the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, a company is not allowed to export controlled substances to one country and then send it to a third country. Companies that export controlled substances must make a large number of long-distance, small shipments to individual countries, incurring large shipping costs. Due to this restriction, American manufacturers are less competitive than their foreign competitors, which results in high-paying U.S. jobs being sent overseas.
S. 1395 will enable U.S. companies to export products more efficiently by allowing them to send a large shipment to one nation overseas and from there to distribute smaller shipments to other countries. All subsequent transfers of controlled substances would still be subject to strict oversight by the DEA and will require a permit from the Attorney General to prevent any potential abuse.
