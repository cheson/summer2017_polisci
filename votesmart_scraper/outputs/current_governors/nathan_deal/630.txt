REP. WALDEN: (In progress) -- change in energy independence. I'm going to open up this news conference and serve as the master of ceremonies. I'll make my remarks later on.
One of our colleagues, Nathan Deal, however, has to go to another commitment shortly, so I'd like to introduce him first to kick us off. So, please welcome Nathan Deal from Georgia.
REP. DEAL: Thank you, Greg. I'm Nathan Deal from the 9th Congressional District of Georgia. And I have gone across my 15 counties with a series of town-hall meetings, about an hour-and-a-half each, during the first week of our recess. And, as you can imagine, the primary issue was the question of gas prices, and energy in general.
I think that I can speak for my constituents when I say that the very thing that we're doing on the House floor, of keeping this issue alive and asking the Speaker to bring us back into session so that we can vote on drilling -- knowing that we have great resources in our own country, and should be accessed.
