Gov. Deal believes a strong education system leads to a strong economy and has made education investment a top priority. Deal has dedicated more than 50 percent of state funds to education every year he's been in office, devoting a higher percentage of the budget to k-12 funding than any governor in the past 50 years.
Deal's education priorities include:
*Increasing the number of students who are able to read at a third grade level by the completion of third grade
*Increasing the percentage of Georgians who hold a postsecondary credential
*Empowering citizens with public school options and local flexibility to improve student achievement
*Increasing k-12 funding by $1.5 billion dollars in the past three years, including almost $900 million for teacher raises, ending furlough days and increasing instructional days
*Creating the Teacher Advisory Committee to review recommendations from the Education Reform Commission to provide feedback and guidance
