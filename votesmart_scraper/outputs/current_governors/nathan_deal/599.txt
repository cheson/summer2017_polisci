Opening Statement Of The Honorable Nathan Deal Ranking Member, Subcommittee On Health committee On Energy And Commerce: " Preparing For The 2009 Pandemic Flu"
By: Nathan Deal
Date: Sept. 15, 2009
Location: Washington, DC

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing to examine our nation's preparedness for the H1N1 Flu as we approach flu season. I also want to thank Secretary Sebelius for being here today. I look forward to her testimony and our questions and answers to follow, so I will keep my opening remarks brief.
Today's Hearing will examine the status of our nation's preparation for the H1N1 Influenza strain as we approach flu season. As I mentioned during the Subcommittee Hearing last April, the threat of a global influenza pandemic is one of the greatest public health threats we face today. From speaking to scientists, researchers, healthcare providers and other experts in the field, I truly believe that it is not a matter of "if" a flu pandemic hits, but "when," and I believe we have the responsibility to ensure the greatest public protection possible when situations arise. This, of course, is no simple matter.
Since the first reports of a novel strain of the influenza virus began to surface earlier this year, U.S. and International authorities have taken aggressive steps to mitigate the spread of illness. This has taken the dedication and cooperation from all of those involved -- both public and private sectors -- particularly as infection rates increase. As my home state of Georgia and other areas of the south have witnessed, the easily-transmissible H1N1 strain continues to spread, particularly as schools return to class. As I have already been in contact with my state's agencies, this will require a continued focus at all levels -- state, federal and international -- throughout the coming months.
The current response to the H1N1 strain was coordinated in large part with plans which were developed to respond to a similar situation, the H5N1 Â‘Avian' Flu. In 2006, Congress provided approximately $6 billion for pandemic planning and cross-agency collaboration. These earlier efforts, and others focused on preparedness for emergencies, have streamlined the response to this situation. While our efforts to combat H1N1 have been aggressive, we must continue to monitor this situation closely and be proactive should things regrettably become worse.
Again, I look forward to Secretary Sebelius' testimony today and our questions and answers to follow.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
