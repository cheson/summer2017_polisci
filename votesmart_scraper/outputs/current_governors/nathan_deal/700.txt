ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE -- (House of Representatives - November 17, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
A lot has been said tonight about people losing coverage under Medicaid if these reforms go in place. I would like to call the reality of today to attention. If you want to lose people from Medicaid rolls, just do nothing. The status quo is doing that very adequately. Tennessee is having to remove over 200,000 from their Medicaid rolls. Missouri is removing over 100,000. In the last 3 years alone, 37 States have had to reduce eligibility, and 34 States have actually had to reduce benefits. The Governors are crying out to us to do something. If we don't do something, they can no longer sustain their portion of the requirement of paying their part of Medicaid. That is the message that they have sent to us on a unanimous basis. All Governors, both Democrat and Republican across this country have said, please reform the program. It is in dire need of reforms in order to be sustainable.

Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, will the gentlewoman yield?
Mrs. EMERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. In the manager's amendment, we provide for a GAO study that would authorize the Secretary to delay the implementation of the new reimbursement structure if the study finds that the average payment rates to pharmacists for drugs under the new Medicaid program are below the pharmacy acquisition cost. We think that this study will determine whether pharmacies are paid adequately and that we continue to provide access to Medicaid recipients for prescription medications.
