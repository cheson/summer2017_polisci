Gov. Nathan Deal announced today that Georgia organizations will receive $3,437,917 in AmeriCorps funding from the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to engage 690 AmeriCorps members with 15 nonprofit organizations and meet education, health, environmental and other local needs.
"Service and volunteerism are key ingredients to increasing the vitality and competitiveness of our local communities," said Deal. "These grants will enable AmeriCorps members to better meet local needs, leaving a positive and lasting impact on the state."
The grants will support AmeriCorps members across the state who will tackle critical challenges in Georgia by tutoring and mentoring youth, facilitating health education programs and preserving the state's natural resources through environmental stewardship projects. AmeriCorps places its members in local non-profit organizations, where they earn a stipend, or living allowance, during their service. They also earn an award toward their education once they complete their term of service.
The law creating AmeriCorps gave states greater responsibility in determining how national service resources are used and in promoting volunteerism and service. The funding was granted to the Georgia Commission for Service and Volunteerism, part of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. The commission awarded grants to nonprofit organizations and public agencies across the state.
"DCA's great tool chest of resources continues to empower communities to grow in a diversity of ways," said Georgia Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Gretchen Corbin. "The funding provided by AmeriCorps will help educate our future workforce, keep them healthy and sustain our quality of life, all while giving AmeriCorps members invaluable training in life and leadership."
The current year's AmeriCorps grant cycle was highly competitive due to the strong demand by organizations seeking these resources. The 2014 competition prioritized investments in economic opportunity, education, veterans and military families and disaster services while also continuing a new initiative for governors and mayors.
AmeriCorps engages more than 75,000 members to serve annually through nonprofit, faith-based and community organizations at 25,000 locations across the country. After completing a full term of service, full-time AmeriCorps members may receive an award of $5,645 that can be used to pay for college or to pay qualified student loans.
"AmeriCorps members make a powerful impact on the toughest challenges facing our nation," said CNCS CEO Wendy Spencer. "Building on Georgia's strong tradition of neighbor helping neighbor, AmeriCorps members improve lives and strengthen communities across the state. As we mark the 20th anniversary of AmeriCorps, we salute our members for their dedication and thank our outstanding partners who make their service possible."
