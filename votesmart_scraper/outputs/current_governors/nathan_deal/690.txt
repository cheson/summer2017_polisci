SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL NURSES WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 245, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Nurses Week.
Nurses are an integral component of the health care system, and it is important that we recognize the over 2.7 million registered nurses for the significant work that they do. For the last 3 years, we have celebrated National Nurses Week. Beginning on May 6, we will once again have the opportunity to truly commend the nursing community for their contributions to our national health delivery system.
I thank Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson for introducing this resolution, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time.
Mr. Speaker, I, too, would repeat my expression of appreciation for our colleague, Ms. Johnson, for bringing this resolution today and commend all of those in our society who have chosen the field of nursing as their profession and encourage others to do so and follow their example.
Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we honor them by this resolution.
