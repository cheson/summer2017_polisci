Gov. Nathan Deal said today that Sen. Johnny Isakson would meet his health challenge head-on:
"In the 35 years that I've known Johnny Isakson, he has risen to meet -- and overcome -- every obstacle he's encountered with determination and a smile on his face," Deal said. "There's not a doubt in my mind that he and Dianne will rise to meet this challenge. As he fights this battle, our distinguished senator will continue representing Georgians' conservative principles in Washington."
