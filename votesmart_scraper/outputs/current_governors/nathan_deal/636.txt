Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Newborn screening can certainly identify children at risk for certain metabolic and genetic diseases for which there may be an effective treatment. If it is detected early it is certainly a cost-saving way of dealing with these problems that can lead to death, disability, mental retardation and many other serious conditions.
Currently, States have differing policies and procedures for doing newborn screening. Accurate screening ensures affected babies are identified and receive the proper care.
[Time: 16:00]
This legislation establishes a newborn screening education and outreach program at the Department of Health and Human Services in order to improve newborn screening. Many parents of newborns are not aware of the wide variety of screening tests that are available. Thus, the legislation would establish a clearinghouse of educational and family support and services information on newborn screening in order to provide resources for those families.
This legislation moved through our committee in a bipartisan process and the majority and the minority were able to reconcile a few differences on the legislation in that committee process. I would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
