Gov. Nathan Deal today ordered flags across Georgia lowered to half-staff in honor of Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Skip Wells of Marietta and Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Randall Smith of Rossville, who were killed when a gunman attacked two military recruitment centers in Chattanooga on July 16. Flags will remain at half-staff through sunset on July 30.
"Sandra and I join millions of other Georgians in mourning the senseless loss of these Georgians and their three fellow American heroes," Deal said. "We honor their memories and recognize the sacrifices made by these military servicemen, and we offer their families our deepest condolences. We lower the U.S. and state flags as a sign of respect and as a reminder to all of the sacrifice it symbolizes."
