Deal Declares State of Emergency
Statement
By: Nathan Deal
Date: April 28, 2014
Location: Washington, DC

In preparation for severe storms that have caused extensive damage in states to the west, Gov. Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency, which will free up all state resources needed for preparation and response in the counties targeted by the storm.
"At this juncture, we've declared the emergency for the entire state because it's impossible to pinpoint where the weather will hit," Deal said. "Georgia is threatened at least through tomorrow and perhaps into Wednesday. We're prepared now and we'll be ready for recovery should we, God forbid, experience tornado damage or flooding.
"The state is sending the latest weather information we have available to affected schools districts, so that they can make informed decisions as they plan for tomorrow. I recommend that Georgians download the Ready Georgia app, follow GEMA on Twitter and tune in to media reports as the weather develops."
The state of emergency will extend until the threat subsides.
