Letter
By: Nathan Deal
Date: Nov. 18, 2009
Location: Washington, DC

Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Ga., the Ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, sent a letter Wednesday requesting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Georgia Senators Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson to offer his identity and citizenship verification language as amendments to the Senate version of the healthcare bill. The Deal language, which would have prohibited taxpayer dollars from being used to provide healthcare benefits to illegal aliens, was rejected by the House Democrat Majority.
In the letter Rep. Deal states, "the citizens of Georgia and the American people have spoken in firm opposition to allowing those who have illegally entered into our country from receiving taxpayer-funded social welfare benefits"
The text of the letter is below.
