Gov. Nathan Deal today signed HB 63, legislation overhauling the employer GED tax credit. The bill replaces the existing, underutilized program while increasing the credit amount available to Georgia job creators.
"By further strengthening our workforce, we'll keep Georgia the No. 1 place in which to do business," Deal said. "Far too often, government hinders, rather than helps, its jobs creators. Along with other pro-growth measures, this legislation removes barriers to employers willing to invest in Georgia's workforce. Encouraging education and professional development is good for business and for our state."
Deal also signed HB 71, which increases transparency and accountability at the State Board of Pardons and Paroles.
"A good government is one that works fairly and openly, that balances the need for protection of confidential information with the right to know how and why decisions are made," Deal said. "This law will better protect our citizens and allow for transparency when matters of justice are considered. At the same time, it will assist board members, who must make difficult, oftentimes complex, decisions in balancing their dual responsibilities."
