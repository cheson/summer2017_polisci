Gov. Nathan Deal today announced the statewide back-to-school tax-free holiday weekend will take place tomorrow and Saturday, July 31-Aug. 1.
"Georgia's back-to-school tax-free holiday is designed to afford hard-working families and students an opportunity to save money on essential school items, clothing and technology," said Deal. "I commend the General Assembly for working with me to reduce tax burdens placed on Georgia families during a time each year when household expenses really add up, and I wish all of you returning to school a productive year."
The Governor's Office of Planning and Budget estimates the two-day holiday will save Georgians up to $73 million. By state law, the holiday starts tonight at midnight and will conclude at midnight on Aug. 1. Some of the exempt items include:
* Clothing (including footwear) with a sales price of $100 or less per item
* Computers, computer components, and prewritten software purchased for noncommercial home or personal use with a sales price of $1,000 or less per item
* School supplies purchased for noncommercial use with a sales price of $20 or less per item
