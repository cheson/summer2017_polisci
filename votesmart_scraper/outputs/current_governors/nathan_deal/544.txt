Gov. Nathan Deal today signed SB 122, which allows the option for public-private partnerships in the development of water supply and infrastructure. Deal signed the legislation into law during remarks to the Georgia Chamber of Commerce at Cobb Galleria.
"Providing for a stable and dependable water supply for Georgia has ranked near the top of my agenda because it's critical to the health of our residents and to our economic development," Deal said. "This legislation is particularly useful at times such as these when budget cutbacks hinder our ability to invest in new infrastructure. This stretches public dollars by attracting partners to move forward with public works projects that will benefit the citizens of the state for generations. The lack of funding has hampered progress, even with a punishing drought in recent memory. This legislation will help us get projects moving before the next drought. Two years ago, Georgia made structural changes that vastly improved how we go about identifying and constructing reservoirs and other essential water infrastructure. The public-private partnership gives local governments the tools they need to take advantage of those changes."
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Ross Tolleson (R-Perry).
