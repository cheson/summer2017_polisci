Gov. Nathan Deal and the Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC) today launched the Veterans Re-Entry Dorm Program, which provides rehabilitated veteran offenders the opportunity to live in supportive living environments and receive specific re-entry services.
"The final step toward a lasting criminal justice overhaul is successful re-entry into society," Deal said. "We must work to remove barriers to employment, housing and education for rehabilitated offenders -- it would be counterproductive not to. These re-entry dorms will offer veterans a supportive place to live as they transition back to their families and into the workforce, reducing recidivism and saving taxpayer dollars. Through this initiative, we are ensuring that those who are willing to change the direction of their lives will find a helping hand."
This program was launched in partnership with the Federal Department of Veterans Affairs, the Georgia Department of Veterans Services and the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles and is offered at the following facilities: Rutledge State Prison, Johnson State Prison and Emanuel Women's Facility. GDC used existing facilities and staff to implement the program.
"I am grateful to the service our veterans have provided to our country and feel it is very important that we better serve our incarcerated veterans," said GDC Commissioner Brian Owens. "This initiative will afford our veteran offenders opportunities to help rebuild character and prepare them for the transition from incarceration back into the community."
