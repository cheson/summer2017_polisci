Gov. Nathan Deal today announced his appointments to the Rural Hospital Stabilization Committee, which was created to identify needs of the rural hospital community and provide potential solutions.
"In March of this year, I proposed three revisions to the way we approach rural health care, with one being the Rural Hospital Stabilization Committee," Deal said. "I recognize the critical need for hospital infrastructure in rural Georgia and remain committed to ensuring citizens throughout the state have the ability to receive the care that they need. This committee will work to increase the flow of communication between hospitals and the state and improve our citizens' access to health care. I am proud to welcome this team and look forward to what we stand to accomplish."
