In a Memorial Day service today, Gov. Nathan Deal honored members of the armed forces who gave their lives in service to the United States. He paid special tribute to 22 service members from Georgia who lost their lives in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Those members, who listed Georgia as their home state, were killed in action since last year's ceremony.
"Today, we commemorate these fallen heroes for their courage and sense of honor, for their service and for their love of this nation and our most cherished principles," said Deal. "They have given their lives in defense of freedom, and we owe them our deepest respect and gratitude. But even more, we owe them our allegiance to the principles that they gave so much for -- freedom, justice and equality. This ceremony is a time to recommit ourselves to those high ideals."
