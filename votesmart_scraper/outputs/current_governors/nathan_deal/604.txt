TWO AGENDAS -- (House of Representatives - July 21, 2009)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, my State of Georgia now has an unemployment rate in excess of 10 percent. As you've heard, other States are in worse condition. We are asking today the question of where are the jobs. We spent millions and billions, and perhaps even now trillions, of dollars throwing money at the problem, and yet the job losses continue.
The legislative agenda that's been adopted by this administration and by this House has primarily two pieces of legislation. First is the cap-and-trade, a bill that is setting us on a path that has already been followed by some of our European countries, Spain in particular. They set out on this path of green jobs over a decade ago. The result is 17.5 percent unemployment. The green bubble burst, and for every job they created, they lost 2.2 jobs.
The second major approach of this House has been the new health care reform bill, a bill that will tax employers 8 percent of their payroll amounts if they do not provide health insurance for their employees. What does that mean? New jobs? No. It means losing jobs that we already have.
Mr. Speaker, it's appropriate to ask, where are the jobs?
