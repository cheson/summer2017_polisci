Gov. Nathan Deal today signed into law Georgia's new congressional map passed by the General Assembly. Act 3X, known as the Georgia Congressional Reapportionment Act of 2011, adds a 14th district, which Georgia gained after the 2010 Census. In the coming weeks, Deal will work with Attorney General Sam Olens and legislative leaders to determine the best path toward preclearance for the congressional, state House and state Senate district maps.
"I applaud the members of the General Assembly for carefully vetting legislative maps that fairly reflect the population changes in the 2010 Census and that honor the sacred principle of "one person, one vote,'" said Deal. "The Legislature has drawn districts that are compact, that keep communities of interest together and that visually make sense. Additionally, these maps honor the guidelines we must follow under federal law."
