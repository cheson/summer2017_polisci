To ensure efficiency and that Georgia remains the "gateway to the Southeast," Deal is dedicated to prioritizing transportation investment.
There is no more important public works project for the competitiveness of our entire region than the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project. Throughout his first term as governor, Deal's budgets have reflected his commitment to the project, bringing our total state contribution to $266 million. Deal continues to encourage Congress to do their part to ensure Georgia is ready when the Panama Canal comes online this year.
"It's time to start moving dirt," said Gov. Deal. "It's time Congress does their part when the Canal comes online later this year."
When Deal ran for office, he pledged to eliminate the GA 400 toll. Deal kept his promise and closed the toll facilities on GA 400 in November 2013. In order to ease congestion and improve mobility, Deal has also invested $85 million into road and bridge projects.
