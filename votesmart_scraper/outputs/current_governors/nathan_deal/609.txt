REP. STUPAK: (Sounds gavel.) Okay. Hearing will come to order. Today we have a hearing entitled, "Terminations of Individual Health Policies by Insurance Companies." The chairman, the ranking member, and the chairman emeritus will have five minutes for opening statement. Other members of the subcommittee will be recognized for three minutes.
Before we begin, I'm going to ask unanimous consent that the contents of our document binder be entered into the record, provided that the committee staff may redact any information that is business proprietary, relates to privacy concerns, or is law enforcement sensitive. Without objection the documents will be entered into the record. And we'll ask that a copy of our document binder be placed at the front table in case witnesses wish to refer to it.
