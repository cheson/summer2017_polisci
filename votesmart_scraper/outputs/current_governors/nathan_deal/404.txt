Gov. Nathan Deal reported today that Fitch, S&P and Moody's have all reaffirmed the state of Georgia's AAA bond rating.
"AAA ratings don't just happen; they must be achieved," Deal said. "We have attained this lofty status -- only nine states have it -- through responsible and conservative fiscal management of state government. Great credit belongs to the General Assembly for its wise stewardship of tax dollars. Members of the House and Senate have worked cooperatively with me on three budgets that keep a lid on spending and limit future liabilities while providing the services Georgians need to educate our children, keep us safe and bring jobs to our citizens. These ratings have a real-world effect on Georgia taxpayers. This distinction lets investors know that our state is a safe bet, which saves the states tens of millions of dollars each year. That's money that Georgians can keep in their pockets, one of the reasons we boast the lowest per capita tax burden in the nation."
