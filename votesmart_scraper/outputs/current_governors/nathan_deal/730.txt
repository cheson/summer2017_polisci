During these austere budget years, our state has an opportunity - and an obligation - to reduce the burden on Georgia taxpayers. We can ensure limited resources are being prioritized to advance the core functions of our state government. Education, transportation, public safety and healthcare are the critical and constitutionally-mandated responsibilities of our state, and as Georgia's next governor, Nathan will work to ensure effective use of taxpayer dollars by enacting zero-based budgeting. This significant reform of state budget policy will ensure every taxpayer dollar spent is justified and accounted for each year.
