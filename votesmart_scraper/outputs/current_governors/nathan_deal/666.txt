DEXTROMETHORPHAN DISTRIBUTION ACT OF 2006 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to rise in favor of H.R. 5280, and I would like to thank Mr. Upton of Michigan and Mr. Larsen of Washington for their work on this important legislation. Dextromethorphan, or DXM as it is sometimes called, is an ingredient found in cough medicine. This ingredient relieves the coughing associated with a cold or the flu. Cough medicines containing this drug are common and can be obtained without a prescription.
While this drug is safe and effective, it is also dangerous if too much is taken. Reports have shown that some segments of the population, particularly young people, will take large amounts of this medicine in an attempt to absorb large amounts of DXM in order to get high. The abuse of this drug can cause death as well as other serious adverse effects such as brain damage, seizures, loss of consciousness, and irregular heartbeat.
The Food and Drug Administration has warned of the rise in the abuse of DXM, and the bill before us here today is an attempt to stem this abuse.
H.R. 5280 would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prohibit the distribution of DXM that is in bulk form to any person not registered with the FDA. It is hoped that these restrictions on the distribution of DXM will lower the potential for its abuse, while at the same time protecting the public health.
Mr. Speaker, I would urge the Members to support this legislation, and I would reserve the balance of my time.
