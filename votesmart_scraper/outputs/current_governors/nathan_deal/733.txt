Issue Position
By: Nathan Deal
Location: Unknown

Nathan wants to leave Georgia a better place for his children and grand children to grow up and enjoy the wonderful gifts Georgia has granted him. Nathan sees that this is a critical point in time, from the lives of Georgians, to the future of the conservative values that make our state a great place to work and live. He believes that his principled conservative leadership, rooted in the Georgia clay and matured in the U.S. Army, is what Georgia needs to move our state forward.
