Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
I rise today in support of House Resolution 833, authored by Mr. Hinchey, Mrs. Bono and Mrs. Capps, expressing the sense of Congress on the importance of Women's Health Week.
Each year Women's Health Week promotes awareness about steps women can take to improve their health. The focus is on the importance of incorporating simple, preventative, and positive health behaviors into women's everyday lives.
When women take simple steps to improve their health, the results can be significant. Many of the leading causes of death among women, such as heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes are preventable and treatable if the warning signs are recognized.
Events like National Women's Health Week and National Women's Checkup Day are great opportunities to tell someone you love that their health is important. Remind a mother, sister, spouse, daughter or friend to get regular checkups, exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, quit smoking, and follow safety rules.
I commend the hundreds of volunteers, women's groups, health organizations, businesses, and charitable organizations who have helped to make National Women's Health Week a success.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution in recognition of National Women's Health Week.
