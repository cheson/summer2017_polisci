Gov. Nathan Deal today signed legislation that would implement an Opportunity School District (OSD) to turn around failing schools. This law provides the framework for how the OSD would work should voters approve a constitutional amendment in 2016.
"By signing the Opportunity School District bill, we are promising better days ahead for students trapped in failing schools," Deal said. "The power of positive change now rests in the hands of Georgia's voters, and I know they share my belief that every child can learn and should have access to a high-quality education that prepares them for the workforce or for college.
"There are currently 139 schools across Georgia that have received a failing grade from the state accountability system for at least three consecutive years. Too few of these students go on to higher education, too few attain job skills and too few get a high school diploma. Too often this leads to a life that never fulfills its potential. With this new system, we can and will do better."
The OSD legislation requires a constitutional amendment to be enacted. The General Assembly passed the constitutional amendment resolution and the implementing legislation during the 2015 legislative session. It now requires a majority approval by Georgia voters in the 2016 general election.
Deal also signed HB 372, the Utopian Academy for the Arts Act. The need for this law stems from efforts by Clayton County officials to obstruct the opening of a state-approved charter school, preventing children from attending class and costing the schools hundreds of thousands of dollars.
