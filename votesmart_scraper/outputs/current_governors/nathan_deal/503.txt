Gov. Nathan Deal has received the state investigators' report on the 2009 administration of the CRCT in the Dougherty County School System. Find the report at http://www.gaosa.org/.
"There is nothing more important to the future of our state than ensuring that today's students receive a first-class education," said Deal. "The findings out of Dougherty County are alarming as they paint a tragic picture of children passed through with no real or fair assessment of their abilities. To cheat a child out of his or her ability to truly excel in the classroom shames the district and the state. We'll now send the results to the Professional Standards Commission and to the Dougherty County district attorney's office. It is my hope that brighter days are ahead for the children affected by this unfortunate situation."
