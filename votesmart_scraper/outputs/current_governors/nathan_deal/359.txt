With inclement weather headed toward Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal today in coordination with Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black signed an executive order prohibiting price gouging for propane. Georgia's continued period of cold weather has increased the demand for propane, causing a substantial prices increase in recent days.
"Our families, farmers and small business are worried about getting the heat they need during times of frigid weather," Deal said. "They shouldn't have to worry about price gouging, and we aim to prevent that."
"Due to the much colder than normal weather this winter, we have seen a higher demand for propane gas resulting in shortages and escalating prices in Georgia and across the nation," said Black. "Livestock and poultry farmers, along with food processors, depend on propane to continue business. We are doing everything possible to work with the propane suppliers and agribusinesses to meet the challenges we are currently facing."
Deal recently ordered restrictions on propane transport be eased to help increase the state's supply of propane. If weather conditions do not improve in coming weeks, Deal will revisit state actions.
