Speaking at a Women for Deal rally today at the state Capitol, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel endorsed Gov. Nathan Deal for re-election, citing his strong record of accomplishments and the need for his future leadership.
"I'm supporting Governor Deal because there is far too much at stake in this election for Georgia," said Handel. "There's just too much at stake to let the past take priority over the future of our state. Governor Deal has done a good job and, as a result, has earned my support for a second term as governor of this great state."
Handel pointed out that, under Gov. Deal, Georgia has created nearly 300,000 private sector jobs and is ranked No. 1 by three different entities as the best place to do business.
"Governor Deal brings the experience, maturity and track record to ensure that Georgia continues to be a great place to live and work and raise a family," Handel said. "In the next four years, I know he'll continue to keep taxes low, implement policies that foster private-sector job growth and continue to invest in cultivating a skilled workforce. And when it comes to education, Governor Deal has made educating Georgia's children a top priority -- and that will continue."
Gov. Deal praised Secretary Handel as a dedicated public servant and a tenacious campaigner.
"Karen was a worthy opponent, and let me tell you, it's much better when she's on your side," Deal said. "Karen is a fighter, she's a reformer and a great messenger for conservative causes, and I appreciate her willingness to serve the people of Georgia. I'm am honored to have her support."
