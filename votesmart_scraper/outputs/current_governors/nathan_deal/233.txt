Protecting Georgians
We must identify and implement innovative strategies and solutions to better execute on the core mission of government--to protect its citizens. We must continue to increase the presence of state law enforcement, reduce injury and loss of life on Georgia's roadways, and appropriately deal with violators. This requires common-sense laws, well-trained and well-equipped law enforcement agencies, and an efficient judicial system.
Rehabilitating Nonviolent Offenders
To better serve all Georgians, we must expand accountability courts and do a better job of rehabilitating low-risk, nonviolent offenders that currently crowd our prisons and strain our budget. The old way of doing things has created a stagnant situation with low rehabilitation rates, high recidivism rates, and high costs. We must be smart on crime, utilizing tools which lessen the taxpayer burden while improving public safety outcomes.
Promote Successful Offender Re-entry and Compliance
Identifying and utilizing successful evidence-based offender re-entry programs and practices is critical in preventing offenders from falling back into a life of crime. Reducing recidivism through meaningful reentry programs will help make our communities safer.
Promote Safe Communities where Families and Children Thrive
Healthy family life and economic development are of critical importance to Georgia, and they depend on safe communities. We must continue to enhance the security of the facilities within our prison system, give law enforcement the tools they need, and be ready to respond to natural disasters in an efficient, timely manner.
