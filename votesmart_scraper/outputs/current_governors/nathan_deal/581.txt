While his opponent has spent the past year apologizing to teachers for his past mistakes, Nathan Deal is actively seeking teachers' input on ideas to improve Georgia's public schools.
Deal has launched an online survey asking teachers to give their opinion on issues ranging from the amount of time spent preparing students for tests to their access to classroom technology.
"I can't develop an educational platform without the input of the professionals in the classroom," Deal said. "Teachers are already offering thoughtful and constructive advice and I look forward to hearing from more of them."
The survey also offers teachers an opportunity to submit written advice for Deal on priorities for education.
"Give teachers the power to teach their students in the most appropriate and beneficial way," wrote one teacher in her comments to Deal. "Teachers have to be treated with respect and we need an advocate not more dictators or enemies!"
Deal, who is married to a former school teacher and is the son of career teachers, said Georgia's teachers will have a strong advocate in him.
"When Roy Barnes was telling teachers what was wrong with them, I was helping my wife grade papers," Deal said. "I have been listening to Georgia teachers throughout my public life and welcome their input."
After reviewing the teacher surveys, Deal plans to release his education plan for Georgia in September.
