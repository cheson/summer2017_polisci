As a husband, father, and grandfather, Governor Deal believes that good government and strong communities begins at home. To help safeguard Georgia families and promote strong marriages, Deal eliminated Georgia's marriage tax penalty in his first term.
Deal believes in the dignity of human life at all stages and will continue fighting to protect our society's most vulnerable. The Deals' deep faith led them to First Baptist Church in Gainesville, where they have worshiped for decades.
