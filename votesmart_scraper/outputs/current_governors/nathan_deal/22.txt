Gov. Nathan Deal today commended the House of Representatives on the passage of HB 338, which creates a turnaround plan for Georgia's lowest-performing schools. The legislation, which passed by a vote of 138-37, includes a method for identifying low-performing schools and a multi-year, multifaceted turnaround plan to assist them.
"I applaud the members of the House of Representatives who demonstrated their commitment to improving education outcomes for Georgia's most vulnerable students," said Deal. "Rep. Kevin Tanner worked tirelessly with House and Senate leadership, education committee chairmen and other stakeholders to produce this critical and bipartisan legislation. I'm grateful for their cooperation and collaboration on behalf of Georgia students. This is a critical step forward for improving Georgia's education system for current and future students, families and communities. I look forward to its passage in the Senate and signing HB 338 into law."
