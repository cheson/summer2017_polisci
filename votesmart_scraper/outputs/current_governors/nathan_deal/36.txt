When Gov. Deal took office, Georgia was in the midst of a criminal justice crisis. To address these problems, Deal implemented a series of bipartisan reforms that are already paying dividends. Through these efforts, Georgia has avoided the need for 5,000 additional prison beds over five years and saved taxpayers at least $264 million.
Accountability courts
*In Georgia, we have taken monumental steps in recent years to give new beginnings to nonviolent offenders whose underlying issues are addiction or mental illness. Instead of saddling taxpayers with the cost of a prison sentence, instead of branding the offender with the stigma of incarceration, these individuals are getting the treatment they need; they are keeping jobs; and they are keeping families together.
*The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last year reported that prison sentences imposed on African-American offenders have dropped by 20 percent and links this "unmistakable" downward trend to the state's boost in accountability courts funding.
*"Since 2007 alone, more than three dozen [accountability] courts have opened their doors across Georgia," the AJC reported. "In the first quarter of 2014, more than 4,100 offenders were enrolled in the state's 105 accountability courts, and many of these participants would likely be in prison without this alternative."
Juvenile justice reforms
*In 2013, Georgia was spending $91,000 on each incarcerated juvenile per year and still seeing a 65 percent recidivism rate.
*These unique challenges led to reforms including assessment tools designed to help judges determine the risk levels of juvenile offenders; providing judges with greater discretion in sentencing juveniles; and expanding community-based options across the state, an objective pursued in part through the creation of an incentive grant program.
*Since these changes have been put in place, the state has made significant progress, particularly with its incentive grant program. For example, participating counties have seen felony commitments and placements in short-term programs drop more than 62 percent over a nine-month period. This has resulted in the closure of two detention centers.
Re-entry programs
*Re-entry is the critical intersection between an offender's incarceration and return to life in the free world. By removing barriers to employment, housing and education for rehabilitated offenders, a larger number of returning citizens are able to rejoin the workforce and support their families.
