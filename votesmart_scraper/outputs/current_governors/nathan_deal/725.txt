BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
REP. UPTON: I just-we're going to have an affiliate at our next hearing, we're going to have an affiliate come.
Mr. Deal?
REP. DEAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As I was listening to the opening statements and the testimony and the questions here today, it sounds to me like we have two worlds that have collided. One is the world that we're all here from, and that is a world that is outraged by what has happened in recent weeks over the public airwaves. Because they do perceive that you are the invited guest into their home and you have badly misbehaved.
The second world, Mr. Karmazin, seems to be your world. That is a world in which you've testified that you have heard no complaints from any of your advertisers about what went on at the Super Bowl. Now, there is something that is colliding here, and that is colliding in this testimony today that requires that we take action. Now I quite frankly think that the NFL has gotten the message. I think they will do everything within their power to make sure this is not repeated. I have not been convinced that the same is true from your world.
On five different occasions in Mr. Tagliabue's testimony and perhaps even more, red flags were waved, almost to the point that they pulled the halftime ceremonies. I heard nothing in your testimony, nor do I see in your written testimony that any red flags were ever waved to you or to MTV. Am I incorrect in my analysis?
MR. KARMAZIN: In some way, sir. With all due respect, we're not living in two worlds, we said the same thing about outrage. This is-you know, we are outraged as to what happened at the Super Bowl.
REP. DEAL: Let me stop you there. Mr. Tagliabue was concerned about things, not the incident with Janet Jackson, he was concerned on at least five different occasions about the way the music was being portrayed, about the other things that went along with it. Did any of those red flags ever cross your mind?
MR. KARMAZIN: Prior to the event, prior to the halftime show, I had zero role in the show. Zero role in the show. Mr. Tagliabue will confirm that, you know, he had meetings, I was never at meetings --
REP. DEAL: I'm not speaking to you personally, you are a representative of every entity involved here from the ownership of CBS to the ownership of MTV, am I correct?
MR. KARMAZIN: You are absolutely correct, yes, sir.
REP. DEAL: Did anybody under you then, if you not personally, was there ever anything raised of saying we ought to be concerned about this?
MR. KARMAZIN: Absolutely, and the evidence shows and Mr. Tagliabue mentioned it in his testimony, that the head of CBS was concerned about some of the information he was getting about the artists and the cooperation of MTV with the NFL and the CEO of CBS was-took corrective action and improved the situation, so, yes, I mean there was. You know, the CEO of MTV was involved and took action when he heard from the head of CBS that there was question about the relationship. There were lots of-I mean, this thing --
REP. DEAL: So it got better then? In other words we could have had a worse presentation, is that what you're saying?
MR. KARMAZIN: You're characterizing better or worse. There were discussions about who the artist should be, whether or not, you know --
REP. DEAL: That sounds to me like nothing changed in the process of those discussions, is that right?
MR. KARMAZIN: Well, if that sounds to you like that --
REP. DEAL: Yes it does. Let me ask you this, we've talked about a lot of things, accountability. You used the word indemnification, I think you were relating to the discussion about the folks who pick up your broadcast, etcetera. I would like to ask you, do you have any indemnification language in your contracts to indemnify you or MTV or CBS for any fine that might take place? Do you have written language with your performers that they will indemnify you in the event you're fined because of their conduct?
MR. KARMAZIN: Yes, in many of our employment agreements, particularly on the radio side where somebody has a microphone in front of them and they are doing a live performance, what we say is we will indemnify you the performer for material that we give you so that if you're reading a commercial and someone is going to sue you because the facts in the commercial are wrong, we'll indemnify you, but if you're going to go on the air and say something that is inappropriate, you need to indemnify us and yes we have used that indemnity not necessarily on indecency, but we have used that indemnity to pay us because people have used the --
REP. DEAL: So if you go before the FCC and they decide that there's a fine coming down the line, you can't use the argument then, that you had no way to protect yourself against it, because you could have, you could have indemnified yourself by such a contract clause with a performer who may go out of line, even though you had no reason to suspect they could.
MR. KARMAZIN: No, I think that if we went before the FCC, and the FCC were to question something that happened on our facility, the fact that-we're responsible and I have said it maybe enough times, we're responsible whether we're indemnified or not indemnified, we take the responsibility that we're the licensee and we're responsible.
REP. DEAL: All right, so that will be your position before the FCC when the issue of fines comes up then, is that you're responsible with no excuses, is that right?
MR. KARMAZIN: We have absolutely not taken the argument that, you know, we're not responsible for what happens on our air.
REP. DEAL: Mr. Chairman, I would just conclude more or less with a statement, and that is we've heard the argument here now that the FCC is the one who ought to redefine the definition of indecency. Perhaps that is true. I find it objectionable that those who have been granted the free use of our airwaves would not see fit to restrain themselves within their own conduct to define conduct that is less than indecent. That is, that which we've heard the use of the words, crude, inappropriate.
It would seem to me that if you have the confidence of the public and wish to maintain it, then you would establish standards and don't require the FCC to set standards defining a constitutional level. You should be above that. Because if all you do is race to the bottom of a standard, then this is what we're going to get, and I believe that that's what's being advocated here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
