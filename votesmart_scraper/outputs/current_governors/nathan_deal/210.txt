Gov. Nathan Deal announced today that WebstaurantStore, an e-commerce brand that sells restaurant equipment and supplies, will create 150 jobs and invest $10 million into a distribution and fulfillment center in Albany over the next three years.
"E-commerce companies such as WebstaurantStore choose Georgia because they can trust that here they will find opportunities for innovation and growth," said Deal. "With our skilled, dedicated workforce and business-friendly environment, I have no doubt that WebstaurantStore will remain highly competitive in today's ever-changing market."
WebstaurantStore will locate to an existing 472,000-square-foot facility. The company's Albany distribution center will serve clients in the Southeast and will help meet the company's goal of providing one-day shipping to its customers. Hiring is expected to begin in December 2015.
"We are very excited to be coming to the Albany area and look forward to being part of the community for many years to come," said WebstaurantStore President Dave Groff.
WebstaurantStore, headquartered in Lancaster, Pa., is the leading restaurant supply store, with more than 4 million orders shipped to date. The company's current three U.S. distribution centers provide restaurant supplies and equipment to the foodservice industry and individual customers worldwide.
Walt Farrell, director of advanced manufacturing, and David Dunagan, project manager on the logistics team at the Georgia Department of Economic Development (GDEcD), assisted WebstaurantStore on behalf of the state along with the Albany-Dougherty Economic Development Commission and Matt Clovin with Electric Cities of Georgia.
