DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2006)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment relates to the issue of birthright citizenship and is a prohibitive amendment for using funds under this appropriations's bill for the purpose of implementing and granting birthright citizenship.
The issue is one that I think has now caught the attention of the American public and rightfully so. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that some 383,000, or 42 percent of births to immigrants are to illegal alien mothers. Births to illegal immigrants now account for nearly one out of every ten births in the United States.
We are in a distinct minority in the world community in recognizing birthright citizenship. There are only 36 countries that do so, 122 do not. Of the 36 that do, the United States, Cuba, El Salvador, Guinea, and Venezuela are in that list. On the other hand, the vast majority of all westernized countries, including every single European country along with Israel and Japan, do not offer birthright citizenship.
In fact, Ireland in 2004 changed their law to no longer recognize birthright citizenship.
The magnitude of the problem is, in fact, astounding. The Center for Immigration Studies found that illegal immigrants cost the United States taxpayer about $10.4 billion a year. A large part of that expense stems from the babies born each year to illegal immigrants.
In my State of Georgia, a normal, noncesarean section child delivery, with no complications, costs an average of $2,720. Born United States citizens, these children are eligible for all benefits of citizenship, including, but not limited to, education, Medicaid, and welfare.
