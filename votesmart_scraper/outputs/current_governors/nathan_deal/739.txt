Transportation is a critical issue for our state. Georgia's east to west connectivity is insufficient, which forces thousands of extra vehicles onto metro Atlanta roads. Alternative routes must be explored to remove more than 100,000 transfer trucks from metropolitan roadways each day and significantly relieve congestion and delays as a result. As the Port of Savannah is expanded to accept larger vessels, surface transit will be a fundamental ingredient in ensuring the full utilization of the port. Connectivity through roadways and rail, when financially justifiable, must be explored. Nathan supports the actions by the Legislature to approve a long-anticipated regional transportation plan, and I commend Gov. Sonny Perdue's approval of the measure. I believe this is an integral first step to resolving transportation shortfalls in our state over the long run.
