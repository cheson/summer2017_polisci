Kia Motors announced today at the New York International Auto Show that it will begin producing the critically acclaimed Kia Optima midsize sedan at its West Point plant. Production on the 2012 Optima will begin in the third quarter of this year, and Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia, Inc. (KMMG) is currently accepting applications for the 1,000 workers it intends to hire to support this new production line. The total number of team members at KMMG is expected to reach nearly 3,000 later this year.
"We are delighted that Kia will make not only the best-selling Sorento, but now the award-winning Optima, right here in Georgia. The company's decision to produce one of its newest models in West Point reflects the success it has already experienced here thanks to the talent and commitment of its workforce," said Gov. Nathan Deal. "This is a great win for Georgia and yet another tribute to the strength of our business environment and infrastructure. I would especially like to recognize the residents of the western part of the state, who have made Kia welcome and contributed so much to its success."
