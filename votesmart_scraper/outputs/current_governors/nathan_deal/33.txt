Under Gov. Deal's leadership, Georgia has created more than 540,000 private-sector jobs. He's overseen five balanced budgets, saved millions of taxpayer dollars by maintaining Georgia's AAA bond rating, and grown the rainy day fund to more than $2 billion.
Deal enacted pro-jobs tax reforms, including:
*Removing the sales tax on energy used in manufacturing.
*Eliminating the estate tax so that small business leaders can pass on their businesses to their families.
*Reducing the marriage tax penalty.
*Reinstituting the sales tax holidays for back-to-school shopping and energy efficient appliances.
*Enacting tax credits for agriculture, film and technology sectors.
Under Deal, Georgia's workforce and pro-business climate have been consistently recognized as among the best in the country. Because of this, Georgia continues to see existing businesses expand and out-of-state companies relocate here, including Kia, Caterpillar, Porsche, Mercedes, Baxter Pharmaceuticals and Comcast. For three consecutive years, Georgia has been named the No. 1 state in the nation in which to do business by two separate organizations. Georgia also leads the nation in women-owned business growth.
