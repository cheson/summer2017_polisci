At a news conference today with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Gov. Nathan Deal announced that he'll work with Jindal, legislators and stakeholders next year to study Louisiana's program to rescue students in continually low-performing schools.
"I have worked with Governor Jindal and with a bipartisan group of Georgia legislators to develop a plan that would rescue children from our lowest-performing schools and provide them the education and opportunities each student deserves," said Deal. "Governor Jindal and I believe that your ZIP code should not determine the quality of your education. Every child deserves the opportunity to get a great education."

"Just like in Louisiana, some of our students are trapped in failing schools that don't prepare them for the workforce or for college," said Deal. "A strong education system leads to a strong economy. I want to give every child a true chance at the American Dream."
