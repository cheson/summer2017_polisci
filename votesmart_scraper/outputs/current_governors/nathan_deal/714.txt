CONFERENCE REPORT ON H. CON. RES. 95, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006 -- (House of Representatives - April 28, 2005)
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee that has jurisdiction over the issue of Medicaid, I would like to talk about that subject for just a minute, the most expensive health care program we have in this country, costing over $300 billion last year alone.
The question is, where are the Governors on this issue? Sure, every Governor would like to have more Federal dollars. But the truth is that they are telling us they cannot really afford, in a matching program as Medicaid, the money that we are providing in many instances now. That is why a Democratic Governor of Tennessee is having to cut over 323,000 recipients off the Medicaid rolls. That is why the same pattern is being repeated in other States.
What would they rather have more than more money or a normal growth pattern? They want reform. The only way we are going to get reform of the Medicaid system is to pass this budget resolution.
Why does it need reform? Every State is now spending more on their contribution to Medicaid than they are spending on elementary education and on secondary education. It is on a road to disaster. The Comptroller General tells us that. Governors say it is something that is going to melt down and take all of their State budgets unless we have reform.
If you want to go home and explain to your Governor and to your people why you voted against an opportunity to reform the most expensive part of their State budget, then vote against the budget resolution.
