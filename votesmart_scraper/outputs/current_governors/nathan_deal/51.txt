Gov. Nathan Deal and members of the Emergency Operations Command today outlined Hurricane Matthew's impact on Georgia's coastal areas and the state's recovery response efforts.
"Hurricane Matthew hit Georgia as a Category 2 hurricane last night, swamping coastal areas with high winds, heavy rain and flooding," Deal said. "We have started mobilizing our recovery plan and working with local authorities to assess damages to restore power, clear roadways and make repairs. I understand that people are anxious to return home, but I ask evacuees to wait until local authorities determine it is safe to do so. The timeline for return may vary depending on degree of damage and storm impact in affected areas, as the primary focus remains on public safety. We will continue to keep you updated throughout the return and recovery process."
