Gov. Nathan Deal announced today that the state has experienced a record increase in both exports and imports for the fourth consecutive year.
"With such diverse geographical representation, Georgia companies can further cultivate business relationships," said Deal. "This is another record-breaking year in international trade. I am proud to be governor of a state that is clearly at the forefront of global commerce."
According to the Census Bureau, the state moved up one position ranking in both exports and imports. Georgia increased from the 12th largest exporting state to the 11th in 2013. The state also increased from the 9th largest importing state to the country's 8th largest importing state. More than 90 percent of Georgia's total trade was with Asia, Europe and North America. Of particular note is the diversity of items involved in trade and the amount of the state impacted by trade.
"This is a clear indication that Georgia companies are aggressively pursuing international markets and that international companies are looking to Georgia for business," said commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development Chris Carr. "With our No. 1 business climate, the state continues to provide businesses with access to the right resources, keeping them competitive in the global marketplace."
