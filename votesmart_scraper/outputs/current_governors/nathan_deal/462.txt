Gov. Nathan Deal today said the state of Georgia agrees with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers legal opinion that the Corps has the ability to grant Georgia's water supply request for Lake Lanier.
"Ultimately, deciding how much of Lake Lanier can be allocated for drinking water supply is the most important determination facing Georgia, the metro Atlanta region and our neighboring ACF basin states," Deal said. "That decision will help us not only plan for Georgia's future growth, but it will also give us greater certainty regarding existing resources. This will help set the parameters for discussions regarding a resolution with our neighboring states.
"Today's legal opinion and technical analysis by the Corps that it has the authority to grant Georgia's previous water supply request is welcome news and an important step toward the Corps final reallocation decision."
