FOR THE RELIEF OF THE PARENTS OF THERESA MARIE SCHIAVO -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2005)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the Leadership in the House and Senate for working together for a rapid compromise on legislation to allow for the relief of the parents of Terri Schiavo, and I rise today to support the bill.
Terri Schiavo's struggle to live has been emotionally trying for anyone who has followed the case, let alone the incomprehensible emotions being faced by her family and caretakers who are directly involved. I, presumably like most Members of Congress, hoped to see the issue of Terri Schiavo resolved without Congressional intervention. While I do not feel it is the role of Congress to make medical decisions in the case of Terri Schiavo, I do feel it is our role to ensure her parents' opportunity to fight for their own daughter's life before a Federal court. Moreover, I feel whenever there is doubt and question and disagreement as to what a person in Terri's condition would want for herself, government must always protect one's right to live.
I continue to pray for Ms. Schiavo and her family, and for the strength they need to endure this emotional trauma. Every life is worthy of protection, and given the circumstances surrounding this case, I support the efforts being taken to save her life.
