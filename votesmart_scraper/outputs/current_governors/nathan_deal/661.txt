CHARLIE W. NORWOOD LIVING ORGAN DONATION ACT
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me this time.
I too wish to express appreciation to the sponsor and all of those who have made it possible to bring this bill to the floor today. It is certainly altogether fitting and proper that we name this bill after the late Charlie Norwood.
This bill does two very important things that Charlie really believed in. The first is he believed in organ transplant. As Mr. Inslee alluded, he was the recipient of a lung transplant that extended his life. He believed in organ transplants.
The second thing that it does is something that he really believed in as well, and that is overcoming bureaucratic red tape that made no common sense. And that is what this bill does. Pairing of donations for kidneys makes all of the common sense in the world. It will save lives and money. Certainly in the tradition of Charlie Norwood, it will perpetuate the importance of organ donations and do so in the memory and in the honor of a great Member of this body.
