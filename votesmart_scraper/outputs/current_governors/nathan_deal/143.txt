Following a yearlong review of Georgia's education system, the Education Reform Commission today submitted its final report to Gov. Nathan Deal.
"I am grateful for the tireless work of the commission members on behalf of Georgia's students and for Dr. Knapp's leadership throughout this process," said Deal. "At its outset, I charged the commission with providing recommendations to improve education, increase access to early learning programs, recruit and retain high-quality instructors and expand school options for students and families. I look forward to reviewing their recommendations as to how we might achieve these goals."
