Earlier this week, Gov. Deal spoke at the 12th annual Georgia Public Safety Memorial Ceremony honoring Georgia's fallen servicemen and women. The names of 12 public safety officials who have lost their lives while on duty in Georgia were read aloud in remembrance and added to Georgia's Public Safety Memorial Wall located in Forsyth. Of those honored, some have been gone for more than a hundred years and others were more recently interred, but all possessed a steadfast dedication to the public safety of Georgia.
"The men and women we honor today have given their lives in sacrifice for the protection of their fellow man. Although they have vacated this earth, their legacy remains," said Deal. "We cannot begin to express our gratitude, as a state, for the sacrifice made by those whose names now appear on this wall."
Deal will continue to honor Georgians who have lost their lives in the line of duty at tomorrow's annual State of Georgia Memorial Day Ceremony. Over the past year, 25 Georgians made the ultimate sacrifice while serving their country.
"We will forever mourn the loss of these brave souls, who laid down their lives to serve the citizens of Georgia and Americans at large."
As we approach Memorial Day weekend, Deal encourages you to remember what the holiday represents. It is a day to honor those who paid the ultimate price to protect the lives and freedoms of our fellow citizens. Stay safe this weekend as you celebrate with family and friends, and remember to show appreciation for all of the servicemen who work tirelessly to keep us safe.
