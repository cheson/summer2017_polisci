HB 683 removes unnecessary regulation on Georgia business, takes effect immediately
Gov. Nathan Deal today signed into law a bill that reforms the way in which businesses can review and respond to garnishment requests. This bill, which passed through both houses of Legislature by large margins, grants businesses the power to file garnishment requests through authorized personnel instead of having to hire legal counsel.
"I'm committed to working with the Legislature to reduce unnecessary regulation on businesses, large and small," Deal said. "This law will take effect immediately and remove a mandate that could pose a costly burden on job creators. Reducing the amount of unnecessary legal fees is just one step in making Georgia the No. 1 place to do business, and there is no need for its delay."
Historically, human resources or payroll employees have processed garnishments for employees. Under a 2011 court decision, the state Supreme Court held that this routine task must be performed by lawyers. This legislation prevents an undue administrative burden on small businesses by eliminating the employment of lawyers to process garnishments and allowing them to be performed by authorized personnel instead.
HB 683 was sponsored by Reps. Wendell Willard, Richard Smith, Andy Welch, Tom McCall and Robert Dickey.
