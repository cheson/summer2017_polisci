115 House Members Sign Norwood Letter Seeking Airline Pension Help

March 13, 2006
(Washington, DC) - The pensions of current and former airline employees would receive additional protections if the U.S. House of Representatives adopts an airline pension funding rule already approved by the Senate, according to U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-GA) and 115 other House members from both parties.
Norwood today forwarded a letter with 115 cosponsors to the Chairman and Ranking Members of the House-Senate Conference on pension reform, encouraging the Conference to accept the airline funding rule from the Senate version of the legislation, S. 1783.
Section 403 of the Senate bill, originally introduced by Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA), gives the airline industry additional time to make catch-up contributions to their pension funds, rather than having to default on their plans through bankruptcy. If airlines are forced to default and turn over insolvent plans to the federally funded Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), retirees could lose more than half of their retirement pay.
"By allowing our airline industry a little extra time to get their finances back in order, we will be giving airline industry retirees the greatest possible chance of receiving their entire pension," says Norwood. "This measure has already passed the Senate 97-2, and with this showing of overwhelming bipartisan support in the House, it should be included in the final version of pension reform we pass this year."

Dear Conference Chairmen and Ranking Members:
As you work to craft the pension reform conference report, we want to emphasize that the final product must include the airline funding rule as reflected in the Senate version, S.1783.
In our view, pension reform legislation must include an identical airline funding rule to that which was adopted by the Senate as section 403 of S. 1783. We believe that the Senate language provides a critical tool for carriers in the financially-troubled airline industry to try to preserve their employees' pension plans.
The Senate provision enjoys strong support in both chambers, and we believe that inclusion of section 403 of the Senate bill in the pension reform conference report will help to ensure overwhelming bipartisan support for the conference report when it is brought before the House for final consideration.
Again, we look forward to working with you to complete work on this important legislation and appreciate your leadership on this issue.
Sincerely,
Charlie Norwood
