State to Control Standardized Tests

On Monday, Gov. Deal announced that Georgia is withdrawing its schools from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers test development consortium, citing the high cost of the tests to taxpayers. Instead, the state will work with educators to create standardized tests to match Georgia's current academic standards. Georgia will also seek opportunities to collaborate with other states.
Deal and state School Superintendent Dr. John Barge believe this is the best decision for Georgia's students.
"Assessing our students' academic performance remains a critical need to ensure that young Georgians can compete on equal footing with their peers throughout the country," Deal said. "We will ensure that the state maintains control over our academic standards and student testing. Georgia can create an equally rigorous measurement without high costs associated with this particular test. Just as we do in all other branches of state government, we can create better value for taxpayers while maintaining the same level of quality."
