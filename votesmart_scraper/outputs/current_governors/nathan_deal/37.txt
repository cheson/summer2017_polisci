Georgia is home to a scenic environment that farmers, producers, sportsmen and nature enthusiasts are proud to call their own. Gov. Deal has protected Georgia's environment for both its ecological and economic worth. Our state's natural resources support agriculture, tourism, jobs and businesses alike.
Economic development and future growth in Georgia requires a dependable and sustainable water supply. Gov. Deal is committed to bringing new water supplies online and has allocated more than $250 million since 2011 for strategic investments in water supply projects around the state.
Gov. Deal also directed the Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority to develop and launch the Governor's Water Supply Development Program. This program is mobilizing state resources to assist local governments in developing new sources of water and investing in projects that address state and regional water supply needs. This program is positioning the state to better negotiate with our neighboring states and is helping to secure our economic future.
