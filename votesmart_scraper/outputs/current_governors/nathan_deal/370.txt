Under Governor Deal's leadership, Georgia has become the No. 1 state in the nation for business. By cutting taxes and reducing bureaucratic red tape, he's helped to create 235,000 jobs. As a result of his fiscally conservative leadership, Georgians enjoy one of the lowest tax burdens in the nation.
Governor Deal has overseen three balanced budgets without raising taxes, saved millions of taxpayer dollars by maintaining Georgia's AAA bond rating, and increased our rainy day fund by more than 500%.
In his second term, Governor Deal will continue to keep taxes low, encourage job growth, and promote workforce development initiatives.
