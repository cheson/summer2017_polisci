Gov. Nathan Deal today met with the state's top elected officials to begin the process of determining how the state will move forward on submitting its state House, state Senate and congressional maps for preclearance.
"In a meeting today with Attorney General Sam Olens, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Speaker David Ralston, we began the discussion of how we will move forward on gaining preclearance for the recently passed maps," Deal said. "I have already signed the General Assembly districts into law, and I'm waiting to receive the congressional map. As a group, we will decide whether we will seek preclearance in federal court or through the U.S. Department of Justice. We are in consultation about what will be the most expeditious way to move forward."
