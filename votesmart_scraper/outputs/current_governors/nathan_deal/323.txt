Gov. Nathan Deal today signed into law Senate Bill 276, legislation proclaiming Aug. 7 of every year Purple Heart Day in Georgia to honor men and women wounded or killed while serving in the U.S. Armed Services. All public officials, schools, private organizations and citizens are encouraged to observe the day and actively participate in honoring those wounded or killed during combat.
"It is because of the bravery, dedication and sacrifice of our veterans that we are able to call Georgia home," said Deal. "The service and commitment of these men and women are unparalleled and worthy of praise. This legislation provides us with a platform to express our sincerest gratitude to Georgians who put our safety above their own. For their selflessness, we are forever grateful."
The bill also declares Georgia a Purple Heart State, a designation that further serves to honor our state's wounded veterans for their service and sacrifice.
