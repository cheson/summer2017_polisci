"My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever." Psalm 73:26
On behalf of all Georgians, Sandra and I grieve with the family, friends and Americus Police Department over the loss of Nicholas Ryan Smarr, who was killed yesterday in the line of duty. We ask for God's grace and sustenance for the family of Jody Smith, the Georgia Southwestern State University police officer who remains in critical condition. Our hearts are with Americus and Georgia Southwestern State University. On behalf of the state of Georgia, I pledge the full support of state resources to this heartbroken community as it begins to heal and as we work to ensure that justice is served.
