Press Release

Location: Washington, DC

Gov. Nathan Deal today bolstered child safety efforts by signing a bill to strengthen the state's booster seat law (SB 88), and he enacted legislation that creates an advisory council for state Capitol ceremonies for the Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday (SB 141).
"We must do everything in our power to protect young Georgians, and studies show consistently that booster seats provide children with a much greater level of safety than vehicle seats built for adults," said Deal, who signed the bill at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta's Scottish Rite Hospital. "I have no doubt that this law will save countless lives and prevent serious injuries for many young children."
This bill will bring Georgia in line with the age recommendations of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration by raising the mandatory booster seat age to 8. SB 88 contains exceptions for children taller than 4 feet 9 inches or a child's parent or guardian obtaining a physician's written permission.
At Ebenezer Baptist Church, surrounded by members of the King family, Deal signed SB 141, a bill that promotes the legacy and philosophy of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. by creating the Martin Luther King, Jr. Advisory Council.
"It will be the duty of this council to promote the principles of nonviolence, peace, social justice and the awareness and appreciation of the civil rights movement and the life and work of Martin Luther King, Jr.," Deal said. "Our state is proud to be the home of Dr. King, and Ebenezer Baptist Church, surrounded by Dr. King's family, was the perfect place to start this new council."
The advisory council will also develop and coordinate ceremonies and activities relating to the observance of the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. on behalf of the state of Georgia.
