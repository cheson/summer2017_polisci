ADOPT HEALTH IT ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2006)
Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise President Bush for his State of the Union remarks on health information technology, which he rightly noted will help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors.
I would also like to encourage my colleagues to support health IT legislation that I have introduced, H.R. 4641, the ADOPT HIT Act.
Consider this: I can go to Antarctica and get cash from an ATM without a glitch, but should I fall ill during my travels, a hospital there could not access my medical records or know what medications I am on.
Right now the health care sector is woefully behind in using modern technology to reduce errors and save money, and that is why I introduced H.R. 4641. It provides increased tax breaks for physicians who invest in new health information technology.
As a physician, I know many doctors want to utilize new technology, but they find the cost prohibitive. Doctors will be more likely to adopt this technology if our Tax Code helps offset the substantial initial cost. By adopting the ADOPT HIT Act, by passing that act, we can move one step closer to a health care system that saves time, money and, most importantly, lives.
