Implementing solutions to better protect Georgia's citizens is essential to the success of our state. Deal also implemented criminal justice reforms to keep the most dangerous criminals behind bars while also improving the efficiency of our judicial system.
Deal expanded accountability courts while finding ways to rehabilitate nonviolent offenders that lead to crowded prisons and financial strain. These reforms will make our communities safer, help us rehabilitate nonviolent offenders, and tackle the inflating costs of a system that wasn't working for Georgians.
