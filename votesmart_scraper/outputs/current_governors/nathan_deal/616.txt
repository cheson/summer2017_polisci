Deal Talks American-Made Energy
I believe the U.S. must promptly take steps to provide Americans with an adequate energy supply from resources within our own borders. There is no magic bullet that can single-handedly solve the energy challenges our nation faces in the foreseeable future. However, there are real steps we can take towards becoming less dependent on foreign sources of oil through a variety of solutions.
As a member of the House Committee on Energy & Commerce, I recently took part in the introduction of a package of 15 pieces of energy legislation which will increase the supply of American-Made Energy. These bills address every portion of the energy sector, and are focused on providing real energy solutions to Americans without hurting American jobs or the American economy.
Alternative fuels and methods should be part of a long term solution to the energy challenges we face. However, I remain committed to the belief that a responsible energy plan should not rely solely on the promise of technologies which are not yet commercially viable, nor should it jeopardize our nation's economy.
This legislative package demonstrates the actions we can take today to address our nation's energy challenges by increasing access and use of American-Made Energy.
American-Made Energy means utilizing the over 10.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that the Department of the Interior says is our nation's best single opportunity to increase significantly domestic oil production over the next 40 years. In my time in Congress, I have voted over 13 times in favor of increasing our domestic energy supply through environmentally sound exploration of ANWR.
