Gov. Nathan Deal today signed into law the bill establishing next year's $21.8 billion state budget, which will keep Georgia moving forward in education, public safety, economic development, health care and other key areas.
"Our decisions on what to fund each year carry a great deal of weight," Deal said. "I commend the General Assembly for working with me to produce a balanced budget that reflects the needs of our agencies and the people of this great state."
The final product includes the following key items:
An increase of over half a billion dollars in funding for K-12 education, much of which will be used by local school districts to continue to restore instructional days, eliminate furlough days and raise teachers' salaries
Funding for the continued development of the Georgia Film Academy to ensure the state has the workforce needed to sustain its thriving film industry
An expansion of the number of strategic industries for which the full cost of tuition is covered for Georgia's technical college students -- an effort to help meet demand for available workers
Another $36 million for services for Georgia's children in need, including funding for additional caseworkers and money to implement the Child Welfare Reform Council's recommendations, which promote the safety and effectiveness of caseworkers
Funding for tools needed to make the new "hub and spoke" model for rural hospitals a success, which will help ensure citizens in these rural areas have access to needed care
