Gov. Nathan Deal today signed SB 2 and SB 132, both of which remove barriers to dual enrollment participation and expand opportunities for students.
SB 132, the "Move On When Ready Act," is one of Deal's legislative priorities and is based off recommendations from the 2014 Dual Enrollment Task Force.
"Since taking office, one of my top priorities has been preparing students to enter the workforce with the skills and tools necessary for them to succeed," Deal said. "There are currently jobs that require highly skilled technical workers that remain unfilled. I'm grateful for Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle and the General Assembly for their efforts in addressing this issue. This legislation streamlines current dual enrollment program options, removes transportation and other barriers to participation and streamlines how students earn course credits. Moving forward, I'm confident Georgia will continue training our deep talent pool to fill much-needed positions in a wide range of industries across our state."
SB 2 further aligns Georgia's K-12 education system with the state's post-secondary institutions, allowing high school students to simultaneously earn a high school diploma while working toward a technical college or associate's degree.
"One of the most important challenges facing our state is preparing students to succeed in the 21st century global economy," Cagle said. "I appreciate Governor Deal's support of this initiative as well as the near unanimous endorsement of the Georgia General Assembly. Together, we will continue to build the top workforce and lead our state to prosperity for generations to come."
