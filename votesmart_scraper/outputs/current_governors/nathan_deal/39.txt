Georgia's logistics and infrastructure system enables companies to quickly reach domestic and international markets through interconnected airports, seaports, rail and roads. Companies in the state can reach 80 percent of the U.S. market within a two-day truck haul or a two-hour flight, and the port of Savannah is the largest single container terminal in North America, and the second-busiest U.S. container exporter. To ensure efficiency and that Georgia remains the "gateway to the Southeast," Gov. Deal is dedicated to prioritizing transportation and infrastructure investment.
Since taking office, Deal has invested in new lanes on I-75 north and south of Atlanta, construction on road widenings in South Georgia, and completion of the Jimmy Deloach Parkway Extension near the Port of Savannah. He upheld his campaign promise to remove the tolls on Highway 400 and signed a transportation law in 2015 that will generate almost $1 billion in new transportation funding annually.
Deal is committed to deepening the Port of Savannah in order to remain competitive and serve growing trade needs. In 2015, the federal government allotted $21 million toward the project and classified the deepening as "ongoing construction," a critical step that allows for additional funding. This funding, along with the state's investment of $266 million, will allow the port deepening to move along as scheduled for now. However, in order to see this project through to completion on time, a larger federal share is needed. Deal is committed to working with the Georgia congressional delegation and other stakeholders to ensure its timely completion.
