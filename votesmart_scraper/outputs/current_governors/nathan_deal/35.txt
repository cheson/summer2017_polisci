Georgia is working to meet the health care demands of a growing and geographically diverse population with sustainable, long-term solutions, including:
Fostering a culture of wellness
*Improving the health and wellness of Georgians is essential to promoting our state as a great place to live, work and play. For far too long, the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity and similar health conditions has risen in Georgia. The consequent rise in healthcare costs has adversely affected our productivity, quality of life and our ability to attract jobs to Georgia. This troubling trend must be reversed through a concerted effort to promote healthy lifestyle choices and disease prevention. Childhood obesity is being addressed through Georgia SHAPE, a public-private partnership with partners like the Coca-Cola Co., the Atlanta Falcons Youth Foundation and multiple state agencies.
Strengthening the health care workforce
*Georgia is home to world-class health care institutions and practitioners who are pioneering new advances in medical research and clinical care. However, we face a decreasing number of health care providers as the number of people in need of care continues to rise. To address growing demand on our health care system, we must find innovative ways to attract and retain highly qualified providers to our state. Working with medical, nursing and technical colleges as well as current health care providers and the Departments of Community and Public Health, we will work to make Georgia an ideal place to practice medicine.
