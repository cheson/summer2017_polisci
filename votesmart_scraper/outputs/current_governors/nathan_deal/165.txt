Gov. Nathan Deal today praised the deal struck between Georgia energy firms Southern Company and AGL Resources. Southern Company will acquire AGL Resources and remain in Georgia.
"In Georgia, we've laid the foundations for a strong, successful business climate," said Deal. "Across the state, our commitment to job creation and economic development is evident in the number of companies who've expanded or relocated here. The decision by Southern Company and AGL Resources to remain in Georgia is further proof that our pro-jobs, pro-growth policies have put our state on the right track. Not only does this venture keep two Georgia-based energy companies here, it creates one of the most robust energy companies in the United States. Together, Southern Company and AGL Resources employ nearly 10,000 Georgians and have a major economic impact each year on our state. I look forward to the continued growth of these two companies and am confident that together, we'll keep our state one of the top places in the country for business."
