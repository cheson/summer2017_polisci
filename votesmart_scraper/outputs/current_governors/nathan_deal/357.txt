Gov. Nathan Deal today highlighted the vital role the tourism industry plays in Georgia's economic prosperity at the annual Tourism, Hospitality & Arts Day at the state Capitol. Representatives from the tourism, hospitality and arts industry presented Deal with a check representing the $1.361 billion in state tax revenue generated from tourism-related expenditures in 2012.
"Tourism is a powerful jobs and economic development generator in almost every community in Georgia," said Deal. "With more than $51 billion in economic impact, Georgia's tourism industry provides employment for more than 405,000 Georgians -- 10 percent of the state's payroll workforce."
Deal also unveiled the new 2014 annual Georgia Travel Guide. This full-color, magazine-size guide features one of Georgia's most recognizable icons: "Gone With the Wind." The guide provides visitors with information on Georgia's tourism assets including trip ideas, attractions, accommodations, events and more. 700,000 guides are distributed through the state's 11 Visitor Information Centers, www.ExploreGeorgia.org, travel and trade shows and 1-800-VISIT GA. The Georgia Department of Economic Development partnered with Atlanta Magazine Custom Media, the award-winning publisher of Atlanta Magazine and the newly launched Southbound Magazine, on the state's official travel guide.
"The most memorable and widely recognized American film was written in Atlanta and can still be experienced in Georgia today," said Kevin Langston, deputy commissioner for tourism for the Georgia Department of Economic Development. "Featuring "Gone With the Wind' on the cover during its 75th anniversary year is also an opportunity to highlight the growth and importance of Georgia's entertainment industry, and its deep connection to tourism."
