The state Senate today acted on behalf of present-day and future generations of Georgia students by putting the HOPE scholarship on firm financial footing, said Gov. Nathan Deal. The Enduring HOPE bill passed by a wide margin, 35-20.
"The state Senate today gave a gift to future generations of Georgia's outstanding students by preserving the promise of the HOPE scholarship," said Deal. "I have worked closely with members of the Senate to find common ground on how best to save this important program. Any reforms to the HOPE scholarship require careful consideration because Georgians care deeply about this issue, and we are proud that our HOPE program holds national prominence. Senators understand our choice on lottery-funded programs is not between reform and the status quo; our state's choice is between reform and bankruptcy. Senators have played an important role from Day 1 on negotiating the best plan, and today they courageously did the right thing for our state."
The Senate substitute now returns to the House for final passage.
"We've witnessed tremendous leadership in the House to save HOPE and I trust that members in the House will act quickly to jump this final legislative hurdle," Deal said.
