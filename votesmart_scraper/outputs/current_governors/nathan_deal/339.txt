Gov. Nathan Deal today announced the creation of the Child Welfare Reform Council to improve our child welfare system and better protect Georgia's most vulnerable citizens. Modeled after the successful Criminal Justice Reform Council, this council will complete a comprehensive review of the Division of Family and Children Services and advise the governor on possible executive agency reforms and legislative fixes if necessary.
"After meeting with numerous stakeholders including former foster youth, juvenile court judges, providers and child advocates, it was clear there was a need for a more deliberate reform process of the child welfare system," Deal said. "We have no greater responsibility than caring for our most vulnerable populations. If we do nothing else, we must always do everything in our power to assure that our children are safe and that they get their best shot at a good life. I am confident this council will produce meaningful and thoughtful reform recommendations."
Stephanie Blank, a longtime champion of children and education, will chair the council and will work in conjunction with the Governor's Office and the Department of Human Services. A complete list of council members will be announced in the coming weeks.
