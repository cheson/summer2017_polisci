Governor Deal credits the U.S. Army with helping form the core of who he is today. Georgia has a proud history of military service, and we recognize the sacrifices servicemen and women, and military families make.
We're deeply grateful for our veterans and we value their unique skill-sets. To help them transition back to the civilian workforce, Deal implemented workforce development programs, eliminated bureaucratic obstacles and signed legislation making it easier for veterans to find jobs.
