Today, Gov. Nathan Deal applauded the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down the formula for determining which states and counties must get permission from the federal government before changing their voting procedures.
"The Voting Rights Act was a vital tool in the struggle to ensure that all Americans had access to the ballot box," said Deal. "But determining who needs 'preclearance' by a formula based on the 1964 election defies logic. Over the last half century, Georgia has reformed, and our state is a proud symbol of progress. Today's decision guarantees that Georgia will be treated like every other state -- a right we have earned. Our continued dedication to voting rights in Georgia will verify the wisdom of the court's determination today. The Voting Rights Act, when passed, was a clarion call for human rights and stands as one of the most important laws in our nation's history. In fact, the fact that we no longer need Section 5 testifies to the success of the law much more than its renewal ever could."
