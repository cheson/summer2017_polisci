Gov. Nathan Deal today announced that he will sign an executive order to create an Ebola response team, which will assess current state health and emergency management procedures and produce necessary recommendations to minimize any potential impact of the disease in Georgia.
"Rest assured, Georgia is taking the threat of the Ebola virus seriously," Deal said. "The creation of this team is an additional step in the state's response to this disease and will further our efforts to ensure the safety and quality of life for our citizens. By combining the expertise of the health and research communities with our state agencies, Georgia will be uniquely positioned to combat the risks of Ebola should the need arise. Those that have been chosen to serve on the panel are leaders in their respective fields -- specifically Emory University Hospital, which has remained at the forefront of our nation's response to this infectious disease. We are taking every necessary precaution to alleviate fear within our communities and make certain Georgia stands prepared."
The team will be comprised of representatives from the following: Georgia Emergency Management Agency, Georgia Department of Public Health, Georgia National Guard, Emory University Hospital, University System of Georgia infectious disease experts, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, city of Atlanta and members of the nursing, rural hospital, EMT and education communities. Individuals on the response team will be named in the executive order tomorrow.
The team will convene this week and immediately begin issuing recommendations.
