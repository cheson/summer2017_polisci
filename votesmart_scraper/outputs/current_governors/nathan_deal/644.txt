GEORGIA'S REPUBLICAN DELEGATION CALLS FOR LONG-TERM ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN
Georgia's House Republicans today joined together to oppose spending $150 billion of borrowed money, preferring Congress to instead focus on long term economic growth measures. The measure passed 385-35, with one "present," and now goes to the Senate, where senators have vowed to tack on even more spending.
Georgia's Republican House members, known as the G7, said the following:
Rep. Paul Broun (10th District):
"Frankly, I don't think that sending out a rebate check is going to do enough to stimulate the economy," said Broun. "We've got to shift our focus towards creating jobs. A real stimulus plan has to be geared towards small businesses as they serve as the economic engine of our country. The Â‘Economic Growth Act of 2008,' which I am a cosponsor of, incorporates principles that have historically proven to stimulate the economy and it is a better legislative solution to address the threat of a slowing economy than the proposal that passed the House today."
Rep. Nathan Deal: (9th District)
"I was disappointed in the lack of legislative process this bill took to reach the floor. I felt this legislative package cherry picked which tax payers deserved a tax rebate and which tax payers do not receive a rebate. I support tax relief for all Americans who pay taxes in the form of a tax cut. In addition, the ninth district has more than 100,000 seniors who are on a fixed income and under this bill were not eligible for a tax rebate."
