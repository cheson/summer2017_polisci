Gov. Nathan Deal today announced that the Governor's Office of Student Achievement (GOSA) has released the Georgia Higher Learning and Earnings (GHLE) dashboard and research report. The GHLE dashboard and report provide earnings information for graduates of Georgia's universities and technical colleges who work in the state after earning their degrees.
"By 2020, more than 60 percent of job openings in Georgia will require some form of postsecondary education," said Deal. "To meet this demand, we are providing additional tools to help students seeking higher education make important decisions for their future. I am encouraged by the graduates of Georgia's technical colleges and universities who have chosen to work in the top state for business and are using their skills in Georgia's workforce."
The GHLE dashboard (http://learnearn.gosa.ga.gov) is an interactive site that allows users to explore earnings patterns of graduates for the first and fifth years after graduation. On the site, users can sort information by program of study/major, degree type and Georgia public technical college or college/university attended. The dashboard also provides earnings information for the most popular and highest-earning degrees.
