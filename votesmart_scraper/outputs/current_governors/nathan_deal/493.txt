Gov. Nathan Deal today signed legislation to amend a state law that inadvertently excluded some military-trained nurses from a license to practice in Georgia.
HB 675 revises the definition of "approved nursing education programs" for registered professional nurses and licensed practical nurses. Through the passage and signing of this bill, around 150 nursing professionals will now be eligible for employment in Georgia. The bill passed the General Assembly unanimously.
"With the current shortage of healthcare professionals in our state, this bill will provide more opportunity for highly qualified nurses to practice here," said Deal. "Legislation sometimes has unintended consequences, and no one ever wanted to prevent these professionals from working in Georgia.
"A special commendation goes to Secretary of State Brian Kemp for his dedication to getting these nurses back on the job."
HB 675 was sponsored by Reps. Sharon Cooper, Buddy Harden, Joe Wilkinson, Stacey Abrams, Ben Watson, Margaret Kaiser and Robert Dickey.
Additionally, the following bills pertaining to reapportionment have also been signed.
