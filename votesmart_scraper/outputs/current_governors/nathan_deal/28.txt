Gov.

Deal has also requested individual assistance for the remaining 10 counties under the state of emergency.

"I'm tremendously grateful for the immediate assistance and attention President Trump has given Georgia's requests for federal aid, as well as his concern for our citizens," said Deal. "I'd also like to thank President Trump for sending the acting director of FEMA to view firsthand the horrific effects of this natural disaster. FEMA, along with the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency, is working to expedite financial assessments in the remaining counties impacted by the storms.
"Following my conversations with President Trump and FEMA, I'm confident that public assistance for all 16 counties will be approved expeditiously. This approval is critical to the state as well as local communities."
