Gov. Nathan Deal, joined by House Speaker David Ralston and Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, today issued the call for the 2011 special legislative session. The special session is set to convene Monday, Aug. 15, at 10 a.m. and will include redistricting of the Georgia House and Senate and congressional districts, technical changes to next year's TSPLOST referendum and ratifying the governor's gas tax rate freeze.
"My aim is to sign into law fair maps that comply with the mandates that the federal government sets forth," Deal said. "We will update our state and congressional legislative district maps to reflect the population changes documented in the 2010 Census, and we will honor the sacred principle of "one person, one vote.'
"Working swiftly, as our maps require preclearance from the Department of Justice, we will also work to provide candidates and voters as much time as possible to prepare for the next election cycle and to keep costs down for Georgia taxpayers."
