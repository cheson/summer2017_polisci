ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010 -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2009)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
I rise to comment about language that is in the report that is attached to this legislation. My good friend and colleague from Florida, Mr. Boyd, has asked that a study be done. The study relates to the ongoing dispute about water between the States of Alabama, Florida and Georgia, and I have no real problem with the study being done.
I simply would hope that we could get assurances from the subcommittee chairman that with regard to the scope of that study that it would be broad enough to include all of the issues that are involved and that it would also allow all three States who have an interest in this to have equal participation.
There has been a perception I think that is a wrong perception that my State of Georgia doesn't have a water conservation program in place. In fact, we have had one in place since 2003, and we believe that all of these issues should be encompassed within the study that is set forth in the report to this particular bill.
And we would hope that we could get assurances, not only from the subcommittee chairman but also from Mr. Boyd, that in determining the scope of that study, that all three States would have equal opportunity to participate.
