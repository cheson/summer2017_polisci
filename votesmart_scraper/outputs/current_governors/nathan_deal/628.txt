TOM LANTOS PULMONARY HYPERTENSION RESEARCH AND EDUCATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I had the honor of chairing that hearing that Mrs. Capps just referred to back in 2005 in the Energy and Commerce Committee, Health Subcommittee, in which we had the first hearing on pulmonary hypertension. The Honorable Tom Lantos' granddaughter, Charity, did testify. She was a compelling witness, and I think it is altogether fitting that this legislation be named in honor of her grandfather.
I want to thank Mrs. Capps and Mr. Brady and all the others who have worked so hard on this legislation. As Mr. Brady pointed out, this is an excellent example of citizen advocates who have taken this issue to heart and who have literally pushed this all the way. Without their support, we probably would not have been able to get this legislation to the floor. I commend all those who have had a hand in it.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance my time.
