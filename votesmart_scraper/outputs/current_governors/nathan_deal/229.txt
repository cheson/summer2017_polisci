Gov. Nathan Deal today announced five winners in round five of the Innovation in Teaching Competition, a recognition and reward opportunity for teachers who demonstrate innovative teaching strategies for the Georgia standards in English/Language Arts and Mathematics. Round five focused on rewarding innovative secondary and special education teachers. The competition is available through Georgia's Innovation Fund, a competitive grant program.
"The Innovation in Teaching Competition recognizes and rewards Georgia's most outstanding teachers," said Deal. "Creating an innovative classroom environment depends on the empowerment and support of high-quality instructors, and schools across the state will benefit from the best practices shared by these five deserving winners. To continue building upon the strong legacy of the Innovation in Teaching competition, I encourage education leaders to submit the names of teachers who fit the ideals and criteria of the competition to the Governor's Office of Student Achievement."
Each teacher will receive a $2,000 stipend and each teacher's school will receive a $5,000 grant for implementation of Georgia's instructional standards. In addition, Georgia Public Broadcasting will film the winning educators teaching in their classrooms in winter and spring 2015, as well as interview them about how they prepared the featured units. The videos, along with the educators' supplementary materials, will be made available to other educators, parents, institutions of higher education and other stakeholders. The videos, unit plans and supplementary materials from the first four rounds of winners are currently available on Georgiastandards.org and iTunesU.
