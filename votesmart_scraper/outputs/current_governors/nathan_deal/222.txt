Gov. Nathan Deal today named the individuals who will serve on the Education Reform Commission that he announced during his State of the State address. The commission will study the state's education system, including its funding formula, and provide recommendations intended to improve the system, increase access to early learning programs, recruit and retain high-quality instructors and expand school options for Georgia's families.
"My vision for K-12 education in Georgia is a system driven by student need that provides local school and district leaders with real control and flexibility," said Deal. "With this commission now in place, it is my hope that we will work together to make education more accessible and effective in preparing our state's students for the rigors of college and the workforce. Georgia families depend on our classrooms, and now it's time we take the responsibility in full to provide the high-quality, technologically advanced education they so deserve. I fully anticipate this commission will help bring my vision to reality and I'm grateful for the members' willingness to serve."
The commission will convene throughout the year to comprehensively review the state's education system and QBE funding formula in order to provide recommendations on possible executive, legislative and agency fixes. The recommendations will be sent to Deal by Aug. 1 of this year, with some going into effect as early as the 2016-2017 school year. Chuck Knapp, former president of the University of Georgia, will chair both the commission and the subcommittee on funding reform.
