Every day, our uniformed men and women put their lives on the line for the safety and security of our nation. With the recent Memorial Day, it is important to remember the sacrifices our troops past and present have made in defense of the freedoms we enjoy every day.
Nothing is more important than keeping our armed forces safe when they are in harm's way. And recent technological advances on the battlefield have helped protect our troops and reduce the mortality rate on the battlefield. But in the cases where we cannot prevent service-related injuries to our brave men and women, we must ensure they receive the care they need to recover and live the highest-quality lives possible after their service.
The VA provides veterans with a wide range of health services for their immediate and long-term health care needs, but the first step to accessing treatment is accurately diagnosing each patient. For physical wounds, the diagnosis is sometimes as easy as an x-ray image. But equally as important as the physical wounds is the status of our soldiers' mental health.
In fact, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is the most prevalent mental disorder among returning Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) soldiers. The Military Health System within the Department of Defense recorded 39,356 PTSD diagnoses from 2003 to 2007 and between 2000 and 2009 PTSD was the primary diagnosis for 5,307 hospitalizations and 578,120 outpatient visits.
