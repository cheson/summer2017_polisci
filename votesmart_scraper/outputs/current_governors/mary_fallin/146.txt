Governor Mary Fallin today kicked off her sixth annual Feeding Oklahoma Drive with the goal of raising two million meals to help feed hungry Oklahoma families, children and seniors. The month-long food drive will benefit the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma, the Community Food Bank of Eastern Oklahomaand their partner agencies across the state.
"Oklahomans consistently prove themselves to be the most caring and giving individuals in the nation," Fallin said. "In previous years, all 77 counties came together and donated over two million meals in time for the holiday season. This year, we can do even more to benefit Oklahoma's hungry."
