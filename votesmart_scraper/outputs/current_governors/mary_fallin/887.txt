Fallin Applauds Legislation Pushing Respect for Human Rights, End to Forced Abortions in China

One week before the Olympics begin in Beijing, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation (H. Res. 1370) calling on the Chinese government to "end abuses of human rights" in its country and to guarantee the Olympic Games take place in an atmosphere that honors freedom and human dignity. Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) supported the legislation and applauded the addition of language to the bill that would call on China to abandon its policies of forced abortion and coercive population control. Fallin released the following statement:
"The Olympic Games are a celebration of the human spirit, of freedom and of international good will. It is a sad irony that they are to be held this year in a country that abuses its citizenry, tramples on political freedoms and subjects its people to coercive population control. It is difficult to imagine a greater indignity to human life and human freedom than a one-party state that forces abortion on women and unborn children. I am happy to see my colleagues take a stand on this issue by demanding the Chinese government put an end to this abhorrent practice and embrace the political freedoms guaranteed in the rest of the civilized world."
