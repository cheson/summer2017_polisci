Fallin Introduces Legislation to Help Women's Business Centers
U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, introduced H.R. 2397 today to restore accountability and efficiency to Women's Business Centers receiving federal grants.
Women's Business Centers (WBC's) were developed in 1997 to give underprivileged women a leg up in the business world by offering them entrepreneurial advice and training they would otherwise not have access to. The Small Business Administration (SBA) currently awards grants to WBC's with the understanding that they be run by non-profit organizations in conjunction with institutions of higher learning and eventually become financially self sustaining.
Under the current system, failing or unviable WBC's can be sustained on a semi-permanent basis by federal grant money. These programs are weak links that have failed to become financially self-sustaining. By competing with start-up WBC's for the same money, they are sapping the strength of the entire program by draining money from potentially viable centers.
The legislation introduced by Fallin in the Small Business Committee sets new benchmarks for accountability and ensures that centers receiving funds are meeting performance requirements. It also shifts more funding towards high-need communities with a large proportion of socially and economically disadvantaged women.
"Women's Business Centers provide invaluable assistance and advice to women who would otherwise not be able to get their foot in the door of the business community," Fallin said. "Unfortunately, the way the federal government has been funding these programs is inefficient and dated. This legislation increases the efficiency of these programs and restores accountability to what is otherwise a worthy program."
