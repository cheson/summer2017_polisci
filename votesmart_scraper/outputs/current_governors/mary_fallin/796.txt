Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today used the case of First Lieutenant Michael Behenna to stress the importance of due process in the military justice system. Fallin asked Pentagon officials to reevaluate whether due process had been satisfied. The question came during a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, of which Fallin is a member.
"We need to make sure the Uniform Code of Military Justice is applied fairly in every case and that and men and women in uniform are afforded every opportunity for a fair trial," Fallin stated. "I am grateful for Lieutenant Behenna's service to our nation and will continue to monitor his situation and insist due process is satisfied."
In March, Behenna was convicted of unpremeditated murder while serving in Iraq and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Earlier this week, he was denied a new trial but plans to continue through the appeals process.
