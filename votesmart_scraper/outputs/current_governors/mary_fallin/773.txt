BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. Speaker, if we pass Speaker Pelosi's 1,990-page bill, which creates a massive new Federal bureaucracy to manage our health care system, States will face huge unfunded mandates.
The $34 billion worth of unfunded mandates to the States in this bill might help hide the true cost of this $1.3 trillion legislation, but the truth is the States will be picking up a lot of these costs. And the only way States could deal with the increased costs and the unfunded mandates would be to look at raising taxes on small businesses and on individuals, and that is unacceptable.
Speaker Pelosi may be all right with increasing the national debt and spending up to $1.4 trillion on this legislation, but when the bill comes due, the children of America and their children will be the ones who will be paying a hefty price for reckless spending in this Congress.
It is estimated that this Pelosi health care bill will cost Oklahoma $127 million a year in unfunded mandates. In our State of Oklahoma, we're required to balance our budget each year.
Let's kill this bill because it will be bad for the States and bad for unfunded State mandates.
