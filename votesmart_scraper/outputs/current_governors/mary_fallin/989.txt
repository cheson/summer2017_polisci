Rep. Fallin sworn in as member of 110th Congress
U.S. Representative Mary Fallin (R-OK) was sworn in today as a member of the 110th U.S. Congress. Fallin participated in the ceremonial swearing in of Congress Thursday at the nation's Capitol. She took her oath on the floor of the House of Representatives. Fallin's children, Christina, 19, and Price, 16, watched the ceremony from the House gallery. A group of about 30 friends and family members watched a broadcast of the ceremony from Fallin's new congressional office.
"I'm so glad to have my children and supporters with me on this special day. They played a crucial role in my election," Fallin said. "Now that I've gone through all the formalities, I'm ready to hit the ground running and get to work serving Oklahoma's 5th District in Congress."
U.S. Rep. Fallin's congressional office is located in Longworth House Office Building in Washington. The Oklahoma City district office is set to open Jan. 5 in the First National Center, 120 N. Robinson. Two other district offices will be opened soon in Seminole and Shawnee.
