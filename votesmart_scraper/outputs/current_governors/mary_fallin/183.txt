Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion in Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency, in which the court struck down certain EPA-imposed regulations on power plant emissions:
"As Justice Scalia noted today, the EPA regulations in question would have imposed a $10 billion a year cost for power plants. The EPA issued these edicts with no thought as to the economic consequences of its regulatory scheme, which would have dramatically raised utility rates. Today's decision is a victory for American families and businesses that would have faced skyrocketing costs because of unreasonable rules and regulations."
