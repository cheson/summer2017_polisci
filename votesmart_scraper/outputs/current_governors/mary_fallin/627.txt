Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement regarding the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks:

"The world changed forever 10 years ago when a terrible attack was perpetrated on our nation. On September 11, the horrors of terrorism were brought to our doorstep and we were reminded our freedoms make us a target for the enemies of liberty.

"Oklahoma experienced tragic loss during our own terrorism attack on the Murrah building and those memories were stirred on September 11. Just as our fellow Americans came to help our state after the April 19th attack, hundreds of Oklahoma firefighters, emergency responders, volunteers and military personnel went to provide comfort and support for our friends in New York and Washington. Out of both tragedies, we saw a compassionate spirit and a resiliency in our communities and nation rise up in response.

"As we remember and pray for the victims of September 11 and their families, we should also take time to honor the heroic actions of countless Americans on that day. The heroes of United Flight 93 kept that plane from hitting its intended target. Thousands of firefighters, law enforcement officers and emergency responders rushed to Ground Zero to save lives. And we owe a tremendous thanks to our military men and women who have fought to protect our freedoms and to root out terrorism and extremism across the globe.

"The act of honoring the victims and heroes of September 11 serves as a reminder that freedom and liberty will always prevail over fear and tyranny."
