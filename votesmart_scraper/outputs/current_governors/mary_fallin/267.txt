Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Nov. 24, 2014
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement after the U.S. Department of Education announced it was restoring Oklahoma's waiver to the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) education law for the remainder of this school year. Reinstating the waiver ensures that Oklahoma schools will retain control of up to $30 million in federal funds.
"The Oklahoma State Department of Education and Oklahoma schools should be afforded the maximum amount of flexibility when using federal dollars. Restoring Oklahoma's NCLB waiver is the correct decision and will help us get more money in the classroom."
