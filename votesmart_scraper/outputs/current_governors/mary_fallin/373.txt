Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin this evening issued a stay of execution for one inmate after prison officials said another inmate's veins collapsed during an earlier execution procedure.
"I have asked the Department of Corrections to conduct a full review of Oklahoma's execution procedures to determine what happened and why during this evening's execution of Clayton Derrell Lockett," said Fallin. "I have issued an executive order delaying the execution of Charles Frederick Warner for 14 days to allow for that review to be completed."
Lockett's execution was halted when it appeared the lethal injection administered to him was ineffective. He remained unconscious and passed away in the execution chamber at 7:06 p.m.
Execution officials said Lockett remained unconscious after the lethal injection drugs were administered.
The governor issued an executive order granting a 14-day stay for inmate Warner, who was scheduled to be executed two hours after Lockett's procedure began. Warner's execution is scheduled for May 13.
Lockett was convicted of a 1999 fatal shooting of a woman and Warner was convicted of killing his girlfriend's baby daughter in 1997.
