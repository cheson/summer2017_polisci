Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement regarding a report issued by the Department of Public Safety (DPS) concerning the execution of Clayton Lockett. The report was the result of an independent review, requested by Governor Fallin, of the Lockett execution and the state's execution protocols. It contains suggested updates to Department of Corrections (DOC) execution protocols.
"My thanks go out to Commissioner Michael Thompson and his team for conducting a thorough review of Clayton Lockett's execution. In the coming days and weeks, I expect the Department of Corrections to implement the proposed improvements in protocols to ensure that future executions are performed effectively. In fact, I have been told by DOC Director Robert Patton that his agency has already taken steps to rewrite its execution protocol in a manner that is consistent with these recommendations.
"I continue to believe the death penalty is an appropriate and just punishment for those guilty of the most heinous crimes, as Mr. Lockett certainly was. The state's responsibility is to ensure a sentence of death is carried out in an effective manner. Commissioner Thompson's report and his recommendations for improved DOC protocols will help ensure this high standard is met."
The state's next scheduled execution is set for November 13. Charles Warner, who was convicted of the rape and murder of an 11 month old infant, has been sentenced to die by lethal injection.
