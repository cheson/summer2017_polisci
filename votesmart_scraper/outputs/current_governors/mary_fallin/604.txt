Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement regarding The Boeing Company's decision to close the Boeing Defense, Space and Security facility in Wichita and to transfer engineering operations to Oklahoma City:
"This is a difficult time for Boeing employees who have been impacted by the decision to close the Wichita facility, and my heart goes out to those men and women. However, as with the recent relocation of Boeing staff from California to the Boeing Oklahoma City facility, our state stands ready to welcome all employees and their families who will now call Oklahoma home. Oklahoma City is a wonderful community and a wonderful place to live, work and raise a family. I know Boeing employees will agree."
"My administration has worked very closely with The Boeing Company to ensure that Oklahoma has both a competitive business climate and a high quality of life for any employees that might be located here. It's a tribute to Oklahoma's progress and forward momentum that we have been chosen as a relocation site."
