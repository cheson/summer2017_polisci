Governor Mary Fallin and legislative leaders today thanked thousands of teachers, superintendents and education activists for coming to the Oklahoma Capitol, where they rallied in support of public education.
"Our educators have one of the most difficult and important jobs out there," said Fallin. "I appreciate their service to the state and their commitment to our children. It's great to see so many of them out here today getting involved in education policy."
Senate President Pro Tem Brian Bingman also praised the education community.
"We are very fortunate to have so many talented teachers and administrators," said Bingman. "Our educators have a tremendous impact on the lives of Oklahomans, and we are all better for their efforts. I am grateful to our teachers for all they do to give young Oklahomans the tools they need to succeed in every facet of their lives."
House Speaker Jeffrey Hickman touted the Legislature's support of education.
"The House is dedicated to improving opportunities for Oklahoma students to be successful and has worked for more than a decade to remove unnecessary mandates and improve the classroom learning environment," said Hickman. "The Legislature has increased education funding the past two years despite budget shortfalls, and has supported Oklahoma's commitment to creating rigorous academic standards to ensure graduates are college and career ready. Total education funding in our state is more than half of our annual budget and clearly reflects the priority Oklahoma places on education."
