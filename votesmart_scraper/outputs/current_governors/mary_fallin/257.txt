Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement regarding Martin Luther King Jr. Day on January 19.
"Martin Luther King Jr. had a famous dream: to live in a nation where every person would be judged not by the color of their skin, but the content of their character. Decades later, we have made tremendous progress towards that goal, but there is work yet to be done. I am asking all Oklahomans to join me in celebrating the life of Dr. King, reflecting on his vision, and contemplating what each of us can do to move us closer to making his dream a reality."
