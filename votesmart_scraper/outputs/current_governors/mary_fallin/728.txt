Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Chairman, this Memorial Day, we thank our men and women serving our Nation--our veterans, their families, and those who have given their lives to defend and protect Americans. We honor their sacrifices on behalf of our freedom as a Nation.
My colleagues and I have worked very hard in our Armed Services Committee on the National Defense Authorization Act, which I believe to be an effective and comprehensive blueprint for our Nation's defense both at home and abroad. Most importantly, I believe this bill provides our men and women in uniform with the support and protection they need and deserve both on and off the battlefield.
Every day, these brave men and women put their lives on the line for the safety and security of our Nation, and it is our job to make sure that they receive the quality support and services they need, especially when they return home.
I am very grateful for my amendments to improve the detection and the diagnosis of common combat-related afflictions, like that of ringing in the ears, of posttraumatic stress disorder, and of traumatic brain injury, which are all included in this year's authorization. The sooner we catch these prevalent service-related injuries, the sooner we will simultaneously improve the quality of the lives of our troops and will reduce the costs of health care across the board for them.
So, as this Memorial Day approaches, I hope we all remember our troops--those who are currently serving and those who have served our country to defend our freedoms.
If this bill makes it off the floor as it came out of the committee, which was in one piece, then I will be supporting it. If there are changes that deal with some other issues that this committee has raised in the last few minutes as objectionable, then we will be considering them.
