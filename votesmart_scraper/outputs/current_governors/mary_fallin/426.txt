Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement after the White House revealed that only 346 Oklahomans have selected a health insurance plan through the federal insurance marketplace:
"It is embarrassing that the Obama Administration cannot produce a functional website, especially when so many individuals are relying on that site to purchase health insurance for themselves or their families.
"Virtually everything this White House has told the American people about Obamacare has proven to be false. The president said the law would lower the cost of health insurance, but we know that state employees in Oklahoma are seeing their premiums rise by as much as 12 percent. He said if you liked your health insurance plan you could keep it. We now know for millions of Americans that has proven to be untrue.
"Many of the people who are losing coverage are sick. In Oklahoma, for example, there are over 800 men and women with preexisting health conditions enrolled in the temporary high risk pool. All of them will lose their coverage by the end of the year. If the exchange is not functioning properly by December, they will find themselves uninsured. These are the people who most need our assistance, and yet they are being left high and dry by the incompetence of this administration.
"Everything about the disastrous launch of Healthcare.gov reinforces what many Oklahomans have been saying for years: Obamacare is an unworkable and unaffordable train wreck. It is clear that even some supporters of the law, like former President Bill Clinton, are now reaching that same conclusion."
