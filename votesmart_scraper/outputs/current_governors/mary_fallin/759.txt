Fallin Returns To Washington On Behalf Of Concerned Constituents
Statement
By: Mary Fallin

Location: Washington, DC

Returning to Capitol Hill to reconvene the second session of the 111th Congress, Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today released the following statement:
"Oklahomans are deeply concerned by the agenda liberal Democrats inside the Washington beltway pursued last year. On their behalf, I am committed to protecting our state's families and small businesses by opposing burdensome federal mandates, increased deficit spending and massive tax hikes proposed in Washington.
"I will stand up against Washington Democrats who keep reaching deeper into my constituents' pocketbooks. Our current budget crisis, coupled with looming taxes on energy consumption and unfunded Medicaid coverage mandates on states, will cripple our state's ability run the programs and services on which my constituents rely. Already we have seen reduced funding in our schools, on our roads and in our senior nutrition centers. Oklahoma simply can't afford any more government mandates from Washington."
Fallin said her congressional priorities for 2010 include:
* Supporting pro-growth policies that support rather than hinder businesses and get constituents back to work
* Reducing health care costs;
* Enacting a sensible energy policy that encourages an all-of-the-above development of energy resources, including the production and exploration of Oklahoma's oil and natural gas resources, which creates jobs for 175,000 statewide;
* Reducing the national deficit to avoid saddling our children and grandchildren with a crushing debt burden; and
* Protecting state's rights.
