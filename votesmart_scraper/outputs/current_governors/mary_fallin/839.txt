Fallin Denounces Administration Decision on Embryonic Stem Cell Research

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) released the following statement today opposing the Obama Administration's decision to allow federal funding for embryonic stem cell research:
"Every human being, no matter how small or how early in his or her development, has a right to life. By allowing federal dollars to fund the destruction of human embryos, the Obama Administration is not only denying this essential truth, it is ordering taxpayers to foot the bill for research that many, including myself, find morally repugnant.
"I enthusiastically support adult and cord blood stem cell research, methods which show great promise and do not involve the destruction of human life. It is a tragedy the new administration has further weakened protections of the unborn and ignored the science behind morally acceptable alternatives to embryonic stem cell research."
