Statement

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement addressing American's announcement regarding future business and restructuring plans:
"American's announcement today represents a commitment to continuing a large presence in Oklahoma and, specifically, Tulsa. Their communications with employees and with my office indicate they are working to preserve as many jobs as possible, and that Tulsa will not be left out of American's restructuring plans. All of this is good news.
"Unfortunately, however, the state will necessarily lose some jobs during the restructuring process. Any time men and women in Oklahoma lose their jobs it is difficult for those individuals, their families and their communities. It is also difficult for me. Today is no exception. My heart goes out to those who now face an uncertain future.
"However, many of these employees have unique and valuable skill sets that will help them to continue their careers in aviation and aerospace, either here in Tulsa or at another location in Oklahoma. Furthermore, the city of Tulsa remains -- as it always has been -- a vibrant, prosperous city with a strong economy.
"Moving forward, I am confident that the plans announced by American today outline the best, least painful and most realistic path forward for both the company and the people of Oklahoma. It is important for American and its employees to work together, along with the support of the state of Oklahoma, to make this restructuring process a success."
