Gov. Fallin Issues Order Postponing Execution
Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: April 22, 2014
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued a stay in this evening's scheduled execution of Clayton Derrell Lockett.
Fallin issued the stay in an executive order to clear up possible confusion arising from an earlier stay issued by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which typically has jurisdiction in execution matters, previously denied the stay.
"While I have great respect for the honorable men and women of the Supreme Court, this attempted stay of execution is outside the constitutional authority of that body," said Fallin.
The governor's stay is for seven days, which sets Lockett's execution for April 29.
Fallin is asking the Oklahoma attorney general's office during the next seven days to file appropriate papers with the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals as to how that court would direct her to implement the execution.
The governor's order does not affect next week's scheduled execution of Charles Frederick Warner. Warner's execution is set for April 29.
