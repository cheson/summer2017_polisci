Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement on the anniversary of September 11, 2001.
"Twelve years after 9-11, the United States of America remains the world's greatest beacon of liberty. Rather than allow the most devastating terrorist attack in national history to jeopardize or weaken our principles, we have redoubled our commitments to democratic freedoms and our opposition to tyranny and oppression.
"Today, let us remember and pray for the victims of 9-11 and their families. Let us also give thanks for the first responders, many of whom made the ultimate sacrifice, to save the lives of others. Finally, let's express our gratitude for the men and women of our Armed Services who risk their lives to protect the liberty of others, both here at home and abroad."
