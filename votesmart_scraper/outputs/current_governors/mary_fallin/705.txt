Governor Fallin Issues Statement on Obstructionist Tactics of State Board of Education
Statement

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin issued the following statement today, after learning about obstructionist actions by the State Board of Education at their first meeting with new State Superintendent of Public Instruction Janet Barresi. The Board voted to reject hires of senior staff that Superintendent Barresi had placed on the consent docket, though past precedent routinely has been to have staff working at the department before board approval and often without ever getting board approval. Governor Fallin's statement:
"The public indicated their support of Superintendent Barresi when they elected her to office. She should clearly be able to appoint her own senior staff, especially given that all of her intended hires are well-qualified. My goal as governor, and Janet Barresi's goal as superintendent, is to improve our schools and help our children. I would hope the Board of Education would join us in that mission rather than engage in the kind of obstructionism and cheap political theatrics they pursued today."
