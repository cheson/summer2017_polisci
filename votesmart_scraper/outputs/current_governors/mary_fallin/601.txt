Governor Fallin to President Obama: Approve Keystone Pipeline Now
Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Jan. 10, 2012
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin today sent a letter (attached) to President Barack Obama asking him to immediately approve the development of TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline, a project which would transport oil from Canada to multiple points within the United States including the Gulf of Mexico. Under current law, the president has until February 21 to declare the pipeline "not in the national interest" or it is automatically approved.
The governor's request followed a visit from TransCanada executives to Oklahoma City. Robert Jones, Vice President for Keystone Pipelines at TransCanada, today met with Fallin as well as executives from Oklahoma oil and gas firms including Devon Energy, Continental Resources, MidContinent Oil and Gas Association of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. Jones also spoke with members of the Rotary Club of Oklahoma City and the Oklahoma City Chamber.
In a letter submitted to the White House today, Fallin writes:
 The pipeline represents an enormous and undeniable opportunity for job-creation and economic stimulus at a time when the nation is sorely in need of both. The creation of the pipeline will also help to ensure our nation's future energy needs are met with resources from politically stable regions of the world right here in North America.
 Yet despite the obvious benefits of moving forward, some environmentalists seem bent on delaying or even preventing the construction of this pipeline.
 I enthusiastically recommend that your administration reconsider and embrace the considerable potential for economic stimulus represented by this project and approve it immediately.
