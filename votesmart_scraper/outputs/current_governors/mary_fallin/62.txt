Governor Mary Fallin today announced that her Oklahoma Fosters initiative with the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS), private and faith-based partners has achieved its goal of recruiting more than 1,000 new foster families in Oklahoma.
DHS also reports that the number of children in state custody has dropped below 10,000 for the first time in three years.
This is the first time DHS has reached its foster care recruitment goal since the Pinnacle Plan was launched in 2012 to reform the state's foster care system.
"Oklahomans have again responded to a crucial need in our state," said Fallin. "I'm pleased that so many Oklahomans came together to help us recruit foster and adoptive families so we can improve the lives of these children in state custody. I thank all of those Oklahomans who stepped up to make the commitment to be a foster or adoptive parent."
While Oklahoma has been successful in reaching the Pinnacle Plan's goals on several fronts, foster care recruitment has continued to be a challenge. DHS's official goal for the 2016 fiscal year was 1,054 new foster families. The agency is still validating the final numbers, but preliminary figures show more than 1,070 new families were certified during the year.
"Achieving this goal is a great example of what can happen when Oklahomans from all walks of life -- government, businesses and the faith community -- work together in the best interests of our children," said Fallin. "The goal of the Oklahoma Fosters campaign, simply put, was to bring all those groups together to help recruit more foster families for our children who are in state custody.
"It is rewarding to know that Oklahoma Fosters helped bring awareness to the need for more foster families to love and support these children during their time of need."
