Fallin Applauds WRDA Vote

U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, applauded today the 361-54 vote to override President Bush's veto of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). All five Members of Oklahoma's House Delegation voted to overturn the veto.
Fallin released the following statement:
"In addition to improving the nation's federal flood protection and water infrastructure, the WRDA bill contains several provisions that would specifically help the people of Oklahoma.
"I personally spent a great deal of time and effort insuring that WRDA included language that would end a debt dispute between the City of Edmond and the Corps of Engineers, saving Edmond over $10 million. I also worked to add a provision that would clear the way for the creation of a first-class tourism destination on Lake Texoma, encourage economic development in the region and create new jobs. The bill also provides money for the Tar Creek cleanup and other infrastructure improvements in the state of Oklahoma.
"The bottom line is that WRDA is a good bill for Oklahoma and a good bill for the nation. It has been seven years since Congress has been able to pass a WRDA bill and it is long overdue. I'm pleased that all 5 Members of the Oklahoma delegation chose to rally in support of this legislation and I'm proud to report to my constituents that this bill will soon become law."
