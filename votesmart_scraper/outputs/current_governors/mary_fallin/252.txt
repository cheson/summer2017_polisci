Governor Mary Fallin has ordered all American and Oklahoma flags on state property to be flown at half-staff from 5 p.m. Friday, February 6, until 8 a.m. Monday, February 9, to honor Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Nicholas Dees, who died while on active duty.
The funeral for Trooper Dees is scheduled for noon Saturday at Broken Bow High School. The governor orders flags to be flown at half-staff on the days of funerals for state law officers and military members killed in the line of duty and for current and former state officials.
"Trooper Dees was very proud to be a member of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and he served the state well," said Fallin. "He was known for his professionalism at work and his kindness towards family and friends. He will be sorely missed."
Dees and Trooper Keith Burch were struck by a vehicle Saturday night while investigating an overturned semitrailer on westbound Interstate 40 in Seminole County just east of Shawnee. Dees died at the scene. Burch remains hospitalized in an Oklahoma City hospital.
"I would like to ask all Oklahomans to join our Oklahoma Highway Patrol family in mourning the loss of Trooper Dees and to pray for the quick recovery of Trooper Burch," said Fallin.
