Despite a recent economic downturn, Oklahoma continues to position itself well for business, according to a recent survey compiled by Chief Executive magazine. Its annual Best & Worst States for Business Ranking, which is compiled from surveys of chief executive officers, shows Oklahoma at No. 17, up one from 2016 and up from No. 21 in 2008.
The state received above-average scores when it comes to taxation and regulation (6.82 out of 10); workforce quality (6.63 out of 10) and living environment (6.69 out of 10). Oklahoma's position as a right-to-work state was also mentioned in the findings.
"We are constantly working to promote Oklahoma as a desirable place for business, and to further strengthen our business climate," said Governor Mary Fallin. "States like California, New York and Illinois find themselves among the worst states for business according to CEOs. Issues like high taxes, governmental red tape and increasing regulations are making it hard for businesses to operate in these places. Oklahoma has the opportunity to showcase our strengths and set ourselves apart."
In addition to the rankings, Chief Executive highlighted other specific areas of interest, including Top 10 States for High-Tech. Oklahoma is ranked No. 10 in that category.
