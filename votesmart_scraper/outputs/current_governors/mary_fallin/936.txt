Fallin Accepts Suited for Success "Hand-Up" Award

U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, has been named the winner of the first ever "Hand-Up" award by Suited for Success, an Oklahoma City based charity. The organization, headed by founder Susan Walton, provides professional clothing and career development services to low-income women. The award ceremony will take place at the charity's ten year anniversary celebration this Monday, October 29th, at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum.
"It has been a pleasure to work with Suited for Success over the years, and it is a great honor to receive the first ever Hand-Up Award," said Fallin. "I've been a big fan of theirs for a long time, and I always enjoy the clothing drives we do with them at my offices. It's inspiring to see how many women in Oklahoma really care about helping out those who are less fortunate.

"I'm especially pleased to be receiving the "Hand-Up" Award because I think it refers to a concept that lies at the heart of Suited for Success. Their program gives women a "hand up," not a "hand out." They provide underprivileged women with the tools they need to achieve success for themselves. Ultimately, that's far more valuable a "hand-out" can ever be.
