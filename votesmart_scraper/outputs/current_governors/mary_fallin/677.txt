Press Release

Governor Mary Fallin applauded members of the Senate Education Committee today for their approval of two bills related to education reform.
HB 2139 defines the responsibilities of the State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The second bill, HB 1380, eliminates a legal procedure known as "trial de novo," thereby simplifying the process of dismissing ineffective teachers. Fallin named the elimination of "trial de novo" as a priority in her State of the State address.
Both measures now proceed to the Senate.
"I applaud the Senate Education Committee for working to approve both of these important bills and I encourage the Legislature to get them to my desk as soon as possible. Signing these bills into law will help to increase accountability in our classrooms, ensure the state of Oklahoma employs qualified and effective teachers, and ultimately work to improve the overall quality of our schools," Fallin said.
