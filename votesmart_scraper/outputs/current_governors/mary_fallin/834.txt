Fallin Statement on House GOP Budget
Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) released the following statement in support of the budget unveiled this morning by House Republicans:
"When I talk to people in Oklahoma, they are understandably concerned about our economy and about the job losses we've seen in recent months. They are equally concerned, however, with the direction this Congress and this administration are taking the country. In just three months, we've seen record spending and record deficits that our children and grandchildren will be burdened with for decades to come. President Obama has proposed a budget that taxes too much, borrows too much and spends too much. His plan will expand our government, but not our economy, and it will do so at an enormous cost.
"For all these reasons, Republicans have spent the last several weeks drawing up an alternative budget, one that puts this country back on the road to recovery and fiscal responsibility. Our proposal will curb government spending and debt by preventing the federal budget from growing faster than family budgets. It will stimulate the economy by reinvesting in American energy supplies, both traditional and alternative. It will create jobs by not only lowering taxes, but by introducing a new, simpler tax code. Finally, it will end the spree of bailouts that are burying the United States under a mountain of debt.
"Our budget offers a better, smarter, more affordable plan for economic recovery. Americans will now have a choice: they can embrace the tired "tax and spend" strategy championed by this administration and Democrat leaders in Congress, or they can pursue a new, innovative strategy that relies on American ingenuity and common sense to revive and grow our economy."
