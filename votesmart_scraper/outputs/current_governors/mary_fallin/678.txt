Governor Fallin Issues Statement on Anniversary of Federal Health Care Law Passage
Statement

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin issued the following statement today regarding the one year anniversary of the passage of the federal health care law. While in Congress, Fallin voted against the bill.
She supports the national effort to repeal and replace the law with legislation as well as the legal effort to have the bill struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. Oklahoma is one of the many states that filed a legal challenge to the federal law.
Fallin's statement:
"A year ago today, President Obama signed into law one of the most ill-conceived pieces of legislation to have ever come from Washington, D.C.: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. "ObamaCare,' as it has come to be known, is both an assault on our constitutional liberties and a burden on our already struggling economy.
"In Oklahoma, the law stands to impose approximately $441 million in unfunded mandates on our state government at a time when we are already struggling to balance our budget and pull our economy out of a recession. And unlike the federal government, we can't print money or borrow it from China -- those funds will come directly out of other government programs in Oklahoma.
"I was proud to be one of the 65 percent of Oklahomans who voted for and helped to pass an amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution designed to block the "individual mandate' contained within the federal health care law. As governor, I continue to offer my full support to our attorney general, who is leading our legal challenge against ObamaCare, as well as the national effort to repeal and replace the law."
