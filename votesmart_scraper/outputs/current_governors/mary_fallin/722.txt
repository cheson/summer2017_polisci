Fallin Statement on Supplemental Appropriations Bill
Statement

Location: Washington, DC

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) released the following statement regarding H.R.4899, the Fiscal Year 2010 Supplemental Appropriations bill. Fallin voted against the legislation, which should have been a clean funding bill to support our troops in the fight against terrorism, because it was loaded with an extra $42 billion to fund initiatives ranging from forest restoration to fisheries and collective bargaining rights.
"Speaker Pelosi and her leadership team in Congress have done an extreme disservice to our men and women serving on the battlefield by loading up a national defense funding bill with pet projects and deficit spending. We owe it to the men and women of our armed forces to pass a clean and timely bill to fund their operations overseas.
"Secretary Gates, General Petraeus and our commanders on the ground have stressed the need to pass this troop funding by the Fourth of July. Unfortunately, our troops will not receive this funding by that time because of the political games played with this bill.
"Worse yet, this bill was manipulated to pass a one-year budget allocation that is the highest in U.S. history. This marks the first time since passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 that the House has failed to pass a five-year budget resolution to fully account for its spending and deficits. Funding our troops and our nation's defense should not be subject to political games."
