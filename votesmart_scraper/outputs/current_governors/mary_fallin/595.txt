Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement on the appointment of Terri White to the position of interim director of the Department of Human Services (DHS). The appointment was made by the Oklahoma Commission of Human Services (OCHS). White is currently the commissioner of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS)
"Commissioner White has an outstanding record of service at the Department of Mental Health. Her experience, both in providing services to Oklahomans in need as well as in managing a large agency, will serve her well as the new interim director at DHS. I applaud the Commission for making a swift and bold decision to quickly find an interim director, as well as outgoing Commissioner Howard Hendrick for his support in the matter.
"I am confident that Terri will not only competently manage this period of transition at DHS, but will also pursue improvements in services during that process. No one cares more about Oklahoma's most vulnerable citizens than Terri, and it is comforting to know that DHS has a dedicated public servant and steady hand at the helm while the agency searches for a permanent director."
