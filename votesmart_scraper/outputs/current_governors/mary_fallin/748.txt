Fallin Statement On February Unemployment Data
Press Release
By: Mary Fallin

Location: Washington, DC

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) released the following statement after the Department of Labor announced the national unemployment rate remained at 9.7 percent for the month of February:
"The president's job-killing agenda remains unchanged, just like this month's national unemployment rate. This administration's agenda has spread a toxic virus through the economy, but rather than treat the disease, the president continues to focus only on the symptoms.
"What we need is a comprehensive and long-term vision for growth and innovation. No more federal regulations slipped through the back-door, no more burdensome government mandates on small businesses and no more unfunded mandates on states. The jobs won't return until these threats are taken off the table completely."
