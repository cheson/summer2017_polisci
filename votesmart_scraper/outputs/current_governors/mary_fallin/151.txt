Governor Mary Fallin today announced that the Commissioners of the Land Office (CLO) voted to approve a settlement on the stalled hotel development on former state park land at Lake Texoma.
Fallin, chairman of the CLO, said commissioners during today's monthly meeting voted to settle lawsuits over the development on Lake Texoma in Marshall County in southern Oklahoma. The settlement involves the CLO, the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation and Pointe Vista Development, LLC, of Oklahoma City.
"This settlement provides a clean and realistic development plan for Lake Texoma and ensures local communities and the state of Oklahoma can benefit from this great natural resource," said Fallin. "This is a victory for the Texoma community, which has been waiting for years for an agreement and a path forward."
