Fallin Cosponsors Veterans Debt Relief Bill

Oklahoma Congresswoman Mary Fallin announced today her support and cosponsorship of H.R. 5148, the Combat Veterans Debt Elimination Act of 2008. The bill corrects a provision in current law forcing the Veterans Administration to collect on the college loan debts of military men and women who have been killed in action.
Under current law, if a service member dies in combat and has received a loan under the Montgomery GI bill, then his surviving family members are obligated to pay back that loan. H.R. 5148 would permanently end that obligation.
Fallin released the following statement:
"When the grieving family of a fallen soldier is placed into debt by the federal government, we should call it what it is: a grave miscarriage of justice. The Combat Veterans Debt Elimination Act will correct this injustice and ensure that our soldiers can enjoy the benefits of the GI Bill without fearing their families will one day be forced to bear the burden of their debt."
