Past and present Marines gathered to hear Gov. Mary Fallin, Governor of Oklahoma, proclaim November as Marine Month in the Blue Room at the Oklahoma State Capitol building here, Nov. 9.
Fallin made the proclamation in honor of the Marine Corps birthday, Nov. 10, 1775, and in honor of the men and women of Oklahoma who have proudly bore the title.
"The Marine Corps has served our nation since its founding during both good times and times of war," she said. "The people of Oklahoma are very appreciative of what you do for our nation and the state of Oklahoma."
During the proclamation ceremony Fallin also participated in the traditional cutting of a Marine Corps birthday cake as the guest of honor, along with Maj. Richard Robinson, III, commanding officer, Recruiting Station Oklahoma City.
"It was a great honor for the governor and the people of Oklahoma to acknowledge us this way," Robinson said. "We appreciate them celebrating with us today."
