Fallin Questions Gates' Defense Cuts
Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said today she is "deeply troubled" by a sweeping series of cuts in the defense budget proposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and the Obama administration.
"I am deeply troubled by this approach, which more resembles an ax than a scalpel," Fallin said. "It is ironic that these proposed cuts in our national defense were announced in the same week that North Korea launched a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to American soil. It is especially troubling that Secretary Gates has suggested stopping production of the state-of-the-art F-22 fighter and the new Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) cannon that was to be produced in Oklahoma."
Fallin said she supports the concept of expanding America's special operations and counterinsurgency capabilities, as proposed by Gates, but not at the expense of vital weapons systems that could be needed to meet a larger threat.
"Like it or not, we live in an unsafe world where both al Quaeda madmen and aggressive nations like North Korea and Iran would love to be able to reach us with even more fearsome weapons," she said. "We cannot afford to reduce our ability to respond to one threat while we enhance capabilities in other areas. The Department of Defense is charged with defending our nation from all potential adversaries."
Fallin said she would fight to retain needed weapons systems targeted by Gates' announcement and support proposals to increase unconventional warfare capabilities.
"I wish we could pick and choose the threat, but we can't," she said. "Our job in Congress is to make sure the nation is safe, period, and that is what I will continue to do."
