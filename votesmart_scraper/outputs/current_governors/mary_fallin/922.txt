Fallin Cosponsors Border Fence Bill

Oklahoma Congresswoman Mary Fallin announced today her support and cosponsorship of H.R. 4987, the Fence by Date Certain Act. The bill requires over 700 miles of double layered fence to be built along border locations in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. It also ensures that sufficient funds are required for the fence and mandates its completion by June 30, 2009.
Fallin's support of the bill was announced shortly after she cosigned a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, outlining her concern over the slow pace of border fence construction (text of letter attached). Fallin released the following statement:
"The endless flow of illegal immigrants across our southern border is a threat to our national security, our economy and our culture. The American people understand this, even if our leaders in Congress do not.
"Every year voters in Oklahoma and all across the country ask the government to secure our borders, and every year they are let down by a federal bureaucracy that seems unwilling to act. The solution to illegal immigration is complex, but the need for physical barriers is clear.
"The Fence by Date Certain Act will prohibit the kind of legislative tricks and bureaucratic foot dragging that we have seen in the past. By June 30, 2009, a fence should be in place along our southern border. "
