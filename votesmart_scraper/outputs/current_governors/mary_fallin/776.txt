Mr. Speaker, one of the groups which is suffering under the tough economic times is seniors.
Some are still working to earn enough money just to make ends meet. Some are on fixed incomes, and every slight increase in expenses can cause them to experience difficult times.
That's why I'm very concerned about the Democrats' health care proposal to make massive cuts to Medicare Advantage plans, which would take benefits away from our senior citizens, even though President Obama has promised Americans that, if they like their health care plans, they can keep them.
The Democrats' plan to cut Medicare Advantage will limit choices; it will cause seniors to lose their coverage; it will increase prescription drug premiums by as much as 20 percent. It will even have an exceptionally harmful impact on seniors in rural areas when we try to force them into a one-size-fits-all government plan.
I will not support a health care plan that cuts benefits for millions of our seniors, who have worked their entire lives paying into this system. We can't ask our seniors on fixed incomes to pay higher costs, and we can't force seniors off of their health care plans they choose.
As a Republican, I am for health care reform, but it's wrong to finance health care reform on the backs of our seniors.
