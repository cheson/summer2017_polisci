Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) has signed an amicus brief in support of the legal case filed by the state of Virginia against the recently-enacted federal takeover of health care. "I believe forcing American families and businesses to buy government-approved health care coverage is unconstitutional," said Fallin.
"I am doing everything in my power to protect Oklahoma's families and businesses from federal intrusions into their private lives and decisions," Fallin said. "Mandate after mandate, the rights of private citizens and state governments are being eroded. We need to challenge these unconstitutional infringements to protect ourselves against an aggressively expanding federal government."
"I am standing with Virginia's lawsuit because Oklahoma's families and small businesses cannot afford the cost of this health care bill, which is expected to increase premiums by an average of $2,100 per family and will raise taxes across the board by a total of $569.2 billion," Fallin said.
The amicus brief, which was filed on Monday by the American Center for Law and Justice and signed by 26 Congressional Republicans, asserts that Congress has neither the Constitutional authority to require individuals to purchase health insurance nor the authority to penalize individuals who do not.
