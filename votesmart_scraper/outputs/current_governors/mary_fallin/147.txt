Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Sept. 30, 2015
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin has issued a 37 day stay of Richard Glossip's execution to address legal questions raised today about Oklahoma's execution protocols. The stay will give the Department of Corrections and its attorneys the opportunity to determine whether potassium acetate is compliant with the state's court-approved execution procedures.

"Last minute questions were raised today about Oklahoma's execution protocol and the chemicals used for lethal injection," said Fallin. "After consulting with the attorney general and the Department of Corrections, I have issued a 37 day stay of execution while the state addresses those questions and ensures it is complying fully with the protocols approved by federal courts."

"My sincerest sympathies go out to the Van Treese family, who has waited so long to see justice done," said Fallin.
