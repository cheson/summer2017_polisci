Statement

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) released the following statement regarding the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas:

"In the wake of a series of deadly terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas, Israel is now exercising its right to defend itself. As long as Hamas continues to fire rockets and mortars into Israel, targeting civilians and seeking to sow general terror and chaos, they are acting as an aggressor. Hamas started this conflict, and they can end it, by ceasing its attacks on the Israeli people. Until they do so, the Israeli government has every right to respond militarily to a terrorist threat."
