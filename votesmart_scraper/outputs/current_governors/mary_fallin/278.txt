Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin and Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby today announced that the state and the tribe have signed a compact to offer "Chickasaw Nation" license plates to Chickasaw citizens.
Anoatubby said that many Chickasaw citizens have requested license plates which recognize their tribal citizenship.
"We are very pleased to work with the state to offer Chickasaw Nation license plates," said Anoatubby. "These tags offer Chickasaw citizens a very visible way to demonstrate their pride in being Chickasaw, while keeping vehicle tag funding for schools, roads, state employee retirement, wildlife conservation and other state programs intact."
Fallin said the compact is another example of the state of Oklahoma working together with the Chickasaw Nation on a project which benefits both the tribe and the state.
"The Chickasaw Nation and the state of Oklahoma are partners on issues as diverse as health care, transportation and education," said Fallin. "This is another example of our successful working partnership. We are pleased to be able to now offer Chickasaw license plates for tribal citizens to showcase their proud heritage."
Under the compact, Chickasaw tags will be sold exclusively at state-licensed tag agencies across Oklahoma. Chickasaws who want to purchase the tags will present their Chickasaw Nation citizenship card and pay the same fees and taxes any other Oklahoman would pay.
After the transaction, the Chickasaw Nation will issue a rebate for a portion of the fees and taxes to each citizen purchasing a tag.
The Chickasaw Nation has designed the tag and is now working with the Oklahoma Tax Commission to finalize plans for its manufacture.
