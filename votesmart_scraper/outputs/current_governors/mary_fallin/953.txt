Fallin and Other Republicans Reject Senate Immigration Proposal
U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma, supported a resolution passed by the House Republican Conference today, expressing strong disapproval of the Senate's proposed immigration plan. House Republicans have been largely critical of the Senate plan for failing to take the proper steps to end illegal immigration.
"We need real immigration reform, not a blanket amnesty," Fallin said. "That means beefing up border security and interior enforcement, providing an employee verification system, and getting tough on those who knowingly hire illegals."
"By passing this resolution, House Republicans are sending a clear signal to the Senate and to the American people: the first step towards substantive immigration reform is securing our borders."
