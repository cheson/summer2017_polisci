Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today said long-term economic stabilization is essential, not an option. Participating in a Small Business Full Committee hearing on the "Impact of Financial Regulatory Reform on Small Business," Fallin questioned whether the creation of a super-regulator, as President Obama has proposed, would achieve this goal.
"The proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency will result in reduced credit availability, which means less choice for consumers. Instead of reevaluating the structure of our current regulatory regime over the financial system, this Administration has yet again chosen to expand the size and scope of the federal government," Fallin said.
The Obama Administration has proposed creating a new regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, to assess and manage the risk and solvency of the nation's financial system. "I have met with several financial experts from Oklahoma, all of whom agree this super-regulator will hurt consumers and businesses alike. I am especially concerned about the impact this regulator would have on our state's small businesses and their ability to grow and create new jobs."
Fallin said financial reform must focus on the Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs), namely Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose reckless lending practices on the taxpayer's dime played a large role in last year's meltdown. "We must also encourage market discipline and put an end to the Â‘too big to fail' motto that got us into this mess and subjected taxpayers to the consequences of Wall Street's irresponsibility."
"It's our job to enact meaningful reform to our financial system and ensure economic stability for our children and grandchildren. But we need to make sure the reforms we pursue do not shut out small business owners and their business prospects by limiting credit and imposing unrealistic federal regulations."
