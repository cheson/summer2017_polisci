THE EXPIRATION OF THE PROTECT AMERICA ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 10, 2008)
(Ms. FALLIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. FALLIN. Madam Speaker, it has been well over 20 days since the Protect America Act expired. For 3 weeks and counting, this Congress has allowed the quality of our surveillance programs to erode. As a result, our intelligence agencies have lost critical tools in the war on terror and are left potentially blind to lethal terrorist plots. In light of these dangers, Democrat leaders are facing a chorus of Members demanding action on the bipartisan Senate-passed surveillance bill.
Madam Speaker, it is time that we bring this bill to the floor. The Democrat chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has said that passing this legislation is the right way to go in terms of the security of our Nation. In the House, over 20 Democrats have publicly urged Speaker Pelosi to bring the bill up for a vote. In fact, it seems that the Democrat leadership will not bring this bill up precisely because they know it will pass.
Madam Speaker, enough is enough. We have floated temporary patches and Band-Aids for months. It is time to get serious about our national security. It is time to bring a permanent fix to FISA and to a vote on this floor.
