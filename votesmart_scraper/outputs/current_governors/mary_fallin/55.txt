Gov. Fallin, State Agencies Reveal New License Plate Design
Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Aug. 22, 2016
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today led an interagency coalition in unveiling the design for Oklahoma's new state license plate, titled "Explore Oklahoma." The new plate depicts Oklahoma's state bird, a scissor-tailed flycatcher, soaring over lakes, mountains and mesas, highlighting Oklahoma's diverse ecology and natural beauty.
The new plates will prominently display the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation's website, TravelOK.com, and feature two distinct, more visible boxes for registration decals (displaying month and year separately). They will be printed on prismatic sheeting, enhancing their visibility at night.
Drivers will receive their new license plates beginning in January 2017.
"The new design will act as a travelling billboard for those looking to experience and explore our beautiful state," said Fallin. "Just as important, the new plates are more clearly visible at night and will aid our law enforcement officers as they work to keep us safe."
Oklahoma's previous plates -- which were more than seven years old -- were past warranty and beginning to deteriorate, dulling the reflective sheeting on them and making them more difficult to see at night.
The Oklahoma Safety Council and the Oklahoma City Fraternal Order of Police had spoken out during this year's legislative session about the importance of more visible license plates, which are used by law enforcement officers to locate suspected felons and respond to Amber and Silver Alerts. Many states issue new license plates every five years for those reasons. (Read: "FOP: Aging license plates putting police in danger;" "Safety advocate: Oklahoma could use new license plates")
