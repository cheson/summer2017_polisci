Issue Position: Life Issues
I believe that one of my roles in Congress is to help preserve a culture of life. That starts with protecting the lives of the unborn and by fighting to eliminate the tragedy of abortion.
I am also opposed to destroying the life of a human embryo for scientific purposes. For that reason, I do not support the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research, which relies on such a process. In addition to destroying human embryos, embryonic stem cell research has not been proven effective. As of January, 2007, it had not produced a cure for a single human ailment.
The good news is that there are types of stem cell research that do not involve the destruction of human life. Amniotic stem cell research, for instance, relies on blood from a woman's umbilical cord. And unlike embryonic stem cell research, amniotic research has proven highly successful, and has lead to cures for over 70 human diseases. I support adult stem cell research, which does not rely on the destruction of human embryos, and look forward to working with members of congress to finding ways of maximizing its potential.
