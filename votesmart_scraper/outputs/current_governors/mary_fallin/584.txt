Governor Mary Fallin today applauded the board of the Oklahoma Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust (TSET) for approving funds to create a fitness center at the state Capitol. Board members approved a $38,500 proposal submitted by the governor, which includes a $20,000 contribution from the Oklahoma Hospital Association. The funds will largely be used for exercise equipment.
Fallin had proposed creating a Capitol Fitness Center in her annual State of the State address.
"Obesity is one of the major drags on the state's health indicators, and we're trying to lead by example at the Capitol by working out and improving our physical fitness," Fallin said. "My thanks go out to the board members of TSET as well as the Oklahoma Hospital Association for their support of this effort."
In her State of the State address, Fallin addressed Oklahoma's poor health indicators, saying that "Â… healthy living is important, not just because we want Oklahomans to live full and happy lives, but because the effects of unhealthy life choices hurt our economy, drain taxpayer dollars and drive up the cost of health care for everyone."
To address poor health indicators, Fallin proposed creating a Capitol Fitness Center, signed an executive order prohibiting tobacco use on property owned by the state, and announced support of initiatives aimed at reducing infant mortality and increasing access to health care in rural and underserved areas.
