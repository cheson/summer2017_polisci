Hunger does not discriminate against race or gender. Hunger envelopes families and entire communities, and in Oklahoma it affects 675,000 people.
The statistics are distressing: one in six Oklahomans wake up each morning not knowing where their next meal may come from; one in four Oklahoma children are at risk of going hungry daily.
Oklahoma consistently ranks in the top 10 hungriest states in the nation. In May, our state was devastated by the tornadoes, further increasing the number of families who are food-insecure in Oklahoma. Oklahoma food banks provide enough food for more than 150,000 people each week, and that demand increases during the holidays.
As the holiday season approaches and all of its wonderful meals are being planned, we must remember our neighbors and lend a helping hand. We recently kicked off the fourth annual Feeding Oklahoma Food Drive, and have set a goal of collecting 1.4 million meals to feed hungry Oklahomans. We can reach this lofty goal if every able Oklahoman joins us in the fight against hunger by donating time and resources.
By taking healthy, non-perishable food, like canned meat or vegetables, to the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City, the Community Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma in Tulsa, or any of the statewide drop off locations including - BancFirst, Bob Moore dealerships, metro area Love's Travel Stops and select AT&T stores--you can be a vital part in feeding Oklahoma's hungry.
