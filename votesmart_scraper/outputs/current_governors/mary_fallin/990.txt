Issue Position: Second Amendment Rights
I grew up in Tecumseh, where hunting and other outdoor sports were part of life. The Second Amendment to our Constitution means exactly what it says, and I will defend the right of every law-abiding citizen to own guns.
As Lieutenant Governor, I have sponsored an annual turkey hunt to promote economic development. I also promote a yearly gun safety program in conjunction with the National Shooting Sports Federation. Responsible gun ownership is a basic right, and I will never vote for legislation that abridges that right. I am also a member in good standing with the National Rifle Association.
