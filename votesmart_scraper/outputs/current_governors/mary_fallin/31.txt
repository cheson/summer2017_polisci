Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement after the state House of Representatives passed House Bill (HB) 1845, which would bring Oklahoma into compliance with the federal Real ID Act:
"I'm pleased to see the House of Representatives taking action on this measure so early in the legislative session. This measure addresses the necessary steps to meet all the requirements of the REAL ID Act. I look forward to similar quick action in the Senate. We cannot burden Oklahomans with the additional cost and hassle of providing identification to gain entrance to federal buildings, military bases or federal courthouses. Failure to approve this measure also will force those with just Oklahoma driver's licenses to have additional identification in order to board a commercial airliner beginning in January."
HB 1845 passed, 78-18, and now goes to the Senate for consideration.
