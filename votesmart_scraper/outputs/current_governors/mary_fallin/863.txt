NewsOK - Cracking the Glass Ceiling
Washington, DC -- Arguably, Congresswoman Mary Fallin has become one of the most popular faces in Oklahoma politics. She was the first woman and the first Republican to become Lt. Governor of Oklahoma and the first woman to be elected to Congress since 1920.
Perhaps it's her genuine likeability, or her dogged support of the business community in Oklahoma. Or, maybe is that people admire a woman who has the guts to take control of the state senate - twice - no matter what the opposing party says about her.
Whatever it is, Fallin has won Oklahoma's loyalty and proved her mettle more than once.
Below, Fallin talks about her family, her goals and being a woman in politics today.

How did you get into politics?
My first introduction into politics was in high school when I served as a page in the state legislature. So I guess I have been in politics in one form or another for most of my life. My parents both served as Mayor of my home town of Tecumseh so I was exposed at an early age. As a young woman, I was active in the Republican Party and volunteered in various campaigns. In 1989 I decided to run for State Representative. It was an interesting campaign - I gave birth to my son Price in between the primary and the general election. Needless to say, knocking on doors while 8 months pregnant was a challenging experience. It was a rewarding one, however, and I was able to do it because I was passionate about state politics and passionate about making a positive change in our state

What are the greatest issues facing Oklahoma today?
Oklahoma has some of the same challenges the rest of the nation faces in regards to the current economic crisis but our story is also quite unique. The energy industry has helped protect us to a certain extent from some of the economic volatility hitting other parts of the nation.
That certainly doesn't mean we are immune from the ups and downs in the global economy. In the early 1980s we saw what happened to Oklahoma's economy when the bottom fell out of the energy industry. Since that time we have diversified our economy so that we are not as reliant as we used to be on one or two key industries for survival.
However, I think moving forward, one of our biggest challenges is to further economic diversification and creating an environment that promotes the recruitment of more business.
Lawsuit and worker's comp reform have to be at the top of any list in terms of policy challenges.
We also have infrastructure issues that need to be addressed to improve the quality of life for Oklahomans and also make us more attractive to business site selectors. Water, highways, rail and aviation are major challenges moving forward.

What are your goals for this term in Congress?
Improving our national economy and protecting jobs will be my first priority. Energy policy should also be at the top of our "to do" list. Currently, we do not have a coherent strategy to wean this country off foreign oil and fight rising gas prices. This is both a threat to our economy and a strategic threat to our national security. It simply is not safe to rely on foreign nations, some of them openly anti-American, for our energy resources. We can break this addiction by investing in our energy resources at home, including both traditional fossil fuels like oil and natural gas and clean renewables like solar, nuclear and wind power.
The economy will continue to be a major issue and we will have some very difficult decisions moving forward on how best to stabilize it and what role the government should or shouldn't play in those efforts.
We also need to develop both a workable immigration policy and an effective way of using markets to drive down healthcare costs for working families.
What kind of impact does being a congresswoman have on your family life?
Like all working parents, balancing between career and family can be challenging. We make it work though, and my two children, Christina and Price, are both very supportive of what I do. My children have had many wonderful opportunities to learn so much about our nation and have had experiences that will create memories that will last a life time.
As the only woman in the Oklahoma congressional delegation, how do you navigate Washington politics and a "good Â‘ol boy" perception?
Now is a great time to be a woman in Congress. We have more women in high profile political positions than any other time in our nation's history, including a female Speaker of the House, a female Secretary of State, a viable female candidate for President this year and of course Governor Sarah Palin as a strong Vice Presidential candidate. In Oklahoma, I was the first female Lieutenant Governor and the first Congresswoman our state sent to Washington since the 1920s. The good ol' boys are out there, but the glass ceiling for women in politics is breaking.
My advice to any woman with an interest in running for office: Go for it! If your heart's in the right place, there is nothing holding you down.

What has been the most significant thing you have experienced since being elected to Congress?
I was privileged to be asked by Republican leadership in the House to take a high profile position in the recent energy debate. It is an issue that is critical to our nation and certainly critical to Oklahoma. Few other issues have such a long term impact on the economic well-being of America then how we craft energy policy in the coming months.
In terms of foreign policy, the most significant event I experienced was the debate over Iraq in the aftermath of the '06 election. Democrats had just taken control of Congress and there was serious talk about their leadership refusing to fund the war in Iraq. Having been to that country and seen the great work that our troops are doing, I can say that nothing would be more damaging and more demoralizing to our men and women in the armed forces than to yank the rug out from under them by defunding their operations. At the end of the day, enough Democrats agreed with that sentiment that we were able to fully fund our operations there and make way for "the surge," a new strategy that proved greatly successful.

Was there ever a turning point in your life where you thought you might not go on to serve in government?
I have had moments in Washington where "the process" is discouraging. Like most Americans, I get tired of the partisanship and the pettiness that plagues DC politics. With that said, I have always enjoyed being a public servant. It is an honor to serve the Fifth District of Oklahoma and to work on behalf of so many people that I know and love. I have never questioned that.
