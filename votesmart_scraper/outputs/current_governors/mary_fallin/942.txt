Fallin Applauds Boeing Contract
U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, applauded news of the 10-year, $1.1 billion U.S. Air Force contract awarded this week to The Boeing Company. The contract means continued work for Oklahomans providing programmed depot maintenance for the nation's KC-135 Stratotanker fleet.
"This is wonderful news for many reasons," Fallin remarked. "As a member of the House Subcommittee on Aviation, I'm proud to represent many of the employees of Boeing, Tinker Air Force Base, and The Tinker Business and Industrial Park."
"More importantly, it means better job security for the workers, increased economic impact for an already growing area of our state, and a brighter future for Oklahoma's role in the aviation and even aerospace industry."
Tomorrow, September 13, 2007, Congresswoman Fallin is scheduled to address a gathering of defense contractors, Tinker Air Force Base, and community leaders at the already-expanding Tinker Business and Industrial Park in Midwest City.
"The Boeing contract announcement affords me the opportunity tomorrow to personally congratulate, not only representatives of Boeing, but to also lift up all of the fine citizens who work so hard to support our nation's military leaders, and the men and women in uniform who serve us all so well."
