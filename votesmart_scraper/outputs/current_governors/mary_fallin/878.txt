Congresswoman Mary Fallin's Comments on VP Nominee Gov. Sarah Palin's Speech
Campaign Release
Congresswoman Mary Fallin's comments on VP Nominee Gov. Sarah Palin's Speech:
" Governor Palin is a strong leader, a principled conservative, and a loving mother. Her speech tonight reminded us all why she has quickly become one of the most popular and successful governors in the nation. Whether it's taking on the special interests, fighting wasteful spending or standing up for the rights of the unborn, Sarah Palin has showed judgment, leadership and political courage. Senator McCain made a great choice in his running mate, and I am proud to offer both him and Governor Palin my support."
