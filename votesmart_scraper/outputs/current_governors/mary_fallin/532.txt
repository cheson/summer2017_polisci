Gov. Mary Fallin commented today on the latest figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) that showed Oklahoma's unemployment rate has dropped yet again. For June, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent, 0.1 percentage points lower than May and 1.4 percentage points lower than June 2011. Nationally, the unemployment rate is 8.2 percent.
Jobless rates were lower in 11 states (including Oklahoma), higher in 27 states, while 12 states saw no change, according to the BLS. Click here for more information from the BLS.
"Oklahoma's low unemployment rate continues to outpace the national unemployment rate and is proof our pro-business policies are succeeding in creating a positive business environment for job creation and investment," Fallin said. "Moving forward, we must maintain our commitment to policies such as "right sizing' government, education reform, workforce development and tax reform that will allow us to continue our economic growth."
Additionally, Oklahoma's labor force grew by nearly 3,000 in June and is up more than 30,000 from the same period last year, according to the Oklahoma Commerce Department. For the 12-month period ending in June, Oklahoma ranked third in the nation in job growth.
