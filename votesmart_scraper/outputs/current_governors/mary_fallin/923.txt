Fallin Praises Pro-Life March in Washington

Oklahoma Congresswoman Mary Fallin issued the following statement in honor of those taking part in today's March for Life in Washington. The pro-life demonstration comes on the same day as the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.
"Today's March for Life stands for the simple truth that every life is sacred. It also serves as a sad reminder that our laws do not reflect this truth. Thirty-five years after Roe v. Wade, it is a tragedy that we remain a nation where the Supreme Court has stripped the unborn of the basic human right to Life.
"I'd like to thank the men, women and children who are out there today supporting the pro-life movement and the rights of the unborn. Their dedication is inspiring, and I will do everything in my power to further their worthy cause."
