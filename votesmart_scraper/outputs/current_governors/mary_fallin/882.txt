From the Oklahoman: Fallin to get her 'biggest audience'

U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin will be a prime-time player during next week's Republican National Convention. The freshman congresswoman is scheduled to speak Sept. 4, the final night of the convention, about an hour before presidential nominee-in-waiting John McCain makes his acceptance speech.
"It's a tremendous honor to be able to speak in the hour leading up to Senator McCain's acceptance speech and especially to be able to represent the state of Oklahoma during prime-time television," said Fallin, R-Oklahoma City. "It will be my biggest audience ever."
The theme for the final night of the convention, which will be held in St. Paul, Minn., is "Peace and the Need to Defend America."
"They have asked me to address issues related to terrorism, with some discussion of how Oklahoma responded so well to the bombing in 1995," said Fallin, who was then Oklahoma's lieutenant governor. "It's an opportunity to tell our story to the nation and to remind viewers that the Oklahoma standard we displayed 13 years ago is really an American standard of helping others and standing together in difficult times."
Oklahoma Republican Chairman Gary Jones said speaking on one of the most-watched nights of the GOP convention will put her in the national spotlight.
