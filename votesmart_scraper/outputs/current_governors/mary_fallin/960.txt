Fallin and Other Members Unveil Tax Increase Prevention Act
U.S. Congresswoman Mary Fallin joined several Members of Congress today in unveiling the Tax Increase Prevention Act. The bill, sponsored by Congressman Tim Walberg, R-Michigan, would make the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 permanent.
"Our nation, our economy and our families have benefited from the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts," said Fallin. "Today we are introducing legislation that will ensure that they continue to benefit."
"The American Tax Increase Prevention act will protect the child tax credit and permanently end the death tax and the marriage penalty. By coming out here today, we are fighting for the many families that would be hurt by a tax increase."
