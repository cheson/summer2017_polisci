Fallin pledges federal support to see state through disaster
Rep. Mary Fallin is working with Governor Brad Henry and federal agencies to make sure Oklahomans get the disaster aid they need in a timely manner to recover from the ice storm that swept through the state during the weekend. President George W. Bush approved the governor's request for an emergency disaster declaration for all 77 counties Sunday.
"I spoke with Governor Henry Sunday night and want to commend him and his staff for their quick response to this situation." Fallin said. "As a former member of the state's executive branch, I fully understand how important it is to receive federal aid during and after a disaster. I will be offering my full support on the federal level to make sure Oklahomans get what they need to recover from this winter storm."
The emergency disaster declaration provides direct federal assistance for costs associated with debris removal and emergency protective measures, such as overtime pay for first responders. Federal resources including generators for public facilities and bottled water for shelters will be delivered to communities impacted by power outages.
More than 111,000 Oklahomans across the state are without power and 12 people have died on Oklahoma roads since the winter weather system first hit the state Jan. 12. The storm left ice up to two inches thick in some areas of the state. Temperatures are expected to remain frigid throughout most of the week, making clean up efforts challenging and costly due to downed trees and power lines.
