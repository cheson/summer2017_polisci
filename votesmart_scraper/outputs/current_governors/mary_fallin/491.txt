Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: March 5, 2013
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today commented on the findings of the Oklahoma Commission on School Security:
"The tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary was an unwelcome reminder that we must actively work to address the mental health needs of our state. It also served to remind us of the need to ensure our schools are well-prepared for emergency situations.
"The Commission on School Security has done a good job at addressing those issues and we expect to be able to implement many of its proposals. My thanks go out to Lt. Governor Todd Lamb and the members of the commission for their diligent work to help ensure Oklahoma's children and schools are kept safe."
