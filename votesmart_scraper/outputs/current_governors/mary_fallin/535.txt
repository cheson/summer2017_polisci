Gov. Mary Fallin Statement on Supreme Court Ruling on Health Care
Statement

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act:
"Oklahomans have voiced their opposition to the federal health care bill from the very beginning, having approved a constitutional amendment to block the implementation of this bill in our state. We believe that, rather than Big Government bureaucracy and one-size-fits-all solutions, the free-market principles of choice and competition are the best tools at our disposal to increase access to health care and reduce costs.
"I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated by the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the federal health care law. President Obama's health care policies will limit patients' health care choices, reduce the quality of health care in the United States, and will cost the state of Oklahoma approximately a half billion dollars in the process.
"Today's decision highlights the importance of electing leaders who will work to repeal the federal health care law and replace it with meaningful reform focused on commonsense, market based changes."
