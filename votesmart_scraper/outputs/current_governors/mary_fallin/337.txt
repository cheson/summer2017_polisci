Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement supporting Israel in its ongoing conflict with Hamas:
"I condemn the continued rocket attacks on the people of Israel by Hamas and other terrorist groups. Israel has the right to defend its citizens against any and all terrorist attacks. Israel is a friend to Oklahoma and to all of the United States, and it's important that the people of Israel know that America stands behind them. Our prayers and hopes are for a quick suspension of hostilities and a lasting peace."
