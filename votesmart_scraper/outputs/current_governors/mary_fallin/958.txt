Fallin Calls for More Openness On Earmarks, Criticizes Lack of Transparency
U.S. Congresswoman Mary Fallin called for more openness and transparency today surrounding Congressional spending and criticized the Democrat leadership for refusing to disclose individual spending projects on appropriations bills. Fallin's remarks came after Democrat leaders announced that individual "earmarks" for pet projects would not be disclosed until August, after the House had already voted on spending bills.
Under reforms passed in 109th Congress, Members were able to see individual earmarks and challenge them before a vote. Under the Democrats' new plan, however, they have essentially been shut out of the earmark process. Instead, the Appropriations Chairmen would have virtually sole discretion over which earmarks are included in the final spending bill.
"Voters in Oklahoma have been very clear - they are sick of out-of-control spending and backroom deals," Fallin said. "I came to the nation's Capitol to restore fiscal sanity and to make sure that Congressional earmarks are subject to public scrutiny."
"I am extremely disappointed in the direction that the Democrat leadership has taken this Congress. Rather than cut spending, they have proposed billions more in funding than the President has requested for federal agencies. Rather than bringing us more openness and accountability, they have embraced a policy of secrecy surrounding earmarks and government spending. And rather than opening the process up to debate and transparency, they have willingly cut the vast majority of Congressmen and women out of the legislative process."
