Gov. Fallin Issues Statement on Use of Fort Sill as Detention Facility for Illegal Minors
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: June 6, 2014
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement after her office was informed by the Regional Administrator of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that Fort Sill is being considered as a location for the housing of up to 1,200 unaccompanied minors who illegally crossed the southern border of the United States.

"The Obama administration today informed the state of Oklahoma that Fort Sill will be housing up to 1,200 unaccompanied minors who came into this country illegally. While they have assured my office this arrangement is temporary, the Obama administration continues to fail in its duty to protect our borders and continues to promote policies that encourage, rather than discourage, illegal immigration. I am dismayed by what appears to be an endless cycle of illegal immigration, temporary housing and eventual amnesty for those who have broken our laws. Today's news is the latest in a long line of policy missteps that the American people are paying for."
