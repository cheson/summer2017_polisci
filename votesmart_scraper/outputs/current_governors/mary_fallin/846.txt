Fallin Statement on Storm Damage
Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) issued the following statement on the serious tornado outbreak that struck Oklahoma on Tuesday:
"Our thoughts and prayers are with those who suffered losses in Tuesday's storms, especially those in Carter County where so many were killed or injured, and in north Oklahoma City and Edmond where property damage was so widespread. Oklahoma's Congressional delegation will work closely with state and local officials to assure that all available federal disaster aid and relief begin flowing promptly."
