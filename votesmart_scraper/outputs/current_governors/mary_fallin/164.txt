Gov. Fallin's Statement on Release of President Obama's Clean Power Plan
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Aug. 3, 2015
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin issued the following statement regarding President Obama's "Clean Power Plan," which will require an approximately 32 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from Oklahoma power plants by 2030.
"President Obama's "Clean Power Plan' represents one of the most expansive and expensive regulatory burdens ever imposed on U.S. families and businesses," Fallin said. "The EPA's new rules will have minimal environmental benefits; they will, however, threaten our fuel diversity and lead to significant increases in utility costs across the country.
"Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt has been helping to lead the charge against the White House and the EPA's overreach. I continue to support his efforts in the courtroom. Oklahoma, not the federal government, knows best how to protect our environment while also supporting our economy."
