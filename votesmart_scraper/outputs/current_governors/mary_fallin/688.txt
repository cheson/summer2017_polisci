Governor Mary Fallin today asked the Oklahoma Legislature to pass legislation authorizing a Quick Action Closing Fund. The fund would be used as an economic development tool to bring businesses and new jobs to Oklahoma, similar to the Texas Enterprise Fund. To date, the TEF has generated over 56,000 new jobs and $14.7 billion in capital investment for Texas, according to the office of Texas Governor Rick Perry.
The creation of a closing fund was mentioned as one of Fallin's priorities in her State of the State address in February. Fallin released the following statement, encouraging lawmakers to pass HB 1953, which would create that fund:
"Authorizing the Quick Action Closing Fund is a key part of our job creation agenda. It will grant my administration an important tool as we work to "seal the deal' with businesses that are serious about bringing a large number of jobs and a substantial investment to the state of Oklahoma. It is my hope the legislature works to pass HB 1953 as quickly as possible."
