LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments about faith and God. And I am a woman of God. I oppose hate, and I think all crimes are awful. And I have a great disdain for violence produced by hate.
But this bill is the wrong solution for an ideal goal. It is horrible for anyone to hate for any class, race or religion or sexual orientation. Violence produced by hate is already outlawed. Why would we, as a Nation, want to divide our American citizens into various categories of more worthy or less worthy of whatever protection the law can give them? What happened to the great ideal this Nation was founded on of equal, equal protection under law?
The hate crimes bill will chill the first amendment rights of religious groups. This hate crimes bill will chill the first amendment rights of the religious groups, and the government will be required to prove the suspect's thoughts as a category of the victim involved in the crime.
Religious groups may become the subject of criminal investigations in order to determine the suspect's religious beliefs, membership in religious organization, or past statements about persons associated with specific categories. Religious leaders will be chilled from expressing their religious views for fear of involvement in the criminal justice system.
This hate crime bill will result in unequal justice for all and the restriction of one of our ideals that has made this Nation great, free speech.
