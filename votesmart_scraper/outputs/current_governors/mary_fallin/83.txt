Governor Mary Fallin today signed the first compact between the state and a tribal nation to help protect vulnerable adults.
The compact signed by Fallin and Osage Nation Assistant Principal Chief Raymond Red Corn is intended to improve cooperation and achieve coordinated services between the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS) and the tribe's social services department. The compact is for five years.
"The state of Oklahoma and the Osage Nation already are important partners and have compacts dealing with tobacco, cross-deputization, transportation infrastructure, gaming and motor fuel," said Fallin. "This is just another example of an opportunity for state leaders and tribal leaders to get together to strengthen our partnerships."
"Both the Osage constitution and Osage culture require us to protect our Osage elders and vulnerable adults," said Red Corn. "This compact ensures that when Osage people need these services they will be provided by our own Adult Protective Services staff. With the cooperation of the state, our staff can provide better outcomes through a unique understanding of our culture and lifestyles. Lee Collins and her team have worked hard with the state to reach this agreement. We appreciate the cooperation of the state and look forward to implementation of the compact."
"We commend the Osage Nation for stepping up and working with us to create this unique compact for protecting vulnerable adults," DHS Director Ed Lake said. "While we have very good working relationships with other tribes in the work of adult protective services, this compact represents a commitment by the state, the Osage Nation and DHS to work together to ensure vulnerable adults are protected to the best of our collective abilities."
