Governor Mary Fallin's criminal justice reform package was endorsed today by policy groups, business leaders and chambers of commerce from the state's two largest cities.
"These policies are evidence based and driven by consensus among Oklahoma's experts. The broad range of support further illustrates that these measures are the best options for criminal justice reform in Oklahoma and we urge their quick passage in the legislature," they wrote in a letter that will be distributed to lawmakers.
Four bills proposed by the governor's Oklahoma Justice Reform Committee are scheduled to be heard early next week by the state House of Representatives.
The letter supporting the bills was signed by:
Oklahoma Policy Institute
Greater Oklahoma City Chamber,
Tulsa Regional Chamber of Commerce
Oklahoma District Attorneys Association
Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs (OCPA) President Jonathan Small
OCPA Impact
Clay Bennett
David Rainbolt
Adam Luck, state director of Right on Crime
"Governor Fallin's criminal justice reform agenda represents the best steps forward for Oklahoma as we work to address the growing incarceration rates, overcrowded prisons, and overburdened county jails," the letter said.
