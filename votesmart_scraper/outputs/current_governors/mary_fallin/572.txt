Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today applauded Senator Dan Newberry and Representative Glen Mulready for introducing Senate Concurrent Resolution 33, calling for a federal balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The resolution notes that "an irresponsible pattern of spending and borrowing has resulted in a total outstanding national debt of more than $15 trillion," and calls upon the president and Congress to balance the budget and to "reduce both spending levels and the annual debt."
Fallin asked the legislature in her State of the State address earlier this year to pass such a resolution, saying the state of Oklahoma needs to send a message to Washington that out-of-control spending was hurting the economy and threatening the nation's future.
"Washington's reckless spending habits are leading this country off a fiscal cliff," said Fallin. "It is wrong; it is irresponsible and it is holding back economic growth in all 50 states. It's important for the people and the state of Oklahoma to speak out against the fiscal policies and out-of-control spending that jeopardize our children's future by burying them under a mountain of debt. I applaud the legislature for sending this important statement to President Obama and to the United States Congress.
"I'd also like to thank our lawmakers for continuing to work with me to offer a bright alternative to the kind of tax-and-spend policies we see coming out of Washington. Here in Oklahoma we have committed ourselves to fiscal discipline, low taxes and limited government. As a result, our economy continues to thrive. Leaders in Washington should take note: Oklahoma offers a great example of how conservative policies can lead to job creation and economic success."
