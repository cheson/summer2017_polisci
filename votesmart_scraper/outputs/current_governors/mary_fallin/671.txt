Governor Mary Fallin today signed in to law House Bill 1909, an energy reform measure dealing with the state's oil and gas laws.
The bill by Rep. Mike Jackson of Enid and Sen. Cliff Branan of Oklahoma City, also known as the 2011 Shale Reservoir Development Act, modernizes Oklahoma oil and gas statutes to better accommodate technological advances associated with horizontal drilling in shale reservoirs.
"This legislation is an important step in bringing state oil and gas laws up to date with innovations needed to keep Oklahoma's oil and gas industry competitive. House Bill 1909 will help Oklahoma to more effectively compete against other shale plays around the country, and help ensure that drilling dollars stay home in Oklahoma," Fallin said. "Through the use of these technologies, our oil and gas producers can reach and produce even more of Oklahoma's vast oil and natural gas resources in ways that are efficient, safe and environmentally compatible."
The bill signing was the culmination of a collaborative effort of small and large oil and natural gas producers as well as royalty owners. Oklahoma Corporation Commission Chair Dana Murphy created the stakeholder committee which worked on proposed language for the bill.
"Reconciling transformative technology in horizontal drilling, much of which was developed right here in Oklahoma, with over 100 years of vertical well case law and rule makings, was no small task," Oklahoma Secretary of Energy Mike Ming said. "But recognizing the importance of the issue to protect the rights of all affected parties, these groups rolled up their sleeves and got the job done."
