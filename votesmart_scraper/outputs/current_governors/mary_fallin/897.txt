Fallin Visits U.S./Mexico Border

America is doing a better job of securing our southern border, Fifth District Congresswoman Mary Fallin said after a two-day visit to the border that included conferences with Border Patrol officials and a walking tour of the border fence system.
"I am encouraged by what I saw," Fallin said after spending time with border security personnel in the San Diego area. "I wanted to get out and walk the border with those who are on the front lines, and I was able to spend time with the people who are out there doing the job every day. It was an enlightening visit."
Fallin said she was able to fly in a Border Patrol helicopter and was present when officers apprehended illegal aliens trying to penetrate the fence.
"Our security arrangements are more layered now, and that is making it harder for illegal immigrants and smugglers to penetrate the border," she said. "There is still much to do, and I remain disappointed that Congress has failed to recognize that before we talk about what to do with illegal aliens already here, we have to stop the flow at the source."
Fallin visited the San Diego border on June 30 and July 1. She said she is concerned that more than 300 border security personnel have been assaulted in the pst year in the San Diego area alone.
"It is a tough and challenging job and we owe these men and women our thanks," she said.
