Gov. Fallin Statement upon Signing Wind Tax Legislation
By: Mary Fallin
Date: April 17, 2017
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement after signing House Bill 2298, which was authored by Speaker Charles McCall (R-22), and Senate President Pro Tempore Mike Schulz (R-38) and passed the Senate 40-3 last Monday. This legislation would sunset the tax credits for the wind industry on July 1, 2017.
"The wind industry for Oklahoma is an essential piece of my "All of the Above' energy strategy. With the support of the zero emissions tax credit, our state has become a national leader in wind energy. Currently, Oklahoma ranks third in the nation in total installed wind capacity, with nearly 7,000MW in the ground. This accounts for more than 25 percent of the state's electricity generation mix, and is an important contributor to Oklahoma having the lowest cost of electricity in the nation.
"The zero emissions tax credit was key to the growth of wind energy in Oklahoma, and I'm grateful to the industry for their ambitious successes, as well as their willingness to work with the state to address our challenging budgetary circumstances. Their leadership, along with the leadership of Speaker McCall and Senate Pro Tem Schulz, is a critical part of our continued investment in the future of our state. It is time to ensure that Oklahoma has a bright future, and continues its position as a prominent energy state."
