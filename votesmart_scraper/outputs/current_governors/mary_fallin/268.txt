Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement regarding President Obama's plan to grant amnesty to up to five million illegal immigrants in the United States:
"The United States is a nation of immigrants, and I am proud that people from all across the world want to come here to enjoy our freedoms and our prosperity. We are also a nation of laws. Like all nations, the U.S. has borders. Those laws and those borders must be respected, for reasons ranging from national security to economics to health.
"President Obama's decision to circumvent a newly elected Congress and grant amnesty to 5 million illegal immigrants undermines the rule of law. It rewards people who have illegally crossed our borders and broken our laws. His decision is an insult to the millions of people around the world trying to come to the U.S. through legal means. It's also an affront to the American people, who elected a Congress to work with the president on matters of national importance, not to be circumvented through a legally questionable power-grab.
"Finally, I have grave concerns about the president's amnesty plan as it relates to the fiscal stability of both our federal and state governments. The president has now unilaterally granted legal status to millions of individuals who may require state-funded medical and educational services as well as other benefits enjoyed by American citizens. All of this comes with a price tag, which the president has not addressed. This decision can be added to long list of policies supported by President Obama that are driving this nation further into debt."
