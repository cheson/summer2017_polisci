Governor Mary Fallin's sixth annual Feeding Oklahoma Drive, which ran October 1 through 31, exceeded its goal of raising 2 million meals. In total, the drive collected $301,159 in donations and 1,369,113 pounds of food, which will provide 2,598,723 meals for Oklahomans struggling with hunger.
"I am thrilled to thank so many generous Oklahomans for stepping up and donating to this year's Feeding Oklahoma Drive," Fallin said. "Because of your generosity, we will provide meals to our hungry neighbors in all 77 counties across the state. Just because the drive has ended and we have met our goal, please do not forget the continued importance of giving. As we enter the holiday season, let's all remember the critical role our food banks play, and continue to stock their shelves."
