Fallin Introduces Bill to Keep Gitmo Terrorists Out of Oklahoma
Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) introduced legislation today that would prohibit federal funds from being used to transfer terrorists held in Guantanamo Bay to any facility in Oklahoma. The bill was filed in response to President Obama's executive order requiring the closure of the offshore detention facility. Representatives Dan Boren (OK-02), Tom Cole (OK-04), Frank Lucas (OK-03) and John Sullivan (OK-01) are all cosponsors of the legislation.
Fallin released the following statement:
"Guantanamo Bay holds some of world's most dangerous criminals, including Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Holding terrorists like this in a secure offshore location makes good sense. Granting mass murderers the kind of rights they would be afforded on American soil is as wrongheaded as it is dangerous, and I will continue to oppose any plans to move these men into the United States.
"Wherever the Gitmo detainees are kept, I am not about to let the murderers and thugs of Al Qaeda set foot in Oklahoma. The legislation I offered today will ensure that men like these, who could pose a serious threat to the security of the American people, will never set foot in our state. Oklahoma has seen the brutality of terrorism up close. After the terrible bombing of the Murrah building, we have no desire to ever again have terrorists on our soil."
