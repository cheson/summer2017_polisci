Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement on the 17th anniversary of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing:
"Seventeen years ago today, an unimaginable and shocking act of terrorism was perpetrated on Oklahoma City and on our nation. One-hundred and sixty eight lives were lost in that terrible attack, including 19 small children. The horror, the brutality and the evil of the Murrah bombing can never be overstated.
"It was an attack that could have easily crippled our city, and left our people hopeless. It did not. Instead, the people of Oklahoma banded together -- with the help of volunteers and well-wishers from across the nation and even the world -- to overcome. We worked together; we comforted one another; and we rebuilt. Today we are a more prosperous city and a stronger people.
"On this anniversary, I would ask that all Oklahomans as well as all Americans remember and pray for the victims of this terrible tragedy and their families. I would ask as well that we remember and honor the emergency responders and the countless volunteers who arrived on the scene and worked without rest or food to pull survivors from the rubble. Lastly, I would ask our citizens to join me in giving thanks to God for the strength of our community and the resiliency of our people, without which we could never have recovered from such a tragedy."
Fallin will speak today at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum's Annual Remembrance Ceremony at approximately 9:15 am.
