Governor Mary Fallin today announced the state of Oklahoma has $1.5 million available in drought grants for cities, counties, water districts and other public entities to help fund projects that highlight responsible use of water.
"Responsible use of water remains the most immediate and effective way to prevent future water shortages for many communities and water systems in Oklahoma," said Fallin. "As the state enters its fourth year of ongoing drought, water efficiency and the reuse of water are becoming increasingly important to protect the water supplies that communities currently use."
To receive funding from the Water for 2060 Drought Grant Program this fiscal year, the applicant and the project must both be eligible. Eligible entities include counties, towns and municipalities, public works authorities and rural water/sewer districts.
Grants are capped at $500,000. The deadline for application is November 26, 2014.
Projects to be considered for a grant must demonstrate water efficiency and support drought resiliency within the community or water/wastewater system. Water efficiency is defined as the use of improved technologies and practices to deliver equal or better services with less water. Water efficiency encompasses responsible water use and water reuse efforts, as well as water loss reduction and prevention to protect water resources for the future.
Eligible categories of water efficiency projects include:
-Installing or retrofitting water efficient devices in public buildings, such as plumbing fixtures and appliances.
