Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement on the Memorial Day holiday:
"As we celebrate this Memorial Day weekend, I encourage Oklahomans to take a moment to remember and honor those who have fought and died to defend the freedom we continue to enjoy every day. Their courage and sacrifice reminds us that freedom is never free. We are blessed to have so many men and women in our military who are willing to fight and sacrifice for this country and to protect the freedom and liberty it represents.
