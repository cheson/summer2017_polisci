Gov. Fallin Signs into Law Pet Breeder Oversight Bill
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: May 29, 2012
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today signed into law a measure that alters the oversight of commercial pet breeders in the state of Oklahoma. House Bill 2921 abolishes the Commercial Pet Breeders Board and transfers the board's responsibilities to the state Department of Agriculture. The legislation would apply to breeders who have 11 or more female cats or dogs capable of reproducing.
"By transferring oversight responsibilities to the state Department of Agriculture, this legislation will ensure the humane treatment of animals while also providing fair treatment and regulation of commercial pet breeders in Oklahoma," Fallin said. "It also allows us to continue to reduce the size of our state government without reducing the quality of services or oversight we are providing. My thanks go out to the Legislature for sending this bill to my desk."
The bill was sponsored by Rep. Phil Richardson and Sen. Josh Brecheen. The measure takes effect on July 1.
