Date: March 10, 2014
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement on Municipal Government Week, which runs today through Friday:
"As the daughter of two Tecumseh mayors, I have a great appreciation for municipal government employees and the impact they have on the communities they serve. Municipal Government Week is a great time for citizens to recognize and celebrate the work being done in their city or town. It is also an opportunity for people to become more involved in their local government."
During the week, municipalities across the state will share with citizens the work it takes to make a city or town run effectively and efficiently. Some will be hosting mock council meetings for youth as well as other special activities.
