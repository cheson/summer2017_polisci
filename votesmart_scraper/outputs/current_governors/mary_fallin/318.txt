Governor Mary Fallin and Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John D. Doak recently worked together to ensure that Oklahoma consumers receive the most accurate information possible when acquiring earthquake insurance.
Fallin approved an emergency rule adopted by Doak to require all licensed producers and adjusters with the property line of authority to complete one hour of continuing education on the topic of earthquake insurance every two years.
"This emergency rule will ensure insurance agents in our state stay up-to-date on earthquake information," said Fallin. "It's important as the market for earthquake insurance expands in Oklahoma that residents get reliable and accurate information from insurance agents to help them consider whether they need this additional coverage."
"Working with Governor Fallin to approve this rule is an important step for consumers who are seeking clarification on the benefits of earthquake coverage," said Doak. "The Oklahoma Insurance Department works hard to ensure that consumers across the state receive clear and accurate information from their agents regarding all types of insurance."
The earthquake insurance continuing education requirement goes into effect Jan. 1, 2015.
