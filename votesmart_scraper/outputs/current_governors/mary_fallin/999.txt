Issue Position: Illegal Immigration
Immigration reform is long overdue. Our immigration system is broken.
The issue of illegal immigration is one of both national and economic security. We cannot claim that we are protecting this country if we cannot control our borders and do not know who is crossing them. While in Congress, I will be an active supporter of legislation that will strengthen our border security and give our Border Patrol the tools it needs to accomplish its mission.
In addition to securing our borders, Congress must address the problem posed by the twelve million illegal immigrants in this country, and it must do so without granting amnesty to those who have broken our laws. The magnitude of the illegal immigration problem in the United States merits serious and comprehensive immigration reform. Anything less than this poses an economic and cultural threat to our country, as well as endangering our national security.
