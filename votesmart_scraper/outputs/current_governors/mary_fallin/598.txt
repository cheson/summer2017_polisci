Governor Fallin today released the following statement following media reports that President Obama's administration will reject TransCanada's application to build the Keystone XL pipeline:
"If the reports are true that President Obama will reject the application for the Keystone XL pipeline, it's a sad day for those of us who care about American energy independence and job creation.
"Independent reports show Oklahoma anticipates a $1.2 billion economic investment in the state. Nationally, 20,000 construction jobs and as many as 250,000 jobs are expected to be created.
"The decision by the president to block construction of this pipeline is more evidence this administration is beholden to radical environmentalists and does not care about real job creation or the plight of tens of millions of unemployed Americans. I am outraged by President Obama's obstructionism, poor judgment and lack of regard for a project that would help secure America's energy independence, boost our economy and create hundreds of thousands of jobs."
