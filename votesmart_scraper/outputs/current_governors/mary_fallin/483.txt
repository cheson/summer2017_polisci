Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today appointed the members of a Blue Ribbon Panel for Developmental Disabilities. Fallin created the panel by executive order, and announced its formation last month at the Governor's Conference on Developmental Disabilities in Norman.
There are almost 60,000 men, women and children with intellectual disabilities in Oklahoma. Currently, the state has a waiting list of over 7,000 people requesting services from the state's Developmental Disabilities Service Division (DDSD).
The new panel will develop a comprehensive plan to support individuals with intellectual disabilities and their families, starting with recommendations to address the state's growing waiting list for DDSD services. It will also research and analyze best practices for the comprehensive delivery of high quality services.
"Our goal as a state is to be a resource that allows men, women and children with intellectual disabilities the ability to realize their full potential, to live their own lives, and to do so as independently as possible," said Fallin. "This new panel is composed of people with personal and professional experiences that can help us to pursue this goal and improve services."
