Rick Armstrong, vice president of simulation for FlightSafety International, believes the company has a "value proposition" that is attractive to airlines, the military and corporate aviation departments facing high fuel prices in a stagnant economy.
It's cheaper - and more forgiving - to train in a full-motion flight simulator, Armstrong said, than in an aircraft burning high-price jet fuel.
Armstrong told more than 500 people at the grand opening Tuesday of FlightSafety's $42 million, 375,000-square-feet flight simulator manufacturing facility in Broken Arrow that he expects a strong return on the company's value proposition.
"We look forward to an exciting future here," he said. "We have 684 employees. We have gone from 240,000 square feet (in four Broken Arrow facilities) to 375,000 square feet. There is room for growth here. Our goal is to be the market leader and to support our city, our state and our nation."
After a year of construction by general contractor Crossland Construction of Tulsa, the new facility opened on a 17-acre site south of 71st Street and Lynn Lane.
A recovery in the economy should lead to job growth at FlightSafety's new plant, company executives said, and up to 1,000 people could be working there within a few years, up 46 percent from today's number.
With 17 bays, or flight simulator manufacturing positions, and a supporting cast of 250 engineers, the plant will speed communications and collaboration, company executives said.
