Governor Mary Fallin today signed House Bill 2154, authorizing a medical pilot program allowing the medically supervised use of cannabidiol (CBD), a low THC non-intoxicating derivative of marijuana. Reports from some families indicate that CBD may be used to effectively treat children who suffer from epileptic seizures and help reduce the number and intensity of those seizures.
HB 2154 was authored by Rep. Jon Echols and Sen. Brian Crain. The bill is known as "Katie and Cayman's Law," named after a young relative of Echols and a family-friend of Crain, both of whom suffer from seizures.
"This bill will help get sick children potentially life-changing medicine," said Fallin. "By crafting the legislation in a way that allows for tightly controlled medical studies, we can ensure we are researching possible treatments in a responsible and scientific way."
Fallin reiterated she remains opposed to legalizing marijuana, either for recreational or medicinal purposes.
"The CBD oil we are studying is a non-intoxicating derivative of marijuana," said Fallin. "It is not marijuana, and it is not anything that can make you "high.' This law has been narrowly crafted to support highly supervised medical trials for children with debilitating seizures. It is not a first step towards legalizing marijuana, and I will never support the legalization of marijuana in Oklahoma."
Clinical trials will be overseen through a partnership with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Oklahoma State Department of Health and OU Medical Center. All other use of any marijuana or marijuana-derived product remains illegal.
