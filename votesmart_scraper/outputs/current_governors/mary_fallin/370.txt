Governor Mary Fallin today declared a state of emergency for all 77 counties because of wildfires that began Sunday, May 4. The governor also issued an executive proclamation that declares a burn ban for 36 counties.
One person was killed and numerous homes and structures have been destroyed in Logan County since a wildfire began late Sunday afternoon. Additional fires were reported near Altus, Jennings and Keystone Lake in Pawnee County, Seiling, Stillwater and Woodward. Damage assessments are ongoing.
"My thanks go out to the firefighters and first responders who have been battling wildfires in several areas of the state," said Fallin. "The emergency declaration allows state agencies to acquire resources that can aid in that firefighting effort."
Under the Executive Order, state agencies can make emergency purchases and acquisitions needed to expedite the delivery of resources to local jurisdictions. The declaration also marks a first step toward seeking federal assistance should it be necessary. https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/filelog/89947.pdf
Governor Fallin's Executive Proclamation bans outdoor burning for nearly half the state as drought conditions continue to worsen across Oklahoma.
Oklahoma Forestry Services (OFS), a division of the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, recommended the ban based upon an analysis of fire activity, wildland fuel conditions and the predicted continued drought as criteria for recommending the ban.
OFS evaluates wildland fire conditions daily. Extreme conditions that occurred during the weekend -- including record-breaking heat and high winds, coupled with low humidity -- resulted in vegetation reaching critically dry conditions very quickly.
