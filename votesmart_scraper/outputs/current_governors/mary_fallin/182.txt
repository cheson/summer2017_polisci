Governor Mary Fallin released the following statement today regarding the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Glossip v. Gross that upheld as constitutional Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol:
"The Constitution is clearly not intended to prohibit the death penalty by lethal injection or the use of the sedative midazolam. I appreciate the Court's ruling, which upholds the letter and the spirit of the law as it is written. My thanks go out to Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Solicitor General Patrick Wyrick and their legal team for aggressively and successfully representing the state on this issue."
The Attorney General's Office, pursuant to state law, will notify the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals that the court is now able to set execution dates for Richard Glossip, John Marion Grant, and Benjamin Robert Cole.
