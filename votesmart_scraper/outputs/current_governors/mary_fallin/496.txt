GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Governors across the country scrambling to deal with the sequester fallout in their states. When asked who is to blame for the mess, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin answered, "Everybody." She joins us. Nice to see you, Governor.
OKLAHOMA GOV. MARY FALLIN: Good to see you, too, Greta.
VAN SUSTEREN: OK, Governor, so who -- who are the everybodys? I mean, I got my list of everybodys, but who's yours?
FALLIN: There's a lot of people. Well, first of all, beginning at the top with leadership, and that's the president. You know, the president suggested the sequester, and of course, it went to Congress. Congress put it in there as a default, that they were going to work on trying to balance the budget, lower the deficit. They didn't do it. So now we have this default of the sequester.
So I think everybody is to blame, whether it's Republicans, Democrats, the House, the Senate, the president. But in the end, it starts at the top with the president.
VAN SUSTEREN: All right, I've looked at the -- the White House issued a paper, and I'm looking at the part that goes to your state, Oklahoma, where they say that all -- this is where the cuts are going to affect Oklahoma. And I'm curious whether you agree. It says Oklahoma will lose approximately $4.9 million in funding for primary and secondary education, putting 70 teacher and aide jobs at risk.
Now, that $4.9 million funding -- maybe you know this or don't -- is that additional money that you weren't expecting? I mean, where -- what's this $4.9 million? Is it -- are you going to be below the baseline of what you've had, or this slowed growth?
