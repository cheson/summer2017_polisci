Governor Mary Fallin today called on President Obama to release a comprehensive plan to fight Ebola.
"Oklahoma is doing everything it can to prepare for any potential threat of Ebola," said Fallin. "Our state agencies are coordinating with health care professionals; our hospitals are preparing themselves to isolate and treat any potential outbreaks; and protocols are being updated and reviewed.
"What is lacking now is a commitment from our federal partners to establish a comprehensive plan to reduce risk for our citizens. Travelers, including non-citizens, are coming and going freely from Ebola-infected hot zones to the United States. Security and screening measures at international airports have widely been reported to be inadequate. Our lack of border security, particularly at the Southern border, means we have no real way of knowing who is coming into this country or whether or not they are sick.
"The president's assurances that the federal government is doing everything it can are ringing hollow. We need the White House to take this threat seriously and move quickly to protect our citizens."
