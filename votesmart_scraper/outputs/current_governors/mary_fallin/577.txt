Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin released the following statement today concerning legislative leaders' decision to hold Senate Bill 1629:
"I accept the Legislature's decision and I remain extremely hopeful that the U.S. Supreme Court will do the right thing and rule the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional," Fallin said. "In the event that it does not, I still believe that establishing a free market, Oklahoma-based online health insurance marketplace that protects consumer choice is the best defense against a federally run exchange."
"Ultimately, Oklahoma Republicans all share the same goal: to prevent the unaffordable and unconstitutional federal health care law from being implemented here. We will continue to work together to pursue that common goal and to protect the rights of all Oklahomans."
