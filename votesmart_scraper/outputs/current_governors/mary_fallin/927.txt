REP. MARY FALLIN (R-OK): Thank you, Madam Chairman. Appreciate you coming today and talking about a very important issue to our business community in the United States. I had a couple of questions. Are you going to survey companies that are private, but might want to go public?
MR. COX: It's an excellent question. The cost study that we're talking about is literally focused on the costs of complying with the new management guidance and the new audit standard. And so it would be impossible to derive that information from companies that aren't complying and aren't incurring those costs. But survey data of companies that are thinking about going public would be enormously useful for other purposes.
REP. FALLIN: Okay. And once the commission has collected the data, what types of action could it take to reduce Sarbanes-Oxley compliance for the smaller companies?
MR. COX: I think we're going to have to stay with this. I've thought all along that writing the new audit standard and writing management guidance directed to small business that takes into account their special concerns is only half the job. After that, starting with user friendly things, like a brochure for small business that explains in plain English all the steps people can take to get started on this, and extending to talking to the audit firms and making sure that they're focused on efficiencies and they're not taking advantage of their clients. All of these things are going to require vigilance and maintenance by the SEC.
REP. FALLIN: Thank you, Madam Chairman. Thank you.
