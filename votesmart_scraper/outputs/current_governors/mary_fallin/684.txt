The Oklahoma House of Representatives has approved Gov. Mary Fallin's request to provide convenience to Oklahoma business owners.
House Bill 1601, by state Rep. Aaron Stiles (R-Norman) and state Sen. Clark Jolley (R-Edmond), would establish a one-stop shop through which business owners could establish a new business and obtain the licensees and permits they need in one convenient location.
"This plan is designed to cut through the government bureaucracy, which is a strong disincentive to the creation of new businesses and jobs," Stiles explained. "Business owners should not be forced to navigate through a gauntlet of multiple agencies and government red tape in order to start their business."
"Governor Fallin's proposal will enable Oklahoma businessmen to spend less time dealing with government and more time focusing on their business," added House Government Modernization Committee Chairman Jason Murphey (R-Guthrie).
House Bill 1601 was approved by a vote of 90-7 and now goes to the Senate for additional consideration.
