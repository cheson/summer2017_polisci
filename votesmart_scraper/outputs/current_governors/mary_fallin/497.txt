Gov. Fallin To Lead Initiative Petition Drive On Second Hand Smoke Reduction Measures
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Feb. 19, 2013
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today announced plans to put tobacco regulations aimed at reducing second hand smoke to a vote of the people.
Fallin, who was joined by community leaders and health care professionals at an event hosted by the American Cancer Society, said she would lead an initiative petition drive on the issue. While details of the petition have not yet been finalized, Fallin announced the creation of a new website, www.DontSmokeOnMe.com, where Oklahomans can sign up to receive more information.
Secondhand smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including hundreds that are toxic and approximately 70 that can cause cancer. It causes an estimated 46,000 heart disease deaths and 3,400 lung cancer deaths annually among adult nonsmokers in the United States.
"Improving health and wellness in Oklahoma is a priority for me," said Fallin. "Any plan that seeks to improve health outcomes will have to address tobacco. Smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in Oklahoma, killing 6,000 men and women each year. Hundreds of these people aren't even smokers, and have instead fallen ill as a result of second hand smoke."
"It's time to let voters decide whether or not they want clean air in public places like bars and restaurants. I believe the answer will be "yes.'"
