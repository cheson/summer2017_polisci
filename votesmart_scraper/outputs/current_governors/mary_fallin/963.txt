FUNDING FOR INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS
Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Speaker, one of the most effective tools we have against fighting our enemies like al Qaeda is intelligence, information that allows us to disrupt their terror cells and prevent attacks before they happen. And yet, the Democrats see fit to cut the funding of these operations.
Worst of all, they are shifting resources away from vital, war-related intelligence operations towards their politically correct crusade on global warming.
Does the Democrat leadership really think that carbon emissions represent a greater threat to the United States than the 9/11 radical jihadists?
Yesterday, law enforcement foiled a plot by terrorists to attack and kill U.S. soldiers in New Jersey. Protecting our Nation should be our number one priority. Does the leadership really think that our surveillance satellites should be aimed at polar ice caps and not terror cells and that spies should be investigating global warming?
Congress must adequately fund our intelligence operations. If we don't, we may need to be more concerned about global warming in the United States caused by a global attack, caused by a nuclear attack in our own backyards.
