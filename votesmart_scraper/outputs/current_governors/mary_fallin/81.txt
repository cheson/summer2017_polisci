Governor Mary Fallin today issued this statement on the report of the multicounty grand jury looking into the state of Oklahoma's execution procedures:
"I want to thank Attorney General Scott Pruitt, his staff and the grand jurors for their time and effort on this important matter. At my direction, my office cooperated with the grand jury's investigation in all respects. Because I just received the report, I will need time to analyze it.
"When the state of Oklahoma carries out the death penalty, we must ensure that the process is appropriate and in full compliance with the law. It is imperative that Oklahoma be able to manage the execution process properly. With new management at the Department of Corrections, led by Interim Director Joe Allbaugh, I am confident we can move forward with a process that complies with the applicable policies, protocols and legal requirements."
