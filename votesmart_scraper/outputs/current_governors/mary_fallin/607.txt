Governor Mary Fallin Comments on Certified Revenue Figures
Statement
By: Mary Fallin

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement on the Oklahoma Board of Equalization certified revenue figures. The governor will have $6.5 billion to craft her FY 2013 budget, an increase of $120.3 million over the previous year.
"The numbers certified by the Board of Equalization today indicate that tax revenues are increasing as Oklahoma's economy continues its rebound from the national recession. That's the good news. The loss of one time funding sources, however, means the state is currently facing an estimated budget shortfall of $150 million. While that number may change, the bottom line is that next year's budget will be flat at best. Moving into 2013, state agencies should redouble their modernization and efficiency efforts to ensure they are maximizing the value of their appropriated funds and saving taxpayer dollars."
