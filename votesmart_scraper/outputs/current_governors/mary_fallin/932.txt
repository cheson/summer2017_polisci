Fallin Calls on Congress to Complete Work on Vets Funding

U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, called today for immediate progress on the veteran's funding bill. Fallin issued the following statement after House Democrats voted for the tenth time in seventeen days to oppose a proposal to immediately complete work on the bill so it can be signed into law:
"Veteran's Day is a time to honor and celebrate our veterans for their courageous national service. Unfortunately, one thing we can't celebrate this weekend is a veterans funding bill.
"One-hundred and forty-nine days ago, the House of Representatives passed a veterans bill with overwhelming bipartisan support. Since then, the Democrat Leadership has refused to send that bill to the President's desk, hoping instead to find a way to attach billions of dollars in unrelated spending and pork barrel projects.
"There are more than 350,000 veterans living in Oklahoma and they demand, as I do, that Congress stop playing political games with the funding for their hospitals, their housing and their healthcare. Our veterans are heroes, not political bargaining chips. When Congress returns to Washington next week, it must move quickly to complete its work on a clean veterans funding bill."
