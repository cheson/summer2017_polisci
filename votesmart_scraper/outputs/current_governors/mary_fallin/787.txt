Op-Ed: Oklahomans Not Big Fans Of President's Health Plan
On Aug. 13 I held a districtwide town hall meeting to listen to the views of Fifth District constituents. As you might expect, the meeting was heavily dominated by the ongoing debate over health care reform.
Attendance at the town hall was the largest and most passionate I have ever seen, which is hardly surprising, since there is so much at stake in the health care debate. In fact, we had to schedule a second town hall right after the first to allow the massive crowd to get inside, and I stayed well into the evening answering questions and visiting with constituents.
I have been clear on what I can support  market-based reforms that leave patients and doctors in charge of medical decisions. I have also been adamant in what I cannot support  an overt or clandestine government takeover of our health care system.
It is clear from the attendance at the town hall and from a survey I conducted that an overwhelming majority of Fifth District residents share my views.
The survey drew a strong response. Here are the results:
n Are you satisfied with your current health care coverage? 80% yes, 20% no.
n Will you support health care reform if it does not guarantee your ability to keep your current coverage? 9% yes, 84% no, 6% no opinion.
n Increased deficit spending is driving the federal deficit above $1 trillion. How concerned are you about our increasing deficit? 87% very concerned, 6% somewhat concerned, 2% no opinion, 4% not concerned.
n The current health care reform bill before Congress would cover abortion. Do you feel abortion should be covered by all insurance plans and subsidized by taxpayers? 13% yes, 80% no, 8% no opinion.
n Do you think the federal government should mandate that employers provide health insurance benefits to their employees? 17% yes, 75% no, 7% no opinion.
These results fit well with those from other polls and surveys around the country.
Most Americans are clearly alarmed at the exploding deficit and suspicious of efforts to bring health care under the federal umbrella. They believe that reforms are desirable, but they are deeply worried about a slide into a national health care system that would raise taxes and lower the quality and availability of health care.
At the town hall meeting, I listened to similar comments from those in attendance. It was clear that this was no manufactured turnout, as some supporters of the current big-government health bills have alleged. These were ordinary Oklahomans who are worried about the direction being followed in Washington.
People attending the town halls included mothers and fathers, a doctor and a nurse, older people worried about more government intrusion into health care, small business owners and middle-class working folks who don't want their insurance taken over by the government.
Unlike in some other states, our attendees were polite and civil, as Oklahomans tend to be. I was especially grateful to the staff at Francis Tuttle Career Tech for hosting the unexpectedly large crowd at their Portland campus and for making everyone feel welcome.
A big part of my job as a member of Congress is listening to you. Part of your job is telling me what you think. On Aug. 13, we did exactly that.
