Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today announced the federal government has approved public assistance for an additional 15 Oklahoma counties to help with storm and flooding recovery expenses.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved the request, one day after the governor and the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management (OEM) submitted the request for Adair, Beckham, Caddo, Comanche, Creek, Garvin, Jackson, Logan, McCurtain, McIntosh, Marshall, Muskogee, Pushmataha, Sequoyah and Washita counties.
"I appreciate the federal government's quick response to our request," said Fallin. "This will help rebuild our damaged roads and bridges as well as offset other costs associated with responding to flood and storm damage."
The federal funds may be used to assist municipalities, counties and rural electric cooperatives with infrastructure repairs, debris removal and costs associated with damages caused by last month's storms and flooding.
To date, 40 counties have been approved by FEMA for public assistance. Thirteen counties have been approved by FEMA for individual assistance.
Fallin continued to encourage individuals and business-owners whose property was damaged between May 5 and June 4 by storms and flooding to report those damages to FEMA by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) regardless of what county they are located in. She stressed that damage assessments are ongoing and the state expects to add more counties to its requests for both individual and public assistance.
