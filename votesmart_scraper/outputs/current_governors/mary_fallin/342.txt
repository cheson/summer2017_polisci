Democratic gubernatorial candidate Joe Dorman on Monday blasted Gov. Mary Fallin over delays in the state's workers' compensation system following a change in the law.
The Tulsa World reported last week that hearings for thousands of injured workers will be delayed this month while the system is split into two agencies. The state is switching from a court-based system to an administrative system.
"That is unacceptable to allow injured Oklahoma workers to linger that long without medical treatment in some form or fashion due to the injuries they sustained on the job," said Rep. Dorman, D-Rush Springs.
He called on both systems to resume duties.
The change was called for in a state law passed in 2013 designed to save money and make the system more efficient.
"Setting aside dockets until the beginning of August is unacceptable," Dorman said.
"I want injured workers to have a system that processes claims quickly, gets them fair compensation and healthy and back to work," Fallin said. "Our old system was not doing that. It was slow, inefficient, and riddled with fraud. Moving to an administrative system of mediation run by administrative law judges opposed to a litigious system dominated by lawsuits and trial attorneys is better for workers and employees."
