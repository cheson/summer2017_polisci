A new report by Standard & Poor's, a national financial research firm, predicts that Oklahoma will be one of four states to lead the nation in economic growth next year. The report forecasts how the national economy is expected to fare through the remainder of this year and into the next. It predicts Oklahoma's economic output will grow by more than 3.5 percent.
Governor Mary Fallin said the report was another sign that Oklahoma's economy is once again moving in the right direction and continues to grow.
"This report from Standard & Poor's is another indication that Oklahoma's economy is back on track and our families and businesses are doing better," said Fallin. "Since 2011 we've created over 102,000 jobs, seen median household income grow at twice the national average, and replenished the Rainy Day Fund from just $2.03 to over $530 million. Our job now is to continue that forward momentum, and it is great news to see organizations like Standard & Poor's predicting that Oklahoma will continue to be a leader in economic growth and prosperity."
