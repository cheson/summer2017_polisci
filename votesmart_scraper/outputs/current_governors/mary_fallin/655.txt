Press Release

Governor Mary Fallin today signed into law House Bill 1665, a measure that suspends the Art in Public Places Act. In the last three fiscal years, the act set aside a total of $3.4 million to be spent on public art alone as part of various public building projects, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society.
"While we all appreciate the aesthetic and cultural value art can bring to public building projects, it's not appropriate to set aside millions of dollars for public art when the state is facing a $500 million budget deficit," Fallin said. "By suspending the Art in Public Places Act, we will be able to save tax dollars by reducing the overall costs of public building projects for the immediate future."
HB 1665 suspends the requirements of the Art in Public Places Act for state agencies during fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014.
