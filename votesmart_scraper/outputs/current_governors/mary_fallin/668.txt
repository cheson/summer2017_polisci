Governor Mary Fallin today signed into law Senate Bill 406, a measure adding further restrictions to funeral protests.
The bill, by Sen. Josh Brecheen of Coalgate and Rep. Dustin Roberts of Durant, would prohibit protests within two hours before or after a funeral. SB 406 also bans such protests from within 1,000 feet of a funeral. Previous law allowed protests to occur within 500 feet.
"Protesting a funeral for political purposes is an abhorrent and disgusting practice," Fallin said. "While such distasteful protests have been ruled constitutionally protected and cannot be legally prohibited, this legislation will help protect grieving families from people who are looking to exploit their suffering."
