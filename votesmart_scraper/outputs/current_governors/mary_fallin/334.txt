Governor Mary Fallin Issues Statement on Same-Sex Marriage Ruling
Statement
By: Mary Fallin

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement in response to a ruling from 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals striking down Oklahoma's constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman.
"In 2004, voters had an opportunity to decide whether or not to allow same-sex marriage in Oklahoma. Seventy-six percent voted not to, and to instead define marriage as the union between one man and one woman. I was one of the many voters who cast my ballot in favor of traditional marriage.
"Today's ruling is another instance of federal courts ignoring the will of the people and trampling on the right of states to govern themselves. In this case, two judges have acted to overturn a law supported by Oklahomans. Their decision will be appealed and, I hope, overturned. As governor, I will continue to fight back against our federal government when it seeks to ignore or change laws written and supported by Oklahomans."
