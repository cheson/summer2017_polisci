Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today signed legislation giving school districts throughout the state the ability to expand public education options and create charter schools. Senate Bill 782 amends the current law, which allowed the creation of charter schools only in Oklahoma and Tulsa counties.
"This legislation provides more local control for parents and school administrators," said Fallin. "Increasing education options will give students greater opportunities to succeed in the classroom and allow students to graduate with skill-sets necessary to go to college or into a career."
SB 782 will give parents and school boards greater opportunity to address the educational needs of young people. Charter schools give parents more choices for their children and encourage innovation.
SB 782 was authored by Sen. Clark Jolley and House Speaker Pro Tem Lee Denney. It will take effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns.
