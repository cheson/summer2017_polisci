From the Edmond Sun: Taking Action on Energy Policy a Must

You may have read or heard that I have cosponsored three bills that would dramatically increase American energy production. Taken together, the legislation would open portions of both the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas production as well as repeal limitations on the development of American oil shale.
With gasoline prices continuing to rise this summer, Congress no longer can afford inaction. American families need a bold, far-reaching energy policy addressing rising gasoline prices and our dependence on foreign oil.
These three bills are the first step in that new policy. Ending these needless restrictions on our energy production can produce millions of barrels of oil each day. Experts tell us we have enough oil right here in the United States to power 60 million cars for 60 years and enough natural gas to heat 60 million homes for 120 years.
Dramatically and proactively increasing our energy supply will boost our national security by lessening our unhealthy addiction to foreign oil. It will strengthen our economy by fighting rising gasoline prices and creating thousands of new jobs. Finally, it will help to ensure our long-term energy security by providing a huge new source of funding for the research into and production of alternative energies.
I hope with increased temperatures this summer, we can heat up the debate on energy issues, and make progress on a realistic energy policy.
