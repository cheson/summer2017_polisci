Fallin Joins GOP Leaders in Calling for Federal Action on Immigration, Other Issues

U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, joined Members of the House Republican Leadership today in calling for legislative action on key issues. Republican Whip Roy Blunt and Conference Leader Adam Putnam both criticized the Democrat leadership for failing to send a single spending measure to the President's desk this year and setting the stage for a fiscal crisis.
Fallin, speaking after Blunt and Putnam, echoed their call for Democrat leaders to seek bipartisan compromise and immediate progress on important issues.
"Almost 50% of our work this year has been naming post offices and federal buildings," said Fallin. "Those are nice things to do, but its time that we get on with the more important business of this Congress, whether that's helping American families with the price of gas, lowering their healthcare costs, or strengthening education."
"One of the things we've been frustrated by in Oklahoma," said Fallin, "is the lack of any real immigration reform. Just last week, the state of Oklahoma enacted an immigration law that is being labeled as one of the toughest in the nation.
"We had to enact that law on the state level because the House has yet to bring a solid immigration bill to the floor. We have yet to secure our borders, provide employers with a way to verify the citizenship of their employees, or punish those employers who knowingly hire illegals."
Fallin went on to express her disappointment that "Congress has not yet gotten its house in order" and called on Democrat leaders to bring bipartisan immigration reform to the floor of the House.
