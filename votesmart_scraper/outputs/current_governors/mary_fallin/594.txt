Gov. Mary Fallin said Thursday that she is proposing an income tax cut for the majority of Oklahomans.
"I believe this will be one of the boldest tax reform plans we have seen in our state's history," Fallin said. "It will give us one of the lowest income tax rates in our nation."
More details are expected to be released Monday when the governor gives her State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature.
Several measures dealing with taxes have already been filed for consideration by lawmakers when they return to the Capitol for the second session of the 53rd Legislature.
Fallin said her proposal will be funded largely by eliminating several tax credits. She is expected to release a specific list Monday.
"We are not going to eliminate all of them, but we are certainly providing a significant list of tax credits," Fallin said.
The governor said her proposal would take effect Jan. 1, 2013, and would provide "immediate relief." It would not be funded on the backs of the poor or result in starving core governmental services, she said.
Fallin also is proposing a reduction in the state's tax brackets from seven to three to simplify the tax code.
