Congresswoman Mary Fallin's statement on Senator John McCain's Acceptance Speech
Campaign Release
"Senator John McCain presented a bold and exciting new agenda to the American people tonight, solidifying his reputation as a maverick and a reformer. The delegates here in Minnesota saw a man of principle, experience and vision. Most of all, we saw a man ready to lead this country at a pivotal time in our history.
My confidence in John McCain extends well beyond his remarks tonight. John McCain has shown courage in the face of adversity, both in Hanoi and later in the United States Senate. He has promoted reform in the face of powerful special interests, moving the government away from Washington lobbyists and closer to the American people. Most importantly, he is a true patriot who has always and will always put country first. I am proud to have John McCain leading my party and, come Novemnber, I will be proud to call him my President."
