Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin issued an executive order today declaring a state of emergency to deal with a depleted supply of propane available in Oklahoma.
The order waives licensing requirements for eligible out-of-state propane transporters so they can bring the fuel into Oklahoma because of a temporary shortage of the fuel throughout the state.
It also allows truck drivers to exceed the number of hours and consecutive days they can transport propane in Oklahoma.
Extreme winter conditions in Oklahoma along with multiple winter storms that brought significant amounts of snow, ice and freezing rain across the state has caused a spike in demand for the delivery of residential and commercial propane gas, according to the executive order. Many Oklahoma residents depend on propane and the effects of the shortage are being felt across the state.
"This executive order will help make sure that there is enough of a propane supply in the days and weeks ahead until problems are resolved," said Fallin.
Propane is commonly used for heating homes in rural areas not served by natural gas. There are approximately 400,000 propane consumers in Oklahoma.
The executive order is effective through Feb. 4. Governors in 15 other states have issued similar executive orders.
