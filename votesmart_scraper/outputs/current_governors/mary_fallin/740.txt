As Oklahoma's families and businesses file their federal income taxes, Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today renewed her calls for fiscal discipline in Washington and tax relief for working Americans. Fallin released the following statement:
"As American families and small businesses struggle to balance their checkbooks each month, this administration has stuck with just two accounting strategies: "charge it' or make somebody else pay for it. Since taking office, President Obama has raised taxes by a total of $670 billion, $316 billion of which has fallen squarely on the backs of middle class American families. Their big-government, big-spending agenda that increases taxes and adds to government debt has discouraged the kind of economic growth and innovation that will create good jobs in Oklahoma and throughout the nation.
"This administration is kicking the can down the road by financing their big-government agenda on the backs of our children and grandchildren. It's time for a reality check. You can't rack up a record $1.5 trillion worth of debt and expect someone else to pay when the bill comes due. American taxpayers don't balance their checkbooks this way, and neither should their federal government.
"It's time for this administration to take a page out of the average American's book and start making the tough financial decisions that families and small businesses make every day. We can never tax and spend our way to economic growth and job creation. The answer is fiscal discipline in Washington and tax relief for working Americans, which I will continue to fight for on behalf of my fellow Oklahomans."
