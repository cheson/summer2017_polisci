Issue Position: Second Amendment Rights
I believe strongly that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees Americans the right to bear arms. To deny this right would be to strip us of one of our most basic freedoms.
In Congress, I will continue to oppose any and all efforts to deny this right.
