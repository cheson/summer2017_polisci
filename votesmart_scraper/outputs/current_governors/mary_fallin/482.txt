Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: March 28, 2013
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today announced the state of Oklahoma has requested a major disaster declaration from the federal government related to the February 24-26 winter storm.
If approved, the designation would deliver federal funding to assist municipalities, counties and rural electric cooperatives with infrastructure repairs and costs associated with responding to the storm.
"Areas of Oklahoma were inundated with heavy snow during this weather event, causing widespread infrastructure damage and resulting in significant costs related to emergency response," Fallin said. "The disaster declaration will provide assistance to help municipalities, counties and rural electric cooperatives in the affected areas to cover the costs associated with responding to this significant winter storm."
The counties included in this request are: Alfalfa, Beaver, Beckham, Blaine, Custer, Dewey, Ellis, Garfield, Grant, Kay, Kingfisher, Major, Noble, Roger Mills, Washita, Woods, and Woodward.
In these counties alone, the storm resulted in an estimated $7.5 million in infrastructure damage and response costs.
Additional counties may be added to the request at a later date should conditions warrant.
