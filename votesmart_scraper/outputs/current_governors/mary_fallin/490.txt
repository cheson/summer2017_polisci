Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: March 5, 2013
Location: Norman, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today signed an executive order authorizing the creation of a new Blue Ribbon Panel for Developmental Disabilities. The announcement came today during the Governor's Conference on Developmental Disabilities in Norman, Oklahoma.
The new panel will develop a comprehensive plan to: support individuals with developmental disabilities and their families, address the state's growing waiting list of thousands of individuals hoping to receive services from the state's Developmental Disabilities Service Division, and research and analyze best practices for the comprehensive delivery of high quality services. The panel will also act in an advisory capacity to the governor on all issues related to providing community services for individuals with developmental disabilities.
"There are nearly 60,000 men, women and children with developmental disabilities in Oklahoma," Fallin said. "While the state is providing high quality services to many of these individuals, we are still experiencing a waiting list of over 7,000 people. This panel will help the state reduce that waiting list while improving the quality of the services it offers."
