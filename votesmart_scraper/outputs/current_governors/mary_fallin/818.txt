Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act of 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2009)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Chairman, I too would like to offer my support for H.R. 2352, the Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act, and to thank Chairwoman Vel√°zquez and Ranking Member Graves for their work in crafting a bipartisan piece of legislation that incorporates several important pieces of small business legislation and work.
Especially at a time when our national economy is struggling, and the American people have asked us here in Congress to focus on economic recovery, this bill will provide important job creation opportunities for our Nation's entrepreneurs.
And I'd especially like to thank our chairwoman and our ranking member for allowing a piece of my legislation, H.R. 1838, the SBA Women's Business Centers Improvement Act, to be included in the Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act. This section of legislation adds accountability and transparency to the distribution of funding to Women's Business Centers to offer temporary assistance rather than permanent dependency on the Federal Government.
The Women's Business Centers are an important part of the grant programs that are funded by the Small Business Administration. Today, Women's Business Centers all across the country are providing women entrepreneurs with much-needed technical assistance in starting and operating their own small businesses.
