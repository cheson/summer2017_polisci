Governor Mary Fallin today commented on measures passed by the Oklahoma State Senate to improve service offered at the state's veteran centers:
"The brave men and women who have served in our nation's Armed Services deserve nothing but the best. I want to thank Senator Frank Simpson and others in the Oklahoma Senate for their work to reform the Oklahoma Department of Veterans Affairs in order to deliver better services and safer facilities to Oklahoma's veterans. I look forward to working with the Legislature on additional reforms to the ODVA that will provide every Oklahoma veteran an opportunity to achieve their fullest potential."
