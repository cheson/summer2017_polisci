Issue Position: Homeland Security and Defense
Homeland security and national defense are priorities for me. Our nation is currently fighting a global War on Terror, and we must ensure that our military has the tools that it needs to continue to be the greatest military force in the world. That starts with fully funding our military. Since coming to Washington, I have co-sponsored legislation to ensure that Congress supports our men and women in the field, and will continue to fight to make sure that it does.
I have also worked to ensure that the President and our generals in the field are able to make decisions to fight the War on Terror without being hamstrung by congressional meddling. While congressional oversight is necessary and desirable, it is important to recognize that we cannot wage war by committee.
