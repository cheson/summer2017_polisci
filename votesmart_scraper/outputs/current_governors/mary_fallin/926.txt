Fallin Joins GOP Freshmen in Calling for Bipartisan Cooperation on Budget, Other Issues

U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, joined other Republican Freshmen Members of the House today in calling for bipartisanship cooperation and progress on key issues. Fallin and the other Members criticized House leadership for failing to pass a budget this late in the year, as well as for failing to act on pressing issues like illegal immigration and rising energy prices.
"One of the most basic constitutional responsibilities Congress has is to fund the federal government," said Fallin. "So far, we've only gotten one out of twelve appropriations bills signed into law." Fallin blamed the budget failure on partisan gridlock and criticized majority leaders for writing bills in secret, a practice that gives most Members little or no input.
She went on to say that Congress' continued inaction means important issues go neglected, citing children's healthcare, gas prices, and funding for American veterans and troops in the field.
Addressing the rising cost of living, Fallin said, "Democratic leaders are ignoring the stress that our families are placed under. Families want progress, not political games."
