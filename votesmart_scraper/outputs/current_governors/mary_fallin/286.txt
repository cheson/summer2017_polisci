Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement after Deaconess Hospital in Oklahoma City confirmed a patient being monitored for Ebola-like symptoms was not at risk of contracting the virus. There are currently no patients identified as Ebola threats in the state of Oklahoma.
"I am relieved -- as is everyone -- that the sick patient at Deaconess Hospital is not at risk for the Ebola virus.
"My thanks go out to the staff at Deaconess for their professionalism and their preparation. Oklahoma health care professionals know that Ebola is a risk. They are trained to respond to Ebola threats, to treat Ebola patients and to isolate and contain any infectious diseases.
"Today that training paid off. Hospital officials coordinated with the Oklahoma State Department of Health and the Center for Disease Control to ensure all proper protocols and safety precautions were followed. Should this have been Ebola, the disease would have been properly isolated and treated.
"The state of Oklahoma has put in place a robust set of procedures in the unlikely event we do have an Oklahoman get sick with the Ebola virus. Health officials have been working non-stop with Oklahoma health care providers and entities to ensure we are ready for any potential Ebola-linked threat."
