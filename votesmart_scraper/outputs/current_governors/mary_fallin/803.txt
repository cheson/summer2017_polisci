Government Health Care = Rationed Health Care
By Representative Mary Fallin
Congress is about to begin debating health care reform. We know it's needed, but the devil is in the details - especially those surrounding the administration's proposal for a "Medicare for all" public health insurance program that would quickly come to dominate health insurance in America.
The financial costs would be enormous Â— ranging from $1 trillion to $1.6 trillion, depending on various estimates. That would almost certainly mean new and higher taxes, but what of the human costs of government-run health care?
The experience in other nations with national health care programs is troublesome. Government health care is always rationed health care. As bureaucrats assume more and more power, decisions that were once left to doctors and patients are federalized. That includes decisions over what treatments patients can or cannot receive.
Here are some examples of the results of government-managed health care in other nations:
Mavis Skeet had cancer of the esophagus. She asked Britain's national health care system for surgery in 2000. Her initial tests showed the cancer had not spread, but a shortage of beds postponed her surgery for four weeks. She died six months later.
Diane Gorsuch lived in Canada. She needed heart surgery to live. Diane died after waiting two years for an operation American hospitals can perform on 24 hours notice.
Brian Booy was also British and also needed heart surgery. He waited for triple bypass surgery for 18 months and finally suffered a fatal heart attack. A year later his widow finally received a letter that his operation had been approved.
Suzanne Aucoin was Canadian. She had advanced colon cancer, and her doctor wanted to try a new anti-cancer drug called Erbitux. Canadian health care bureaucrats denied her, saying the drug was not on their list of approved medications.
Karine Lachappelle went to a Montreal hospital to have her baby. Because there were only two nurses on duty due to government-mandated staffing rules, she waited and waited in the labor room. Ultimately she and her partner delivered the baby themselves, alone in a hospital room, frantically pushing the call button to summon nurses who never came.
Alice Mahon suffered from macular degeneration, a condition that can lead to total blindness. There's an advanced drug for it, but Britain's NHS refused to fund it for Alice. They have a program called National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) that determines what treatments can or cannot be offered to patients.
The Obama administration wants to create a similar government program here. NICE was not nice to Alice. She has had to threaten to sue the NHS for their neglect.
By the way, Alice Mahon was once a member of Britain's House of Parliament. She said she had been "an ardent supporter of the NHS, and now feels totally let down." She and many others learned too late that government health care is rationed, inefficient and sometimes deadly.
As the debate in Congress heats up, I will continue to oppose any attempts to establish a government run healthcare system that would lead to these types of horror stories here in the United States. We need to improve access, affordability and the quality of our medical care, but we can't do that by elbowing doctors aside and replacing them with bureaucrats.
