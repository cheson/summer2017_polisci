As a result of the Oklahoma Supreme Court dissolving its stay of execution for two inmates, Governor Mary Fallin said today the state is proceeding with plans to execute both men by lethal injection on Tuesday, April 29.
The Supreme Court ruled last night that the rights of inmates Clayton Derrell Lockett and Charles Frederick Warner were not being violated. The court's ruling means that the executions of the two convicted murderers can proceed.
"This ruling shows that our legal system works," said Fallin. "The defendants had their day in court. The court has made a decision. Two men that do not contest their guilt in heinous murders will now face justice, and the families and friends of their victims will now have closure."
The state Department of Corrections is working on specifics and logistics of how both executions will be carried out Tuesday.
Both inmates challenged their executions on the grounds they needed information on the supplier of the execution drugs. The identity of the drug supplier is confidential under state law.
Lockett was convicted of a 1999 fatal shooting of a woman and Warner was convicted of killing his girlfriend's baby daughter in 1997.
