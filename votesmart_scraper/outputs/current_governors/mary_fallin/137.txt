Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today filed an executive order directing state agencies to dispose of any underused property and buildings to generate revenue to pay for the maintenance of state buildings and help offset projected state revenue shortfalls. Her order includes undeveloped land as well as unused or underused office buildings, warehouses and residences.
"Disposing of underutilized property will reduce costs and ensure our taxpayer dollars are going towards the core government services that Oklahomans rely on," said Fallin. "That is especially important as we approach what we know will be a tough budget year."
