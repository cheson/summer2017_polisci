Location: Washington, DC

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) issued the following statement following the inaugural address by President Obama:
"The President's emphasis today on personal responsibility and unity was encouraging. Part of the genius of the American system is our ability to transfer power peacefully from one elected administration to the next. We saw that today, and it was truly an honor to be present in Washington for the inaugural ceremonies.
"We have much to do in the months ahead. While I am sure many of us will be at odds with some of the new administration's policies, we can disagree without being disagreeable. I am anxious to see what concrete proposals President Obama brings to Congress to deal with the economic crisis and to assure that America remains safe from foreign threats."
