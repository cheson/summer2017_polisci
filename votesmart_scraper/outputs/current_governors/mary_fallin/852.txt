Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) addressed a crowd of thousands of pro-life activists at today's March for Life. The pro-life demonstration is an annual event taking place on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision.
"I want to thank all the families who came to the Capitol to fight for the cause of Life," said Fallin. "Thousands of people stood in the cold today, talking to their Congressmen, to the media and to passersby, reminding them and this country of a fundamental truth: that every human being possesses an inalienable right to life. Thirty-six years after the infamous Roe v. Wade decision, that right continues to be trampled."
"I stand with the men, women and children who participated in today's March for Life, who continue to hope and pray this grave injustice will be corrected and our laws will someday soon reflect those principles which our nation has traditionally held most dear."
