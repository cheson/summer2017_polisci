Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today signed HB 1007, a bill protecting religious leaders from being compelled to perform marriages that are in direct contradiction to their religious beliefs. The bill states, "No regularly licensed, ordained or authorized official of any religious organization shall be required to solemnize or recognize any marriage that violates the official's conscience or religious beliefs."
Fallin said the bill was an important measure protecting the Constitutional and religious rights of Oklahomans.
"This bill makes it clear that the government can never compel our religious leaders or houses of worship to act in violation of their faith where marriage is concerned," said Fallin. "I am proud to join our Legislature in taking a strong stand in defense of religious liberty and the freedoms awarded to all American citizens by the U.S. Constitution."
