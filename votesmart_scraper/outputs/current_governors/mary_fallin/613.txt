Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to hear arguments on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), President Obama's controversial health care law:
"President Obama's health care law is unconstitutional and unaffordable. Not only will it limit choice and undermine the quality of American health care, it stands to cost the state of Oklahoma about half a billion dollars in the process.
"Our citizens have already passed a constitutional amendment blocking its implementation in Oklahoma, and it's clear that a majority of states are similarly opposed to the mandates, new taxes, and out-of-control spending proposed in the law.
"The Supreme Court should strike down the president's health care reform as unconstitutional as soon as possible. The uncertainty surrounding the future of PPACA is frustrating to those who believe it stands as an obvious affront to constitutional principles, and a hindrance to crafting serious budget and health care policy on both the state and federal levels."
