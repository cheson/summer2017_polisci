Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin and the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety (DPS) announced today that Oklahoma has received an extension through October 10, 2016, to meet the requirements in the REAL ID Act. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security informed the state in a letter that "for the duration of this extension, Federal agencies may accept Oklahoma-issued drivers' licenses and identification cards for official purposes in accordance with the phased enforcement schedule and existing agency policies."
"This is great news for Oklahomans and means there will be no restrictions on individuals using Oklahoma licenses to fly or access federal buildings through October 10 of next year," said Fallin. "In the meantime, I will work this legislative session with the Legislature, DPS, Oklahoma's Congressional delegation and the Department of Homeland Security on a permanent solution."
