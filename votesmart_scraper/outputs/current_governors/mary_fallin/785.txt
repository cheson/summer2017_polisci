Fallin Statement On President Obama's Remarks
After President Obama's address to a joint session of Congress this evening, Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) released the following statement:
"It's clear President Obama isn't listening to the American people. Americans have made it perfectly clear they do not support a big government bureaucracy public option that will compete with the private sector health insurance market place, add new taxes and fees or mandate coverage as a part of health care reform.
"The president seemed strident in his comments directed to those who disagree with his health care proposals saying, 'If you misrepresent what's in this plan, we will call you out.'
"We all agree that much needs to be done to lower the costs of health care for all Americans, but replacing your family's health care with government run care is the wrong prescription for reform.
"I am steadfast in my support for ensuring affordable access to quality health care for all Americans, but believe this goal can be achieved through common-sense, market-based solutions that keep Washington out of the doctor's office. "
