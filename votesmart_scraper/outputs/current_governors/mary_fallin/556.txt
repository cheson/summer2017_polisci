Governor Fallin Signs into Law Energy Efficiency Measure
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: May 8, 2012
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Fallin today signed into law Senate Bill 1096, a bill that directs all state agencies and higher education institutions to achieve at least 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency and conservation by the year 2020. The governor first outlined the initiative in her Oklahoma First Energy Plan and asked the Legislature this year in her State of the State address to write the plan into law.
"Senate Bill 1096 outlines several common sense energy conservation policies for state agencies and higher education institutions that will save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars," Fallin said. "My goal has always been to deliver a government that is smaller, smarter and more cost efficient. By pursuing these energy conservation reforms, we will be able to do just that."
Estimates indicate savings from SB 1096 could range from $300 to $500 million over 10 years.
"Up until now, hundreds of millions of dollars each year have been wasted on practices like keeping the lights on in empty government buildings. We can now expect that money either to be returned to taxpayers or to fund core services like education, transportation, public safety and health care," Fallin said.
SB 1096 was sponsored by Senate President Pro Tempore Brian Bingman and Representative Scott Martin.

"I want to thank Pro Tem Bingman and Rep. Martin for their leadership in guiding SB 1096 through the legislative process," Fallin said.
