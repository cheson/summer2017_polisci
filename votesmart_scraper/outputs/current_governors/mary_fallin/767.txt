Fallin Says Key To Afghanistan Success Is Commitment
Statement

Location: Washington D.C.

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) tonight released the following statement after President Obama presented his chosen strategy in Afghanistan before the United States Military Academy at West Point.
"This year has marked the deadliest for our troops in Afghanistan since 2001. It has become increasingly clear to me that the resurgence of Taliban and al-Qaeda activity in Afghanistan requires a strong response, both by the United States and our NATO allies.
"While I am encouraged by the President's decision to increase and strengthen our resources on the ground, I remain concerned about whether 30,000 troops is enough man power to do what we set out to do and defeat the Taliban. I am also disheartened by this Administration's willingness to put an expiration date on this mission, once again demonstrating their lack of resolve in this region.
"Returning Afghanistan to its former status as a base for terrorists threatens all of Western civilization, which is why the President and his administration must demonstrate a firm commitment to wiping out this threat and ensuring our troops have the resources they need to stay safe and carry out their mission to the end."
