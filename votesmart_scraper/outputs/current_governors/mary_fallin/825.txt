Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) expressed her support this morning for a new, comprehensive energy proposal recently unveiled by the Republican Study Committee (RSC). Fallin, who serves as the RSC's Communications Chairwoman and is a member of the American Energy Solutions Group, said the plan would boost the economy, help to keep gas prices low and put the United States on the road to energy independence.
"The RSC proposal - the American Energy Innovation Act - provides a comprehensive set of policies that will secure our energy future and help grow our economy," said Fallin. "Our plan encourages innovation through entrepreneurship and reduces the financial, regulatory and legal burdens that stifle progress in energy markets. It uses tax cuts and other incentives to reduce demand and promote greater efficiency. Finally, it removes government barriers to environmentally responsible production of energy resources in Alaska, the Outer Continental Shelf and elsewhere."
An outline of the American Energy Innovation Act, which Fallin is a cosponsor of, can be viewed on the Republican Study Committee Website.
Fallin presented this new plan as an alternative to legislation currently being considered by House Democrats, commonly referred to as "cap and trade."
"'Cap and trade' may be well intentioned, but the consequences of implementing huge new tax increases on the energy industry will be devastating to our economy, particularly in Oklahoma," said Fallin. "Experts estimate the U.S. may lose as many as seven million jobs. Utility and energy costs will skyrocket, raising prices for the average family by as much as $3100 per year. Our dependence on foreign oil will grow worse, our economy will become more unstable and American families will pay the price."
