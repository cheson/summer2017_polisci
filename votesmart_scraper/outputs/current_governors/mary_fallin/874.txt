Fallin Calls Highway Funding Action by Senate Imperative'

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today urged swift Senate action on a financial fix for the troubled Highway Trust Fund (HTF) after state transportation officials were forced to delay work on a number of major road projects. The balance of the HTF has dropped quickly and dangerously in the last two months, moving from $4.2 billion to less than 1.4 billion at the beginning of September.
Following a Friday call by Transportation Secretary Mary Peters warning of the early depletion of state funds, Oklahoma officials decided to delay funding for future construction projects, including the Interstate 40/Crosstown Expressway in Oklahoma City. While the House has passed legislation to protect the solvency of the fund, the bill has yet to come to a vote in the Senate.
"The House has taken action to provide a short term fix for highway funding, but it is imperative for the Senate to step up before Congress recesses at the end of September," Fallin said. As a member of the House Transportation Committee, Fallin helped push the $8 billion funding fix to a bipartisan floor vote in July.
"I know Senator Jim Inhofe is working hard to get a Senate vote," she said. The funds would make up a shortfall resulting from lower federal fuel tax revenues collection, a reaction to higher gas prices.
"Oklahoma transportation officials took the only appropriate action, as painful as these delays may be," she said. "We cannot spend money we don't have. Our job in Washington now is to fix the problem in a hurry, and I will make that a top priority."
