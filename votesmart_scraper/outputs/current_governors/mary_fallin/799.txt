Spending Spree In Congress
Floor Speech

Ms. FALLIN. American families have taken a hit time and time again, and they are hurting. The stock market has tanked, gas prices spiked, hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost, and unemployment has soared.
It is no secret that we need to reform our Nation's health care system and provide relief to American families throughout this country by helping them with access to affordable health care and quality coverage for healthy living. But we can't do this unless we rein in the excessive costs and prevent an explosive deficit in spending.
In just 7 months, this House passed an energy bill that will cost American families $846 billion in new taxes and a $1 trillion economic stimulus bill that is yet to create the jobs it was predicted to do. Our national debt now stands at $11.5 trillion.
House leaders now have been on a spending spree and are about to raise taxes even higher for this health care reform bill. This approach is wrong, and the American people know it.
Mr. Speaker, with all this spending in this bill, I cannot find a sincere attempt to rein in the cost and increase access to quality care. I only see more regulation, less choice, and major tax increases on families and businesses. There are market-based solutions to provide affordable health care and to make it more portable and to have quality access to quality care.
Unless we are able to reform this health care system, it is going to be another spending spree here in Congress.
