The Army Clemency and Parole Board today reduced the sentence of First Lieutenant Michael Behenna from 20 to 15 years. 1LT Behenna, who is currently serving his sentence at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, was convicted of unpremeditated murder while serving in Iraq. Previous cases of similar or more aggravating circumstances, where the defendants were found guilty of premeditated murder, have resulted in less severe sentences, which prompted the Oklahoma Congressional Delegation to appeal to the Clemency Board for a careful review of this case and relevant precedent.
"I appreciate the clemency board's review of the facts and circumstances of 1LT Behenna's case," said Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05). "This review is designed to ensure each of our service members is given full and fair review of the facts surrounding their case. We owe nothing less to our brave men and women in uniform than to be certain due process is satisfied and justice is distributed in a fair and equitable manner. As 1LT Behenna continues his appeals process, I will continue to monitor this matter to ensure he is provided every right under the Uniform Code of Military Justice."
"I am grateful the clemency board considered and reviewed Lieutenant Behenna's case," U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe said. "I appreciate the Behenna family's service to our country. Lieutenant Behenna could not have had a stronger advocate than Vicki Behenna. She provided compelling arguments on her son's behalf. I am thankful to have been able to help in this difficult process, and work with the entire Oklahoma delegation on this matter. I will continue to follow this case."
