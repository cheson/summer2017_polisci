Mary's Minutes: John McCain made a great choice in Sarah Palin
Rep. Mary' Fallin's statement on the nomination of Gov. Sarah Palin as the Republican Nominee for Vice President of the United States:
"The country witnessed a historic moment Wednesday night as the first woman on a GOP presidential ticket had the eyes of the world upon her. Governor Sarah Palin delivered a stirring speech, reminding us all why she has quickly become one of the most popular and successful policy makers in the nation. Her bedrock conservative principles, her record of reform and her willingness to stand up to the special interests make her an excellent addition to the ticket.
John McCain made a great choice in Sarah Palin, and I am proud to be supporting a strong woman, a successful executive and a loving mother for Vice President.
We saw history in the making today, and the convention delegates are riding a wave of excitement into the last day of the convention, when Senator McCain will accept the Republican nomination and present his vision of a peaceful and prosperous United States of America."
