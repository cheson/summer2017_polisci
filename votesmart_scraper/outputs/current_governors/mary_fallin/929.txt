Fallin Calls for Energy Plan that Reduces Foreign Dependency on Oil, Lowers Gas Prices

Mary Fallin, R-OK, called today for a realistic energy policy that reduces American dependence on foreign energy and provides relief to consumers. Her announcement came shortly before an expected vote on Nancy Pelosi's energy bill, which Fallin indicated she would not support. Fallin and several other Republican Members spent the early part of the afternoon attending a hearing on energy policy in which several industry experts recommended increasing production of domestic energy. The expert witnesses also warned against provisions in Speaker Pelosi's energy plan, saying they would increase energy prices and American dependence on foreign oil.
Following the hearing, Fallin released the following statement:
"After listening to the expert testimony given at our hearing, I am even more convinced that Speaker Pelosi's energy plan would take our nation in the wrong direction.
"Experts have concluded the only way to lower energy prices and reduce our dependence on foreign oil is to increase production of our domestic energy supplies. Speaker Pelosi's plan would do just the opposite.
"At a time when Oklahoma families are struggling with gasoline prices and the cost of heating oil, I take issue with any legislation that will further drive up costs. For the sake of our economic well being and our national security, we must pursue a common sense plan that provides incentives for increased domestic energy production. In the short term, that means oil and natural gas. In the future, that means dedicating resources to the development of alternative energy sources like ethanol, wind, solar and nuclear power."
