Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement following President Barack Obama's State of the Union Address:
"Tonight we heard the same thing from President Obama that we've been hearing since he took office: proposals for more spending and bigger government. Like in previous speeches, the president paid lip service to reducing the federal deficit, but has not presented a serious plan to do so.
"Unfortunately, it is American families and businesses that are bearing the brunt of these failed policies and stale ideas. Almost two million more Americans are out of work today than when the president was sworn in. Even when his administration is given a golden opportunity to aid in significant economic growth -- as was the case with the proposed Keystone XL pipeline and its 20,000 shovel-ready jobs -- it is squandered. Unfortunately, it seems the president is intent on continuing down a path that will only lead to more debt and less job creation.
"It is clear by now that President Obama believes more taxes, more spending and more borrowing is an effective recipe for economic success. This is especially frustrating because Oklahoma has proven the opposite to be true. By reducing our income tax, balancing our budget, pursuing a pro-business legislative agenda and supporting the production of American made energy, we have benefitted from impressive job creation, double digit growth in tax revenue and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation.
"The president's policies are failing. States like Oklahoma, on the other hand, serve as a reminder that small government, conservative solutions are succeeding in creating jobs where the White House is not."
