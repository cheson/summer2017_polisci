Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin, state Representative Mike Ritze and the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs (OCPA) announced today the relocation of the Ten Commandments monument from the Oklahoma State Capitol to OCPA's campus, located on private property ten blocks south of the capitol complex.
"My thanks go out to OCPA for providing a temporary home for the Ten Commandments Monument that is easily accessible to those visiting the State Capitol," said Fallin.
"Moving forward, I believe the people of Oklahoma should have the opportunity to vote on a proposed Constitutional change to ensure that historical monuments like this one are not pushed out of public spaces. I strongly encourage lawmakers to take up this issue in the next legislative session."
