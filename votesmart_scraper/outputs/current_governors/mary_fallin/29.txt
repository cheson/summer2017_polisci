Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued this statement after the Oklahoma Senate voted 35-11 to give final legislative passage to House Bill 1845, which would allow persons to obtain a compliant REAL ID driver's license or identification card:
"I'm pleased to see the Legislature work so quickly on this important issue. We cannot burden Oklahomans with the additional cost and hassle of providing identification to gain entrance to federal buildings, military bases or federal courthouses. And most certainly we can't let them down by forcing them to have additional identification in order to board a commercial airliner in January. I look forward to receiving this bill on my desk."
