Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin called on the Obama Administration today to stop dragging its heels and immediately approve the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Her renewed call to complete the project came after a State Department study reported the pipeline would have little or no affect on global oil consumption or climate change.
The Keystone XL pipeline connects oil reserves in Canada to markets throughout the United States, ending in the Gulf Coast. The pipeline runs through Cushing, Oklahoma.
"The Keystone pipeline project is important to our nation's energy security as well as the individual economies of our states," said Fallin. "In Oklahoma alone, the pipeline represents a billion dollar investment with the potential to create thousands of jobs. We've waited long enough for this to be approved. It's time for President Obama to let common sense prevail and give American workers the green light on this shovel-ready project."
