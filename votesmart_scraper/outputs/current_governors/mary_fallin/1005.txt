Issue Position: Faith
I have faith in Oklahoma, in America and in God. That faith is at the root of my philosophy of what government ought to be and do. I believe faith is the firm foundation our nation was built upon. If we allow that foundation to slowly erode, we are threatening our nation's very future.
My faith leads me to recognize the rights of the unborn and the sanctity of all life. As a pro-life Congresswoman, I have helped to stop legislation that would give taxpayer dollars to foreign organizations that perform abortions.
My faith, as well as my understanding of the Constitution, has also lead me to embrace the role of religion in the public sphere. I oppose activist judges who have tried to ban prayer, Christmas and the Pledge of Allegiance in schools and public places. The First Amendment assures freedom OF religious expression not freedom FROM it.
I believe that our religious institutions can and should be able to work in partnership with government to help those in need. As a federal legislator, I have actively worked to establish this partnership, hosting a special gathering of faith leaders from Oklahoma's Fifth District.
Like my faith in God and my faith in country, I also possess a faith in the great potential of our young people. I see their hopes and dreams in the eyes of my own two children, and will continue to work in Congress to make sure they have every opportunity to succeed.
Faith will always play an important role in my life and will continue to be my guiding force.
