The Christmas season is the most wonderful time of the year. All around are the signs of this incredible celebration--Christmas lights and trees, carols and more. It's a time of honoring traditions with our families while creating new memories.
No matter what your faith, the holiday season is one of selfless joy. No other span on the calendar has the same capacity to inspire goodwill, kindness and hospitality in our hearts and the hearts of those around us.
Still, it's easy to get caught up in the hubbub of the season. Holiday traditions become tasks to check off a list, time with family and friends can be cut short by busy schedules. The joy we should feel is sometimes obscured by the stress of the holidays.
This Christmas, I hope all Oklahomans have the opportunity to slow down and remember that the holiday season is more about spending time with our loved ones and less about spending money in department stores.
Most of us have very few, if any, Christmas presents from childhood. Toys break, get lost or simply lose our interest. But I still have great memories of family and friends from Christmases past. Long after the new presents have lost their luster, we cherish our memories. Such recollections are our best gift to ourselves and to each other.
We should also remember the men and women of the armed forces who are serving overseas and cannot be with their families during this festive time. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them, along with our thanks for their incredible sacrifice on our behalf.
Many of our fellow Oklahomans, too, are struggling to find joy this holiday season. Because of the nationwide economic slump, the need is greater than ever.
