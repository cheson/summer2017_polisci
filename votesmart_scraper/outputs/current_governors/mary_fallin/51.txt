On Aug. 11, the state of Oklahoma, city of Oklahoma City, and the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations reached a settlement to end a water rights and tribal sovereignty dispute stemming back to the 19th century. The settlement acknowledges tribal sovereignty and meets the tribes' conservation guidelines for an area that spans over approximately 22 counties in south-central and southeastern Oklahoma while the state of Oklahoma would continue to manage the state's natural water supply. The deal also guarantees Oklahoma City's long-term access to Southeast Oklahoma as a drinking water source and sets lake limits at levels that meet tribes' recreational, cultural and water use claims. A provision in WRDA 2016 provides for the Congressional approval required for the settlement since it involves the Department of Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers.
"I'm glad the Senate passed this legislation and appreciate Senator Inhofe's efforts to get this matter taken up so quickly. Having a sufficient, reliable supply of water is essential for life, economic development, manufacturing, recreational activities, and important industry sectors like energy and agriculture to name a few. Under the agreement, the state will continue to exercise its authority to manage and protect water resources in Oklahoma. This way, existing uses of water remain secure, and it provides certainty for future development. And the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations will have a voice in specific proceedings addressing water resources within their treaty territories," said Governor Mary Fallin
