Fallin Responds to MoveOn.org; Calls for Vote on Comprehensive Energy Legislation

A recent radio ad launched by the leftwing group MoveOn.org criticizes Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) for supporting the expansion of offshore drilling. Fallin released the following statement in response:
"MoveOn.org's latest ad shines a bright light on the debate over energy. It proves once and for all that leftwing radicals are the ones driving Speaker Pelosi's agenda. As the ad says, I support an energy bill that would open the outer continental shelf to deep sea drilling. However, it fails to mention that I also support measures that would encourage both conservation and the development of alternative energies. I support this comprehensive approach to energy; MoveOn.org and Speaker Nancy Pelosi do not. I support policies that would fight rising gas prices and reduce our dependence on foreign oil; they do not. Polls show a majority of Americans support deep sea drilling, but Nancy Pelosi continues to block a vote on any legislation that would make this drilling possible.
"Ironically, this ad serves as a useful reminder of why Washington has failed to address the current energy crisis. While House Republicans and I continue to push for a comprehensive, Â‘all of the above' energy strategy, leftwing radicals busy themselves with negative advertisements and excuses for their continued inaction.
"It's not surprising that the group that called into question the patriotism and honor of General Petraeus would resort to this desperate ploy, but Speaker Pelosi and other Democrat leaders should be embarrassed. I am ready to come to Washington and vote on a real energy bill, but the Democrat leadership refuses to call the House into session. American families are desperate for Congress to act, but Speaker Pelosi has sent us on vacation. I will take this opportunity to again ask her and other House leaders where they stand - with MoveOn.org, or with the vast majority of Americans worried about gas prices and our energy future?"
