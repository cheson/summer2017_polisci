Governor Mary Fallin today issued this statement on the Release of the A-F school grades:
"Oklahoma's A-F grading system is an important measure of school performance for parents as well as school administrators and teachers. The A-F school grades provide a mechanism for teachers and administrators to compare their schools with others, while providing insight on how they can improve. The grades also let parents know how the schools are performing, while showing other school patrons what supports are needed to help their schools prosper.
"It is not easy to see significant academic gains in academic performance. It takes hard work and leadership from all levels. It is very important to recognize the efforts of numerous schools in the state that continue to demonstrate academic excellence and improved educational outcomes for students as well as identify schools that need improvement. It is especially important to highlight the service our teachers provide. The daily contributions they make and the role they play in educating the future generations of this great state are honorable.
"I remain committed to having a robust assessment of the schools in Oklahoma. I strongly support the continuation of this program, especially the easy-to-understand designation of A-F that provides parents with a clear understanding of how a school is performing. Just as students are graded on the A-F scale, it is important to have a similar designation for parents to understand school performance."
The Oklahoma Legislature passed and Fallin signed legislation adopting the A-F School Grading System in 2011 to provide incentives to schools that challenge their students to reach high levels of college and career readiness.
