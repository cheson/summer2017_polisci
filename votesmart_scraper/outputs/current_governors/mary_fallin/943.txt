Fallin Statement on the Anniversary of 9/11
Congresswoman Mary Fallin (R-OK) issued a statement today on the sixth anniversary of September 11, 2001:
"September 11, 2001 was a day of terrible loss and sadness for our nation. It was also a day of unrivaled heroism. We saw then, much like we saw in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, that our nation, our communities, and our democratic ideals are far more powerful than the hatred that inspires terrorism.
"This is a hard day for the families who lost loved ones on 9/11. Six years after Al Qaeda's vicious assault, we join them in remembering the barbaric cruelty of our attackers and the grief we felt for their victims. We remember and pray for the families who lost loved ones on that day, as we remember and honor those who gave their lives in an effort to save complete strangers from a burning building. Finally, we remember the lessons learned from 9/11, that there are those who hate us for our freedoms, and that those freedoms are worth fighting for."
