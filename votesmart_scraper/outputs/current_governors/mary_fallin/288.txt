Gov. Fallin Responds to SCOTUS Decision to Allow Gay Marriage
Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement in response to the United States Supreme Court's decision to reject the appeal of a lower court ruling striking down an Oklahoma constitutional provision defining marriage as the union between one man and one woman. The Oklahoma amendment passed in 2004 by a vote of the people, with over 75 percent of voters supporting it.
"The people of Oklahoma have the right to determine how marriage is defined. In 2004, Oklahomans exercised that right, voting by a margin of 3-1 to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman.
"The will of the people has now been overridden by unelected federal justices, accountable to no one. That is both undemocratic and a violation of states' rights. Rather than allowing states to make their own policies that reflect the values and views of their residents, federal judges have inserted themselves into a state issue to pursue their own agendas.
"Today's decision has been cast by the media as a victory for gay rights. What has been ignored, however, is the right of Oklahomans -- and Americans in every state -- to write their own laws and govern themselves as they see fit. Those rights have once again been trampled by an arrogant, out-of -control federal government that wants to substitute Oklahoma values with Washington, D.C. values."
