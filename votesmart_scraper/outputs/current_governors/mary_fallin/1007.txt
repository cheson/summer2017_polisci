Issue Position: Freedom
We must never take our freedoms as Americans and as Oklahomans for granted, nor must we ever forget the debt we owe our sons and daughters in the armed forces who fight and die for that freedom.
Supporting the Defenders of Liberty

I support our men and women in uniform, wholeheartedly and without reservation. They are the guardians of our liberty, and they are more than that: they are ambassadors for freedom and democracy throughout the world.
As a Congresswoman, I will never let politics come in the way of supporting our troops, either home or abroad. I have visited our military men and women in Iraq and the wounded veterans in Oklahoma. I will continue to work to ensure that our troops receive the necessary support while deployed abroad, including funding for body armor and IED-resistant Humvees. When they return, I will do everying in my power to ensure they receive worldclass healthcare and help with job placement. The men and women who fight for our freedom should never be shortchanged by budget cuts or partisan politics, and I will work to make sure they never are.
Protecting Freedom Overseas

America is the only nation in world history that mobilized military power to free others. That's what sent our troops ashore at Normandy in 1944, and that is what motivates them today in Afghanistan and Iraq. Regardless of party affiliation on our views on foreign policy, we must never forget that we are the good guys.

In both Iraq and Afghanistan there have been a heartbreaking numbe rof men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to their nation. To ensure their sacrifice was not in vain, I believe we must complete our missions there. I will make it a priority in Congress to see that our troop have the equipment and the support they need to get the job done.
