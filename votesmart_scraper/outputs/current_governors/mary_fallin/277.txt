Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today condemned the violence against the Ten Commandments Monument at the Oklahoma State Capitol and volunteered to help raise private funds to restore it.
"This monument was built to memorialize the historical significance of the Ten Commandments in guiding our own laws and lives," said Fallin. "It is absolutely appalling that someone would vandalize anything at the Oklahoma State Capitol -- the People's Building -- much less a monument of such significance."
The Ten Commandments monument was paid for with private funds from Rep. Mike Ritze. Governor Fallin has offered her assistance to Rep. Ritze to help lead any private fundraising efforts necessary to rebuild the monument.
"Our monument will be rebuilt and restored," said Fallin. "The people of Oklahoma will not stand for acts of violence against the Capitol or its monuments."
"Authorities are currently investigating this criminal act. The person or people responsible for this crime will be caught and held responsible."
