Fallin Joins In Push for American Energy Act

Congresswoman Mary Fallin joined House colleagues today in unveiling the landmark American Energy Act that would increase the supply of American-made energy, improve conservation and efficiency, and promote renewable and alternative energy technologies.
"American families and businesses are being crushed by high gas prices," said Fallin. "They need relief now. The American Energy Act provides that relief by blending new production of traditional fossil fuels with conservation and speedy development of technologies like wind, solar and nuclear energy. It is a landmark piece of legislation that will finally give our nation a coherent and comprehensive national energy policy."
The energy bill would open offshore regions, sections of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and oil shale deposits to environmentally safe drilling; trim red tape that impedes the construction of new refineries; give tax incentives and a cash prize for the development and use of alternative energy sources; create a renewable energy trust fund from new drilling revenues, and promote the expansion of safe nuclear power generation.
"If the dilemma posed by our energy problems is found in a multiple choice question, the clear and obvious answer is Â‘all of the above'," Fallin said. "Tragically, the liberal House leadership continues to block a vote on these issues. While they idly wait for a solution to present itself, American families suffer under skyrocketing energy prices. House Republicans, on the other hand, are presenting a bill that takes into account both current energy needs and the bright energy future of the United States."
