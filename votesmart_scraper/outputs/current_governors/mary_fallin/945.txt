The Oklahoman - Fallin Looks at Where to go from here on Bridge Woes
John Greiner
U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin said Thursday she hopes Congress can develop a plan within a year on how to deal with the nation's aging bridges.
Fallin, an Oklahoma City Republican representing the 5th Congressional District, is the only Oklahoma congressional delegation member on the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
The committee will begin hearings in September on the bridge issues, Fallin said.
Thursday she was briefed by transportation officials Thursday on state bridges and bridge inspections.
She held a news conference with state Transportation Director Gary Ridley under Oklahoma City's Crosstown Expressway near where the bridge was being inspected.
She said Ridley assured her in a meeting that inspection of it is an ongoing process.
Nationally, one in eight bridges is structurally deficient, Fallin said.
"Structurally deficient" means a bridge has deteriorated and needs repairs, but isn't necessarily dangerous.
