Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: May 23, 2016
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today asked for disaster assistance from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to benefit Murray and Garvin counties, which were impacted by tornadoes, severe storms, flooding and straight-line winds that occurred May 9 -13.
The governor in her letter sought assistance for only Murray County, but if it is approved it would cover contiguous counties, including Garvin County, in accordance with SBA guidelines.
Damage assessments showed there were 79 homes and businesses affected by the storms in Murray County. Of those, 32 were destroyed or had major damage.
An additional 14 homes were affected in Garvin County. Two were destroyed or had major damage.
If approved, SBA low-interest disaster loans would be available for eligible homeowners and business owners to replace any storm-damaged property that was not covered by insurance or other assistance programs. The loan program is also available to assist businesses that sustained economic injury due to the storm.
