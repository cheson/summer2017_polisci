Fallin Statement on "Use it or Lose it" Defeat

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today issued the following statement on the House's action to kill the Democrat's latest "use it or lose it" legislation:
"The use it or lose it' bill rejected by Congress today represents an unproductive sideshow at a time when American families are demanding real energy solutions. It is frustrating and mindboggling that the Democrat leadership continues to hold votes on meaningless gimmicks while the price of gasoline goes through the roof.
"I will continue to vote against any energy legislation that does not take meaningful steps towards weaning our nation off foreign oil while fighting rising gasoline prices. The way forward is clear: we can work towards a sustainable and affordable energy future by pursuing all the resources at our disposal, including wind and solar power, nuclear power, biofuels and traditional fossil fuels like oil and natural gas. Unfortunately, use it or lose it' does none of the above. It is my hope that Speaker Pelosi will put a stop to the kind of partisan games that have given rise to this ill-informed legislation and begin work on real energy solutions."
