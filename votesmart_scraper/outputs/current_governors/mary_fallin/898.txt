Fallin Applauds Supreme Court Decision to Strike Down Washington, D.C. Gun Ban

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today issued the following statement praising the U.S. Supreme Court after it overturned Washington, D.C.'s ban on handguns:
"The court made the right decision in upholding the principles of the Second Amendment. Law-abiding Americans have the right to the responsible ownership and use of handguns for sporting purposes and self defense. I am proud of the court majority, which overturned a law that was not only clearly unconstitutional, but out of step with the beliefs of a huge majority of Oklahomans."
