Fallin Urges Congress To Protect Workers' Secret Ballots
Rep. Mary Fallin (R-OK) released a statement today urging her colleagues to protect private-ballot rights of American workers. Those rights are currently being jeopardized by H.R. 800, a measure Congress is voting on today. The so-called "Employee Free Choice Act" would rob individual workers of their right to vote anonymously when deciding to be involved in a union.
"Private ballots protect the free choice and the privacy of Americans in the workplace," Fallin said. "Without that privacy, workers can be subject to intimidation and coercion that pollute the election process."
"At a time when we are spending tremendous resources to support free and fair elections around the world, it is inconceivable that we would taint our own elections at home," Fallin said. "I urge my colleagues to protect the sacred privacy rights of American workers by rejecting H.R. 800."
