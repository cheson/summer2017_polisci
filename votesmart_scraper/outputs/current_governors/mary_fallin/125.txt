Gov. Fallin Forms Fact-finding Group to Look at Ways "Produced Water' Can Be Reused
Statement
By: Mary Fallin

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today announced the formation of a fact-finding work group to look at ways that water produced in oil and natural gas operations may be recycled or reused instead of being injected into underground disposal wells.
The Water for 2060 Produced Water Working Group will be charged with discussing opportunities and challenges associated with treating produced water for beneficial uses, such as industrial use or crop irrigation, Fallin said. Attention will be focused primarily on how water produced from oil and gas activities in north-central Oklahoma can be reused.
"Opening appropriate and environmentally responsible avenues for beneficial use of reclaimed produced water will require coordination across industry sectors and regulatory agencies," said Fallin, who made the announcement during the 36th Annual Oklahoma Governor's Water Conference and Research Symposium underway in Norman.
"In addition to the opportunities to save fresh water by reusing and recycling oil- and gas-produced water, I'm equally interested in looking at alternatives to deep well disposal of this resource," she said. "What a win-win for all if we can turn wasted water into a useful resource, while at the same time reducing seismic activity caused by deep well injection."
