Governor Mary Fallin along with the Department of Human Services today kicked off the Oklahoma Fosters initiative to recruit more foster and adoptive families for children who are in state custody.
"There are nearly 11,000 children in Oklahoma's foster care system and we desperately need the help of our entire communityto care for them," said Fallin. "These children are in state custody through no fault of their own. They need foster families to love and support them during their time of need."
Oklahoma Fosters is a renewed effort to recruit foster or adoptive families tosupport the state's Pinnacle Plan, an effort launched in 2012 by DHS to reform the state's child welfare operations. While successful on several fronts, the recruitment of foster and adoptive families continues to be a challenge. The rate of abuse and neglect of children in the state continues to keep the number of children in state custody high, hampering efforts of the Pinnacle Plan.
"We need a full-court press in this state, that's what Oklahoma Fosters is about," said Fallin.
"We are too good of a people to allow children to grow up in an environment without parental love," Fallin said. "If we do, we all suffer, because the children that are neglected today could become adults that fill our prisons and continue a cycle of abuse and neglect."
