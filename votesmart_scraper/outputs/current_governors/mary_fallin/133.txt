Gov. Fallin Statement on President Obama's Rejection of Keystone XL Pipeline
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Nov. 6, 2015
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin issued the following statement on today's decision by President Obama's administration to reject the application for the Keystone XL Pipeline:
"It continues to be absolutely mind-boggling that President Obama and his administration will not approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. It's an important driver of economic growth and even President Obama's State Department says it will create over 42,000 jobs. It will also support North American Energy production, which is good for both our economic security and our national security.
"Hopefully, future leadership in the White House will reverse this decision and make energy policy based on common sense instead of political pressure from anti-fossil fuel extremists."
