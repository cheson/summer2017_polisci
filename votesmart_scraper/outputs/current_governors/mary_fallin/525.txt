Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement regarding the anniversary of the September 11 attacks:
"Eleven years ago today, our nation mourned as thousands of lives were lost in the 9/11 attacks," Fallin said. "Today, let us pause to remember the innocent victims who were killed in the attacks, as well as their family and friends. Let us also honor the thousands of firefighters, police officers and first responders, as well as those aboard Flight 93, whose heroic actions saved countless lives.
"While our nation has not experienced an attack on our soil since that day, we must remain vigilant against those who would support tyranny over liberty and seek to do us harm. We appreciate the men and women of our Armed Forces for their service and sacrifice in the effort to keep us safe from our enemies."
