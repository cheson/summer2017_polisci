Did you know that Oklahoma once had nine Congressmen? In the 1930s, we had nine of the 435 members of the U. S. House of Representatives. Today we have five. What happened?
Simply put, we lost population compared to other states. From nine congressional seats in the 1930s we declined to eight in the 1940s, six in the 1950s and the five we have today after the 2000 census. That's why it is essential that Oklahomans respond to the census next year.
The number of seats in the House is set at 435, and has been that way since 1911. The Constitution requires that we count heads every 10 years for the purpose of reapportionment of those seats among the states. States that gain enough population add seats; those that lose people, or simply fail to grow as fast as other states, lose seats.
That's what happened in 2000. Oklahoma grew during the 1990s, but not enough to prevent the loss of one of our six congressional seats. While it is unlikely that this will happen again after next year's census, it is still vitally important that every Oklahoman responds to assure that we keep our current five seats and have a chance to reclaim the one we lost.
The census in 2010 will be simpler than in past decades. Beginning in March, every household will receive a brief 10 question form that asks how many people live at that address, along with a few demographic questions such as the ages and races of the residents. The form will be accompanied by a post-paid return envelope. All you have to do is complete it and drop it in the mail.
This year's census form should take about 90 seconds to complete. It's simple and easy.
