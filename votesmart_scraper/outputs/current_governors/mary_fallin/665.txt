Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today signed into law House Bill 1439, authored by Representative Steven Vaughan and Senator David Myers. HB 1439 expands the right to use deadly force when in fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm. Current law allows individuals to use deadly force only in their homes; HB 1439 expands that right to include their place of business. The bill takes on November 1.
"Oklahomans have the right to feel safe and defend themselves in their homes and now, with the passage of this law, in their workplaces as well. This measure represents a victory for law-abiding citizens and gun owners and a defeat for the criminals who would threaten them," Fallin said.
