Statement

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released a statement supporting the ruling of a federal appeals court in Atlanta that the "individual mandate" contained within the federal health care law was unconstitutional. The federal panel said in the majority opinion, "This economic mandate represents a wholly novel and potentially unbounded assertion of congressional authority."

Fallin released the following statement:

"I am pleased that yet another federal court has agreed that the "individual mandate' contained within the president's health care law is unconstitutional," Fallin said. "Oklahomans have made it clear the federal government under no circumstance should be allowed to force citizens to purchase health insurance. As this case moves through the federal court system, I look forward to continued validation that the "individual mandate' is unconstitutional and in contradiction with the free market principles that have made this nation great."
