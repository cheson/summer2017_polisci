Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued this statement on the death of David Hall, who served as Oklahoma's governor from 1971 until 1975. He was 85.
"My thoughts and prayers are with the family of former Governor David Hall. During his tenure as governor, he focused on the state's education system and was committed to expanding Oklahoma's roads. He called education the "golden problem solver of the 20th century,' and introduced what was then the largest-road-building program in Oklahoma history.
"I served as a page at the Capitol my sophomore year at Tecumseh High School, and still have the picture Governor Hall took with me."
