Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement after Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn filed charges against the suspected perpetrator of an attack at Vaughan Foods in Moore. The DA indicated he would seek the death penalty.
"The attack at Vaughan Foods was an act of cowardice, brutality and barbarism. The perpetrator of that attack will be brought to justice and face the full weight of the law. My thoughts and prayers continue to go out to the victims of this terrible crime as well as their families.
"Since the attack was reported, I have been communicating with law enforcement as well as Oklahoma's Department of Homeland Security to ensure a thorough investigation is conducted into the motives of the attacker. That investigation is still ongoing, and it is unclear at this time whether the crime was an act of terrorism, workplace violence, or a gruesome combination of both.
"I have asked the Oklahoma Department of Homeland Security to work with the FBI to quickly get the facts and share them with the people of Oklahoma. In the meantime, I'm asking Oklahomans to remain alert and report any suspicious activity to local law enforcement.
"The story we don't want to forget is that of a local hero, Mark Vaughn, a trained reserve deputy whose response saved at least one life and possibly saved others.
"He represents the true Oklahoma, where residents rally to help others - such as after last year's deadly tornadoes in Moore. Mark's actions also serve as a reminder that the rights outlined in the Second Amendment, which protect the ability of law-abiding citizens to carry weapons, save lives.
"We are still Oklahoma strong. We will get through this gruesome, horrible act. I've asked law enforcement to keep me informed so that I can relay factual information to Oklahomans."
