Fallin Demands House Vote on Obamacare Repeal
Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: June 30, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today signed a discharge petition to allow a vote in the House of Representatives to repeal Obamacare. Members of Congress use discharge petitions to bring a bill directly to the House floor for action. If this discharge petition receives a majority (218) of signatures in the House, Speaker Pelosi would be forced to hold an up-or-down vote on H.R. 4972, a bill to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Fallin released the following statement:
"A majority of Americans do not support Obamacare because they know higher taxes, burdensome government mandates and increased deficit spending will not improve their access to quality health care or reduce their health care costs. I call on Speaker Pelosi to bring a vote on repealing Obamacare to the House floor and finally listen to the majority of Americans who do not agree with this legislation."
