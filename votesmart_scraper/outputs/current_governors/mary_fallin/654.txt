Governor Mary Fallin today signed into law legislation creating the Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program, or SHOPP. The program, proposed under HB 1381, allows for a provider assessment to support Oklahoma hospitals. The bill protects patients by specifically prohibiting hospitals from passing on the cost of the assessment to them.
"SHOPP is an important piece of legislation that provides necessary support and funding for Oklahoma's hospitals," Fallin said. "Getting this legislation signed into law will be a big boost for our medical community and will help to improve access to quality medical care for all of our citizens. HB 1381 is an especially important bill for rural Oklahoma, where some hospitals might be forced to close without this additional support."
Craig Jones, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said HB 1381 would help to improve access to hospital services.
"Signing this important legislation is a vital step toward ensuring that individuals across Oklahoma will have access to needed hospital services in their communities," Jones said. "The future health of Oklahomans is absolutely dependent upon hospitals having the proper resources to address the health care needs of their communities, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This bill has been a priority of the Oklahoma Hospital Association for quite some time."
HB 1381 was authored by Representative Doug Cox and Senator David Meyers.
