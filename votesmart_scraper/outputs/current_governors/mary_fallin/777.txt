Obama Foreign Policy Is A Bit Alarming
Much of the focus in Washington in recent months has been on domestic issues -- primarily health care reform and the economy. In the midst of these pivotal debates about substantial domestic policy changes, we must not forget about our government's primary responsibility, which is to protect America's interests and security. Unfortunately, the Obama Administration's reactions to several recent developments abroad pose significant concerns for me.
First, President Obama cancelled the planned deployment of an anti-missile defense system in Eastern Europe. The President's announcement broke an earlier promise to Poland and The Czech Republic that they would receive this system, which was intended to protect Eastern Europe from possible attack by Iran. This broken commitment to our allies could jeopardize security in that region. Ironically, just a few days after the President's announcement, Iran was found to have a second nuclear processing facility capable of creating nuclear weapons. In a further show of defiance the Iranian government test fired a new missile that could reach Israel, American bases in the region and other territories the cancelled missile defense system was intended to cover.
Next, President Obama spoke to the United Nations and neglected to differentiate between Israel and Hamas or other terrorist organizations. This approach is misguided. Israel is a freely elected democracy that has defended itself against three invasions and countless terror attacks for decades.
Finally, there is some doubt that the new administration has a real policy in Afghanistan, where the Taliban and their al Qaeda allies are trying to return to power. Our military leaders in the region have emphasized the need for more troops, but so far the Obama administration has only said it is "studying" the situation.
The Obama Administration must heed the advice of its military generals on the ground and act expeditiously to determine an appropriate course of action that protects and assists our servicemen and women on the ground. To do so in any other fashion is irresponsible, wasteful and disrespectful of the human and capitol resources we have dedicated to this mission.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have experienced growing concern with the Obama administration's approach to national defense. Since his Executive Order issued on January 22, 2009, to close the Guantanamo detention facility by January 22, 2010, the President has moved forward on political promises without regard for details or logistics. The President has since announced cancellation of a new Army artillery piece and also indicated his intention to shut down production of the next-generation F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft.
Now the President has reneged on commitments to defend our allies. Worst of all, his speech to the United Nations seemed to send a message of weakness, not strength.
The world is a dangerous place and it is high time for this Administration to accept the reality that some nations and some radical terrorist movements are headed by unstable people, whose ultimate goals are to damage or even destroy free people and free governments like Israel and the United States.
I am increasingly concerned that President Obama either refuses or fails to accept these harsh realities. Hopefully he will listen more to the sensible military leaders than some of the pacifists in his own administration.
