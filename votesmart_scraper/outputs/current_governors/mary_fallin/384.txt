Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today thanked the Oklahoma Senate Committee on Rules for its bipartisan support of a constitutional amendment that would allow Oklahoma school districts to pursue a one-time increase in bonding capacity to fund upgrades such as storm shelters, safe rooms and precautions against intruders. The bill passed 12-3 in the Senate Committee on Rules, with the support of both Republican and Democratic senators.
The measure now goes to the full Senate. The Oklahoma House of Representatives previously voted 65-28 to pass House Joint Resolution 1092.
"My thanks go out to the senators who supported this plan today and worked to advance it," said Fallin. "I especially appreciate Senator Anthony Sykes for championing this issue in his legislative body.
"This resolution empowers communities to take action to better protect their children from tornadoes and other threats. It is a fiscally responsible, realistic plan that I believe will ultimately help to save lives."
The resolution was originally authored by Rep. Mark McBride, from Moore, and Rep. Jon Echols, from Oklahoma City. Both represent areas hit hard by last May's deadly tornadoes.
Legislative approval of HJR 1092 would put the measure on the Nov. 4 general election ballot for Oklahoma voters to consider.
