Fallin To Obama: Appeal Federal Court Ruling And Support Prayer In Our Nation

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) called on President Obama to appeal a U.S. Federal Court ruling against the constitutionality of a National Day of Prayer. At a bipartisan press conference where Members of Congress and prominent faith leaders gathered in response to the ruling, Fallin said we cannot turn our backs on God because His strength and wisdom are the cornerstone of this great nation.
"Instead of upholding the religious freedoms guaranteed to us under the First Amendment, the court has used its power to take them away," said Fallin. "No where in the Constitution is there reason to prohibit official recognition of a National Day of Prayer, which every president has done since 1952."
Today's press conference came in the aftermath of last week's decision by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb against the constitutionality of a National Day of Prayer. The case, which was filed by the Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion Foundation, challenged the constitutionality of a 1988 law requiring the president to designate the first Thursday of every May as the National Day of Prayer.
Fallin said she hoped this ruling would be appealed because both constitutional rights and centuries-long precedent uphold our faith as a nation. "The power of faith has transcended our differences even before the founding of this great nation," she said. "We also find our prayers in our heritage as American citizens, dating back to 1775 when the Continental Congress asked the 13 colonies to pray as they built our country. Today, perhaps more than ever, we must rely on our faith to overcome the many challenges facing our nation."
