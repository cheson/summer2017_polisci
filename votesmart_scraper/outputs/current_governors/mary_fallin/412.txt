The nation's governors criticized Congress on Wednesday for the political gridlock that they said had stymied passage of almost every federal initiative most needed by the states, and reiterated their calls for help from Washington.
"We are now midway through the 113th Congress, and governors are frustrated," said Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, a Republican and chairwoman of the National Governors Association, as she delivered the group's second State of the States address.
"Despite the recent budget agreement, partisan gridlock continues to prevent long-term policy solutions," Ms. Fallin said. "We're doing our part as governors to create jobs and address the challenges facing our states and this country. But we also believe that now it's time for our federal partners to do theirs and to take action."
Last January, the governors association came to Washington to lay out a blueprint of what states needed from lawmakers. This year's list of requests, Ms. Fallin said, is almost identical.
"We stand here today with essentially the same to-do list sitting before our Congress," she said.
Ms. Fallin and the vice chairman of the association, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat, delivered the address at the National Press Club a day after meeting with President Obama.
The president and his staff asked a lot of questions, Mr. Hickenlooper said, and promised to act on behalf of any governors who felt the federal government was stifling their states' efforts.
