Fallin Asks President to Commute Sentence of Border Patrol Agents
Congresswoman Mary Fallin, R-OK, joined other Members today in delivering a letter to President Bush asking that he commute the sentences of former Border Patrol Agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean. Fallin has also cosigned legislation granting a Congressional pardon.
Ramos and Compean are currently serving 11 and 12 year prison sentences for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler while in the course of duty. The smuggler, who was caught with more than 700 pounds of marijuana, was granted immunity in return for his testimony against the two agents.
"There is something fundamentally wrong with a judicial process that allows a drug smuggler to run free while two Border Patrol Agents face over a decade in prison," said Fallin. "President Bush should commute the overly harsh sentences of Agents Ramos and Compean and correct this injustice."
