Fallin Calls for Immediate, Comprehensive Energy Reform

U.S. Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) joined Republican Whip Roy Blunt and other members of the House Energy Action Team today to call for immediate Congressional action on rising gas prices and America's growing dependence on foreign energy. With the national average for gasoline nearing $4.00/gallon, HEAT members called on the Democrat majority to pursue a commonsense, supply oriented solution to the current energy crisis.
Fallin released the following statement:
"American families and businesses are being hammered by the rising cost of gas, food and the general cost of living. It doesn't have to be this way.
"This Congress has ignored the energy needs of this nation for far too long. We must demand a responsible, far reaching energy policy that does not rely on feel-good gimmicks. We need an energy policy that will address the long term needs of our nation.
"This starts with a commitment to increasing American energy supplies, both to lower gasoline prices and reduce dependence on foreign oil. We can do this by incentivizing conservation and allowing energy exploration in Alaska and the Outer Continental Shelf. We should also redouble our efforts with alternative energies like wind and solar power, clean coal, nuclear power and biofuels.
"With a gallon of gasoline now approaching $4.00 and oil approaching $130 dollars a barrel, we need a bold reexamination of our national energy policy, or lack thereof."
