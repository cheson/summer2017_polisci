Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: April 8, 2016
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today asked for disaster assistance from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) for Tulsa and Rogers counties and other counties impacted by tornadoes, severe storms and straight-line winds that began March 30.
The governor in her letter sought assistance for only Tulsa County, but if it is approved it would cover contiguous counties, including Rogers County, in accordance with SBA guidelines.
Damage assessments showed there were 287 homes and businesses affected by the storms in Tulsa County. Of those, 34 were destroyed or had major damage.
An additional 200 homes were affected in Rogers County. Two were destroyed or had major damage.
If approved, SBA low-interest disaster loans would be available for eligible homeowners and business owners to replace any storm-damaged property that was not covered by insurance or other assistance programs. The loan program is also available to assist businesses that sustained economic injury due to the storm.
