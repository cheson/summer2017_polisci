Fallin Joins Republican Convention Speaker Lineup

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) announced today she has been asked to speak to the Republican National Convention on its final night, shortly before GOP presidential nominee John McCain makes his acceptance speech.
"It's a real honor to be part of the final session's program," Fallin said. "Early in the planning process, the convention organizers asked me to be part of the run-up to Senator McCain's acceptance speech. They asked us to keep that secret until the final convention program was determined. I look forward to representing Oklahoma at the podium on this historic night."
Other Thursday night speakers on the schedule released by the convention include Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida and McCain.
"The theme for the final night is peace and the need to defend America," she said. "They have asked me to address issues related to terrorism, with some discussion of how Oklahoma responded so well to the bombing in 1995. It's an opportunity to tell our story to the nation and to remind viewers that the Oklahoma standard we displayed 13 years ago is really an American standard of helping others and standing together in difficult times."
Fallin said she will speak briefly about an hour before McCain's acceptance address, which will conclude the convention on its final night.
"It's always a privilege to represent your home state at a party national convention, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat," she said. "You are a small part of history."
