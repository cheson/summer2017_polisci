Fallin Votes to Hold the Line on Spending
With the fiscal year coming to an end this weekend, Congresswoman Mary Fallin (R-OK) voted today to continue funding the federal government through November 16 while holding spending at its current level. With no appropriations bills having been signed into law this year, the Continuing Resolution was needed to prevent a government shutdown.
Although the House has passed 12 spending bills, none have yet reached the President's desk and 10 are expected to be vetoed for excessive spending. Combined, they request $22 billion more in funding than what President Bush asked for in his budget.
"I am glad that the House was able to work in a bipartisan fashion to fund vital government services without extraneous spending. As we work towards passing the 12 spending bills for 2008, it is my hope that Congress can exercise considerably more fiscal discipline that it has shown this past year.
"I am also pleased today's measure temporarily extends the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Congress should act to renew this program on a more permanent basis and ensure that 6.6 million children in low-income families get the kind of health insurance that they need."
