The State of Oklahoma has launched 20%x2020, a statewide energy savings program that seeks to reduce energy use in state agency buildings by 20 percent by 2020.
20%x2020 is the first program of its scope in any state government. It was conceived by Gov. Mary Fallin, who signed legislation in 2012 creating the initiative, and the Legislature as a way to lower government utility costs in order to reduce overall state spending and free up resources for core government services.
"State government has a lot of room to be more responsible with its energy usage," Fallin said. "Every dollar saved on energy costs is a dollar better used back in the hands of taxpayers or by core government services. We believe this is the most ambitious behavior-based energy savings program any state government has undertaken, and we are committed to its success."
State agencies will participate in 20%x2020, which is part of Fallin's Oklahoma First Energy Plan and will be administered by the Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES). The program has a dedicated website, 20x2020.ok.gov, that beginning later this year will allow agencies and the public to track monthly agency utility spending throughout the entirety of the initiative.
20%x2020 projects agency energy cost reduction potential of at least $150 million by 2020, with additional cost reduction potential in subsequent years, using 2012 agency energy usage as a baseline. Establishing the specific 2012 baseline will be 20%x2020's first task in partnership with state agencies.
Oklahoma State University used a similar program to reduce energy expenses at campuses statewide by more than $30 million since 2007.
"The success enjoyed by the OSU system can be achieved on an even larger scale across state government," said OMES State Energy Program Manager Rick Krysiak, who previously directed OSU's energy savings program. "State buildings offer tremendous opportunities to save energy, reduce taxpayer costs and lead by example when it comes to energy efficiency. This can be done by educating building occupants on how to more efficiently use energy at work and by optimizing building equipment operations and maintenance."
Under 20%x2020, each agency will designate energy managers who will be trained to identify and implement behavior-based energy efficiency initiatives within their agencies.
An Oklahoma-based energy efficiency firm, ES2, will assist the state with development and administration of 20%x2020.
"We're thrilled to partner with the state on this historic undertaking. Our team is more than ready to start saving the taxpayers as much money as possible through daily conservation habits and improved operations and maintenance procedures," said ES2 President Bill Kinser.
ES2 was selected through a competitive bidding process conducted in accordance with the Public Competitive Bidding Act pursuant to SB 1096, the legislation passed in 2012 creating 20%x2020.
