Press Release

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today released the following statement in support of H.Con.Res. 185, a Sense of Congress Resolution requesting the president report to congress on the qualifications and responsibilities of his special advisors, known as "czars":
"Oklahomans are concerned about the qualifications and accountability of the 32 czars President Obama has appointed to serve as his top policy advisors on high-priority issues. They worry these unelected officials are not accountable to their deep concerns over the sweeping policy changes, massive deficit spending and tax hikes this administration has undertaken, and so do I.
"I call on President Obama to uphold a high level of transparency and accountability in his administration by reporting to congress on the responsibilities and qualifications of each appointed czar and disclosing their associations, just as he would for any senate confirmation nominee. I also call on the president to certify these officials will not act outside of their legal authority.
"If the president is sincere about his dedication to transparency and accountability, he'll let the American people know who is calling the shots and why. H.Con.Res. 185 is a step in the right direction to ensuring that unelected government officials are answerable to the American public."
