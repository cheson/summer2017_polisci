Statement from Gov. Fallin on Final Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: May 28, 2015
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement regarding the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) release of their final rules defining what constitute "Waters of the United States" (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.
"Two things are immediately clear about the EPA's new WOTUS rules. First, they represent the expansion of federal power over the nation's waters at the expense of property owners and states. Second, the EPA released these without regard to state or local interests, and oftentimes in direct opposition to the will of states that expressed concern and alarm over the nature of these rules.
"I continue to believe these rules will have a negative impact on economic development, and will slow down improvements and installation of critical infrastructure. Because of the flawed development of these rules and lack of a clear implementation strategy, projects in Oklahoma may be hamstrung by this extra layer of federal red tape. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt has rightfully expressed his intention to explore legal action to prevent these new rules from harming our state."
