Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin and the Oklahoma Department of Commerce's foreign direct investment team announced today that Fallin will lead an Oklahoma delegation to the upcoming Paris Air Show from June 15-20, 2015. Delegations from 11 U.S. states will be present at the air show along with eight U.S. governors. Governor Fallin's travel will be paid for in full by the Oklahoma Business Roundtable, a private organization that supports economic development.
Secretary of Commerce and Tourism Deby Snodgrass and Secretary of Science and Technology Stephen McKeever will join Fallin at the aerospace show.
"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to showcase Oklahoma as a top destination for the global aerospace industry," said Gov. Fallin. "We believe Oklahoma's business climate, strong economy, educated workforce and high quality of life make it an obvious choice for both commercial and military aerospace companies considering expansion into North America."
The Paris Air Show, along with the Farnborough International Airshow, which take place every other year, are the largest and longest-running aerospace trade shows in the world and are at the very heart of business developments in the global aerospace market, attracting over 150,000 aerospace executives and companies.
Secretary McKeever said the governor's presence helps to elevate the Oklahoma delegation and ensure high level meetings with executives.
"These shows are where decision makers meet. They represent the best opportunity for Oklahoma to showcase its aerospace industry and attract investments back to the state," said McKeever.
