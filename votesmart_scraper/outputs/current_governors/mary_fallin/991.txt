Issue Position: Energy
America is on the brink of an energy crisis. We are becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil from nations that are openly hostile to America and our interests, such as Iran and Venezuela. Allowing ourselves to be held hostage to these rogue regimes jeopardizes not just our national security, but our economic security as well.
Fortunately there are common sense solutions that can help us avert this crisis and lessen our dependence on foreign energy sources. In the short term, that means an increase in domestic energy production. Increasing production will help drive down gasoline prices, boost the American economy, and bolster our national security by lessening our dependence on foreign energy.
In the long term, it is essential that the federal government continue to provide incentives for research into and production of alternative energy sources. American business is the greatest source of innovation and technological advancement in the world; by supporting private enterprise as they invest in alternative energy, we can harness that power for the public good.
In both the short term and the long term, Oklahoma stands on the front line of the struggle for energy independence. Oklahoma has long been an American powerhouse for traditional forms of energy, like oil and natural gas. As the U.S. seeks out alternative energy sources, Oklahoma has enormous potential as a source of wind power, solar power, and ethanol production. By making a serious commitment to the long term energy interests of this country, Oklahoma can pass on its rich history of energy production to future generations.
