In Wake of Attacks, Gov. Fallin Authorizes Adjutant General to Arm Full-Time Military Personnel
Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today authorized Oklahoma's adjutant general, Maj. Gen. Robbie L. Asher, to arm full-time personnel at installations like the military facilities that were attacked Thursday in Chattanooga, Tenn.
"Four unarmed Marines were killed in what appears to be a domestic terrorist attack," said Fallin. "It is painful enough when we lose members of our armed forces when they are sent in harm's way, but it is unfathomable that they should be vulnerable for attack in our own communities. For that reason, I want to make sure that our National Guardsmen are authorized to arm themselves at our military facilities."
Fallin issued an executive order allowing Asher to arm certain full-time personnel in military installations throughout Oklahoma with weaponry as he deems necessary "to adequately provide for security of the facilities and their occupants." Such installations shall include, but not be limited to, military recruiting offices.
In another executive order, the governor instructed that all American and Oklahoma flags on state property be flown at half-staff through 8 a.m. Monday in honor of the four Marines killed.
"This attack is a horrible tragedy for our country and especially those in the state of Tennessee," Fallin said. "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of those who were killed."
