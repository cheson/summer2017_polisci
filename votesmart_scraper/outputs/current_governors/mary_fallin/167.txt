The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has denied the state of Oklahoma's request for Individual Assistance to aid individuals and businesses in 19 counties that were impacted earlier this year by flooding, tornadoes, severe storms and straight-line winds.
The 19 counties denied assistance are Blaine, Craig, Creek, Custer, Dewey, Garfield, Greer, Harmon, Haskell, Jackson, Kay, Major, Muskogee, Osage, Pawnee, Roger Mills, Sequoyah, Washita and Woods.
FEMA earlier approved 45 counties for Individual Assistance. Public Assistance earlier was approved for all 59 counties that the state had submitted for aid. Aid was for damage that occurred between May 5 and June 22 by storms and floods.
"While I am grateful to FEMA for granting assistance to many in Oklahoma whose homes or businesses were damaged, I am disappointed we could not secure federal aid for those living in these 19 counties," said Fallin. "I encourage those individuals to seek help through organizations like the American Red Cross, Oklahoma Baptist Disaster Relief and the Salvation Army. Oklahomans looking to help should consider making monetary donations to those charitable organizations or others like them."
A list of counties that received aid is below.
Individual Assistance
Note: Individual Assistance makes available federal assistance for housing repairs or temporary housing, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) low-interest loans for individuals and businesses to repair or replace damaged property, disaster unemployment assistance, and grants for serious needs and necessary disaster expenses not met by other programs. Forty-five Oklahoma counties have been approved by FEMA for Individual Assistance.
