Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement on the extension of Insure Oklahoma (InsureOK) for one additional year from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017:
"I am pleased to announce that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have granted my request for an extension of our 1115 Medicaid Waiver for the Insure Oklahoma program. This is the fourth time we have been granted an extension of this public-private partnership, once again demonstrating that successful innovations and solutions happen at the state level, especially here in Oklahoma.
"Insure Oklahoma is a critically important piece of the health insurance puzzle in our state, helping nearly 4,000 participating Oklahoma businesses provide quality health insurance coverage for their employees. The additional time granted by this one-year extension will ensure thousands of Oklahomans will continue to have access to great health care regardless of their ability to pay.
"I am committed to supporting Oklahomans in their quest to find quality, affordable health care coverage, and am grateful that CMS saw the value in this innovative public-private model. I will continue to advocate on behalf of Insure Oklahoma and all Oklahomans."
