Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

On Tuesday, October 1, Oklahomans will be able to apply for health insurance through a federally run Health Insurance Marketplace. The new insurance marketplace is not a state entity and is not run by state employees. Governor Mary Fallin has instructed state employees to refer inquiries about the new marketplace to the federal call center and websites. Individuals who call state offices will be referred to HealthCare.gov or 1-800-318-2596. Those inquiring on behalf of businesses will be referred to the number 1-800-706-7893.
As the new marketplace is launched, Governor Fallin is cautioning all Oklahomans to protect their personal information and to beware of fraud. No one should call or visit your home without your permission, even if they say they are with the marketplace.
"There are many changes occurring very quickly to our health care system," said Fallin. "Regardless of the politics surrounding the Affordable Care Act, no one wants to see Oklahomans be the victims of scam-artists."
"If a company contacts you and asks for your social security number or banking information, do not give it to them. Similarly, no one should be asking for your personal health information. Oklahomans should also keep a record of the names of any salespeople or "navigators' that might assist them as well as who they work for."
