Nearly 4,000 low-income Oklahomans who use propane as their primary or only source of heat have received financial assistance since Governor Mary Fallin ordered the Department of Human Services (DHS) to give them priority status.

Records show 3,753 low-income Oklahomans who use propane for heating fuel received $1,033,453 in financial assistance since the governor issued her assistance order.
"High propane prices are really hurting Oklahoma families," said Fallin. "In some cases, we know that families are choosing not to heat their homes. That can actually be dangerous given how cold it has been. I'm glad to see the directive to prioritize assistance for propane users is helping Oklahomans to get the assistance they need."
Fallin issued an executive order Jan. 31 instructing DHS to expedite applications for both the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Energy Crisis Assistance Program (ECAP). The federal assistance programs help low-income families with heating costs in the winter, cooling costs in the summer and home insulation.
In order to qualify for the programs, persons must be Oklahoma residents and must need financial assistance for home energy costs.
Propane is commonly used for heating homes in rural areas not served by natural gas. There are approximately 400,000 propane consumers in Oklahoma.
