Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Sept. 24, 2015
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin, legislators and law enforcement supporters are hosting a "Back the Blue" rally to offer support and thanks to law enforcement agencies and officers at 6 p.m. Oct. 12 on the south steps of the Oklahoma State Capitol. Oklahomans are encouraged to join the rally -- dressed in blue -- to show their appreciation for law enforcement professionals who risk their lives to protect their communities.
"Working in law enforcement can be a dangerous job, but it should never be a thankless one," said Fallin. "I encourage Oklahomans to join us on Monday, October 12, at the Oklahoma State Capitol to thank our law enforcement officers for the work they do to keep us safe."
