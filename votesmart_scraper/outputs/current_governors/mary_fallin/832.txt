REP. BOEHNER: Well, it's good to be back and to see all of your smiling faces after a two week recess.
As you all know, we are approaching President Obama's first 100 days in office. And as we do the economy continues to slide, unemployment continues to increase and the spending and taxing and borrowing here in Washington continues to go up, as well. I just believe that there is way too much of it.
This Sunday, we come to National Debt Day. National Debt Day is the day during the fiscal year when we have spent all of the revenue coming in to the federal government. And so after Sunday - every dime that is spent, every new program that is approved - the money has to be borrowed from our kids and grandkids. This National Debt Day is three and a half months earlier this year than it was last year because of the stimulus bill - the trillion dollar stimulus bill and the $350 billion worth of TARP money that's been spent. And clearly, the $410 billion omnibus spending bill that was $30 billion over budget and had 9,000 earmarks in it. And so, it's no wonder that Americans across the country are rising up and are saying "enough is enough."
