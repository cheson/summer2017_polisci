Fallin Rejects Energy Tax Hike

Oklahoma Congresswoman Mary Fallin voted today against a new proposal (H.R. 5351) to raise taxes on energy companies. Fallin released the following statement:
"Any energy bill passed by Congress should focus first and foremost on the creation of additional sources of energy production within the United States. Increasing our domestic energy supply is vital to our economic security and our national security. Providing incentives for increased energy exploration at home will help drive down gas prices and keep jobs in the industry from being shipped overseas. Increasing the supply of American made energy will also help fight America's dependence on foreign oil, an unhealthy addiction that could threaten our long term safety.
"I voted against today's bill because it introduces a multi-billion dollar tax on energy at the expense of our economic and national security needs. Rather than encourage domestic energy production, this bill discourages it by raising taxes. Rather than support a homegrown energy supply, the bill would ship jobs overseas while worsening our dependence on foreign oil. With working families already feeling the pinch from rising gas prices and economic uncertainty, that's the last thing we need."
Note: H.R. 5351 passed by a vote of 236-182.
