Fallin Urges Colleagues to Reject Iraq Resolution
U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin (R-OK) spoke today on the full floor of the House of Representatives, urging her colleagues to reject a non-binding resolution condemning the President's proposed troop increase in Iraq. The resolution does not hold the force of law and does not propose a plan for victory. Fallin warned that the resolution would send mixed messages to terrorists in Iraq and elsewhere.
"Congress has a vital role to play in helping America win its wars, but it can also play an unintended role in losing them if it says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time.  If this resolution passes," said Fallin, "it is sending a clear message of weakness, and our enemies are watching."
Fallin went on to ask her colleagues to place the security of the United States above politics when deciding whether or not to support the President's plan.

"This non-binding resolution represents nothing more than a political game," said Fallin, "but the war on terror is not a game.  We must take extraordinary precautions to protect our nation from those who would do us harm. Some day our children and grandchildren will look back on our decision this week and reflect on their lives. The question we have to ask today is, will our children live in a safer America?'"
