Issue Position

I have always been pro-life, and I am glad that the pendulum is finally swinging back to common sense on this vital issue. More and more Americans are coming to realize that a society that fails to protect the most vulnerable is not a healthy society at all. I support efforts in our state legislature and in Congress to prohibit partial birth abortion and to require parental notification when minors seek abortions. I also favor recent efforts that insist that ultrasound results be made available to all pregnant women. Thankfully, President Bush has continued to appoint federal judges and members of the U. S. Supreme Court who honor and value life ... and I am hopeful that one day soon the courts will re-examine and reverse Roe v. Wade.
Life matters ... and I say that as a mother who campaigned for my first elective office while I was expecting my second child.
