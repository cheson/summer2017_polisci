SBA Disaster Assistance Granted for Oklahoma Counties Impacted by December Storms
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: March 30, 2016
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today announced that 10 Oklahoma counties may now receive disaster assistance from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) as a result of the winter storm and flooding that began December 26.
The designation provides SBA low-interest disaster loans for homeowners and business owners in Cherokee, Mayes and Ottawa counties to replace any property damaged by the storm that was not covered by insurance or other assistance programs. The loan program is also available to assist businesses that sustained economic injury due to the storm.
Under SBA rules, the contiguous counties of Adair, Craig, Delaware, Muskogee, Rogers, Sequoyah and Wagoner are also eligible for assistance.
The state requested the SBA declaration on March 23 after the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied the governor's appeal for individual assistance. Two counties included in the governor's request, Pushmataha and McCurtain, were not approved for the SBA declaration.
