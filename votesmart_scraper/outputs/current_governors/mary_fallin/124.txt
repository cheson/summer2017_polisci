Governor Mary Fallin today issued this statement on the resignation of Robert Patton as director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (DOC):
"I appreciate Robert Patton's efforts to keep our state prisons safe for both correctional officers and inmates. During his tenure, he worked to reform DOC's internal operations to be more efficient and effective, as well as implementing the Justice Reinvestment Initiative's corrections reform package to emphasize rehabilitation and treatment for non-violent offenders. I regret his departure, but I understand the importance of family and the need to be close to loved ones. I wish him well in his future endeavors."
