Fallin Joins Nation In Day Of Prayer
Press Release

Location: Washington, DC

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today joined Americans nationwide in the 59th observance of a National Day of Prayer. Fallin, who participated in a Capitol Hill press conference on April 20 in support of an annual presidential call to prayer, said America has become a great nation because our Founding Fathers turned to God for His guidance and wisdom.
"The power of faith has transcended our differences even before the founding of this great nation," Fallin said. "In prayer we find strength and unity. With all of the challenges we face today, it is important to pause and seek guidance and strength from our Creator."
In April, Fallin asked President Obama to appeal a federal court ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Barbara B. Crabb, for the Western District of Wisconsin, which struck down the National Day of Prayer Statute as a violation of the Establishment Clause. "No where does the National Day of Prayer compel Americans to take part in any specific religious activity," Fallin explained. "The purpose of National Prayer day is to unite us as Americans by honoring our timeless heritage. If we take God out of America, America will cease to be a great nation."
In 1952, Congress established an annual day of prayer. In 1988 the law was amended to designate the National Day of Prayer as the first Thursday in May. The theme for the 59th Annual National Day of Prayer is "Prayer, For Such a Time as This" and is based on the verse from Nahum 1:7 which states: "The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in Him."
