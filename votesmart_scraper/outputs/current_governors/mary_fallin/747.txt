Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) yesterday said she will post frequent updates on her Congressional office website beginning Thursday as the House prepares to debate and vote on the contentious health care bill:
"This change in the way we deliver our health care system is one of the most important policy changes of our time and will affect future generations to come. My Fifth District constituents are intensely interested in this debate and I intend to keep them fully informed," Fallin said. She said the updates will be posted throughout the weekend on a special link to her website at http://fallin.house.gov/.
"This will be almost like live blogging, with observations on the debate and updates on new developments as they happen," Fallin said. "We will post updates continuously on my website so Oklahomans can follow the process in real time."
Fallin said she will join other Republicans and a growing number of Democrats in voting against the bill. Those opponents are concerned about the government takeover of health care and soaring costs inherent in Speaker Pelosi's bill.
"This is the wrong approach to health care reform," she said. "I cannot recall an issue that has so energized voters, and the mail, calls and email to my office from the very beginning have been strongly opposed to a big-government, high-tax approach to the issue."
