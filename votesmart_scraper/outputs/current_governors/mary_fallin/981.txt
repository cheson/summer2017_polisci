Fallin Joins new Anti-Terrorism Caucus
U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin (R-OK) announced today that she joined the new Congressional Anti-Terrorism Caucus. The caucus will help provide members with more detailed information on terrorism so that Congress can create better policy and provide better oversight in regards to terrorist threats.

"We face a very real and very grave threat from terrorism," Fallin said. "I look forward to working with all the members of this important caucus, regardless of their party, to better understand the ideology and motivation behind terror attacks. Together we can help make this country safer from the terrorists and jihadists who seek to do us harm."
There are currently more than 70 members of the Congressional Anti-Terrorism Caucus, which is co-chaired by Rep. Sue Myrick (R-NC), Rep. Bud Cramer (D-AL), Rep. Kay Granger (R-TX), and Rep. Ben Chandler (D-KY). The bipartisan caucus will meet twice a month to receive briefings from terrorist experts about the threat to our country from extremism and jihadist terrorists.
"Terrorists don't target Democrats or Republicans. They target Americans, and this is why we must face the issue as Americans," Myrick said.
The caucus will help Congress start an informed dialogue with the public regarding terrorism so that all Americans better understand the extent of the threat we face. A few of the subjects that will be discussed in the next several months include terrorist use of the internet, terrorist financing methods, and ideological differences between moderate Muslims and extremists.
