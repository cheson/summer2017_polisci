Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today rejected House Democrats' plan to drive 6.7 million students and 4,400 higher education institutions away from their current student loan providers and into one federally-run program. "Sold to Americans as a bill to improve higher education access, this bill will turn the Department of Education into the largest bank in the world, with American taxpayers on the hook for its losses," said Fallin, who voted against H.R. 3221, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act.
"I've talked to several community colleges throughout the state that have experienced large enrollment increases during the recession and I am sympathetic to their needs for increased resources," Fallin said. "Its unfortunate helpful funding for these schools was wrapped into yet another federal takeover of the private sector."
Fallin said it was the elimination of the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) that caused her to vote against the bill. "80 percent of our nation's higher education institutions have chosen to participate in the FFELP program. This bill will force these schools, whose students hold over $400 billion in outstanding loans, into a government-run program." Fallin also said this switch will put an enormous amount of strain on colleges and students. "When it comes to health care, Democrats like to promise Â‘if you like your plan you can keep it.' Apparently they don't feel the same way about student loans."
"The government already owns our mortgages, car dealerships and banking institutions," Fallin continued. "Now they want to control the student loan market as well, managing over $1 trillion in capital over the next ten years and eliminating college financing choices for students. If this bill becomes law, students will be stuck standing in line in another massive bureaucratic system, just like the Internal Revenue Service or Post Office."
