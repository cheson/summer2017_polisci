Congresswoman Fallin and Other Members Report Progress in the War on Terror
U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, joined other House Members today in reporting progress made by U.S. troops in Iraq. Fallin and six other Republicans, all of whom have recently returned from Iraq, said that conditions are improving and that politicians should remain committed to fighting the War on Terror.
Fallin, who spent July 28-29 traveling in Iraq, issued the following statement:
"I am proud to have spent last weekend with some of our nation's bravest men and women. What I heard from our troops and from our commanders in Iraq was encouraging."
"The progress that U.S. and Iraqi soldiers have made is remarkable. In the city of Ramadi, for example, U.S. forces have successfully turned a command post for Al Qaeda into one of the most encouraging stories in Iraq. Only months ago, Iraqi and American commanders noted that the city was a "lost cause." Al Qaeda had consumed the community. But with the cooperation of tribal Sheiks, Iraqi armed forces and U.S. troops, Al Qaeda was successfully driven out. Ramadi was once the most dangerous city in Iraq, ravaged by hundreds of IED and suicide bomb attacks as recent as April. Two days ago, however, I was able to walk down the street of a local market safely."
"There is still a lot to be done in Iraq. Success or failure will ultimately rest on the ability of the Iraqi people to defend themselves and end sectarian strife."
"Iraqi politicians and soldiers know that the patience of American families is wearing thin. But while we help Iraqis take responsibility for their own nation, it is important not to overlook the commitment and obvious progress made by American troops in the field.
