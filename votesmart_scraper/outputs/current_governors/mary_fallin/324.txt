Governor Mary Fallin announced today she would ask lawmakers to work with her in the next legislative session to support legalization of medicinal cannabidiol oil (CBD) on a limited, medically supervised, trial-only basis. CBD is a component in the cannabis (marijuana) plant. Research suggests that it may be effective to treat toddlers with rare conditions that cause seizures and strokes. CBD is an oil; it is not smoked. It is not intoxicating or used as a recreational drug.
"I do not support legalizing the recreational use of marijuana," said Fallin. "Nor do I support a broadly-defined "medicinal' marijuana use that makes it easy for healthy adults and teenagers to find and buy drugs."
"I do support allowing potentially life-saving medicine to find its way to children in need. I am very interested in allowing limited, heavily supervised use of non-intoxicating CBD to be delivered on a trial-basis to sick children in Oklahoma."
Rep. Jon Echols is currently preparing to lead a legislative study examining the possibility of allowing medical trials for the use of non-intoxicating CBD oils to children affected by severe seizures.
"I am extremely interested in the findings of that study, and I look forward to working with lawmakers in both parties to pursue policies that can help sick Oklahoma children," said Fallin.
