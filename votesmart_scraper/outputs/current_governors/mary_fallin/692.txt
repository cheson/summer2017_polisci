Gov. Mary Fallin on Thursday told National Guardsmen at Camp Gruber she and Oklahoma state legislators with her held them in high esteem.
"We're deeply honored to be here," Fallin said. "We know you're making sacrifices. We owe you our gratitude. We owe you our respect."
Fallin and 23 members of the Oklahoma Legislature visited Camp Gruber to learn about its resources, current preparations for deployment overseas, and to watch combat training exercises.
Fallin and the legislators were also given an audio-visual presentation about Camp Gruber's 33,000-acre facility, its capabilities, and plans for expansion. The presentation also gave an example of economic impact, saying that one of the current training groups has poured $2,192,000 into the local economy. Muskogee leaders at the event included Mayor John Tyler Hammons, City Manager Greg Buckley, Greater Muskogee Area Chamber of Commerce President Sue Harris, OG&E spokesman Al Stevens, and Walmart Manager Mike Ebert.
Afterward, Fallin said she highly values Camp Gruber's contributions to the state and nation.
"Camp Gruber is very important not only to the training of our soldiers and our war fighters in our war on terror, but it's also important to our economy," Fallin said. "It generates almost $2 billion dollars of economic input back into the state of Oklahoma, when people come here to train they spend money here in the local economy. When the contractors come in to service Camp Gruber, they rent hotel rooms and buy food at local restaurants. Camp Gruber not only serves an important mission for our military, but it's also great for our economy."
