Press Release

Date: April 26, 2012
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today announced that Woodward County has been granted disaster assistance from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) for the deadly tornado outbreak that occurred earlier this month.
The designation provides SBA low interest disaster loans for renters, homeowners, business owners and private, non-profits to repair or replace any property damaged by the storm which was not covered by insurance or other assistance programs. The loan program is also available to assist businesses that sustained economic injury due to the storm. Under SBA rules, the assistance is also available for in the contiguous counties of Dewey, Ellis, Harper, Major, and Woods.
"When I went to Woodward immediately after the tornado struck, I spoke with families who lost everything and saw businesses that were completely destroyed," Fallin said. "I also saw a community that was determined to get back on its feet quickly. This SBA disaster assistance will provide some much-needed help to that community as families and businesses work to rebuild and recover."
The Governor requested the SBA assistance on Friday, April 20, after a Presidential Declaration for Individual Assistance for Woodward County was denied. The tornado hit Woodward on April 15, leaving six dead and 224 homes and businesses damaged, including 74 destroyed.
