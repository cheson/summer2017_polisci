Fallin: Air Force Cuts Show Misplaced Priorities at the White House
Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: March 6, 2012
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement in response to the news that the Air Force will eliminate hundreds of military and non-military personnel in Oklahoma, including the 600 men and women of Tinker Air Force Base's 3rd Combat Communications Group, also called the Third Herd:
"The announced cuts to Oklahoma Air Force personnel are both disappointing and alarming. Oklahoma's Air Force bases are not only important parts of their local communities; they play a vital role in our national defense. The decision to eliminate hundreds of military and civilian Air Force personnel will mean Oklahoma will lose jobs and the United States Air Force will be without quality units like the Third Herd.
"It is disturbing that President Obama is so eager to make billions of dollars in funding and personnel cuts to our military even while spending on entitlements and social programs continue to skyrocket. This is yet another instance of misplaced priorities and a policy agenda that is dangerously out of touch. I will continue to do everything in my power to oppose this weakening of our national defense and assault on the military.
