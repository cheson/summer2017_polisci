The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Fallin) is recognized for 1 minute.
There was no objection.
Ms. FALLIN. Madam Speaker, I am pleased today to be able to introduce our guest chaplain for the day, Pastor Sharon Daugherty, who leads one of our Nation's great institutions of faith, Victory Christian Center of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Sharon founded Victory Christian with her husband, Pastor Billy Joe Daugherty. Tragically, we lost him to an illness late last year, but Pastor Daugherty still is very committed to the church and has vowed to carry on the wonderful family tradition. Victory Christian Center operates a school for 1,300 students, has summer camps, local and worldwide outreach missions, an international Bible institute, youth programs, and a community health clinic. It also includes job fairs for those looking for employment. And it has much, much more.
Most of all, Victory Christian Center is the faith home to a congregation of more than 17,000 Oklahomans, one of the largest in America. This is a time when faith matters so much to our people. It binds us together, transcends our differences, and reminds us that our liberties are divinely grounded and divinely inspired.
Pastor Sharon Daugherty is a friend, a good neighbor, and a true faith leader in Oklahoma and America. I am so proud to welcome her today to be our chaplain of the day and thank her for a wonderful prayer.
