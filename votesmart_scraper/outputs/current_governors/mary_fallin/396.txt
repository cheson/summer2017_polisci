Governor Mary Fallin today commented on the House of Representatives Government Modernization Committee passing House Bill 3028, which calls for the consolidation of the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation, the Oklahoma Arts Council and the Oklahoma Historical Society into the Oklahoma Department of Tourism, History and Cultural Affairs:
"The Oklahoma Arts Council and the Oklahoma Historical Society make invaluable contributions to tourism, culture and education in Oklahoma. Housing these two agencies as independent entities in the Department of Tourism will enhance, not detract from their missions. Tourism has significant advertising, communications, legal and Internet resources that can be used to support both the Arts Council and the Historical Society. Tourism also can build private and public partnerships to enhance funding. Combining these agencies will save taxpayer dollars while ensuring the resources allocated to promote and preserve Oklahoma art and history go to these fields instead of back-office expenses. My thanks go out to the House of Representatives Government Modernization Committee for taking action on this important legislation."
House Bill 3028 was authored by Rep. Jason Murphey.
