Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement after the Supreme Court's ruling in the Hobby Lobby case.
"Religious liberty is one of the principles this nation was founded upon. It is a freedom woven into the fabric of this country and expressly outlined in our Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court acted today to protect religious liberty and defend our citizens from an overreaching, overbearing federal government.
