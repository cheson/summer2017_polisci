Following a request from Governor Mary Fallin, the U.S. Small Business Administration today announced that low-interest federal disaster loans are available to businesses and residents in Tulsa and Cleveland counties who were affected by the tornadoes, severe storms, straight-line winds and flooding that occurred March 25-26. The disaster declaration also makes SBA assistance available in the contiguous counties of Canadian, Creek, Grady, McClain, Oklahoma, Okmulgee, Osage, Pawnee, Pottawatomie, Rogers, Wagoner and Washington.
"This most recent storm was devastating to many families and businesses," said Fallin. "I'm glad the SBA recognized the need to step-up and help the recovery effort. This disaster assistance will provide some much-needed help to families and businesses that are working to rebuild and recover."
Last month's tornadoes and storms resulted in four deaths and 26 people suffering injuries that required treatment at area hospitals. Damage assessments showed 1,047 homes and businesses were damaged in the tornadoes, severe storms, straight-line winds and flooding that occurred March 25-26.
