Governor Mary Fallin today signed House Joint Resolution (HJR) 1028 to approve the assessment and accountability report recommendations required by legislation (House Bill 3218) passed and signed into law last year. The key components of the report include recommendations for new assessments for Grades 3-8 and for high school students as required by the federal government, as well as a study of an enhanced accountability system.

Governor Fallin's Statement on signing HJR 1028
"As one more action in the many pro-education steps my administration has taken, I am delighted to sign House Joint Resolution 1028 by Representative Michael Rogers and Senator Gary Stanislawski. The HJR accepts in whole the Assessment and Accountability Report prepared by the State Department of Education and approved by the State Board of Education. The Assessment and Accountability Report is the culmination of a lot of work by a task force of school leaders and education stakeholders. The report will provide recommendations for new future-ready assessments for Grades 3-8 and for high school assessments, as well as an enhanced A-F Accountability System. I appreciate the efforts of numerous Oklahomans who developed the report, as well as the Republican leadership in the House and Senate who worked diligently to approve the measure within the first 30 days of the legislative session."
