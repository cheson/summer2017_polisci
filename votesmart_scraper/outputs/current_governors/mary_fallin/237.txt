Press Release

Location: Oklahoma, City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today announced the appointment of Judge Robert Hudson to the Court of Criminal Appeals. Hudson, of Guthrie, succeeds Judge Charles Johnson.
Hudson, a former longtime prosecutor for Payne and Logan counties, has served as a special district judge in Payne and Logan Counties since 2012. In that role, he handles both civil and criminal litigation.
"Judge Robert Hudson is a proven and effective leader who has served in both public and private practice," Fallin said. "As a prosecutor, he has been both "tough on crime' and "smart on crime.' Judge Hudson has worked to ensure that dangerous criminals are locked up, while at the same time supporting programs that provide an alternative punishment for non-violent offenders, many of whom have substance abuse or mental health issues that require treatment. I look forward to working with him in his new role."
Hudson previously served as first assistant attorney general, a role in which he oversaw approximately 80 lawyers working in the attorney general's office.
In 1996, he was appointed by then-Governor Frank Keating as district attorney for Payne and Logan counties. He was re-elected to the post four consecutive times. During his time as district attorney, Hudson's office prosecuted more cases than any other time in the history of the two-county district.
While serving as district attorney, he also helped establish Oklahoma's first drug court to provide an alternative punishment for offenders convicted of non-violent drug offenses.
