Public Statements
Insure Oklahoma Now Accepting Larger Businesses
Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin and the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA) announced today that the Insure Oklahoma program is increasing its employer size limit from 99 to 250 employees. The change is effective immediately.
Insure Oklahoma is the state's premium assistance program that helps businesses and their middle- to low-income employees afford health insurance coverage. Insure Oklahoma's funding levels can support premium assistance for about 30,000 individuals. Increasing the employer size limit to 250 employees, which is authorized under the program's federal waiver, would allow Insure Oklahoma to maximize program usage.
"Raising the eligibility cap allows the state to partner with more businesses to provide affordable health insurance to their employees," said Fallin. "The money that Insure Oklahoma saves employers can be reinvested in more jobs and other employee benefits."
