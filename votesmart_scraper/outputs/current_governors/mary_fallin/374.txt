Governor Mary Fallin today declared a state of emergency for Ottawa County due to a tornado that struck Quapaw on Sunday.
One person was killed in Quapaw and the city's fire station was destroyed when a tornado struck early Sunday evening. The tornado struck an area from First to Sixth streets, destroying at least five businesses and other structures. Damage assessments are ongoing today.
"Our hearts and prayers are with those who have been affected by Sunday's tornado," Fallin said. "The state is prepared to offer every resource available to assist with cleanup, rebuilding and recovery."
Under the Executive Order, state agencies can make emergency purchases and acquisitions needed to expedite the delivery of resources to local jurisdictions. The declaration also marks a first step toward seeking federal assistance should it be necessary.
The declaration can be amended to add additional counties if conditions warrant.
