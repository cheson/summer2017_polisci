U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Congresswoman Mary Fallin (R-Okla.) today introduced the McGee Creek Project Pipeline and Associated Facilities Conveyance Act. The bill authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to convey to the McGee Creek Authority (an authority within the City of Oklahoma City) all rights to the pipeline and any associated facilities to be operated and maintained by the City of Oklahoma City. In the 110th Congress, Rep. Fallin was successful in passing the bill through the House.
Senator Inhofe: "Our bill is about ensuring safe drinking water for residents in the Oklahoman City region. The bill is designed to end requests for federal funds and will protect the federal government from legal liabilities that could be incurred in their operation. I am pleased to work closely with Congresswoman Fallin and appreciate the cooperation and coordination between Oklahoma City, the McGee Creek Authority, and the Bureau of Reclamation."
Congressman Fallin: "By cutting out federal bureaucracy and red tape, this stand alone bill will allow Oklahomans get top quality water services in a more efficient manner. My thanks go out to Senator Inhofe for working with me on this project and taking the lead in the Senate."
