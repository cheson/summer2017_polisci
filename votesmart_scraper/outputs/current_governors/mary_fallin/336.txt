Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin today called on the Obama Administration to keep its promise to the people of Oklahoma and close the facility housing illegal immigrant minors at Fort Sill after its 120 day lease.
The facility began housing illegal immigrant minors on June 13. At that time, representatives from the Government Services Administration explained the facility was "temporary" and that the federal government had a 120 day lease expiring on October 10.
"From the very beginning, I have opposed the housing of illegal immigrants at Fort Sill," said Fallin. "As I have told the administration, this facility is a testament to their failure to secure the borders and enforce our laws. It is a burden to taxpayers, who are being asked to shoulder transportation, medical and education expenses. It is also a potential health hazard.
"The Obama Administration has offered promises that this is a temporary facility supporting a 120 day operation. I am calling on President Obama and Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell to keep their promise and offer assurances to the people of Oklahoma that this facility will be closed after October 10."
