Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Sept. 4, 2014
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin today announced the creation of a Coordinating Council on Seismic Activity to link researchers with policy makers and energy industry experts. The council will be headed by Oklahoma Secretary of Energy and Environment Michael Teague. Fallin's announcement came during the Fourth Annual Governor's Energy Conference, held in Oklahoma City.
"Oklahoma has always had seismic activity," said Fallin. "But the reality is, we are seeing more earthquakes today than we did several decades ago. It's important we study this issue and have sound science that can inform decisions made in both the public and private sector. This new council will link researchers with the energy industry and policymakers to ensure we are maximizing communication and access to information. We can't examine a complex issue like this in a vacuum; everyone needs to be at the same table and talking."
The coordinating council will include input from public sector groups like the Oklahoma Geologic Survey, the Corporation Commission, and the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board; research institutions including the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University; industry groups like the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association and the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Association; and state legislators.
