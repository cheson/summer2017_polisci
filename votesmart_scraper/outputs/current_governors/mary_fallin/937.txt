Fallin Announces Grant Recipient "YouthBuild"

Oklahoma Fifth District Congresswoman Mary Fallin today announced a $555,000 federal grant has been awarded to The Eagle Ridge Institute's "Eagle's Nest YouthBuild". And, an equal second-year funding is contingent upon Congressional approval.
"I am proud of this Oklahoma City-based program's efforts to provide job training and educational opportunities for disadvantaged youth in our region." Fallin said.
"YouthBuild students construct and repair housing for low-income families in their own neighborhoods, while working toward a GED or high school diploma."
Congresswoman Fallin called the program a win-win situation and an example of how the government and non-profits can work together for a brighter future for all Oklahomans.
Fallin said, "Program Director Marie Burns tells me the grant is possible because of the strong support and partnership of: The Urban League of Greater Oklahoma City; Oklahoma City Housing Authority; the Area Prevention and Resource Center of Oklahoma; Regional Food Bank; Workforce Oklahoma; Mid-Del Adult Learning Center; and the Office of Juvenile Affairs.
So, these entities deserve our gratitude and congratulations, as well."
