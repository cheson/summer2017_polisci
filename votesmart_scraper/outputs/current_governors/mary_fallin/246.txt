Governor Mary Fallin today announced the formation of the Governor's Education Advisory Committee.
Committee members include representatives of K-12 schools, Career Technology centers, and colleges and universities. The committee will advise the governor on education policy and aid in the development and implementation of the governor's "Oklahoma Works" initiative. The new initiative, announced in Fallin's State of the State Address, seeks to develop local partnerships between the public and private sector to ensure students have access to the education and training they need to find good paying jobs after graduation. More information about the initiative can be found at http://oklahomaworks.gov/.
"Nothing is more important to Oklahoma's future than boosting educational attainment and ensuring our students get the education they need to succeed in the workforce," said Fallin. "Supporting that effort will take input from a wide variety of educators. We want to make sure that K-12 schools, CareerTech and Higher Education all have a seat at the table as we work to improve educational outcomes."
