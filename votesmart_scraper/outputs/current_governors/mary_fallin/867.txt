"Like all Americans, I am deeply concerned about the financial crisis facing our nation. Rest assured I am committed to working with my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representative to craft legislation that will not only ease immediate concerns but also offer long-term stability for our nation's economy.
"On Tuesday, we were presented with a bill I felt did not go far enough in addressing the systemic problems that created this crisis in the first place. The hastily drafted bill asked us to set a dangerous precedent and commit $700 Billion of your money with very little assurance that it would adequately address the problem or offer the fundamental reforms needed to avoid a repeat of the problem.
"227 of my colleagues and I felt this plan did not adequately protect your interests and rewarded poorly run investment firms at the disadvantage of prudent ones. That is why we made the difficult decision to vote no. Instead, we committed to rolling up our sleeves and getting back to work on a plan that will address the inadequacies of the bill we voted against. We believe we can help Wall Street "workout" of this crisis, not force the taxpayers into a "bailout".
"The hundreds of constituents who called my office in the days leading up to this vote demanded a solution that reflected their fundamental belief in fiscal discipline and personal responsibility. Make no mistake, even while the House is officially in recess. I am working with members from both sides of the aisle to produce legislation that will do just that.
"We will return to Washington on Thursday and am confident we will find an alternative solution to the crisis that puts taxpayers first and preserves the integrity and freedom of the American marketplace."
