Governor Mary Fallin today urged President Barack Obama to suspend accepting Syrian refugees into the United States in the wake of deadly terror attacks in Paris being linked to the Islamic State.
"The Obama administration needs to assure the public that the background checks they are doing are rigorous, and that American lives will not be endangered in the process," said Fallin. "Until then, I call on the Obama administration to suspend any Syrian refugees into the United States. During these uncertain times, the Obama administration needs to make sure those entering the United States are not terrorists."
During a U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing last week, FBI Director James Comey said there is a risk bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like Syria.
"The American people need to be assured that national security will not be compromised," said Fallin. "We must maintain a strict verification process against possible terrorists."
Since 2012, three refugees from Syria have been placed in Jenks, according to information from Catholic Charities in Tulsa and the U.S. Department of State. The three, aged 50, 44 and 14, were brought to Jenks to live with family members.
"Oklahomans have welcomed refugees escaping religious persecution for many years and will continue to do so," Fallin said.
