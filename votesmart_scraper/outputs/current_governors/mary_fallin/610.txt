Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement concerning the decision by the parent company of American Airlines to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection:
"As the largest private sector employer in Tulsa, American Airlines is an extremely important part of the Oklahoma community. The company has long and deeply rooted ties to the city and the state, both of which provide the kind of good business climate and educated aerospace workforce the industry requires. Despite the recent announcement, I'm confident that AA and Tulsa will continue their great relationship, and my office stands ready to help in any way it can."
Fallin spoke to American Airlines executives earlier today to express both concern and optimism for the future.
