Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) and local Bethany officials have been working closely in recent weeks to finalize payment of federal funds to help compensate Bethany for losses it suffered after a 2007 ice storm. Their efforts paid off today, as the town received its long awaited federal assistance.
"Congresswomen Mary Fallin's Office has greatly assisted the City of Bethany in obtaining over $200,000 in FEMA reimbursement for the 2007 Ice Storm," said City manager John Shugart.
Last year's ice storm stretched the state's emergency response to the limit, leaving over 640,000 homes and businesses without power and contributing to dozens of fatalities. It also contributed to a costly cleanup and recovery effort in the City of Bethany.
"This storm was one of the worst in recent memory," said Fallin. "FEMA offered this community a hand up in its time of need, and it is finally delivering on that promise. I'm glad to have been able to help facilitate this much needed payment and break whatever logjam was occurring within the federal bureaucracy. The families and taxpayers in Bethany should not get stuck footing a bill like this after a major natural disaster. That's what we have FEMA for."
