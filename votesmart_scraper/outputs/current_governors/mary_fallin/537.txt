Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin and members of her cabinet joined emergency management and homeland security representatives yesterday to discuss Oklahoma's capability to plan for, prevent, respond to and recover from catastrophic events.
The event was designed specifically for state government leaders, featuring scenario-based roundtable discussions tailored to include all facets of state government. It also emphasized the state's ability to manage hazards and the importance of continuing essential services during and after a large-scale disaster.
"We do an exceptional job with emergency management in Oklahoma, but this was an opportunity for the state's top officials to re-examine our existing protocols and procedures while also anticipating the potential challenges a catastrophic disaster may bring," Fallin said.
The training event included discussions on critical pre-disaster planning, use of the incident management system as well as the role of the private sector and media in ensuring continuity of government.
The half-day event was developed and facilitated by the Naval Post Graduate School's Center for Homeland Defense and Security.
