Governor Fallin Lauds Legislature for Passage of Energy Efficiency Bill
Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement on Senate Bill 1096, directing all state agencies and higher education institutions to achieve an energy efficiency and conservation improvement target of at least 20 percent by the year 2020. The governor outlined a proposal for such an initiative in her Oklahoma First Energy Plan and asked the Legislature to write the plan into law in her State of the State address earlier this year. Estimates indicate that savings to the state could range from $300 to $500 million over 10 years.
"This energy efficiency bill is a central component of our agenda to make Oklahoma's state government smaller, smarter and more cost efficient, and I applaud the Legislature for sending it to my desk.
"Senate Bill 1096 has the potential to save hundreds of millions of dollars simply by pursuing common sense energy conservation policies. That's money that can be returned to taxpayers or used to fund essential services like education, transportation, public safety and health initiatives. This is an important step forward for Oklahoma and for anyone who cares about good government."
SB 1096 now heads to the governor's desk.
