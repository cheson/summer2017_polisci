Governor Mary Fallin has ordered all American and Oklahoma flags on state property to be flown at half-staff from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. Thursday to honor the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America.
"September 11 is a day to mourn and remember those who were victims to the worst terror attack in our nation's history," said Fallin. "As we continue to pray for their families and friends, let us also remember and pay tribute to the heroic actions of first responders and volunteers who acted quickly and selflessly -- sometimes even sacrificing their own lives -- to save others.
"As we look back 13 years ago today, we also should keep in mind our troops who serve in our nation's military. These brave men and women willingly leave the comfort of their homes to place themselves in harm's way to ensure the citizens of Oklahoma and the United States can continue to enjoy freedom.
"As a nation, we lost a lot on 9/11," Fallin said. "However, we rose stronger and more resilient. Moving forward, our goal must be to continue to ensure that the events of September 11 never repeat themselves, and that we remain vigilant against those who seek to do us harm or undermine our freedoms."
