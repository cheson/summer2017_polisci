Governor Mary Fallin issued a statement celebrating today's groundbreaking of a $1.3 billion expansion of Koch Nitrogen's plant in Enid, Oklahoma. Koch Nitrogen currently employs approximately 2100 Oklahomans.
"Today's groundbreaking represents a billion dollar investment in the state and the people of Oklahoma. Koch Nitrogen is a large Oklahoma employer and I am grateful for its continued confidence in our workforce and our continued economic growth.
"Four years ago I took office and began pushing pro-growth economic policies that would deliver an economic environment conducive to job creation, business retention and business expansion. This major investment in the state -- along with the more than 102,000 jobs created since 2011 -- demonstrates that those policies are working and benefitting people and communities across Oklahoma." -- Governor Mary Fallin
