Governor Mary Fallin today said three Oklahoma cities have been named to a list of best places to start a business.
WalletHub recently released its 2016 Best Cities to Start a Business, ranking the 150 most populous cities in the U.S. based on business environment, access to resources and costs.
Oklahoma City ranked No. 3 overall (up 18 spots from 2015), just behind Sioux Falls, S.D. and Grand Rapids, Mich. It also ranked No. 7 in business environment.
Tulsa ranked No. 9 overall, including No. 4 in costs, and Enid ranked No. 11.
"Small businesses are the backbone of Oklahoma's economy, creating a large portion of jobs in our state. We are happy to see these three cities being recognized for being great places for business start-ups," said Fallin. "The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well across Oklahoma, and we will continue to support business-friendly policies that will help cultivate small businesses."
WalletHub's analysts developed their findings by using 16 key metrics, ranging from five-year survival rate to affordability of office space to educational attainment of the local labor force.
