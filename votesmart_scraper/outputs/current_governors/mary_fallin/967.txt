Fallin Calls For Clean War Funding Bill
U.S. Congresswoman Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, addressed the full floor of the House of Representatives today, calling on Congressional leaders to bring forward a clean funding bill for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House voted today on a war funding bill that included arbitrary timelines for troop withdrawal and preconditions on when and where troops can be deployed. Fallin voted against the bill saying that it represents a misguided attempt to transfer control of the war from our generals to Washington politicians.
"It is absurd to assume that this war can be planned by the 535 members of Congress instead of our generals and our Commander in Chief," said Fallin. "Waging war by committee is not an option. I encourage the Democrat leadership of this Congress to immediately bring forward a clean bill that provides the necessary funds for our troops and leaves tactical decisions in the hands of our generals."
The final bill passed by a margin of 218 - 208. All five Representatives from Oklahoma voted against the bill.
