Fallin: President Supports Tax Increases On Americans To Pay For Government Run Healthcare
Press Release

Location: Washington, DC

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) released the following statement in response to President Obama's press conference last night:
"It's no secret that we need to reform our nation's healthcare system to provide all Americans with quality, affordable access to medical care. Last night, President Obama failed to address any of the questions Oklahomans, and families across the country, have asked about this plan.
"Instead, the president affirmed his support for tax increases on Americans and businesses to pay for this takeover. His plan costs too much, spends too much and taxes too much, all to fund the same kind of big government programs that have failed us in the past. Make no mistake, the president's plan will wedge a federal bureaucrat between every decision made by you and your doctor if it becomes law.
"I support measures to reduce healthcare costs and improve access to quality care, but we can pursue these reforms without socializing medicine or imposing devastating tax increases on individuals and small businesses. We must take the time to listen to our constituents and enact reforms that lead to real cost savings for American families and businesses."
