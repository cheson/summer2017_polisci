Governor Mary Fallin Comments on Oklahoma Victory in Anti-Obamacare Lawsuit
Press Release

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement regarding U.S. District Judge Ronald White's ruling in favor of a 2012 lawsuit filed by the state of Oklahoma. The suit challenges the constitutionality of provisions within the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
"For years, I have argued that Obamacare represents bad policy, irresponsible spending, an outrageous expansion of federal authority into the private sector, and unconstitutional law. Since 2012, the state of Oklahoma has been fighting the implementation of the ACA, both to protect our citizens from the negative effects of this law -- including devastating cuts to Medicare -- and to stand up for Constitutional principles.
"Today, Oklahomans won a major victory, as a United States District Court ruled in favor of Oklahoma's lawsuit challenging the implementation of Obamacare. My thanks go out to Attorney General Scott Pruitt and his team who have relentlessly continued the fight to defend Oklahomans from federal overreach and unconstitutional mandates."
