Fallin Rejects Proposal to Raise Taxes

Oklahoma Congresswoman Mary Fallin rejected a budget proposal today that would dramatically raise taxes and fail to address the crisis of ballooning entitlement spending. Fallin released the following statement:
"The American people are asking Congress to pass a budget that is fiscally responsible, but it seems Congressional leaders aren't listening. The Democrats' budget proposes $683 billion in tax hikes, the largest tax increase in our nation's history. It does so while pouring billions of dollars into expanding the federal government and continuing to ignore the unsustainable growth in spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
"At a time when American families are struggling with the rising cost of living and an uncertain economy, the same old "tax and spend" philosophy isn't going to cut it. The American people deserve more than a job-killing tax hike and a continued unwillingness to address long term problems. It is my hope that Speaker Pelosi and other Congressional leaders will listen to the American people, abandon their plan to raise taxes and make a renewed commitment to controlling spending."
