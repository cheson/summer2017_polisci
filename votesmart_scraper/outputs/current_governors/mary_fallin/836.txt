Fallin Blasts AIG Bonuses
Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) released the following statement today, strongly criticizing AIG's decision to award executives more than $165 million in bonuses after receiving government bailout' funds:
"The behavior of AIG's executives in light of the current economic crisis is outrageous. When taxpayers pump billions of dollars into supporting a firm on the brink of failure, collectively sacrificing to avoid the collapse of our financial system, it not just irresponsible, it is immoral and disgraceful to award executives extravagant bonuses.
"We have now seen two administrations very publicly fail to assure that taxpayer dollars are spent in a way that is effective and responsible. It is unacceptable for another federal dime to be spent on Wall Street unless an appropriate and enforceable oversight mechanism is in place and the American public is presented with a clear exit strategy where bailouts' are concerned."
