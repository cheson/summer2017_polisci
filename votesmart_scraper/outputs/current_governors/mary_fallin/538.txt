Roughly 60,000 delegates from around the world have come to Calgary for the the Global Petroleum Show.
On Tuesday night, several hundred people attended a reception where Premier Alison Redford made a quick speech.
"I'll say to some of our international visitors that as part of a stable democratic nation that values free enterprise and economic protection we believe that Alberta has successfully used innovation and technology to build our province and to build our energy sector," she said.
As much of the crowd continued to chat and visit, Redford talked about how energy has been key to economic development in Alberta and the rest of Canada. She says the energy sector can be relied upon to build a strong and stable economy.
The premier says Alberta has always welcomed innovators and investment.
"We know that this show that allows people to connect to each other here in Alberta, across Canada and around the world is key to success not only in this city but this province and this country," she said.
Redford and Alberta's minister of energy plan to address the conference at a breakfast meeting Wednesday morning.
American governor in attendance
Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin is also one of the key guests at the Global Petroleum Show that kicked off in Calgary Tuesday.
