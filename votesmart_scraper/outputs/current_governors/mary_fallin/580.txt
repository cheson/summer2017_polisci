Oklahoma's long and colorful aviation history is part of the fabric of the state, and its economic contributions have sustained it through wars and recessions, Gov. Mary Fallin said Tuesday.
Speaking at the 2012 Partnership Conference - sponsored by the Oklahoma Airport Operators Association, the Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission and the Federal Aviation Administration Southwest Region Airports Division - Fallin said the Oklahoma aviation industry precedes statehood.
The governor spoke before 350 people at the Renaissance Tulsa Hotel and Convention Center.
While Oklahoma's oil boom was beginning with the drilling of the Ida E. Glenn No. 1 well 10 miles south of Tulsa in 1905, Clyde Cessna began flying his first airplane, Fallin said.
"Another Oklahoman named Wiley Post discovered the jet stream and twice set records for flying aircraft around the world," she said. "He invented the first pressurized space suit," refinements of which were used by fellow Oklahomans and astronauts Gordon Cooper and Gen. Thomas Stafford, the governor said.
Components of the spacecraft flown in the Apollo moon program of the 1960s and 1970s as well as parts of NASA's space shuttle were built in Tulsa at Rockwell International Corp., which became Spirit AeroSystems Inc., Fallin said.
