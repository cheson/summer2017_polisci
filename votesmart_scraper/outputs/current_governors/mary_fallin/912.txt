Fallin Reacts to Hearing on Rising Gasoline Prices

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (R-OK) and other members of the Small Business Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight held a hearing today to discuss the impact of rising fuel prices on small businesses. The members called several expert witnesses to testify, including Dr. Vincent Orza, a small business owner and Dean of the Meinders School of Business at Oklahoma City University.
Fallin, who serves as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, released the following statement:
"The small business owners and industry experts who testified today made it clear their businesses are feeling the pinch of rising fuel costs. Soaring energy prices reduce the profit margin for these businesses and can force both wage cuts on employees and price increases on consumers. The implications for our national economy are alarming.
"The testimony we heard today reinforces my convictions about the role of government in relation to American energy. Congress must take action to reduce the United States' dependence on foreign oil by increasing domestic production. Doing so will help to provide consumer relief and alleviate our dangerous dependence on foreign energy sources.
"In the long term, our government should continue to aggressively encourage research into both conservation techniques and alternative energy sources. Nuclear energy, biofuels and wind and solar power will all play an important role in our energy future."
