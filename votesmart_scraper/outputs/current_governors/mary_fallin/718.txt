Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today opposed Speaker Pelosi's latest installment of taxpayer funded bailouts, partially paid for with $9.8 billion worth of tax increases on American businesses. "This legislation is another big-spending bailout our nation simply cannot afford," said Fallin. "This $26.1 billion bill rewards states for years of budget recklessness while raising taxes on our nation's job creators. Furthermore, Congress should not continue to allocate additional funds when $34 billion of the $100 billion in education funding provided in last year's stimulus bill remains unspent."
"Strengthening our nation's health care and education programs are top priorities, but both must be accomplished in a fiscally responsible manner," Fallin insisted. "Unfortunately, this two-year funding band-aid will be paid for by ten years worth of job-killing tax increases on American businesses. This is not the kind of sustainable solution these programs need for long-term success."

Fallin said H.R. 1586 is the third time in three years the federal government will prop up state and local governments. "Bailouts will only perpetuate the cycle of state budget shortfalls without addressing the root causes. That is why we must zero in on both job creation and government efficiency to simultaneously strengthen our economy and improve taxpayers' return on their investment in government."
