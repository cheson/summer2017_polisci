Governor Mary Fallin and Oklahoma Secretary of State and Native American Affairs Chris Benge announced today the State Charitable Campaign (SCC) surpassed its 2014 donation goal by raising $603,617 to benefit SCC member charities.
The SCC offers an efficient, accountable way for state employees to contribute to over 200 local, statewide and international charities.
The charities support a variety of services, including feeding the hungry, education for children in poverty, senior care and many others.
This year, state employees contributed $47,303 more than the previous year, said Benge, who served as the 2014 SCC chairman.
"I appreciate all of the hard work and dedication from state employees this year who have stepped up and donated some of their hard-earned money to a variety of worthy causes," said Benge. "The contributions will go a long way in helping these organizations sustain quality care to the people who depend on the services provided."
The annual campaign ran from September 9 through December 15.
"To have a lofty goal of nearly a half million dollars and surpass it speaks to the quality of character and generous spirit of our state employees," said Fallin. "It continues to show that whenever Oklahomans are struggling or a community is struggling, we can always count on each other for support."
The SCC is open to all state agencies. For agencies looking to become involved in the 2015 campaign, applications are now being accepted.
