Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement regarding the passage of House Joint Resolution 1092 in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. The bill had been defeated earlier in the day, but was reconsidered and passed on Thursday night.
"Because of the extraordinary efforts of Rep. Mark McBride and Rep. Jon Echols, who represent communities in Moore and Oklahoma City that were hard-hit by last year's storms, HJR 1092 has been revived and is now heading to the Senate for final passage. These legislators have my thanks and appreciation for their work on this bill and their dedication to making Oklahoma schools safer for children and teachers.
"It is now up to the Senate to act on this bill and ensure the people of Oklahoma have a chance to vote on a plan to help put more storm shelters and safe rooms in our schools."
