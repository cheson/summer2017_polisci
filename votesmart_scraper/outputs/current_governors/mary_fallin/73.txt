Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement on the Memorial Day holiday.
"I encourage all Oklahomans during this Memorial Day weekend to take time to remember and honor the sacrifices of the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces. Their service keeps our nation free and protects the freedoms we enjoy every day. Oklahomans have a deep and profound respect for the men and women of our military -- and their families. We can never fully repay the debt of gratitude owed to them.
"I'm wishing Oklahomans a safe and fun Memorial Day weekend. I know they will join me in keeping our former and current military personnel in their thoughts and prayers."
