Fallin earns additional committee assignment
U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin (R-OK) was named today as a new member of the Committee on Natural Resources. The committee has jurisdiction over issues relating to public lands, water and energy, as well as issues affecting Native Americans.
"In just a short time Mary has proven herself as an effective advocate in representing her constituents here in Washington," said Minority leader John Boehner (R-OH). "I know she will be a valuable asset to the Natural Resources Committee and continue to serve the interests of Oklahoma's 5th district in this critical post."
Also commenting on Fallin's appointment was Don Young (R-AK), Ranking Member of the Committee. "Our committee deals with numerous issues important to the nation and to Oklahoma," said Young. "Congresswoman Fallin's extensive experience as a State Legislator and Lieutenant Governor should serve her well here. From fish and wildlife, to public lands and water and energy issues, I know that she will bring a strong background to our work. She's an excellent addition to our Committee."
Reacting to her new assignment, Fallin said, "I am honored to be asked to serve in this additional capacity. I believe this additional committee assignment will offer me an opportunity to serve the people of Oklahoma and the fifth district even more effectively. I appreciate leadership's confidence in my ability and look forward to this new challenge."
Mary joins two other members of the Oklahoma Delegation serving on the Natural Resources Committee, Democrat Dan Boren and Republican Tom Cole.
