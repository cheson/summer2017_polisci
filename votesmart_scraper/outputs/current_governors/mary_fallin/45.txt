Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement on action taken by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in response to the 5.0 magnitude earthquake Sunday evening in the Cushing area:
"I support the quick action taken today by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in our state, as it worked closely with state researchers at the Oklahoma Geological Survey to put in place mandatory reductions in activity impacting induced seismicity. Two years ago, we established the coordinating council on seismicity. Regulators continue to target areas for additional scrutiny that are experiencing increased seismic activity, which has led to the shutting down of disposal wells or reducing the volume of disposal wells and flow pressure in known fault lines where we believe there is a correlation to earthquakes."
- Governor Mary Fallin
