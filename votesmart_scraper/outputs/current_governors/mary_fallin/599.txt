Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement regarding Martin Luther King, Jr. Day:
"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. preached a message of tolerance, mutual respect and human dignity that is just as relevant today as it was when he lived. He was a patriot who believed in the great potential of the United States of America and the message of freedom and equality of opportunity for which it still stands. I encourage all Oklahomans to join me in remembering and honoring Dr. King's legacy on the 26th anniversary of the first Martin Luther King, Jr. Day."
