Governor Mary Fallin today issued the following statement regarding the one year anniversary of last year's May tornadoes:
"One year ago today, a devastating tornado took the life of 25 Oklahomans. Unfortunately, that tornado was neither the first nor the last during what was an extremely difficult and tragic month for the people of Oklahoma. We lost 49 lives and 1300 homes to storms during one of the worst stretches of severe weather in the history of our state.
"Today, please join me in remembering and praying for those who lost loved ones as well as those who suffered injuries or lost homes.
"On the one year anniversary of the Moore tornado, I would also like to offer my appreciation to all those who helped in the rescue, recovery and rebuilding of Moore and other communities hit by last year's storms. In the wake of the tornadoes, we witnessed incredible courage, resiliency and generosity. We are deeply indebted to our first responders, who worked tirelessly to save lives and property; the many volunteers, churches and non-profits that helped with cleanup and recovery; and the countless men and women from all over the world who donated their time and resources to give Oklahomans a hand up during the most challenging of circumstances.
"Because of their efforts and the incredible spirit of the people of Oklahoma, we are stronger today than we were one year ago. We are and always will be Oklahoma Strong."
