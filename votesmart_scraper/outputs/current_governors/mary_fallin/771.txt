BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Speaker, the American people understand the need for health care reform. They just don't want socialized medicine. They don't want the Federal Government taking over our health care decisions, taking away our freedoms of choice about health care. They don't want more Federal deficit spending on the backs of our children and future generations of our children, and they don't want more taxes upon small business, especially in this recession.
They don't like the Federal Government taking away our freedoms guaranteed under this Constitution, and they don't want the Federal Government interfering in our States' rights. They don't want unfunded mandates upon the States, and they don't want government-funded taxpayer abortions upon our families.
Mr. Speaker, men and women have fought for our freedoms for this Nation for generations, but this health care bill will change the face of our Nation and put our Nation on a trajectory of a Federal Government takeover in so many areas of our freedoms and our lives.
Let's reject this health care bill, and let's start all over and pass real, meaningful health care reform.
