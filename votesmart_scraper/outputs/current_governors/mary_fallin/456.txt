Governor Mary Fallin today made the following statement regarding Independence Day.
"Independence Day is a great time for all of us to reflect on what it means to be an American. It's especially important for us to remember -- and be thankful for -- the men and women in our armed services who are protecting our freedoms around the world and here at home. Their sacrifice, and the sacrifices their families face daily, should make us all proud to be Americans.
"We are blessed to live in a country where freedom and liberty are still valued. I am proud to be an American, and I know that all Oklahomans appreciate the sacrifice and love of country that have enabled us to live in freedom."
