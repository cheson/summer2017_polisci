STOP THE POLITICAL GAMES
Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Speaker, this is a difficult time for our Nation. We are all war weary. We are all heartbroken over any loss of life, and we are all concerned about the cost of the war.
All Americans, Republicans, Democrats, and, yes, the President, want this war over as soon as possible. It's time to stop the political games and put the needs of our men and our women defending our Nation first.
The people of America want a solution to bring the troops home, but not at the expense of jeopardizing the safety and the future of our Nation. As a Nation, we must make a strong commitment and a declaration to the world that the United States will defend itself and will not tolerate terrorism, nor will we coddle terrorists or surrender or appease them.
The Commander in Chief vetoed a bill which sought to micromanage the war on terror, tie the hands of our generals, and provide a surrender date to the enemies. Congress must uphold the President's veto, set aside the cut-and-run attitude, the loser attitude, for good.
Where is the pride for the defense our Nation, the liberty and the freedoms that thousands of men and women have given their lives for in earlier years?
