Issue Position: Health Care
The rising cost of health care is one of the most dangerous threats to our economy. It impacts the cost of doing business, threatens jobs and stretches many family budgets to the breaking point. There are some common-sense solutions to rein in out-of-control costs:
* Comprehensive tort reform. The high cost of malpractice insurance is being passed on to patients and forcing an ever growing number of physicians to give up "high-risk" specialties. The health of our nation should not be held hostage by the trial bar.
* Promote association health care plans that will give small businesses the same bargaining power with insurance carriers that big businesses have.
* Resist efforts to nationalize our healthcare system. During the Clinton administration I traveled the state to make sure Oklahomans understood so-called "Hillary care" was nothing more than an attempt to replace a free market system with more government programs. It simply doesn't work.
