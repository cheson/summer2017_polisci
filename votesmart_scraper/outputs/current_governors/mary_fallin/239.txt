Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement regarding a video showing several members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma using racial slurs.
"The racist words chanted by the students in this video do not represent OU values or Oklahoma values. As the outrage among Oklahomans has demonstrated, we are a state that does not tolerate that kind of disrespectful behavior. I appreciate President Boren as well as OU's faculty, staff and students for quickly condemning these hurtful words and demonstrating the true nature of our Oklahoma community, which is diverse, compassionate and respectful." -- Gov. Mary Fallin
