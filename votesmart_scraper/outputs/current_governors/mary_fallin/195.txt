Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin on Friday signed legislation approving funding for the Oklahoma Museum of Popular Culture, to be located in Tulsa, commonly known as OKPOP. Senate Bill 839 provides a $25 million bond for construction of the museum. Once built, no state appropriations will be required to fund operations.

Land for the facility has been donated, and an estimated $10 million in exhibits and collections will also be donated, rather than purchased. The Oklahoma Historical Society has secured prominent collections from figures such as Garth Brooks, Will Rogers and Bob Wills, among numerous others.

"The OKPOP Museum will be a tourism destination and a source of economic growth and development for the city of Tulsa," said Fallin. "It's another addition to a beautiful city that continues to grow every day."

SB 839 was authored by House Speaker Jeffrey Hickman and Senate Pro Tem Brian Bingman. It passed in both chambers with bipartisan support.
