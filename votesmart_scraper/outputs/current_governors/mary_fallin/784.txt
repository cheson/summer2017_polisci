Pelosi Picks Partisan Politics Over Meaningful Reform
Press Release

In response to House consideration of a resolution formally reprimanding Congressman Joe Wilson (SC-02), Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) released the following statement:
"Following his remarks last week, Congressman Wilson promptly apologized, as he should have, to both Speaker Pelosi and President Obama for his inappropriate remarks. Both have accepted his apology and as far as I'm concerned, that should be the end of it. To drag this out any longer reeks of nothing more than partisan politics at a time when the American people have made it clear they want congress to keep their eye on the ball and pass meaningful reform.
"I will vote Â‘no' on this resolution. Americans are tired of political gaming and ready to debate real reform, and so am I. It's obvious the Speaker would rather play partisan games than address American's concerns about rising health care costs and creating new jobs."
