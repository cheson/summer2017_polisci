From The Hill Blog: Healthcare Reform: You Won't Necessarily Get What You Pay For

Ensuring Americans have access to quality and affordable care that best fits their medical needs should be a priority for every lawmaker. Unaffordable medical costs are hurting our economy, families and businesses.
Unfortunately, the Democrats' plan to nationalize the health care system will wedge bureaucrats between patients and doctors, which will be damaging to both the health of our citizens and our national economy. The Majority's plan to tax our way to health reform will drive up costs, drive down quality and drive employers out of business.
The results of this huge expansion of government will be costly and counterproductive to the long term goal of delivering quality, affordable health insurance. With a price tag well over one trillion dollars, our medical treatments will have to be rationed by Uncle Sam since this bill does nothing to control medical costs or rein in federal spending. At a time when the nation's deficit is exploding, we cannot afford to neglect the skyrocketing prices of medical insurance. These insurance costs place a crushing burden on both our families and our businesses, creating hardship and reducing our competitiveness in a global economy.
I believe there are fiscally responsible, market-driven solutions to our nation's healthcare crisis that will ensure affordable access while emphasizing high quality care. Congress should pursue these common sense solutions and reject the type of big government, big taxing plans that have failed so many times in the past. I urge the Majority to reach out to the other side of the aisle and incorporate market-oriented solutions to protect the relationship between patients and doctors.
