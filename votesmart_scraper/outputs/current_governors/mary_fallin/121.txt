Governor Mary Fallin today announced she has re-appointed Rick Davis to the Board of Regents for Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges. He has served on the board since 2011, when he was appointed to fill an unexpired term.
Davis, of Guthrie, is one of the governor's three at-large appointees to the nine-member board, which also includes the president of the Oklahoma State Board of Agriculture and representatives from each of Oklahoma's five congressional districts.
"Rick has done an outstanding job of using his agricultural background to bolster state colleges overseen by the Board of Regents for Oklahoma A&M Colleges," Fallin said. "I am confident he will continue to guide those institutions as they raise the bar for education in our state, ensuring a bright future for their graduates."
