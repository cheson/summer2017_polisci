Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today requested a federal disaster declaration for Woodward County in the wake of the deadly tornado that swept through the town of Woodward early Sunday morning. The designation would provide federal assistance to individuals and businesses in the tornado-ravaged area.
Six confirmed deaths including three children and 36 injuries are attributed to the Woodward tornado. According to preliminary damage assessments conducted this weekend, the storm impacted 224 homes and businesses in Woodward County. Of those, 73 were destroyed, 22 sustained major damage and 21 had minor damage.
"Last weekend's deadly tornadoes led to the tragic loss of six lives and destroyed or severely damaged many homes and businesses," Fallin said. "Having spoken with many of the residents in Woodward who lost everything, I know how important it is to do everything in our power to quickly rebuild this community. This disaster declaration would be an important first step in helping residents and businesses get back on their feet."
If the request is approved, those who suffered damage will be eligible for assistance for housing repairs or temporary housing, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) low-interest loans for individuals and businesses to repair or replace damaged property, disaster unemployment assistance, and grants for serious needs and necessary disaster expenses not met by other programs.
If the disaster declaration is granted, additional counties could later be added.
