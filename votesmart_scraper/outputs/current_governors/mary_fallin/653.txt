Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today signed into law a measure to consolidate the Oklahoma Human Rights Commission into the Attorney General's Office. Senate Bill 763, by Sen. Clark Jolley and Rep. Dan Sullivan, will save tax dollars through the consolidation of shared administrative services while continuing the mission of protecting citizens from discrimination and human rights violations.
SB 763 creates within the Attorney General's Office an Office of Civil Rights Enforcement that will assume the functions, duties and responsibilities of the Human Rights Commission.
"Protecting human rights is an important function of government and I support the goal of eliminating discrimination," Fallin said. "Merging the responsibilities and duties of the Human Rights Commission into the Attorney General's Office will result in cost savings and will better serve to elevate the mission of protecting human rights."
Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt said the AG's office will work diligently to transition the commission into the Office of Civil Rights Enforcement.
"The objectives of the Oklahoma Human Rights Commission and its focus on civil rights fit well with our mission as the state's attorney to defend the rights of Oklahomans," Pruitt said. "We take seriously the responsibility to protect the citizens of our state, and plan to fulfill that obligation with efficiency and professionalism."
