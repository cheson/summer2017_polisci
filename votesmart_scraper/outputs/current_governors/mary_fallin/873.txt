Fallin Votes to Restore Funds for Roads and Bridges

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) voted today to restore $8 billion to the Highway Trust Fund and avert an impending crisis caused by a funding shortfall. The bipartisan bill has now passed in both the House and Senate and is expected to be quickly signed into law by President Bush.
The passage of the bill is timely. As the trust fund fell from $4.2 billion to less than $1.2 billion in recent months, Oklahoma was forced to briefly delay funding for future construction projects, including the Interstate 40/Crosstown Expressway in Oklahoma City. The legislation that passed today should put those projects back on track and provide more than $170 million in available funds for the Oklahoma Department of Transportation.
Fallin, who serves on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, called the measure a "temporary solution to a long term problem." She said she was looking forward to Congress taking on the more difficult challenge of developing "sustainable, long term, transportation policy," but praised today's legislation as a necessary first step.
"I am pleased that Congress took swift, bipartisan action on legislation that will help to adequately fund our roads and bridges in the near future," said Fallin. "Passing this bill is the right thing for Oklahoma, and the right thing for the United States."
