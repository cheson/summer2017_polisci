Fallin Applauds Vote Supporting General Petraeus and Men and Women in Uniform
U.S. Congresswoman Mary Fallin (R-OK) applauded the passage today of a resolution supporting General Petraeus and other men and women in the Armed Forces. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, had recently been the subject of a vicious and highly personal attack ad placed in the New York Times by the radical liberal interest group MoveOn.org.
The resolution condemned MoveOn's ad "in the strongest possible terms" and honored "all members of the Armed Services" and their families. It passed by a vote of 341-79.
"At a time when our troops are fighting abroad for our safety and freedom, it is almost incomprehensible that our top General could be the target of vicious political attacks at home," said Fallin.
"Regardless of one's position on the War, MoveOn's recent attempt to cast doubt on the patriotism of General Petraeus has defied every standard of decency that we might seek to hold them to.
"I am pleased that most members of House, regardless of party, could come together and condemn this vicious attack on an honorable military man. I am proud to have cast my vote in his defense and in defense of all members of our Armed Services. Name calling and political mud-throwing in a time of war accomplish nothing and demean a debate that should be both serious and civilized."
