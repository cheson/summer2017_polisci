Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today joined other House Republicans in calling on Wall Street CEO's to testify before Congress to explain how their firms are using funds provided by the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). In a letter addressed to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, Fallin and others said that Wall Street executives should be required to testify, as auto executives have, as to how their institution has or would use public funds and what steps they have taken to ensure a working business model.
"Today I joined other Republican colleagues in asking Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Barney Frank to summon Wall Street CEO's whose firms have received TARP money to the capitol," said Fallin. "Taxpayers deserve the highest possible level of accountability and transparency. To ensure we get that, Congress needs to hear from these CEO's to determine that federal funds are being used responsibly, the rescue program is working and, of course, that taxpayers will be reimbursed for their significant investment in the nation's financial institutions."
