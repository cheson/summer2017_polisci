Fallin Passes McGee Creek Bill

U.S. Congresswoman Mary Fallin, R-OK, passed legislation in the House of Representatives today that approves a long awaited land transfer between the Federal Bureau of Reclamation and the McGee Creek Authority. The legislation was co-sponsored and brought to the floor with the help of Congressman Dan Boren of Oklahoma.
The bill formally transfers ownership rights of the water pipeline, pumping facility and other maintenance facilities surrounding the McGee Creek Reservoir from the Federal Bureau of Reclamation to the local governments that make up the McGee Creek Authority. The land transfer is prepaid and supported by both the Bureau and the McGee Creek Authority.
Following the vote, Fallin said, "This bill represents a win-win situation for both the State of Oklahoma and the federal government. In Oklahoma, the McGee Creek Authority will no longer have to navigate federal bureaucracy in order to make updates and improvements to their water facility. That should make it easier to provide top quality water services to Oklahomans who receive their water from McGee Creek.
"H.R. 2085 also reduces the amount of administrative review and paperwork that the Bureau of Reclamation is required to perform. Ultimately, that will save them time and money."
"This bill is a good thing for Oklahoma, and I'm glad we were able to get it passed in the House."
