Bureaucrats In Charge Of Health Care
Floor Speech

Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Speaker, the American people are concerned about keeping their jobs and the huge deficit that we have incurred here and in the Senate, and passing that debt on down to future generations of our children.
With over a thousand pages, the Democrat health care bill costs too much, spends too much, and will destroy jobs in America. Health care reform should be about lowering costs, providing quality, affordable care for all Americans. And this health care debate must consider that every individual has different health care needs and that Americans are struggling to pay their bills.
The Democrat leadership has failed to address these needs by supporting the same old, tired proposals of massive Federal new spending and increased Federal regulation, which will cost the United States more jobs.
This time, cutting a bigger Federal check won't do it. Their plan amounts to $818 billion in new taxes on individuals, on businesses, and a Federal takeover of our health care system. These taxes will crush our small business owners and destroy thousands of jobs.
This plan will put bureaucrats in charge of our health care--and the American people don't want that.
