Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement on the vote on House Bill 2365 in the House of Representatives Joint Committee on Appropriations and Budget meeting this afternoon:
"I am disappointed the House Democrats on the Joint Appropriations and Budget Committee voted against the cigarette and gasoline revenue measure to help fund education, public safety, health and infrastructure," said Fallin. "They have said they want to fix our large budget shortfall, but where's the vote? The people of Oklahoma want solutions to the problems our state is facing. It's time to put aside partisanship to solve our problems."
