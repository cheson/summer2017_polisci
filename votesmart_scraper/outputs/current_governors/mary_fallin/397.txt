Governor Mary Fallin issued the following statement today on the Oklahoma Senate's passage of Senate Bill 1246, which would lower the state's income tax rate to below 5 percent if the state's economy continues to improve:
"An income tax cut is an important way to stimulate the economy, create jobs and help middle class families. I am open to any and all plans, including the measure passed by the Senate today, that responsibly reduce the income tax rate. I am pleased the Legislature is examining several different tax cut proposals and I encourage them to remain committed to passing a tax reduction measure this year."
SB 1246, which passed the Senate 32-10, was authored by Senate President Pro Tempore Brian Bingman. It now goes to the House of Representatives.
