STOP PLAYING GAMES WITH AMERICAN ENERGY PRODUCTION -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008)
Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Speaker, my, my, my, what a difference one night can make. Last night we were in session until about 7:15. There was no energy bill. All of a sudden, we wake up this morning and we have an energy bill, but it's an energy bill that even the majority of, well, I would say even the conservative Blue Dog Democrats have not seen, much less even the Republicans in the House. And so why do we have this today happening?
It's because there are people in this body who do not want to produce energy for America. We're playing games with American energy production. We're hurting the American economy. We're hurting the pocketbooks of our American businesses. We're increasing our dependence on the foreign oil.
All of the Americans right now are very concerned about our economy, they're concerned about our unstable financial institutions, they're concerned about home foreclosures, they're concerned about trade deficits, they're concerned about foreign countries who are coming in and buying American assets. They're concerned about the cost of gasoline, the cost of food, the cost of consumer goods.
You know, families are struggling, businesses are struggling. But yet in this body, we have an energy bill that has been brought forth today that we have not seen, that we have not had time to debate, to look at. It's one of the most important issues facing our Nation.
Producing an American energy bill that produces American energy is the course for the future of this Nation. It's a threat to America's national security, our economic security not to pass the energy bill.
