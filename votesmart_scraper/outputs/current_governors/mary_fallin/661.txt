Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin released the following statement today on the successful elimination of Osama bin Laden by U.S. armed forces:
"Our military men and women and our intelligence officers have once again made the world a safer place. This is a great victory in the War on Terror and a defeat for Al Qaeda and all those who use terror as a weapon. It is also, I hope, a cause for relief and for closure among the many men and women who lost loved ones in the September 11th attacks. I would encourage all Oklahomans and Americans to keep the victims of 9/11 and their families in our thoughts and prayers as we celebrate this important victory for the United States and all freedom-loving people."
