LET'S VOTE ON AMERICAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008)
(Ms. FALLIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Speaker, in just 2 weeks, children from all across America and in my district will be starting back to school. All over America, school officials are struggling with the rising costs of fuel. They have to run their buses twice a day for the next 9 months. And in some States, they're already talking about cutting back on bus routes. They're already talking about forcing some children to have to walk to school, and even going to four-day-a-week school classes. That's just not inconvenient for our families and our children, but it's flat-out dangerous for our children, especially our young ones.
Day after day, we wait for this House and the Democratic leadership to allow us a vote on expanded energy resources, whether it is drilling, whether it is alternative resources--wind, solar, nuclear, refinery capacity, and day after day they say no.
In just a few weeks, our children, who have been riding buses safely, are now going to have to alter the way they get to school.
Mr. Speaker, time is up. It's time for us to vote on the American Energy Act. Let's vote on it today. Let's vote on it before we go on our August break. Let's give the American people relief on gas prices.
