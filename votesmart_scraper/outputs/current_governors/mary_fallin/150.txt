Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin announced today that Jari Askins, special adviser on child welfare and Pinnacle Plan implementation, is leaving her post on October 1 to become the administrative director of Oklahoma's courts.
The governor in April tapped Askins, a former Oklahoma lieutenant governor, to oversee implementation of the Pinnacle Plan, the Oklahoma Department of Human Services' (DHS) ongoing effort to reform the state's child welfare operations.
"I appreciate Jari's hard work these past six months to improve child welfare services and to serve as my special adviser," said Fallin. "She made a lot of progress in a very short period of time to ensure the Pinnacle Plan was being implemented appropriately. I wish her well in her new position."
