Governor Mary Fallin today announced she is appointing Andy Lester to the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education.
Lester will replace Marlin "Ike" Glass Jr., whom Fallin thanked for his 18 years of dedicated service to the state as a regent. Glass's second nine-year term expires in May.
Lester, of Edmond, has served on the Board of Regents for Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical (A&M) Colleges since 2007. His appointment requires Senate confirmation
Lester will continue to serve on the A&M board until the Senate approves his appointment.
"Andy has proven himself to be a champion for education," Fallin said. "That is what our state needs as we try to close the skills gap that has left nearly 80,000 jobs unfilled in Oklahoma because of a lack of qualified candidates."
