Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today accepted the "Ratings Award for 2009" from the American Conservative Union. The award is presented annually to Congressional members scoring 80 percent or higher on a variety of votes pertaining to taxes, government spending, cultural issues, defense and foreign policy. Fallin received a 96 percent rating for 2009, an affirmation of her consistent and conservative record in Congress.
"This award is a reflection of Representative Mary Fallin's consistent support of conservative principles on a wide range of issues of concern to grass roots conservatives in 2009. At a challenging time when the fundamental principles on which the American system of government are being challenged, Representative Mary Fallin stands with those who are trying to preserve those principles," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union.
"Conservative values have been the foundation of my service to Oklahoma for over 20 years," Fallin said. "Now more than ever, these principles will see us out of the big-government, big-spending policies that have been the hallmark of this administration. I am proud to call myself a true conservative and will remain steadfast in my dedication to small government, strong national defense and traditional family values."
