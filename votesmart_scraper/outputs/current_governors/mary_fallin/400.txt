Governor Mary Fallin today praised the Oklahoma Senate for its quick and decisive action in approving Senate Bill 2044, which would authorize a $160 million bond issue to repair the crumbling state Capitol.
The Senate passed the measure 36-11. It now goes to the House of Representatives.
"Many thanks to the senators who voted to support this measure, which would pay for much-needed repairs to the state Capitol," said Fallin. "It's our responsibility to maintain and preserve our seat of government. A bond issue is the best, most realistic option for restoring the People's House."
Governor Fallin proposed a bond for repairs to the state Capitol in her 2014 executive budget and her State of the State Address that she submitted earlier this month to lawmakers.
SB 2044 is authored by Senate President Pro Tem Brian Bingman and was carried by Sen. Greg Treat.
