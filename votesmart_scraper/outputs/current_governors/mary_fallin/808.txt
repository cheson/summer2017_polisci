Ms. FALLIN. Madam Speaker, I have to say that I am outraged. Here we are getting ready to vote on a piece of legislation, and we haven't even seen 300 pieces of this legislation. No one can even find the bill or even knows where it is at. And here we are talking about major policy that could change the face of America, that will certainly be a large tax increase to our taxpayers. And here we don't even know where the bill is. I'm just shocked at the way we are running this House today before we leave to go on our Independence Day holiday.
And I will say that the government's first priority right now should be addressing our economy and jobs. And economists can tell you that one of the surest ways to prolong a recession and to damage an economy is to raise taxes. My friends on the other side of the aisle apparently didn't get that memo.
This plan for carbon emissions taxes amounts to a $646 billion tax increase on the American public. It will have a negative effect upon every American family, upon business and upon family farms. Family energy costs will increase. In fact, it is said that utility costs can go up anywhere from 30 to 50 percent, not to even mention what cost increases will be upon manufacturing.
So Madam Speaker, I will just tell you that I hope we get a copy of the bill so we can at least look at it before we enact this policy.
