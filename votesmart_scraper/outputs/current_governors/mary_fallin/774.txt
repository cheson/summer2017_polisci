Proposed Health Care Reform Will Hurt Women
Floor Speech

Mr. Speaker, for many women and their families, higher health care costs means the difference between receiving care or going without it. Unfortunately, the Pelosi health care bill raises taxes on health care and empowers the Federal Government and bureaucrats to decide what kind of health care families and women will have versus empowering people to make their own personal decisions. It also undermines a woman's ability to make the best decisions for her family.
According to a report, studies have shown that more than 52 percent of women have foregone necessary care because of the cost. They have foregone care from filling prescription drugs, skipping a medical test, or even failing to see a doctor when they needed medical help.
We know when the Federal Government takes over care, whether it is a bureaucratic system or a socialized system, that it also leads to rationing of care. This bill increases taxes while also causing higher insurance premiums and will hurt women and children and their families. But House Republicans support reasonable health care reform that lowers costs and will ensure access to care for all Americans.
