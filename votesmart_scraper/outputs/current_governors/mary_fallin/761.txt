Fallin Demands Transparent Health Care Negotiations
Statement

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today issued the following statement in opposition to closed-door health care negotiations taking place on Capitol Hill:
"Instead of listening to concerned Americans, liberal Democrats are meeting behind closed doors to strike last minute deals and figure out a way to pass their government takeover of health care and transform one-sixth of our economy. American families and businesses deserve a transparent government that is accountable to their concerns, not more backroom deals and closed-door meetings.
"Throughout his campaign, President Obama promised voters the health care negotiations would be televised but time and again this promise has been broken. If this negotiation is sincerely dedicated to improving health care in America, then the negotiators should have nothing to hide.
"Oklahomans have made it clear to me they support reforms that will increase access to quality care, reduce their costs and preserve their patient-doctor relationship. Unfortunately, both the House and Senate bills will only raise taxes, impose mandates and reduce choice across the board. This is the wrong prescription for health care reform and Oklahomans know it.
"If the Senate's bill is any indication of how these negotiations will result, the final legislation will be ridden with sweetheart deals and special favors to secure the 218 votes Speaker Pelosi needs to get her bill through the House. If this was the kind of reform the American people wanted, the bill would pass on its merits alone."
