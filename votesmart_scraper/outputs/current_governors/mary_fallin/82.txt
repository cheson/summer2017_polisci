Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today said she is pleased that Steve Burrage, chairman of the Oklahoma Tax Commission, is withdrawing his letter of resignation and will continue to head the three-member panel.
Burrage sent the governor a letter last month stating his intention to resign from the Tax Commission because of unforeseen personal reasons. He sent a note asking to withdraw that letter.
"There is much left to be accomplished," Burrage wrote. "I would be honored to remain a part of your administration, as you seek solutions to the difficult problems that lie ahead for our state."
Fallin appointed Burrage to the Tax Commission on Feb. 1, 2015. In 2012, she appointed him to the Oklahoma Board of Corrections. From 2008-10, he served as state auditor and inspector.
Burrage previously served as president, chief executive officer and chairman of The First Bank of Antlers for more than 30 years.
"I appreciate Steve"s service on the Tax Commission and am pleased he will continue to lend his expertise to its important mission," said Fallin. "I appreciate his persistent efforts to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, both in government agencies and as it relates to the state's many tax credits and economic incentives."
The governor did not accept Burrage's resignation letter so he continues to serve on the commission. Had she accepted his resignation, the governor would have 20 days to fill the vacancy, according to state law.
"I want to thank the governor for her continued confidence and support," Burrage said.
