Fallin Says Budget Raises Taxes, Hurts Families
U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, called the budget which the House of Representatives passed today "the largest tax increase in American history." The budget allows the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire while introducing $392.5 billion in new spending. It also fails to address the looming entitlement spending crisis for social security and Medicare.
"This Congress has a duty to allow American families to thrive" Fallin said. "The budget we voted on today, brought forward by the liberal, tax and spend leaders of this Congress, does just the opposite. You cannot say you support our families while draining their bank accounts."
The new budget cuts the child tax credit in half and re-imposes both the death tax and the marriage penalty on American families. Overall, it would increase taxes for 44 million families, 48 million married couples, 12 million single mothers and 17 million elderly individuals. The budget would also increase taxes for more than 1.1 million Oklahomans, at an average of $2,560 per year.
"I won't vote for legislation that undermines pro-growth economic policies, or a budget which increases the tax burden on our families," Fallin said.

The budget passed in the House of Representatives on a vote of 216 to 208. It must now pass in the Senate before it can be signed into law by President Bush.
