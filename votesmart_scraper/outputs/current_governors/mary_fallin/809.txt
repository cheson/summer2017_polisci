From the Oklahoman: Fallin Supports Iranian Protestors
Representative Mary Fallin said she hopes a rally she attended at the state Capitol on Saturday "will demonstrate to all freedom-loving Iranians that the United States is on their side." Fallin, R-Oklahoma City, appeared at the rally in support of Iranians who have been protesting the country's election. Fallin said Monday she wanted to "stand with those who believe in freedom, democracy and human rights, both in this country and everywhere. The protesters in Iran, as well as every Iranian citizen who believes in free and fair elections, are now being denied these rights." Rally organizer Mehdi Adham said about 100 people attended.
