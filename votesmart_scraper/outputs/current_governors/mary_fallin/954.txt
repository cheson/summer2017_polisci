THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007)
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Chairman, I am listening to this debate today, and it seems to me that the question is not if there is money going to family planning. I understand there is $441 million already allocated, U.S. money, that goes to foreign countries for family planning. But the question is whom is the money going to and do the organizations that receive the money for family planning promote abortion as a method of family planning. And that is what this whole debate is on our side.
And the way I see it, if we supplement the budgets of other organizations in foreign countries who use abortion as family planning by giving them contraceptives, which we already do, by the way, $441 million worth of family-planning help, then we are supplementing their budgets so that they can have freed-up money to continue down the route of doing abortions for family planning. So it is just kind of logical that that is what we are doing here by changing this policy. And that is why I support the Smith-Stupak amendment.
And the gentlewoman has been kind to say that she wants to work in good faith and find common ground, and she has said it is her goal to get contraceptives to other countries. So if that is our goal and our goal is not to help other countries with abortions for family planning, then let's accept this amendment, the Smith-Stupak amendment, and let's pass it and let's show that the United States will not be in the business of exporting abortions to foreign countries.
