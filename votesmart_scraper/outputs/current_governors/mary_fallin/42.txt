Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement on the oil production agreement reached by OPEC:
"The news that OPEC has finally reached an agreement to reduce oil production for the first time since 2008 is welcome here in Oklahoma. Our oil and gas producers and the thousands of Americans they employ have done a great job of persevering during difficult times. Thanks to their hard work, innovations and efficiencies, America is better positioned to compete and win in the world energy market. For our national security and economy, our country must continue on a path to becoming energy independent."
