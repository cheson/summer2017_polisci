Press Release

Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today signed legislation that extends the waiting period for women getting an abortion to 72 hours.
House Bill 1409 increases the time for voluntary and informed consent before an abortion from 24 to 72 hours. Additionally, abortion facilities that operate a website must add a web link to the state's website, "A Woman's Right to Know."
"This legislation will help women get the information they need before making a decision they can't take back," said Fallin. "It will allow for more time to consider medical risks as well as explore alternatives to abortion, such as adoption."
HB 1409 was authored by Rep. Lisa Billy and sponsored by Sen. Greg Treat. HB 1409 takes effect Nov. 1.
When the measure takes effect, Oklahoma will become the fourth state with a 72-hour waiting period.
