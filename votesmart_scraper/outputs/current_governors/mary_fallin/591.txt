Gov Fallin Statement on Attorney General's Lawsuit To Stop Construction of Broken Arrow Casino
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Feb. 8, 2012
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today released the following statement concerning Attorney General Scott Pruitt's lawsuit to stop the construction of the Kialegee Tribal Town casino in Broken Arrow:
"While I share the concern that many Broken Arrow residents have over the construction of a casino in their community, my office is unfortunately left with no legal way of blocking the project. The same does not hold true for our attorney general, however, and I am happy that Attorney General Pruitt has decided to take this matter to court. I certainly do not support the construction of a gaming facility which local residents do not want and which may have a negative impact on the community.
"Moving forward, it is my hope that state law can be adjusted to give the office of the governor greater flexibility in approving or denying gaming compacts of this nature."
