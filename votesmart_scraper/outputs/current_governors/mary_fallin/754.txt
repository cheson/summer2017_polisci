Fallin Says Nation Can't Afford President's FY2011 Budget

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today released the following statement in response to the President's $3.8 trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2011:
"Just five days after telling American families and small businesses that he will get our nation's fiscal house in order, President Obama today outlined a destructive and irresponsible way forward. During an economic recession, his budget proposal provides for record high spending, mountains of new debt and massive tax increases. This is not the fiscal accountability Americans are demanding. Rather, it is exactly the opposite.
"Oklahomans know we can't tax and spend our way to prosperity. American families are making tough decisions, and the federal government should too. Rather than reform entitlement spending, consolidate federal programs and eliminate waste, the President has proposed a 3-year spending freeze that will lock in record-high spending and punt tough choices down the line. Over the last two years, spending has increased by 85 percent. Therefore he is simply freezing the budget at record spending levels.
"I know our nation can't afford to ignore our deficit spending any longer and I am ready to work on behalf of families and small businesses to ensure our nation's fiscal stability for years to come. We can start by abandoning job-killing legislation, like the cap and trade tax on energy and a government takeover of health care and by scraping proposed tax increases that would take hard-earned money away from families and small businesses."
