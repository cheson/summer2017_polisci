Governor Mary Fallin today expressed disappointment with Congress for failing to pass the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization extension. The FAA's current authorization will expire tonight at midnight.
The failure to pass a reauthorization extension could endanger funding for the FAA Airport Improvement program, FAA facilities and equipment as well as the NextGen Air Transportation System. In Oklahoma, over $54 million in construction projects at Will Rogers Airport, Tulsa International Airport and general aviation airports across the state could be in jeopardy. Additionally, approximately 130 employees at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City are expected to be furloughed indefinitely without pay.

"It is essential that Congress act quickly to pass an FAA reauthorization bill," Fallin said
