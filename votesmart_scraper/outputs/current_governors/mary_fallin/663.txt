Governor Fallin Signs Union Reform Bill
Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: April 29, 2011
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today signed into law House Bill 1593, authored by Representative Steve Martin, Senator Cliff Aldridge and Senator Clark Jolley. HB 1593 repeals the Oklahoma Municipal Employee Collective Bargaining Act, a law requiring collective bargaining for non-uniformed employees in cities with at least 35,000 residents.
"House Bill 1593 will help to control costs for Oklahoma's cities and save taxpayer dollars," said Fallin. "I'm happy to sign it into law."
Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Norman and Muskogee -- all of which had collective bargaining agreements prior to the 2004 passage of the Oklahoma Municipal Employee Collective Bargaining Act -- will not be affected by the new law. HB 1593 goes into effect on November 1, 2011.
