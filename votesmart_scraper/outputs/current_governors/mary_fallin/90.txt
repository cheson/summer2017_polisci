Gov. Fallin Applauds Oklahoma Senate for Passing Criminal Justice Bills
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: April 20, 2016
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today thanked the Oklahoma Senate for its bipartisan and overwhelming approval of four criminal justice bills related to reforms spotlighted in her State of the State address at the start of this year's legislative session.
"Oklahoma's drug possession sentences have filled our prisons to over capacity," said Fallin. "These sentences, while well intentioned, tend to send some nonviolent offenders into prison for years and years, where they live alongside violent offenders whose bad influences can make nonviolent offenders worse.
"Keeping our public safe from dangerous people will always be a priority, however with our state prisons filled to well over capacity, it is vital that we make some changes to our criminal justice system. These measures will address Oklahoma's prison population, which is among the highest in the nation, without jeopardizing public safety."
