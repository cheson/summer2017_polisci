Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: March 10, 2011
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Legislation worked on by Governor Mary Fallin's Workers' Compensation Study Group and authored by Senators Anthony Sykes and Patrick Anderson was passed unanimously today (44-0) by the Oklahoma State Senate. Workers' compensation was listed as an important step to creating more jobs and an environment friendlier to business growth and development in Fallin's State of the State address. Fallin released the following statement:
"Our current workers' compensation system is expensive, inefficient and ultimately drives jobs out of the state of Oklahoma. It is a system that has long been in need of an overhaul. I am extremely pleased to see the Senate has taken action and passed a comprehensive reform bill. This plan will create a system that is fair to both workers and employers, lowers costs and helps us in our mission of creating a better environment for business growth and job creation. It is a key step in the job creation agenda I laid out in my State of the State address. I strongly encourage the House to take up this measure as soon as possible, pass it and deliver it to my desk for me to sign into law."
