Press Release
By: Mary Fallin
Date: March 24, 2010
Location: Washington, DC

Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today joined Altus Chamber of Commerce members in Washington, DC to discuss their top priorities and key concerns for Altus, Oklahoma and Altus Air Force Base. Speaking to the Chamber, Fallin listed several major legislative initiatives moving through Congress that would have major impacts on Oklahoma and encouraged the Chamber to keep speaking out on behalf of the state.
"The stakes are high in Washington right now," Fallin said. "This administration has set its sights on a big-government agenda that will raise taxes and impose burdensome federal mandates on families and businesses throughout our state. We are reliant on the expertise of groups like the Altus Chamber to step forward and make sure this administration is aware of the real-life consequences its agenda will have on everyday life in Oklahoma, especially in our rural communities."
Fallin also thanked the Chamber for their work on behalf of Altus Air Force Base, the state's air crew training facility for airlift and aerial refueling. "Because of your leadership and advocacy, Altus Air Force Base continues to thrive as a premier training and education center for the United States Air Force."
Fallin said, "Even though there is a lot of bad news coming out of Washington these days, I am encouraged by recent developments in the KC-X airborne refueling tanker bid and as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, will be fighting tooth and nail to retain both the existing C-17 and the new KC-X training missions at Altus. I look forward to continued work with the Chamber and the leadership at Altus to ensure the base remains well-positioned for the future"
