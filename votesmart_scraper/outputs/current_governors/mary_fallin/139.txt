Gov. Fallin Targets Use, Management of State Aircraft
Statement
By: Mary Fallin
Date: Oct. 23, 2015
Location: Oklahoma City, OK

Governor Mary Fallin today issued an executive order intended to reduce operating and maintenance costs associated with the state's fleet of airplanes and helicopters.
Executive Order 2015-45 centralizes the custody and control of all state-owned air assets under Oklahoma's public safety commissioner. Agencies like the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control, the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation would retain ownership of their air assets; however, use of those air assets would be scheduled and coordinated by the public safety commissioner.
"Planes and other aircraft can play key roles in helping law enforcement track illegal activities and capture criminals as well as respond to natural disasters, such as tornadoes, floods and wildfires," said Fallin. "However, they also have high operating and maintenance costs. This executive order will require agencies to do more to coordinate the use of aircraft, eliminate inefficiencies and save taxpayer dollars."
