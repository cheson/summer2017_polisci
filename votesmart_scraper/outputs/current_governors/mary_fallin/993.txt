Issue Position: The Economy
American families are currently facing rising gasoline prices, soaring healthcare costs and an uncertain housing market. Congress can and should take several steps to improve our long and short term economic outlook and put American workers on surer footing.
In the immediate future, our economy will benefit from an economic growth package passed in February of Â‘08. This responsible, bipartisan legislation will provide temporary relief to working class Americans and give our economy a much needed shot in the arm. By providing tax rebates to over 130 million working Americans, seniors and disabled veterans, we can boost the spending power of the American public. This will spur economic growth, create new jobs and produce higher salaries. The growth package also includes tax benefits for small businesses, encouraging both investment and job growth.
In the long run, Congress needs to be far more vigilant about safeguarding our economic security. It can begin to do so with a simple promise not to raise taxes. Decreasing the child tax credit or restoring punitive measures like the death tax and marriage penalty will damage the economy and hurt working Americans. Congress should abandon any plans to raise taxes.
Besides keeping taxes low, Congress must get a handle on out of control spending. It can do so by pursuing real earmark reform, restoring transparency to the spending process and replacing "bridges to nowhere" with projects that address the needs of working Americans.
The long term health of our economy is in our hands. It is the responsibility of this Congress to drive down out of control spending, pursue a balanced budget, and do so without raising taxes.
