Governor Mary Fallin applauded the Oklahoma House of Representatives today for approving a bill that would implement part of the agenda she laid out in her State of the State address.
House Bill 1601, by state Rep. Aaron Stiles and state Sen. Clark Jolley, would establish a one-stop shop for business owners to obtain licenses and permits, making the process more efficient and convenient for Oklahoma businesses. The Senate has already passed a similar bill, SB 772.
Fallin released the following statement:
"Creating a user-friendly, one-stop shop for business licensing is an important part of making Oklahoma friendlier to business growth and job creation. It shouldn't be any easier to open a business in Texas than it is in Oklahoma, and legislation like this goes a long way toward making sure it isn't."
