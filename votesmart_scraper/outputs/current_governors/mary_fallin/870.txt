Location: Washington, DC


Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) voted today to restore gun rights to Washington, D.C., requiring the city to comply with the Second Amendment and a recent Supreme Court ruling. The bill, which passed with a bipartisan majority, forces the District of Columbia to eliminate a series of restrictions on gun ownership which have effectively banned handguns within the nation's capitol.
Fallin called the vote a "victory for gun owners and a victory for the Constitution." She urged the Senate to take up the bill quickly and for the president to sign it into law.
"Owning a gun for self-defense and sport is one of the fundamental rights enjoyed by all Americans," said Fallin. "It has been a longstanding outrage that here in our nation's capitol a web of intrusive regulations and legal hurdles has essentially done away with that right. I am pleased that Congress took action today to resport this basic freedom and guarantee the Constitution and our rights are not trampled."
