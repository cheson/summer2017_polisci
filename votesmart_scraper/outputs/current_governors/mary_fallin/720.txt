Congresswoman Mary Fallin (OK-05) today voted in favor of H.R. 4899, the FY10 Emergency War Supplemental appropriations bill. Fallin said passing the bill, which provides critical funding for troops overseas to continue operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and to support the 33,000 troops expected in Afghanistan this summer, was of the utmost importance. "When it comes to our brave men and women overseas and the security of our nation, we must put politics aside and ensure our troops have the resources and support they need for success," Fallin said.
"Secretary Gates, General Petraeus and our commanders on the ground have stressed the need to pass this troop funding as soon as possible," Fallin said. "I am disappointed the Democrat majority delayed this funding for five months by attempting to attach expensive and controversial provisions to this bill. Approving this clean supplemental funding bill, free of arbitrary benchmarks or timetables, is critical to ensuring our military readiness at home and abroad."
"I am committed to the strength and security of our nation for our children, grandchildren and generations to come," said Fallin. "I am relieved Democrat leadership in Congress finally put their ideological differences aside to allow House consideration of a responsible version of this important funding bill."
