Governor Kate Brown today issued the following statement in response to post-election protests:
"Oregon has a proud and strong history of civic participation, protest, and advocacy. It's part of the Oregon way to make our voices heard, but the right to peacefully assemble should not be clouded by attempts to instigate lawlessness.
"I commend our law enforcement officers and local leaders for preserving peace and keeping our communities safe. What defines and distinguishes us as Oregonians and Americans is our willingness to come together to work through our challenges. We must do so now, following the election and looking forward to the future."
