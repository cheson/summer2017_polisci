Governor Kate Brown invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act at 3:28 a.m. August 13, 2015 in response to the Cornet Fire burning in Baker County. After growing very quickly, the fire threatens approximately 170 structures.
"The Cornet Fire reminds of us how quickly a fire can grow and how dangerous these dry conditions can be," said Governor Brown. "I encourage Oregonians to take every step possible to prevent even the slightest spark from becoming a life threatening blaze."
In accordance with ORS 476.510-476.610, Governor Brown determined that a threat to life, safety, and property exists due to the fire and that the threat exceeds the firefighting capabilities of local firefighting personnel and equipment.
The Governor's declaration authorizes the Oregon Office of State Fire Marshal (OSFM) to mobilize structural firefighters and equipment to assist local resources battling the fire.
The emergency was declared for the Cornet Fire only and is effective immediately. OSFM will assume command of the fire at 11:30 a.m. Thursday.
