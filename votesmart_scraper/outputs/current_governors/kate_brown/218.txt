Governor Kate Brown today announced the appointment of Patricia Perlow as Lane County District Attorney to fill the upcoming vacancy created by Alex Gardner's resignation, effective July 31, 2015.
"Patricia Perlow brings a high level of prosecutorial and leadership experience to this critical role," said Governor Brown. "She has earned the support and confidence of her colleagues at the DA's office, local law enforcement, the Court, members of the public, and the social services community. She will continue to be an outstanding public servant for the people of Lane County."
Ms. Perlow has been a prosecutor at the Lane County District Attorney's Office since 1990, most recently serving as its chief deputy under Gardner. Over the course of her career there, she has also been the office's trial teams' supervisor and served on the office's major crimes team that specializes in prosecution of violent crimes such as assault, homicide, and child physical and sexual abuse. She has also been the attorney advisor to INET, the local interagency drug crimes team.
Early in her career, Ms. Perlow clerked for Lane County Circuit Court Judge Kip Leonard. She earned her undergraduate and law degrees at the University of Oregon and was admitted to the Oregon State Bar in 1989.
