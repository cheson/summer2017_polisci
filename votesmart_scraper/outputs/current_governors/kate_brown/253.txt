HB 2020 Testimony

Good afternoon Members of the Committee, Kate Brown currently serving as Oregon's Governor. Thank you for the opportunity to talk with you about House Bill 2020.
My ethics package includes three bills. These bills seek to make changes in response to the abrupt ending of the former Governor's administration. Actions taken, or not taken, by the former Governor and the former First Lady have shone a spotlight on Oregon's Ethics and Public Records laws.
House Bill 2019, which addresses important structural changes relating to the Oregon Government Ethics Commission, passed the House with a unanimous vote and awaits a vote in the Senate.
Senate Bill 9, which originated in this committee and directs the State Auditor to conduct a performance audit of state agency public records retention and disclosure practices, has passed both chambers---it currently awaits my signature.
And the third bill in my ethics package is House Bill 2020, which tightens current statutes to be clearer and more transparent.
Today I am here to present House Bill 2020 for your consideration.
HB 2020 addresses four main issues:
First, the bill alters the definition of "public official." This bill recognizes that the person who is the Governor's partner -- the First Lady or the First Gentleman -- serves in a public role. To this end, the bill makes clear that the First Partner is a statutorily defined position. With this statutory recognition, there can be no mistaking the duties and responsibilities of the First Partner that come with holding public office.
