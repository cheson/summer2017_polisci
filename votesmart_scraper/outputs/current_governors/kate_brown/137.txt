Governor Kate Brown made the following statement regarding Oregon's March unemployment rate report:
"Today, more than 95 percent of Oregonians who want a job have a job," said Governor Brown. "To continue strong job growth we must sustain critical investments we've made in education and help small businesses grow and expand. We must address the digital divide in rural communities to expand access to the vast resources of the internet. All of Oregon, rural and urban, must have the opportunity to share in this historic economic momentum."
