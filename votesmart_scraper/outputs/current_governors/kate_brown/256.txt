Public Statements
Fritz-Fairchild Act Signing
By: Kate Brown
Date: June 10, 2015
Location: Salem, OR

This important safety bill honors the memories of Dr. Steven Fritz and Cary Fairchild, who were both killed in a cross-over crash on Interstate 5 near Salem on September 24, 2014. Both were dedicated public servants at the Oregon State Hospital who devoted their lives to serving others.
I applaud the Legislature for sending me SB 921, the Fritz-Fairchild Act. This legislation will address a critical safety need on highways across Oregon, by installing life-saving safety cables along interstate highways in order to reduce cross-over crashes.
There is no silver lining in the loss of Steve Fritz and Cary Fairchild, but this act will attempt to limit the number of families who will experience the loss of a loved one on our roads, and that is a great way to honor the memory of Steven and Cary in the decades to come.
I would like to thank the sponsors and carrier of this bill: President Courtney, Speaker Kotek, Senator Hansell, Senator Monroe, Senator Kruse, Senator Devlin, Representative Parrish and Representative Lininger
I also want to thank the families of the victims who worked tirelessly on this important bill:
Commissioner Amanda Fritz and her family and Jim Fairchild;
I also want to thank Chris Jenkins, a 17 year old whose life was saved by a crash barrier here in Keizer, and his sister Amanda McKensie who testified in support of this legislation;
And the Oregon Department of Transportation, Oregon Nurses Association Oregon State Hospital Employees/AFSCME, and the colleagues of Dr. Steven Fritz and Cary Fairchild for their support and advocacy.
It is now my great pleasure to sign SB 921 into law.
