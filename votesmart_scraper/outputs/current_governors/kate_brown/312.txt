Governor Kate Brown today named Misha Isaak as Deputy General Counsel.
Isaak, a litigation attorney at Perkins Coie in Portland, will report to General Counsel Ben Souede and join him in representing and advising the Governor's Office. Isaak begins work on April 1.
"Misha's legal acumen, corporate litigation experience, and civic engagement will serve him well in this role," Governor Brown said. "I appreciate his willingness to serve the people of Oregon and am pleased he is joining our team."
At Perkins Coie, Isaak is a trial and appellate litigator representing clients in complex business disputes. He also litigates civil rights and constitutional cases involving free speech, equal protection, and privacy claims for business and nonprofit clients. Isaak was one of the lead attorneys in the successful constitutional challenge to Oregon's ban on marriage for same-sex couples.
Isaak previously clerked for judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. District Court in New Jersey. Before becoming an attorney, he worked as a special assistant to U.S. Congresswoman Darlene Hooley and managed the campaign to re-elect Oregon Attorney General Hardy Myers.
He earned his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and his bachelor's degree in political science from Reed College.
Isaak also volunteers as the coach of the constitution team at Lincoln High School in Portland. He has coached the team to two national championships. Additionally, he serves on boards and committees for the Oregon Law Commission, Basic Rights Oregon, and the Oregon Board of Bar Examiners.
