While in Grant County today, Governor Brown announced that she activated Oregon National Guard members to assist in fire fighting. About 125 soldiers will begin training this week at the Department of Public Safety Standards and Training in Salem.
"Oregon National Guard members will join first responders who are working tirelessly to battle these unpredictable wildfires," said Governor Brown. "We have weeks of fire season left, and it is incumbent upon us to make sure that above all else, we continue to protect the public's safety."
Already this summer, the National Guard has dedicated resources to fighting wildfires, with 4 Blackhawk helicopters and support personnel assisting in the effort.
"Prevention is crucial. We need every Oregonian and visitor to be fire-savvy and aware of fire restrictions and common-sense practices," said Governor Brown.
After their training, Oregon National Guard members are expected to join the fire line late next week.
