Oregon has been selected to compete in the final phase of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's National Disaster Resilience Competition (http://oregon.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=41b11f32beefba0380ee8ecb5&id=aafd60f08b&e=5790d39953). The state is using the program to work collaboratively with the cities of Brookings and Reedsport to secure much needed funding to improve transportation, water, and medical security in preparation for, and recovery from, disasters - both natural and human-caused.
"To prepare for the impacts of extreme weather and climate change, it is of the upmost importance we use science, data, and community wisdom to protect against and adapt to risks," said Governor Kate Brown. "Being selected as a finalist is key to helping the people, communities, and systems of rural Oregon prepare to withstand catastrophic events and recover from them stronger than before."
Governor Brown is proposing a program to support local level innovative resilience projects and the jobs that build and maintain them. This innovative rural resilience incubator framework will encourage communities to adopt policy changes and activities that plan for known and emerging risk.
The State is working with the City of Brookings and City of Reedsport and many partners to secure much needed funding to improve transportation, water, and medical security for local citizens. Brookings and Reedsport will propose projects that advance their community's resilience to winter storms, tsunamis and earthquakes, as envisioned in Phase 1 of the competition (http://oregon.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=41b11f32beefba0380ee8ecb5&id=f2e6918538&e=5790d39953).
Oregon joins 14 municipal and 26 state governments to compete for part of nearly $1 billion in available funds in the last phase of the competition.
