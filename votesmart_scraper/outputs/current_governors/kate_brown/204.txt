Press Release

Governor Kate Brown today declared a drought emergency in Linn County. This declaration comes at the request of local officials and is based on the recommendations of the Drought Council and the Water Availability Committee.
"This summer, the hardships of climate change are being brought to the forefront of Oregonians' lives," said Governor Brown. "As these conditions become an everyday reality, we must use the tools at our disposal to protect Oregonians' safety, their property, and ensure the economic vitality of all our communities big and small."
The Governor's drought declaration allows increased flexibility in how water is managed to ensure that limited supplies are used as efficiently as possible. In addition, the Governor is working with Oregon's federal delegation, state agencies, local governments, and other partners to coordinate efforts and mobilize actions to address drought-related issues.
Drought means hot and dry conditions leading to water shortages that have resulted in limited water supplies for farming and ranching operations, community water systems, recreation, and fish, as well as increased risk of wildfire. Long-term forecasts continue to call for temperatures well above normal. Low river and stream levels are of concern as well, although recreational areas around the state remain open for business. People visiting parks and natural areas should read and follow local fire restrictions very carefully.
