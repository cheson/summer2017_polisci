Governor Kate Brown issued the following statement today about the shootings in Louisiana, Minnesota, and Dallas:
"I am horrified by the ugly and explosive violence of the past 72 hours in Louisiana, Minnesota, and now, Texas. Violence answers nothing, offers nothing, solves nothing. It robs us of our humanity, turning us against one another promising only more pain, more loss. Instead of reaching for weapons, we must reach for answers. If we want to end violence, we must fight ignorance and desperation. We must instill hope and create opportunity. We must work for justice. We must work toward equality. It will be these tools, more powerful than any arsenal, that restore peace and civility in America."
