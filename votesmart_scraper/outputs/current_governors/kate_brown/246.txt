Some monumental news from Oregon Health & Science University Thursday morning: the hospital reached its Phil Knight Challenge. That means $1 billion will go toward fighting cancer.
About 2 years ago the co-founder of Nike and his wife Penny said if OHSU raised $500 million, they would match it.
The billion dollars will support the first large-scale program dedicated to early detection of lethal cancers.
This is one of the biggest unmet needs in cancer care today.
2014: OHSU more than halfway in Knight challenge
OHSU announced it went above and beyond its goal - raising $508 million instead.
With this new funding, the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute will recruit about 25 of the world's top researchers. Those researchers will hire 225 to 275 scientists and physicians, a team focused on the detection of cancer.
And that's not all. OHSU is also going to build a new, state-of-the-art cancer research facility, along with a clinical trial center.
They'll break ground for the new research facility March 2016, with construction expected to be complete 2018.
