Governor Kate Brown issued the following statement regarding the September Oregon Economic and Revenue Forecast, https://www.oregon.gov/das/OEA/Documents/forecast0... and report of 50 consecutive months of job growth in Oregon, https://www.qualityinfo.org/documents/10182/73818/...
"Oregon is in its 50th straight month of job growth, and state revenues are reported to be stable in the short term," Governor Brown said. "The same cannot be said for the rest of the country, however. Economic slowdowns elsewhere call for caution. We will pay close attention to these national signals."
