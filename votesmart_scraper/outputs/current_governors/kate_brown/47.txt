Governor Kate Brown today met with Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly to discuss several issues of concern to Oregonians. They discussed at length how Oregon families are being impacted by recent immigration enforcement actions and the presence of Immigration and Custom Enforcement Officers in county courthouses across the state.
"I'm concerned some actions of Immigration and Custom Enforcement officers are creating an atmosphere of fear," said Governor Brown. "Today I shared with Secretary Kelly that the trust in public institutions is undermined when Oregonians seek assistance from public officials, but are instead met with suspicion from those they expect to help them. This kind of fear also puts the growth of Oregon's economy at risk; our state relies on immigration policies that allow Oregon to compete in the global market."
Governor Brown and Secretary Kelly's wide ranging conversation also included Oregon's efforts to build resilient communities and infrastructure in preparation for a Cascadia earthquake; her concerns over the possible reduction of federal emergency aid funds; Oregon's compliance efforts with the REAL ID Act; and substance abuse prevention.
Governor Brown is in Washington D.C. attending the annual National Governors Association Winter Meeting. She will hold meeting with additional federal authorities and members of Oregon's congressional delegation.
