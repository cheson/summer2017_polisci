Governor Kate Brown issued the following statement today regarding North Carolina's discriminatory law:
"As Governor, I am appalled that North Carolina enacted a law that promotes hate and discrimination. We are living in divisive times and it should be our practice as government, as policymakers, and as community members to celebrate people's diversity, not shun it.
"In Oregon, this is not how we do business. I seek policies that bring people together, and build bridges, not walls. I would oppose anything like this happening in Oregon, and our voters have shown that they do not support similar discriminatory policies. I'm working to cultivate a culture of inclusion and building an Oregon where each person can thrive.
"I ask that Oregonians join me in voicing their concerns about such attacks on people's personal freedoms in North Carolina or anywhere."
