HB 3343 Signing Ceremony
By: Kate Brown
Date: June 11, 2015
Location: Salem, OR

Good afternoon, thank you for being here today to celebrate this important occasion.
I am proud to sign this historic bill into law on behalf of Oregon women and their families.
Today Oregon becomes the first state in the nation to ensure that every woman has reliable and steady access to a full year of oral contraceptives.
HB 3343 will allow women to get a full year's supply of birth control and require insurance companies to reimburse all at once.
That is truly something to be proud of.
This bill has a simple premise that I wholeheartedly believe in. Increase access. Decrease barriers.
For women in rural Oregon, this will mean less travel time to reach their pharmacy. For women who don't have access to transportation, they will no longer be burdened with going to a pharmacy on a monthly basis. And for women in college, they can now access a supply that will last them a full school year, whether they are studying out of state or attend college a couple hours from home.
This is a wonderful milestone for women and their families.
Thank you to the champions in this room who supported this legislation, a now I would like to introduce Representative Jennifer Williamson.
