Governor Kate Brown today announced that D.R. Johnson, a family-owned Southern Oregon timber company, is now the nation's first supplier of a certified structural wood product known as cross-laminated timber, or CLT. The massive panels of engineered wood are used to build taller wooden buildings.
"CLT presents a new and exciting opportunity for Oregon. Expanding new industries and innovative technologies like advanced wood manufacturing will help reinvigorate our rural, timber-focused economies," Governor Brown said at Oregon BEST FEST, http://oregon.us2.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=4... ,an annual clean tech innovation conference in Portland.
