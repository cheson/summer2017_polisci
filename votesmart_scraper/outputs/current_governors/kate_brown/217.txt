Governor Kate Brown issued the following statement regarding the promotion of Oregon National Guard Maj. Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, Adjutant General.
"Our loss is the country's gain," Governor Brown said. "I am proud to see Maj. Gen. Hokanson's dedicated service recognized with this promotion. We will miss his steady, thoughtful leadership. During his tenure, he guided the state to develop a synchronized response to a Cascadia Subduction Zone event, oversaw the deployment of 1,400 service members; and led the Oregon National Guard's response to state emergencies, including wildfires and search and rescue operations. I wish the best for him and his family as they begin this new chapter."
On July 28, 2015, the United States Senate confirmed the appointment of Major Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson to the rank of lieutenant general and assignment as Deputy Commander, United States Northern Command, and Vice Commander, U.S. Element, North American Aerospace Defense Command at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado.
