Today, Governor Brown signed the final 43 of 846 bills from the 2015 Legislative Assembly.
"Together with the Legislature, I took action to make our communities safer, our workforce more equitable, and our state more engaged, putting ballots in the hands of hundreds of thousands of new voters," Governor Brown said. "With an eye on the future of Oregon, we invested in our working families by passing paid sick leave, bolstering public education, and funding affordable housing at historic levels.
"There is still more to do, and I remain committed to finding solutions that sustain economic recovery statewide, expanding opportunities so Oregonians can get ahead," Brown said.
