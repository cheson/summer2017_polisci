Governor Kate Brown today released the following statement regarding Oregon's unemployment rate:
"Oregon's historic jobs gains over the last few months mean Oregonians in every corner of the state are closer to gaining the opportunities they need to thrive. We must continue this progress by creating good jobs in the places that need them most," said Governor Kate Brown. "The health care and social assistance sector are key to Oregon's economic momentum, adding 8,700 jobs this February. While Oregon has had historic job growth, unfortunately the proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act puts more than 23,000 health care jobs at risk. Congress must stop playing politics and consider the drastic consequences to Oregon's economy."
