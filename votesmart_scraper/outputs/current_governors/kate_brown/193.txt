Today, Governor Kate Brown announced, at the request of Oregon State Police Superintendent Rich Evans, the formation of a workgroup to evaluate the practices and procedures followed by the Oregon State Police Crime Lab, based upon the recent concerns raised by stakeholders.
"The credibility of the criminal justice system is critical to Oregon's citizens," Governor Brown said. "Superintendent Evans and I believe that an open review of the lab is appropriate under the circumstances. I am confident that the participants of this workgroup will give the issues full and open consideration, and make appropriate recommendations for the best ways to move forward."
