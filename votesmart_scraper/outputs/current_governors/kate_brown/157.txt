Governor Kate Brown's request for federal disaster aid was approved by President Obama for the State of Oregon, tribal, and local recovery efforts in areas affected by the Pacific storm event in December, 2015.
"This federal declaration will help Oregon recover from numerous hardships caused by this destructive event," said Governor Brown. "Substantial property damage, infrastructure and utilities outages, obstructed roadways, and other problems that occurred during severe storm conditions last December reminds us all to take the necessary steps to be prepared for future events -- flooding, earthquakes, and other hazards."
Federal funding is available to eligible state, tribal, local governments, and certain private nonprofit organizations for emergency work and repair or replacement of facilities damaged in Clatsop, Columbia, Coos, Curry, Lane, Lincoln, Linn, Multnomah, Polk, Tillamook, Washington, and Yamhill counties.
Governor Brown, with support from the Oregon Office of Emergency Management (OEM), coordinated with local jurisdictions and FEMA to do the Preliminary Damage Assessment that led to the declaration.
"I'd like to thank OEM employees, FEMA staff, and our local partners and emergency managers who supported the Preliminary Disaster Assessment for this Pacific storm event," said OEM Director Andrew Phelps. "Their efforts throughout this process means Oregon will receive valuable assistance to recover from this Pacific storm that caused millions of dollars worth of damage, and help mitigate against future disasters."
