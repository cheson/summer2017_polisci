Several agencies play a key role in Oregon's economy. While government does not necessarily create private sector jobs in the state, it is important that it adds value to the private sector economy when it can.
Assisting small businesses in Oregon is a priority and the Secretary of State's Office of Small Business Assistance is a one stop shop for Small Businesses in need of technical assistance with state and local regulations.
