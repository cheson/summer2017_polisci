Governor Brown Champions Campaign Finance Reform
Press Release

Governor Kate Brown issued the following statement in connection with her testimony today in support of Senate Joint Resolution 5, which changes the Oregon Constitution to allow campaign contribution limits, and Senate Bill 75, which implements new spending limits if SJR 5 passes.
Governor Brown testified before the Senate Rules Committee.
"According to The Oregonian, more than $23 million was spent on Legislative races in 2014, more per capita than just about any other state in the nation.
"No one should be able to buy a megaphone so big that it drowns out every other voice. The First Amendment was intended to protect political discourse for all Oregonians, not just those with the deepest pockets.
"Truly representative leadership requires meaningful change to the status quo.
"Oregonians want campaign finance reform. It's our job as state policy makers to find the best way to accomplish it. My expectation is that SJR 5 and SB 75 will start the legislative conversation on how to get this done."
