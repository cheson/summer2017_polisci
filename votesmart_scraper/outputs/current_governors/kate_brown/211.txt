Governor Kate Brown invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act at 3:57 p.m. August 14, 2015 in response to the Canyon Creek Complex Fire burning in Grant County. More than 100 homes have been evacuated with some structures already feared lost.
"Preventing additional fires is of the utmost importance and all Oregonians need to be aware of regulations prohibiting camp fire and power-driven equipment. This is the time for every Oregonian to be tuned in to fire prevention and fire awareness," said Governor Brown
Currently, there are fourteen major fires burning in the state. Such significant wildfire activity draws down available firefighting resources.
In accordance with ORS 476.510-476.610, Governor Brown determined that a threat to life, safety, and property exists due to the fire and that the threat exceeds the firefighting capabilities of local firefighting personnel and equipment.
The Governor's declaration authorizes the Oregon Office of State Fire Marshal (OSFM) to mobilize structural firefighters and equipment to assist local resources battling the fire.
