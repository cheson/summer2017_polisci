Governor Kate Brown released the following statement regarding her proposed 2017-19 state budget:
"In the coming days, I'll meet with legislative leaders on both sides of the aisle to discuss budget priorities and next steps in preparation for the 2017 session.
"Following these discussions, on December 1 I'll release a balanced budget that makes every effort to protect vulnerable Oregonians to the greatest extent possible.
"I will give priority to protecting services for children and helping lift families out of poverty. Given the severe constraints, we will still have to make a number of heartbreaking cuts.
"Looking forward, if we expect to improve our dismal high school graduation rate, help more families achieve self-sufficiency, and keep Oregonians safe and healthy, we need stable and adequate revenue.
"I call on both the proponents and opponents of Measure 97 to find common ground and develop solutions that Oregonians support. As I evaluate potential options, I'll look for proposals that provide adequate and stable revenue, do not hurt struggling families, and bring increased fairness to Oregon's tax system."
