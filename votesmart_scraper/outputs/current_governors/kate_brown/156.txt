Governor Kate Brown today released the following statement in response to the Oregon House of Representatives' passage of SB 1532, a plan to increase Oregon's minimum wage:
"Today's action advances one of my priorities for 2016: raise the minimum wage," said Governor Brown. "I started this conversation last fall, bringing stakeholders together to craft a workable proposal; one that gives working families the much-needed wage boost they need, and addresses challenges for businesses and rural economies presented by the two impending ballot measures. I look forward to signing this bill."
