Governor Kate Brown today announced the State of Oregon is seeking to join the Deschutes Basin Oregon spotted frog litigation as a friend of the court, with the goal of resolving the water management conflict through a collaborative, court-sponsored process.
""The Deschutes Basin litigation is a major conflict over water resources that requires a solution developed collaboratively, recognizing multiple important interests," said Governor Brown. "To reach a sustainable and comprehensive solution to this conflict, Oregon needs to be at the table to help craft a positive path forward for the health of our fish and wildlife, their habitats, and the economic vitality of our communities."
The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service listed the Oregon spotted frog as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in August 2014. Lawsuits filed by the Center for Biological Diversity and WaterWatch of Oregon assert that operations of Crane Prairie, Wickiup, and Crescent Lake dams and reservoirs on the Upper Deschutes River and Crescent Creek harm spotted frogs in violation of the Endangered Species Act. The lawsuits, filed against the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and three irrigation districts, seek sudden and dramatic changes in dam and reservoir operations.
The Deschutes Reclamation Project was federally approved in 1937 and the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Crane Prairie Dam in 1940. Wickiup Dam and the North Unit Main Canal were completed in the late 1940s. Additional water storage and delivery infrastructure were built in the 1950s and 1960s.
