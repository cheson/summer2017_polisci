Governor Kate Brown today issued a letter to U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy highlighting Oregon's successes under the Affordable Care Act and urged Congress not to roll back Oregonians' health care coverage.
The Affordable Care Act has expanded health care coverage to hundreds of thousands of Oregonians in the past several years. In 2013, 15 percent of Oregonians lacked health insurance. Today, more than 95 percent of adults and 98 percent of children have health care coverage in Oregon. At the same time, Oregon's coordinated care model has also improved the quality of care while holding down costs.
"Oregon has made great progress in extending health care coverage and financial assistance to more than 550,000 Oregonians under the Affordable Care Act," Governor Brown said. "It would be imprudent and irresponsible to repeal Americans' health care coverage, which would put hundreds of thousands of Oregonians at physical and financial risk. Health care is fundamental to employment and education, and helping people to develop independence and self-reliance. We need to correct the shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act, not dismantle it."
