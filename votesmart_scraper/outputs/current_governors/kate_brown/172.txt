Press Release

Governor Brown today announced her plan to increase the minimum wage statewide. The proposal was developed after conversations with stakeholders in both the public and private sectors. Their input was essential to finding Oregon's path forward to a higher minimum wage. The plan will be brought for debate during the 2016 legislative session next month.
"The costs of essentials such as food, child care, and rent are rising so fast that wages can't keep up," said Governor Brown. "Many Oregonians working full-time can't make ends meet, and that's not right."
