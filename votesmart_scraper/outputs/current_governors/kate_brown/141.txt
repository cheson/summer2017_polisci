Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown issued the following statement today regarding Mississippi's new discriminatory law:
"Mississippi's anti-LGBT law creates a chilling effect as it becomes the second state in two weeks to enact a discriminatory law that promotes hate and exclusion. I say, enough is enough.
"The effect of such laws remind us that we have more work to do as individuals and as a nation to ensure that all people have the freedom and right to express themselves as they choose. This law will touch every aspect of a person's life including how they receive health care, their housing and rent options, employment, and their educational experiences. It doesn't have to be -- nor should it be -- this way.
"We must remember that we are our strongest and accomplish more when we stand together. As Governor, the legacy I hope for our state and country is that we embrace and honor every individual.
