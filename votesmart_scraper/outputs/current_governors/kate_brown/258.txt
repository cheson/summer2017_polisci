Good morning!
Thank you so much for having me here today, this is such a wonderful event.
Since becoming the Commander-in-Chief of Oregon's National Guard, I have the opportunity to attend ceremonies welcoming home many of our soldiers, as well as seeing a few off on new missions.
Those ceremonies are special to me, because I have the opportunity to share the gratitude of Oregonians to our citizen soldiers and their families for their sacrifices.
So it was with great pleasure that I learned today I could also thank you, the employers in our state, for your commitment to our soldiers and the missions they perform.
We are fortunate in Oregon to have a reintegration team to help transition veterans back to civilian life, along with our Department of Veteran Affairs to help them access the benefits that they have earned.
But state government cannot do it alone--so I am thankful to business leaders in local communities across the state for their interest and support of our service members coming off active duty.
Hiring a citizen soldier or a veteran is a big win for your businesses. Oregon's soldiers bring meaningful work experience, initiative and dedication to their new positions and employers. They have answered their call of duty and return to contribute their talents and leadership to building a better state and continuing our economic recovery.
Thank you again for being here today, and for your support of the Oregon National Guard and its veterans.
