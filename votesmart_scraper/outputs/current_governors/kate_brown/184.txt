Governor Kate Brown issued the following statement about Hood River-native Minoru Yasui, who today posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom Award from President Obama.
"On behalf of all Oregonians, I am incredibly proud that Minoru Yasui, a son of Hood River, was honored today with a Presidential Medal of Freedom award. He is an Oregon hero who had the courage to take a stand against discrimination. Fighting for freedom cost him dearly, including a wrongful incarceration and a criminal record that followed him like a dark cloud throughout his career.
"It's not lost on me that we still struggle with these issues. Oregon's potential to thrive is compromised when any group of people face discrimination. We are stronger when everyone has the opportunity to succeed free from injustice. The best way to honor his courage is by showing our own in the face of new challenges to freedom and justice."
