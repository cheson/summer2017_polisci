Governor Kate Brown released this statement following Senate passage of Senate Bill 9:
"I am pleased the Senate has passed Senate Bill 9 directing the State Auditor to conduct a performance audit of state agency public records retention and disclosure practices," said Governor Brown. "This is a key component of my ethics package, and brings greater transparency to the important work we do in government. Senate Bill 9 is the first step in evolving our system. Ultimately, fact-based solutions and best practices should inform how the system evolves and the audit required by this legislation provides that information."
