Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown today will sign Senate Bill 1507, expanding the Oregon Production Investment Fund (OPIF): The tax incentive program is designed to increase the capacity for more film, TV, and new media projects in Oregon and encourages productions to operate in rural parts of the state.
"Promoting the creative industry Oregon is so well known for has a direct economic impact, generating more than $160 million per year," Governor Brown said. "Now that we are sharpening our tools to promote growth in Oregon, I challenge the film, video, and new media industry to expand your projects to all corners of the state. Over the last decade, you all have set the bar very high and I look forward to you making an even greater impact here in Oregon for years to come."
Since the introduction of the OPIF in 2005, Oregon Film: http://www.oregonfilm.org/ tracked the economic activity directly attributed to the incentive programs as rising from just below $10 million per year, to now over $160 million per year. More than 100 individual projects and hundreds of local companies have benefitted from OPIF, generating more than $1 billion in tracked economic activity since its inception.
