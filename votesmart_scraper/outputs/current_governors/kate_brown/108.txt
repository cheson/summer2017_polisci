Governor Brown to Participate in Major Earthquake and Tsunami Exercise
Press Release
By: Kate Brown
Date: June 6, 2016
Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown on Tuesday will take part in Cascadia Rising, a region-wide disaster exercise, to help plan for a Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake and tsunami. Governor Brown will make comments along with emergency management officials before boarding a National Guard helicopter as part of the exercise.
"The prospect of a major earthquake and tsunami may seem so overwhelming that preparation -- by individual Oregonians or their state government -- is too big of a task," said Governor Brown. "But, we can do this and we will do it together. We must build a better prepared and more resilient Oregon, one step at a time."
The Oregon Office of Emergency Management (OEM) is conducting the simulation with state and federal partners - including State Resiliency Officer Mike Harryman - as well as city, county, and tribal emergency management groups. The exercise tests specific functions and capabilities these agencies have in place to respond to such an event.
There are several other media events in addition to the Governor's availability.
