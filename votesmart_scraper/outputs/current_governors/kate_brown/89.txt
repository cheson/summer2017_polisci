At 11:00 a.m. today, Governor Kate Brown invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act in response to the Wassen Pond Fire in Wasco County. Governor Brown's action will activate additional resources to support the effort to contain the fire. Officials report that the fire has burned about 200 to 300 acres and threatens area homes and structures. A Level 2 pre-evacuation notice was issued today to some Wasco County residents.
"I am invoking an emergency declaration to ensure the safety of Wasco County residents and to make additional state resources available to firefighters working to contain the Wassen Pond Fire," Governor Brown said.
In accordance with ORS 476.510-476.610, Governor Brown determined that a threat to life, safety, and property exists due to the fire and that the threat exceeds the firefighting capabilities of local firefighting personnel and equipment.
The Governor's declaration authorizes the Oregon Office of State Fire Marshal to mobilize resources to assist local first responders battling the fire.
