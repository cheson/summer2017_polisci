Governor Brown to Sign Pay Equity Legislation
Statement

Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown will sign into law on Thursday House Bill 2005 , expanding pay equity protections to Oregonians.
"Pay inequity can keep women in relationships they don't want to be in and can keep women of color working two or three jobs," Governor Kate Brown said. "I applaud the Legislature's bipartisan efforts to pass the Pay Equity Bill and make great strides toward a more equitable and prosperous Oregon."
HB 2005 strengthens existing protections, creates new provisions to ensure an individual's past salary does not hold them back when applying for a new job, and encourages all employers to conduct a pay equity study, just as the state has recently done.
