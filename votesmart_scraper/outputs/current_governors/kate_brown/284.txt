Governor Brown Declares Drought Emergencies in Baker and Wheeler Counties
Press Release
By: Kate Brown
Date: April 20, 2015
Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown today declared drought emergencies in Baker and Wheeler counties due to drought, low snow pack levels, and low water conditions.
The drought continues to have significant impact on agriculture, livestock, and natural resources in each of the jurisdictions. The counties requested the state to take action, and the Oregon Drought Council considered the counties' requests by weighing current water conditions, future climatic forecasts, and agricultural impacts.
"Oregon's warm and dry winter has potentially devastating consequences for those who live in Baker and Wheeler counties," Governor Brown said. "By enlisting the support of our state and federal partners, we will ensure the safety of residents, livestock and property."
The Oregon Drought Council, chaired by the Oregon Office of Emergency Management, meets as necessary to assess water conditions around the state. In the first four months of this year, Governor Brown has already declared drought emergencies in seven counties: Baker, Crook, Harney, Klamath, Lake, Malheur, and Wheeler. In 2014, a total of nine counties were under drought emergencies.
The Governor's drought declaration allows increased flexibility in how water is managed to ensure that limited supplies are used as efficiently as possible. In addition, the Governor is working with Oregon's federal delegation, state agencies, local governments, and other partners to coordinate efforts and mobilize actions to address drought-related issues.
Many of these authorities expedite water management tools to which users would not otherwise have access.
