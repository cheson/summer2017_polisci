Statement

Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown today announced Oregon will remain committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement in response to the decision by the White House to withdraw.
Governor Brown's office has been engaged in the creation of the United States Climate Alliance and other coalitions, and to help achieve the U.S. goal of reducing emissions 26-28 percent from 2005 levels and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan.
Governor Kate Brown released the following statement:
"As founding members of the Pacific Coast Collaborative, Oregon, Washington, California, and British Columbia have shown collaboration makes a huge difference in pursuit of greenhouse gas reduction goals and working toward the development of a greener, cleaner energy mix of the future. Expanding and strengthening the commitment to combat climate change with additional partners in states and cities across the U.S. sends a strong message to our global allies that despite the decision by the White House to retreat, the American people will nonetheless move forward to fulfill the goals of the Paris Agreement. I'm confident that we will continue to make meaningful strides to ensure our communities and economies are resilient and better prepared to meet the challenge of climate change."
Oregon is also founding member of the Under2 Coalition -- a global pact of 170 cities, states, and countries around the world representing more than one billion people and $27.5 trillion in combined GDP -- committed to limiting global average temperature increases to well below two degrees Celsius.
