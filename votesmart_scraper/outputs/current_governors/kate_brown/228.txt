Governor Kate Brown issued the following statement after signing SB 81, Oregon's community college tuition waiver program:
"Oregonians can now afford to dream big," Governor Brown said. "Today, we fling wide open the doors of opportunity by expanding access to post-secondary education, the precursor to a better life."
"The Oregon Promise program is made possible through a combination of budget and policy changes: significant budget increases for community colleges, and the expansion of the Oregon Opportunity Grant coupled with the new policy that gives priority to students who have substantial financial need. These elements work together with Federal Pell Grants to broaden access to more students.
"Signing the Oregon Promise into law demonstrates my commitment to expanding opportunities for working families to thrive."
