Location: Washington, DC

Governor Kate Brown today met with several officials in Washington D.C. to urge that any changes to health care maintain insurance, jobs, and improve access to affordable care to all Oregonians. Governor Brown met with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Medicaid and Medicare Administrator Seema Verma, Senator Jeff Merkley, Representative Peter Defazio, Representative Greg Walden, Representative Kurt Schrader, and Representative Suzanne Bonamici.
"While there's been uncertainty throughout the day about whether Congress would pass a bill, let's not forget about the uncertainty this is creating for hundreds of thousands of Oregonians who are worried about whether they'll continue to have health care," said Governor Kate Brown. "I found common ground with Secretary Price on the flexibility Oregon needs to build on our health care system. But, flexibility is useless without adequate resources.
"While the American Health Care Act is the wrong direction, there are other bipartisan solutions we could work on together. I look forward to helping shape the future of health care, not being subject to mandates from Washington D.C."
