Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown released the following statement on her updated proposal to raise the minimum wage:
"Based on feedback from stakeholders, I have refined my proposal, beginning implementation in 2016, so workers get higher pay sooner, and extending the glide path to give businesses more time to prepare for higher wages," said Governor Brown.
Governor Brown's plan will call for implementation of a higher minimum wage to begin in July 2016, six months earlier than originally proposed. Statewide, minimum wage will start at $9.75 and rise to $13.25 by 2022. Inside the Portland Metro Urban Growth Boundary the minimum wage will start at $9.75 and increase to $14.50 by 2022.
After 2022, the wage can increase annually in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.
