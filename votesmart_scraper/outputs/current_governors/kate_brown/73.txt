Governor Brown today released the statement below, following the State Land Board's initial consideration of the Elliott State Forest transfer proposal:
"Oregon's public lands -- our forests, parks, and beaches -- are irreplaceable assets. Even in the face of complicated challenges, we must strive to protect the values that Oregonians hold dear. Those include hunting, fishing, and hiking in the woods; they include the habitat for the marbled murrelet, northern spotted owl, and coastal coho salmon; and they include jobs critical to our rural economies.
"As I have said before, I am deeply appreciative of the private, non-profit, and sovereign tribal government proposal for the Elliott State Forest that has come before the Land Board. However, it would be in the public's interest to have more than one proposal to consider.
"Today I outlined an alternative option that uses up to $100 million in bonding authority to pay into the Common School Fund and relieve a portion of the Elliott from its fiduciary responsibility to the fund.
"This option will sustain the Common School Fund and keep the Elliott State Forest public. It will also include the opportunity for public, tribal, or private forest management, with the possibility of restoring some land to tribal ownership.
"This is only part of the solution to preserve and protect the natural wonders and assets of the Elliott State Forest. I call on stakeholders and interested parties to develop a public-private option to purchase and manage the Elliott Forest in a sustainable manner.
"I am confident if we work together to balance public ownership, rural jobs and economies, conservation, and recreation we can protect the Elliott for future generations."
