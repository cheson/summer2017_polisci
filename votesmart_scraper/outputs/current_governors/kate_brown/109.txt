Governor Kate Brown today released the following statement regarding rail safety in Mosier and across the state:
"I share the concerns of the people of Mosier and all Oregonians regarding the safety of our communities and ecosystems. I have directed my staff to follow up with the Incident Response Team to ensure public safety is maintained and risk to the environment is minimized throughout the duration of the response effort.
"I also expect federal authorities to conduct a full and thorough investigation of the cause of this accident, assess the response to see what improvements should be made, and evaluate ways to reduce risks to communities and the environment.
"Critical federal rules that would enhance rail safety are either in litigation or are yet to be adopted. I am calling for the strongest possible measures from federal policymakers and regulators to bolster rail safety. The safety of our communities depends on this work being completed as soon as possible."
