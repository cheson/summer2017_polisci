Governor Kate Brown and Interim Department of Human Services Director Clyde Saiki today announced the members for an external advisory committee charged by the Governor with conducting an independent review of the state's child foster care system and services.
"Recent information has come to light that calls into question Oregon's foster care services and state agency accountability," Governor Brown said. "This is unacceptable. As part of an independent review of the DHS child foster care system, this external advisory committee will provide additional community perspective to the reviewer and oversight of the assessment process."
