Governor Brown Declares 'Water Awareness Month'
Press Release
By: Kate Brown
Date: July 7, 2015
Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown today declared July "Water Awareness Month." With 20 counties under emergency drought declarations and approximately 98 percent of the state experiencing drought, Governor Brown is directing all state agencies to assist the Oregon Water Resources Department in increasing awareness about Oregon's water resources challenges.
"I am asking all Oregonians to do their part to use water wisely," said Governor Brown. "Water is the foundation for local economies and ecosystems, and essential to the health and well-being of Oregonians. Drought is a slow moving disaster, adopting responsible water use practices now will help reduce the impact of drought for years to come."
The proclamation cites as causes for concern the lowest statewide snowpack level on record; the third warmest average temperature from January to May in the past 121 years; and below normal rainfall. The proclamation also recognizes some climate scientists' prediction that over the next 50 years Oregon is likely to lose most of its snowpack and become a rain dominated system.
In the effort to raise awareness of the dire conditions that Oregon faces this summer, Governor Brown's office has created a website for more information, http://www.drought.oregon.gov , and launched the "#ORdrought" campaign. State agencies are using the website and the hashtag #ORdrought to keep Oregonians informed and prepared to adapt to drought conditions.
