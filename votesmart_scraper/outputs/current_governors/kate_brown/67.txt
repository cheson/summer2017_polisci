Climate change poses one of the most significant threats to Oregon's economy, environment, and way of life. Our winters are becoming milder, our summers hotter. Snow packs are shrinking and unseasonably warm temperatures are leading to rapid spring melts depleting Oregon's supply of summer water for agriculture and stream flows for wildlife. Storms and forest fires are becoming more severe while the risk of coastal flooding is increasing.
These impacts will affect all Oregonians, but will hit low-income communities, communities of color, and rural communities the hardest. Mitigating the impacts of climate change and achieving Oregon's greenhouse gas reduction goals are key priorities for Governor Brown.
Oregon has a strong history of taking action to protect our environment, preserving our natural wonders and diverse wildlife, and helping to meet the challenge of climate change. We preserved public access to Oregon's coastal beaches for future generations, and Oregon became the first state in the entire United States to require deposits on cans and bottles. Today, an astounding 90% of containers are returned in Oregon for re-use, helping Oregon remain a clean, green place to live.
Oregon must continue to do our part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a way that strengthens our communities and bolsters our economy. Under Governor Brown's leadership, Oregon is working with leaders along the West Coast to fight global climate change and develop a clean energy mix of the future as a member of the Pacific Coast Collaborative and the recently launched Ocean Acidification Alliance.
