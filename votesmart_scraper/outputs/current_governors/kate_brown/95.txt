Governor Kate Brown Statement on Supreme Court Ruling Affirming Safe, Legal Abortions
Statement

Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 5-3 ruling today in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, which would have restricted women's access to reproductive health services:
"Today's decision is a triumph for women's health, and an important one for our nation. Not only did the Supreme Court's action protect the rights of women in Texas, it signals to other states the fate of hostile policies that threaten women's constitutional rights and our ability to control our own bodies and health decisions.
"While today gives me hope, I know our fight for women's reproductive health rights is not over. In the steady barrage of attacks to limit abortion access, I stand firm in supporting the rights of women to control their own bodies. We must be vigilant in addressing health disparities for our sisters of color and women and families living in poverty. I support contraceptive equity and age-appropriate health and sexuality education for all young people. Together, with our communities and like-minded leaders, we can build a legacy for women and families that ensures the future health and well-being of our state."
