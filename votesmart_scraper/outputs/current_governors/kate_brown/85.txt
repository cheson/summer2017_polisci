Governor Kate Brown on Friday will announce "Oregonians United to End Gun Violence," a plan to reduce gun violence in Oregon and across the country. Governor Brown will be joined by faith leaders, advocates for gun safety, Senator Ron Wyden, Representative Suzanne Bonamici, Multnomah County District Attorney Rod Underhill, and other elected officials to release new policies and legislation that protects Oregonians from gun-related acts of violence.
"In Oregon, 2,280 Oregonians -- an average of 456 people each year -- died from firearms-related injuries between 2010 and 2014," said Governor Brown. "I call on each of us as Oregonians and Americans to stand united in our resolve to end this senseless loss of life."
