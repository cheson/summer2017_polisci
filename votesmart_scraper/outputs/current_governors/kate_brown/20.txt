Location: Salem, OR

Governor Brown will sign into law on Wednesday two bills that support the rights and self-sufficiency of Oregon's foster youth and a proclamation declaring May as Foster Care Month.
"Each and every Oregonian can make an impact on the lives of our must vulnerable children," Governor Brown said. "I am proud to sign into law legislation that protects the foundational relationships between siblings and help foster youth achieve independence as they transition into adulthood."
House Bill 2216 requires the Department of Human Services (DHS) to create a Foster Children's Siblings Bill of Rights. House Bill 2344 modifies the qualifications for current or former foster youth to participate in DHS' Independent Living Program.
Prior to the bill signing, Governor Brown will meet with current and former foster youth to discuss her top priorities for improving child welfare in Oregon.
"All three branches of government must come together to ensure foster children have access to a brighter future." Governor Brown said. "This means providing safe and stable homes, protecting access to critical behavioral health services, and providing continuous counsel and training for case workers."
Members of the media are invited to attend each event. Those who plan to attend or need more information should call Press Secretary Bryan Hockaday at 503-580-7836.
