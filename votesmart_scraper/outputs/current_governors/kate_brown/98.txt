Thank you for the introduction, Dr. Robertson.
Three years ago at the Knight Cancer Institute's gala, people who care deeply about eradicating cancer made a pledge to take a stand against cancer that, as Dr. Robertson put it, "will change the world."
Many of you in this room had passports stamped to be here tonight. While I understand we have a large contingency from the United Kingdom, you have also traveled to Oregon from Germany, Honk Kong, the Netherlands, and France. Tonight is a reminder that though oceans separate you, you're working hand in hand with one another to improve the lives of millions of people around the world.
Your work may be local, but your fight is global.
I am grateful for each and every one of you who traveled from around the world to be a part of this very important endeavor. I also wanted to acknowledge the people who made tonight possible.
Thank you to OHSU's Knight Cancer Institute and Dr. Brian Druker and his team for seeing this vision through.
To Cancer Research UK, the largest global funder of cancer research in the world and to its CEO Sir Harpal [HAR-pull] Kumar [KOO-mar} who is with us tonight, thank you for hopping the pond.
To Gordon and Katie, thank you for your foundation's generous donation that made this a reality.
Lastly, thank you to the sponsors who worked with Gordon and Katie to help make lasting contributions to people and their families.
When Phil and Penny Knight laid out the challenge to cure cancer, the state and people of Oregon responded. We know that others around the globe are equally committed to this crusade and we look forward to the ongoing collaboration with all of you.
