PREPARED REMARKS
SB 1583 Bill Signing
3/8/2016
Last month, Bloomberg News reported that Oregon has the best performing economy in the country. While we've always known we live in a special place, the secret has clearly gotten out. Not because of mysterious economic forces beyond our control and outside state lines. Rather, it's because Oregonians show the love we have for our home by giving a little piece of ourselves back to Oregon in everything we do.
Entrepreneurs who believe their products truly add value to people's lives. Investors who give back to their communities by supporting underserved business owners who may not otherwise have a shot. And champions who are so proud of our state they tell the world about the great work we produce.
This all fosters an economy that encourages growth and attracts talent. When it came to employment, personal income, and the equity of its publicly traded companies, little old Oregon is leading the pack.
For investors, Bloomberg called Oregon a "superior bet."
Now -- on the heels of this historic momentum -- it is my priority to ensure every corner of the state benefits from our progress and is also better prepared for the economic whims of the future. This is best done by increasing the ways for state government to add value to Oregon's overall economic enterprise -- not creating more red tape for small businesses to navigate.
Today, we are putting to pen to paper in two ways.
