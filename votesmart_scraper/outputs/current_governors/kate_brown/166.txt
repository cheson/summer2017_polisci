Location: Salem, OR

As part of her 2016 Policy Agenda to increase ways for state government to add value to Oregon's overall economic enterprise, Governor Kate Brown today announced the creation of her Small Business Advisory Cabinet. The Cabinet is charged with developing recommendations to Governor Brown on how state government can support small business owners and emerging entrepreneurs and advance statewide economic growth.
"We know 70 percent of new jobs in Oregon happen when existing businesses expand," said Governor Brown. "The Small Business Advisory Cabinet will identify issues and needs specific to small businesses and advise me as to how state government can help them grow Oregon's economy statewide."
The Small Business Advisory Cabinet will consist of small business owners, representatives of the financial community, and state government officials appointed by the Governor. The Cabinet will deliver recommendations on three priorities by October 1, 2016:
* How state government can further the support and promotion of small business owners and prospective entrepreneurs.
* How state government can increase access to capital.
* How state government can streamline regulations to help small business owners and prospective entrepreneurs navigate the myriad laws and policies of state government.
