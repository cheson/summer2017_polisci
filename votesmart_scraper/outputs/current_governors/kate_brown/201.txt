Governor Kate Brown and Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum announced today that the state has reached a settlement in Lane v. Brown, the class action involving employment services that Oregon provides to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
In 2013, with the adoption of Executive Order 13-04, http://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orde... , the State revolutionized the services it provides to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities by committing to phase out "sheltered workshops" and to replace them with employment services directed toward integrated workplaces. With this settlement, the State has agreed to continue to implement the Executive Order, and carry out other commitments already made by the state, such as finding 1,115 jobs in the community for individuals who have worked in the workshops. The State's work will be supervised by an independent monitor.
"This is a big win for Oregonians. We are already on track to provide integrated employment opportunities for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. This settlement continues our commitment to ensure that all Oregonians are part of the economic recovery," said Governor Brown.
"This settlement ensures that we will be able to improve employment opportunities and services for persons with disabilities. I am pleased that we were able to come to a solution through the legal system that will work well for all Oregonians," said Attorney General Rosenblum.
The settlement was brokered by Magistrate Judge John V. Acosta. It must still be approved by Magistrate Judge Janice M. Stewart, who has presided over the litigation since its inception.
