There is an old saying, "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.
Today, we celebrate an important milestone in a shared journey. In recognizing the value of building community, we also recognize the importance of planning, designing, and building physical spaces that inspire people to gather and connect. When we succeed in creating such spaces, we build community.
And, ladies and gentlemen, One North is what success looks like.
To build inspirational spaces, you need inspirational people -- people from a variety of perspectives and backgrounds with a shared vision, working together toward common objectives --community-focused economic development, environmental sustainability, and resiliency.
The inspired vision for One North incorporates local wood products, is energy efficient, and dedicates a substantial portion of its footprint to the area you're standing in now.
And then, the creators of One North generously gave it to the people of Portland.
One North is emblematic of a commitment to working together to add value to the North and Northeast Portland neighborhoods. I hope it will be an inspiration to others who seek to make a positive difference for the people of Oregon. .
This project reiterates the need for more visionary projects that not only create beautiful, sustainable spaces, but also move Oregon forward, providing jobs, connecting people, and building communities.
Congratulations, and thank you.
