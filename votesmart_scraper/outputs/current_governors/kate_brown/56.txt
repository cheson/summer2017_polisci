Governor Kate Brown today kicked off the Western Governors' Association (WGA) National Forest and Rangeland Management Initiative Workshop. The initiative brings together states and land managers to share best practices and policy options for forest and rangeland management.
"Federal public lands account for 60 percent of the total forest lands in Oregon, and we foster strong partnerships with the U.S. Forest Service, local and tribal communities, the forest products industry, and conservation interests," Governor Brown said. "By taking an 'all-lands, all-hands' approach and working together across jurisdictional boundaries, we can support healthy communities, sustain robust rural economies, and preserve our natural resources for future generations."
This week's workshop is the fourth in a series hosted across the West for the central policy initiative of WGA Chair and Montana Governor Steve Bullock. For more more information about the initiative, visit WGA's National Forest and Rangeland Management Initiative website .
