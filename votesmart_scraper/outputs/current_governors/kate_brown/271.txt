Governor Brown issued this statement in response to the May revenue forecast:
"I am pleased that strong economic growth will enable us to invest an additional $100 million in our public schools as well as fund early childhood, career technical, and STEM programs that support student success and reduce the opportunity gap. According to the U.S. Department of Education, Oregon's 2013 graduation rate was the worst in the country. We simply must do better, and we will.
Additionally, Oregon's positive economic outlook allows us to reinvest in other priorities for middle class Oregonians such as access to health care, ensuring public safety, and promoting rural economic development while also building our savings. It's important to have funds in reserve for future needs."
