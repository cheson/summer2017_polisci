Governor Kate Brown today announces a new pilot program to help small Oregon companies finance their growth.
Small and young companies often struggle to find conventional financing. The Small Business Expansion Program at http://oregon.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=41... is a $5 million fund that will provide an alternative for small businesses, especially those in underserved or disconnected communities.
"Businesses that start and expand in Oregon provide about 70-percent of new jobs here," said Oregon Governor Kate Brown. "By connecting small companies with the resources they need to thrive, Oregon is seeding job growth while supporting businesses that might otherwise not have access to these kinds of tools."
