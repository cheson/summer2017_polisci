The Governor's Natural Resources Office (GNRO) provides policy analysis and advice to the Governor's Office. We work with more than a dozen state natural resource agencies to implement the Governor's natural resource and environmental agenda. The governor's natural resources team convenes regular meetings of state natural resource agencies to ensure that state policies are consistently applied across agencies. The office facilitates resolution of policy differences between state agencies, federal agencies and between agencies and stakeholders, and provides direction and coordination for agencies on regulatory, planning and environmental issues that span multiple agencies. Examples include coordination of species recovery efforts, water quality monitoring and enhancement, preventing and mitigating drought, multipurpose water development and ocean conservation.
