Governor Kate Brown will sign SB 1532: increasing Oregon's minimum wage according to a tiered system, at 11:00 a.m. Wednesday, March 2.
"I'm proud to sign into law my top priority of the 2016 Legislative session -- raising the minimum wage," said Governor Brown. "Today we can say Oregonians are truly better off. SB 1532 is a path forward -- so working families can catch up, and businesses have time to plan for the increase. That's the Oregon Way."
"Oregon takes a bold step today on behalf of working families. With Governor Brown's signature, hundreds of thousands of Oregonians will get a well-deserved raise and a little peace of mind, while giving a boost to local economies," said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez. "Today's action vindicates the basic principle that no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty. I am continually encouraged by states like Oregon that push our country forward on this critical issue."
