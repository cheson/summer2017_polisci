From the earliest moments of her career working as a family law attorney advocating for children and their parents, Kate has been fighting to ensure kids in Oregon receive the support they need to succeed from cradle to career. As governor, Kate is investing in our schools to keep students on track to graduate from high school with a plan for their future -- and ready for college, post-secondary job training, or the world of work.
"Education is like an elevator. It enables us all to rise."
-- Governor Kate Brown
Investing in Oregon's Future
To have a strong and skilled workforce, Oregon needs strong public education. That's why Kate has made education one of her top priorities as governor, making the largest investment in education in Oregon's history to help reduce class sizes and put more resources in the classroom. This included funding all-day kindergarten statewide for the first time ever, making sure every child has a strong foundation to learn and grow. Kate also understands that great teachers change lives. She created the Council on Educator Advancement to make sure our educators have the tools and training they need to support student success.
Kate will continue to fight for the resources necessary to make sure every student enters school ready to learn, and stays engaged and on track throughout their educations.
More Graduates, More Career Options
Kate is passionate about improving high school graduation rates and finding ways to awaken students to the power of their own potential. This year, she appointed an Education Innovation Officer to identify and help implement strategies proven to keep students engaged and on track to earn their high school diplomas. She also doubled the state's investment in hands-on learning programs with real-world experiences that expose students to new technologies and professions.
