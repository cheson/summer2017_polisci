Governor Kate Brown today released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of same-sex marriage.
"Today, love wins. The United States Supreme Court extended the right to marry nationwide, giving couples and families the freedoms and recognition they deserve.
"I am grateful to the many people, some of them Oregonians, who lent their voices to the fight for marriage equality. Let's acknowledge the steps these courageous individuals took in the name of love.
"In the words of Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, 'No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family,' he wrote. 'In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were.'
"While the Supreme Court has upheld the union of marriage, our work is not done. Let us remember that we still must strive to end discrimination and hate so that all people live with dignity. Love who you want to love. Marry who you want to marry. Be who you are, and celebrate."
