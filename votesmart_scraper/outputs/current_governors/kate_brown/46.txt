Governor Kate Brown today released the following statement regarding the Port of Portland and ICTSI Oregon, Inc.'s mutual decision to terminate the 25-year lease agreement to operate the container facility at the Port's Terminal 6:
"Container service is key to our trade-dependent economy, and I am confident the Port of Portland will take advantage of this opportunity to re-establish a crucial lifeline to rural Oregon and businesses across the state," Governor Brown said. "Container service at Terminal 6 was one of the first issues I took on after becoming Governor. I still believe Oregon businesses, the shipping community, those who work on the waterfront, and the Port of Portland will come together to develop a solution that supports Oregon's economy and creates jobs."
