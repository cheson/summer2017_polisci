Governor Kate Brown today ordered all flags at Oregon public institutions to be flown at half-staff immediately until sunset on Tuesday, July 12 in honor of the victims of the attack in Dallas, Texas:
"I'm tremendously saddened that police officers in Dallas, Texas were killed or injured in the line of duty as they worked to ensure the safety of lawful, peaceful protestors calling for justice for the black community. For our law enforcement officers in Oregon and across our nation, we are grateful for your public service and the work you do to keep all people safe. My thoughts are with the victims and families who lost loved ones this week."
