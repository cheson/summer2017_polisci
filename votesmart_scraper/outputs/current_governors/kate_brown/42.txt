Governor Kate Brown today released the following statement regarding the Congressional Budget Office's report that 14 million Americans would go uninsured next year and 24 million will be uninsured by 2026:
"This bill will needlessly harm millions of Americans by increasing the prices for insurance 15-20 percent next year and eliminating important jobs in our critical health care sector. It will especially harm rural Oregon, which is just starting to recover from a prolonged economic downturn," said Governor Brown. "What's more, during a month when we are celebrating the contributions women have made in America, I am disturbed to learn that under this plan 15 percent of American women would lose access to care. This is simply unacceptable.
"The Congressional Budget Office's report makes it clear that Congress should not support this bill until they can ensure American's will be protected under any kind of health care replacement. The Oregon Health Authority and Department of Consumer Business Services are examining the CBO report and will deliver a comprehensive analysis, performed at my direction, this Thursday."
