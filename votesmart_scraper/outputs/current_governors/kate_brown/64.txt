The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion/Affirmative Action (DEI/AA) is committed to providing leadership and support to Oregon state agencies as they create a work environment that allows every individual the opportunity to reach their full potential as a state employee. Training, policies and practices are focused toward improving recruitment, retention and promotion and toward ensuring nondiscrimination toward employees protected through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations and Oregon statutes. In addition, the DEI/AA Office oversees the development of state business policies that direct the conduct of contracting and procurement processes to eliminate bias and barriers for businesses owned by minorities, women, and veterans and emerging small businesses to provide the state with goods and services. The DEI/AA Office works with policy advisors and other agencies to increase engagement with community members across the state to ensure that all Boards and Commissions reflect the diversity of the people of Oregon.
