Governor Brown expanded staff resources in the Office of General Counsel shortly after taking office in 2015 as part of a larger effort to restore public trust in state government. Attorneys and staff in this unit work with Governor's Office staff, legislators, and state agencies to improve the accountability and accessibility of Oregon's government. This includes developing and advocating for improved practices and policies among state agencies relating to compliance with public records and public meetings laws.
Responsibilities also encompass the daily work of acknowledging, reviewing, evaluating, and responding to public records requests made to the Office of the Governor. This work includes:
*working with requestors to define and understand the scope of public records requests
*managing and conducting the legal review of potentially responsive public records and producing responsive public records to the requestor
*posting them on the public records log maintained on the Office of the Governor's website
*making decisions regarding applicable fees or charges
