Governor Kate Brown on Friday will sign Senate Bill 1547, increasing renewable energy and eliminating coal from Oregon's energy sources. The event will be held at James John Elementary in North Portland, a school using solar panels to generate electricity and educate students about renewable sources of energy.
"Knowing how important it is to Oregonians to act on climate change, a wide range of stakeholders came to the table around Oregonians' investments in coal and renewable energy," said Governor Brown. "Working together, they found a path to best equip our state with the energy resource mix of the future. Now, Oregon will be less reliant on fossil fuels and shift our focus to clean energy. I'm proud to sign a bill that moves Oregon forward, together with the shared values of current and future generations."
