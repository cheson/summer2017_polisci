Statement

Governor Kate Brown today released the following statement regarding the May revenue forecast:
"This is the good news: our economy is humming; unemployment is low; and state revenue is a higher than expected.
"Here's the bad news: this doesn't change the fact that Oregon still has a structural deficit. This means in the long term, whether the economy is good or bad, the state will struggle to pay for education, public safety, child welfare, and health care.
"We now have less than two months before the end of this legislative session. The stakes couldn't be higher. I will continue to hunt for every penny and rein in the costs of state government. But, without definitive action by the Legislature 350,000 Oregonians could lose health care, hundreds of teachers could lose their jobs, and college could become even more unaffordable.
"Every week I meet with business, labor, and legislative leaders across the state to stop this from happening.
"There has been a lot of careful analysis, good conversation, and thoughtful consideration by our state's leaders. But, now is the time to start making hard decisions and come to agreement. All sides need to give. All sides need to come together and do what's right for Oregon."
