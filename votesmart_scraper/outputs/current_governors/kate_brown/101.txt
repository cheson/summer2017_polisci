Governor Kate Brown today released the following statement thanking Oregon Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley for their efforts to pass background checks at the national level:
"I am proud of the work Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley have done to help bring our country up to Oregon's standards on background checks. From taking part in last week's filibuster to their vote today, I want to thank them for representing our state's values on this important issue.
"Oregon is one of eight states and Washington, D.C. that require universal background checks. I'm proud that we brought responsible gun owners, community advocates, and law enforcement together, and under my leadership, we passed common sense reform to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.
"Congress has introduced more than 100 gun safety reform bills since 2011, and so far all have failed. From San Bernardino, to Roseburg, to Charleston, to Orlando -- Congress must put politics aside as we did in Oregon, and do its part to stop this dangerous trend."
