At the request of President Obama, Governor Kate Brown today ordered flags lowered to half-staff at all public institutions until sunset on Saturday, July 25 in honor of the victims of the Chattanooga shootings.
"It is becoming all too frequent that we mourn lives lost to gun violence within the borders of our country," Governor Brown said. "On behalf of Oregonians, I send condolences to the loved ones of Sgt. Carson A. Holmquist; Petty Officer 2nd Class Randall Smith; Gunnery Sgt. Thomas J. Sullivan; Lance Cpl. Squire K. Wells; and Staff Sgt. David A. Wyatt. These victims were fathers, sons, and friends, and their untimely deaths are tragic."
