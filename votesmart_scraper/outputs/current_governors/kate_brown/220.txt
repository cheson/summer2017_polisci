Press Release

Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown today ordered state agencies to step up efforts to conserve water. The goal of these efforts is to reduce water consumption by 15 percent or more on average across all state-owned facilities on or before December 31, 2020. The Executive Order calls on agencies to report their progress to the Governor's Office by November 1, 2015, and annually thereafter.
"Water is the foundation for our economies, communities, ecosystems, and quality of life," Governor Brown said. "State government's efforts to address climate change must include reduced consumption and other conservation measures as water shortages become the new normal."
The Governor's Executive Order also directs agencies to update the state's overall planning for drought, including potential new tools to help communities deal with the impacts of water shortages. Governor Brown has also asked state agencies to reduce water use on the Capitol grounds in Salem.
In the effort to raise awareness of the dire conditions that Oregon faces this summer, Governor Brown's office has created a website for more information, http://www.drought.oregon.gov , and launched the "#ORdrought" campaign. State agencies are using the website and the hashtag #ORdrought to keep Oregonians informed and prepared to adapt to drought conditions.
