Governor Kate Brown announced today that Erinn Kelley-Siel will step down as Oregon Department of Human Services Director, a role she has held since 2011.
"Erinn has accomplished so much on behalf of Oregonians," Governor Brown said. "She is an exceptional leader with the rare ability to integrate compassion and strategic thinking into all that she does. Oregon was fortunate to benefit from her talent and leadership in public service for more than 13 years."
During Kelley-Siel's tenure as director, she led the agency to become more efficient as it served hundreds of thousands of more Oregonians during recovery from the Great Recession. Under her leadership, the agency safely reduced the number of children in foster care and strengthened partnerships with those served by the agency as well as community partners and stakeholders. More Oregonians who accessed DHS services are going back to work, including a growing number of TANF parents, Vocational Rehabilitation consumers, and individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. More children with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families now have access to in-home and youth transition services to support them in achieving their goals.
Prior to serving as director, Kelley-Siel was DHS' Director of Child Welfare, Self Sufficiency and Vocational Rehabilitation Programs. She previously served Governor Ted Kulongoski as the Health and Human Services Policy Advisor.
Kelley-Siel will continue in her role until Governor Brown appoints a new DHS director.
