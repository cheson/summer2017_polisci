Governor Kate Brown today announced she will appoint Patrick W. Henry to fill the vacancy on the Multnomah County Circuit Court created by the retirement of Judge Paula J. Kurshner.
"Patrick Henry has spent his legal career supporting those least able to protect and defend themselves," said Governor Brown. "He has litigated on behalf of abused and neglected older adults, people with mental illness, victims of domestic violence and people with developmental disabilities. His passion for the law and his compassion for people will make him an outstanding judge for the people of Multnomah County."
