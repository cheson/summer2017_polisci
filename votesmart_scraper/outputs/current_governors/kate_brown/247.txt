Governor Brown today issued the following statement after signing HB 2655 , establishing the Student Assessment Bill of Rights:
"During the 2015 legislative session, I have worked with Legislators toward ensuring success for every Oregon student, including:
* Expanding Head Start and high-quality child care and preschool options, and fully funding all-day kindergarten for the first time ever
* Investing $12.5 million in improving outcomes for English Language Learners, and strengthening reporting requirements and accountability measures (HB 3499)
* Improving educational outcomes among African-American students (HB 2016), and targeting resources to improve attendance and retention rates among Native American students
* Nearly doubling our investment in Career and Technical Education and STEM programs throughout Oregon
* Making additional investments to develop high-quality teachers and school leaders, with a focus on cultural competency
"The audit of the opportunity gap in the Oregon K-12 education system completed while I was Secretary of State underscored the need for accurate data across all student subgroups to evaluate student outcomes and make improvements at the student and system levels. But participation is crucial to success. Under HB 2655, the State is responsible to ensure parents are aware of the purpose and value of assessments and receive notice from their local school districts about their rights and obligations. Educators must engage with parents about the value of assessment and the potential consequences if parents opt out and student participation diminishes. We cannot afford to risk losing federal dollars, especially for students who have been traditionally underserved. I will monitor implementation and work with federal partners to ensure our funding is maintained.
"As educators and policy makers, it is important to demonstrate for parents the connection between high levels of student participation in assessment and system accountability -- ensuring the success of every student."
