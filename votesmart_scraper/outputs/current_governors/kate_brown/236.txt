As July 4th approaches, Governor Kate Brown and State Fire Marshal Jim Walker are reminding Oregonians to use extreme caution and common sense when using legal fireworks in legal places.
"Hot, dry conditions and improper fireworks use don't mix," said Governor Brown. "We all share the responsibility to use only legal fireworks, and use them carefully. I encourage Oregonians to be aware and considerate of our state's natural beauty, neighbors, and pets before deciding on when and where you choose to light fireworks."
Legal fireworks can only be purchased from Oregon permitted fireworks retailers and Oregon law bans the possession, use, or sale of fireworks that fly, explode, or travel more than 6 feet on the ground or 12 inches into the air. Fireworks commonly called bottle rockets, roman candles, and firecrackers are illegal in Oregon.
"I urge all Oregonians who plan to light their own fireworks to check with your local fire authority first to be sure it is OK to light them," said State Fire Marshal Jim Walker. "One spark is all it takes to start a fire that can have devastating results. If fireworks use is allowed in your area, please be aware of your local weather conditions before using them and follow our four B's for fireworks safety."
Be Prepared
* Store fireworks out of children's reach.

* Place pets indoors; they are frightened by
fireworks.
* Always have water handy (a garden hose or
bucket of water).
Be Safe

* Keep matches & lighters away from children.
* Use fireworks outdoors only.
* Light only one firework at a time & move away
quickly.
* Keep children & pets away from fireworks.
* Always remember -- do not throw fireworks or hold
them in your hand.
Be Responsible
* Soak used fireworks thoroughly in a bucket of
water.
* Dispose of used fireworks & debris properly.
* Never relight "dud" fireworks. Wait 15-20 minutes
then soak them in a bucket of water.
Be Aware
* Use only legal fireworks.
* Use legal fireworks only in legal places.
* Fireworks are not allowed on all beaches, state
parks, and state and federal forestlands.
