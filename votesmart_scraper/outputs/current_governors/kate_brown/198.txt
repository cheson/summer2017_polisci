Governor Kate Brown today invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act at 12:25 p.m. in response to the Dry Gulch Fire burning in Baker County. At the time of the declaration, the fire had grown to more than 12,000 acres and about 275 homes were threatened; some of which were on level 3 evacuations.
"With homes and lives in the balance, we must quickly devote the resources and coordination needed to protect Oregonians and their property," said Governor Brown. "The rapidly growing Dry Gulch Fire is a reminder that fire danger is still high across much of the state and each of us must do our part to prevent another one from starting."
