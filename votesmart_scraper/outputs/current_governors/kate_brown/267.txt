Thank you, Mayor Peterson, and thanks also to Jason Brandt and the Salem Chamber, as well as SEDCOR, and Larry and Jason Tokarski at Mountain West Investments for hosting us tonight.
When I told my husband Dan that I thought perhaps the Salem mayor was going give me the key to the city, he said, "Hey, I thought we took all your keys away."
Ok, it's true, I have been known to misplace my keys on occasion. But I promise to take very good care of this one. Thank you.
I have been driving to Salem regularly over the course of my 23 years in public life and obviously, during that time, I ventured out of the Capitol frequently enough to form a few opinions:
Best chai: Governor's Cup.
Best hot chocolate: Ike Box.
Best quick lunch: Willamette University. It's good, it's close, it's cheap, and there are almost always college kids, dogs or ducklings on campus. There are lots of good restaurants in Salem, but it's tough to compete with kids, dogs and ducklings.
These are basically the kinds of things a commuter learns about Salem. But since we have become locals, Dan and I have made all kinds of discoveries.
For example, in Salem, there's no separation of Church and State -- streets, that is. Since that intersection has a church on one corner and state government on the other, the street names makes perfect sense -- but it's the kind of thing the attorney in me finds pretty entertaining.
