Governor Kate Brown invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act at 7:37 p.m. tonight in response to the Grizzly Bear Complex Fire burning in Wallowa County. At the time of the declaration, the fire threatened more than 100 homes and structures, including a local school.
"Winds continue to fuel 13 lightning fires burning together, and they've now pushed across the Washington-Oregon border," Governor Brown said. "The Grizzly Bear Complex Fire threatens more than 100 homes and structures, so I ask residents to make safety a priority and heed all evacuation orders."
The Grizzly Bear Complex Fire was caused by numerous lightning fires and originated in the State of Washington on August 13. The fire is estimated at more than 12,000 acres.
In accordance with ORS 476.510-476.610, Governor Brown determined that a threat to life, safety, and property exists due to the fire and that the threat exceeds the firefighting capabilities of local firefighting personnel and equipment.
The Governor's declaration authorizes the Oregon Office of State Fire Marshal to mobilize structural firefighters and equipment to assist local resources battling the fire.
The emergency was declared for the Grizzly Bear Complex Fire only and is effective immediately.
