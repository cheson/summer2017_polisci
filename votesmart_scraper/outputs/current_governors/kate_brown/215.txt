Governor Kate Brown invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act at 9:50 p.m. July 30, 2015 in response to the Stouts Creek Fire burning 11 miles east of Canyonville in Douglas County. At the time of the declaration, the fire threatened about 50 homes and another 300 were at risk. Today, this fire remains challenging due to very difficult conditions.
"The Stouts Creek Fire has grown very quickly since beginning early Thursday and is already putting homes at risk," said Governor Brown. "As temperatures rise across Oregon this week, the Stouts Creek Fire has explosively grown amid record setting fuel conditions and extreme drought. This declaration allows us to quickly dedicate more resources to the fire in the effort to save lives and property."
The Stouts Creek Fire was first reported at 1:00 p.m. Thursday afternoon and quickly grew from a few hundred acres to about 6,000 acres by day's end.
In accordance with ORS 476.510-476.610, Governor Brown determined that a threat to life, safety, and property exists due to the fire and that the threat exceeds the firefighting capabilities of local firefighting personnel and equipment.
The Governor's declaration authorizes the Oregon Office of State Fire Marshal to mobilize structural firefighters and equipment to assist local resources battling the fire.
The emergency was declared for the Stouts Creek Fire only and is effective immediately.
