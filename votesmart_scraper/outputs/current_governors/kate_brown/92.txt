Press Release

Location: Portland, OR

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) today announced its endorsement of Governor Kate Brown in the Oregon election this November.
"Governor Kate Brown has an extraordinary record of leadership on LGBTQ equality. She has stood with and fought for the LGBTQ community throughout her career, and it is clear she will continue to make this a priority," said HRC's JoDee Winterhof, Senior Vice President for Policy and Political Affairs. "HRC is proud to support Governor Brown in her campaign, where she stands poised to make history as the nation's first openly bisexual person elected governor."
Governor Brown has fought for LGBTQ equality at the state level for nearly 25 years. Under her leadership as governor, Oregon banned the practice of gay conversion therapy, and extended protections for transgender students in Oregon schools ahead of the federal government's directive.
During her time as Senate Majority Leader, she played a central role in passing Oregon's non-discrimination law, ensuring critical protections for the LGBTQ community.
Governor Brown expressed her gratitude for HRC's endorsement. "It's an incredible honor to have HRC's support in my campaign for governor. I am passionate about ensuring equality and fairness for every Oregonian, and growing our culture of tolerance and inclusion for the LGBTQ community is a critical piece of that goal. I look forward to working with HRC and our allies in the LGBTQ community so we can continue moving Oregon forward."
