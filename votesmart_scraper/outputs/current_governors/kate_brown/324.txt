Governor Kate Brown's statement on House passage of Motor Voter bill:
"I commend the House of Representatives for the passage of House Bill 2177, Oregon's Motor Voter bill," said Governor Kate Brown. "It modernizes how the DMV and the Secretary of State's Office work to register eligible citizens to vote. Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for eligible voters to participate in our elections. As Secretary of State, passage of the Motor Voter bill was my top priority. Now that House Bill 2177 is moving to the Senate, I hope to have the opportunity to sign this bill into law."
