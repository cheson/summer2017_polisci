Governor Kate Brown's statement in response to the March 2016 Economic and Revenue Forecast released today:
"I am pleased to see that job growth is steady and Oregon's economy is likely to remain stable through the remainder of the biennium," Governor Brown said. "Although state revenues are on track to fulfill important commitments in education and other critical services, my optimism is tempered by longer-term dynamics in the forecast that call for caution. I will work with legislative leadership to build reserves for future needs."
