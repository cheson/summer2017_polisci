Good evening everyone and welcome to the Special Olympics Oregon Summer Games.
I have been looking forward to this event all week, and am so glad to finally be able to take selfies and meet with the athletes, coaches, and community members who make this event so special.
These games would not be possible without the support of Ken and Joan (pronounced Jo-Ann) Austin, and their family.
When the Special Olympics Oregon Summer Games were forced to cancel during the economic downturn, Ken and his wife Joan (pronounced Jo-Ann) stepped in with $1 million to bring back the games for four years to their home community of Newberg.
When Joan passed away two years ago, Ken pledged another $500,000 that will allow athletes to compete this year and in 2016.
Thousands of athletes benefit from the Austin family's loving spirit as they challenge themselves to reach new heights at the games each year.
Our community and our state will forever be grateful for your generosity and support of the games.
Tonight is a beautiful reflection of what it means to be an Oregonian. We come together. We respect our differences. We celebrate each other's successes.
Here, in the wonderful city of Newberg, people from across our great state will cheer on the 1,600 athletes who have worked so hard for the seconds, minutes, or hours in which they will compete.
Let's talk a little about time.
