This morning the U.S. Department of the Interior announced that sage-grouse will not be listed under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). Oregon has been highlighted as one of the key states that led the way to this federal finding.
"Oregonians have reason to be very proud of the work done by partners supporting healthy Oregon ecosystems, rural communities, and economies," said Governor Brown. "The work of the SageCon partnership and our action plan helps our wildlife and its habitat while also addressing threats to the vitality of our farms and ranches, outdoor recreation, energy development, and other sectors."
