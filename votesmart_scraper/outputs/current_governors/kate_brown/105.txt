Governor Kate Brown today issued the following statement on the mass shooting in Orlando:
"Tragically, what we are waking up to in the United States today is that the growing number of mass shootings in the U.S. increases the number of Americans with a personal connection to a Roseburg, a Charleston, a Columbine, and now, an Orlando.
"Two days ago I participated in Umpqua Community College's commencement exercises just nine months after 10 lives were lost in a mass shooting on its Roseburg campus. As we celebrated UCC students reaching a major milestone, we also honored the community's resiliency.
"I call upon us as a state to move beyond the political debate about gun control and instead bring responsible gun owners and community advocates together to find solutions. We must take action to better protect community safety.
"My thoughts are with the victims in Orlando, their loved ones and families, and I extend my sincere gratitude to the first responders. As Oregonians, we share in the pain and mourning reverberating across the United States and world today."
