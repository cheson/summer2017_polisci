Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown today declared a state of emergency to exist in Benton, Clackamas, Clatsop, Columbia, Lane, Lincoln, Linn, Marion, Multnomah, Polk, Tillamook, Washington, and Yamhill Counties due to a severe winter storm, including high winds, flooding, and landslides. This declaration comes at the request of local officials and is based on the recommendations of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management.
"Heavy rains and wind have required the evacuation of residences, and mudslides and high water have severely damaged or blocked major roadways in these areas of the state," Governor Brown said. "The emergency declaration ensures state resources, emergency response personnel, and equipment can be activated to respond to communities in need if their local resources are exhausted."
