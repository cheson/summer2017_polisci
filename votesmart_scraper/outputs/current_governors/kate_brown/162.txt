This week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) allocated more than $85 million in its 2016 work plan ( http://oregon.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=41... ) to support dredging this year for 12 Oregon coastal ports. Governor Kate Brown, Oregon's congressional delegation, and local legislators secured this funding following a collaborative effort to ensure the state's coastal economies can thrive.
"Oregon's coastal communities have long fought to ensure the state's ports receive necessary federal funding for dredging," said Governor Brown. "I am pleased that advocacy from my office, the delegation, and other elected leaders to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been successful. Oregon's coastal ports will now have the resources to be dredged this summer. This work is critical for safety of the boating community and the survival of our coastal economy."
