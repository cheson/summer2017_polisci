Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown today announced that Elisa Dozono will step down as chair of the Oregon Lottery Commission effective Friday, July 10 following the recent filing of a lawsuit against the Oregon Lottery. Dozono is a partner at Miller Nash, the law firm representing a retailer in the June 19 lawsuit.
"Elisa Dozono has provided excellent leadership to the Oregon Lottery Commission," said Governor Brown. "Her integrity is unassailable; she has gone out of her way to ensure that she abided by all the applicable ethical rules with respect to her law practice and her position as Chair. However, the recent litigation required a re-examination of the situation, out of an abundance of caution, this was the best course of action. In the near future, I hope to be able to appoint Elisa to another post so that Oregon may continue to benefit from her talents and dedication."
Governor Brown has 30 days from Ms. Dozono's departure to appoint a successor to the five-member Commission.
