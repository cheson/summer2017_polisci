In light of a ruling last week by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Governor Kate Brown today called for the Legislature to create a task force chaired by Secretary of State Jeanne P. Atkins to study campaign finance limits and deliver recommendations by the end of the year.
Governor Brown asked that the task force include representatives from major political parties and other stakeholders concerned about the issue of campaign finance reform.
"No one should be able to buy a megaphone so big it drowns out every other voice," Governor Brown said. "It's time to reopen conversations about reasonable campaign limits in Oregon."
The Ninth Circuit ruled on May 26 that states can cap political donors' campaign contributions only if they can show that those limits are preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption. The court's decision involved Montana's campaign contribution limits. The Ninth Circuit covers nine western states, including Oregon, Washington, and California.
Oregon is the only state in the Ninth Circuit with no limits on campaign contributions. Governor Brown and Secretary Atkins are aware of the enormous value Oregonians place on free speech and testified in support of campaign finance reforms this session.
"I understand campaign finance reform is important to Oregonians," Secretary Atkins said. "I'm ready to work with the Legislature and task force members to consider the Ninth Circuit's recent opinion and identify solutions that will restore faith in our system of representation and elections."
