Governor Kate Brown today released the following statement about a leadership change at the Oregon Department of Human Services and her call for an independent review of the agency's programs to determine what improvements are needed to ensure children's safety:
"I have serious concerns about information brought to light regarding foster care provider Give Us This Day. When it comes to ensuring the safety of children in the state's care, we must be uncompromising. I am taking immediate action to place the state's chief operating officer, Clyde Saiki, in the interim director role at the Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS) pending completion of the national search for a new director. George Naughton will serve as interim chief operating officer and director at the Oregon Department of Administrative Services (DAS) during this period. I also will pursue an independent review of DHS programs to determine what improvements are needed in order to ensure children are served and protected."
