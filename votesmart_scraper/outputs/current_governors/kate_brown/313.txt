Governor Brown Declares Drought Emergency in Malheur, Lake Counties
Press Release

Location: Salem, OR

Governor Kate Brown declared a drought emergency in Malheur and Lake counties due to dry conditions, low snowpack, and lack of precipitation.
County commissioners from both jurisdictions requested the state to take action, and the Oregon Drought Council considered the counties' requests by weighing current water conditions, future climatic forecasts, and agricultural impacts.
"Projected forecasts for Malheur and Lake counties look bleak, meaning these rural communities will continue to experience severe drought conditions," Governor Brown said. "In addition to creating an increased wildfire risk, this drought presents hardships to crops, agriculture, communities, recreation, and wildlife, all of which rely on Oregon's water resources. I will continue working with federal, state, and local partners to help Oregonians in this part of the state through this challenging situation."
The Oregon Drought Council, chaired by the Oregon Office of Emergency Management, made its recommendation to the Governor last week. The Council meets as necessary to assess water conditions around the state.
The Governor's drought declaration allows increased flexibility in how water is managed to ensure that limited supplies are used as efficiently as possible. In addition, the Governor is working with Oregon's federal delegation, state agencies, local governments, and other partners to coordinate efforts and mobilize actions to address drought-related issues.
Many of these authorities expedite water management tools to which users would not otherwise have access.
