An improved economy means many Oregonians are breathing easier, but many working families still struggle to make ends meet, to access opportunities that lead to a better future for themselves and their children.
Standing up for Oregon's families and helping every Oregonian thrive begins with educational opportunity.
Investments in Oregon's community colleges and public universities will make a college education more accessible. We enhanced the Oregon Opportunity Grant to provide an additional 16,000 students a path to earn a college degree.
And with the legislation I will sign today, known as the Oregon Promise, we are opening the doors of opportunity even wider by providing tuition waivers to academically eligible students. In rural and urban communities alike, recent high school graduates will now be able to earn their undergraduate education tuition-free at their local community college.
I want to commend the authors of Senate Bill 81 -- Senator Mark Hass, Representative Mark Johnson and Representative Tobias Read -- for their bipartisan leadership. The expansion of the Oregon Opportunity Grant and the new Oregon Promise means we can -- and will fulfill -- the dream of a college education for more Oregon students and their families.
We will deliver real opportunity, proudly starting with the next class of Oregon's high school graduates.
I would now like to welcome Senator Mark Hass.
