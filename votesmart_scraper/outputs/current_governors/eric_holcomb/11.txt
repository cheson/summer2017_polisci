Indiana Governor Eric J. Holcomb offered the following statement on the April revenue forecast released today by the State Budget Committee, which projects modest growth over the next two fiscal years:
While we are seeing moderate growth in revenues across our state, we must be cautious about the fact that projections have not always mirrored actual revenue experience. Hoosiers may be assured my administration will continue to exercise strong financial management and good fiscal stewardship as we strive to deliver great government service at great taxpayer value.
