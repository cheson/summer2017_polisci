Today Gov. Eric Holcomb joined federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt, U.S. Senator Joe Donnelly, U.S. Senator Todd Young, U.S. Rep. Pete Visclosky, East Chicago Mayor Anthony Copeland, state Senator Lonnie Randolph, state Rep. Earl Harris, Jr., East Chicago officials and community leaders at the East Chicago Superfund Site.
Gov. Holcomb offered the following statement regarding the day's visit:
The impacts of lead contamination in East Chicago have made clear some of the most pressing systemic challenges these families face. The situation demands an unprecedented level of cooperation among state, local and federal stakeholders. That is pretty easy to articulate, but it's difficult to achieve.
Today's visit by EPA Administrator Pruitt is one more example. I think it speaks volumes that he chose East Chicago to be his first Superfund site visit since taking on this new role. From our very first meeting, Pruitt and his team have demonstrated their commitment to being a partner with us, and I am profusely grateful.
This all means the collaboration is working. It means we are here, and we're staying. We're not going to leave until we get the job done, and then we'll be here a little longer--because this is about the residents.
