Investing in Local Community Development to Make Indiana the Best Place to Live, Enhancing the Safety of Our Communities, Addressing and Acting on Public Health, Mental Health and Drug Addiction Challenges, and Protecting Indiana's Vulnerable Citizens from Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation.
* Invest in Local Community Development to Make Indiana the Best Place to Live
Expand the Regional Cities Initiative to encourage regional collaboration on projects that improve the vibrancy of communities across our state.
Expand the Stellar Communities and Mainstreet programs under the Office of Community and Rural Affairs so that projects in more of our smaller communities can be selected for transformational investments.
Streamline the various quality of place-related incentives managed by the Indiana Economic Development Corporation into a single tax credit that can be accessible to every community to support revitalization and redevelopment.
Instruct the Office of Management and Budget to waive annual audit fees for local Regional Development Authorities that continue to work in unison to prepare their communities for investment.
Increase broadband capabilities in rural communities.
* Enhance the Safety of Our Communities
Substantially increase the Indiana State Police compensation matrix to ensure Indiana can continue to recruit, equip, train, and retain the very best statewide police force.
Convene a working group to share best practices across state and local law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve, a working product of strategies that build upon ongoing successful efforts at developing trust between police and the Hoosiers they serve.
Focus on mitigating property crime and pharmacy robberies through increased focus on drug treatment and a matching grant program to enhance pharmacy security.
