Location: Indianapolis, IN

As Hoosiers across the state build their March Madness college basketball brackets, Gov. Eric. J. Holcomb and Superintendent of Public Instruction Dr. Jennifer McCormick today unveiled a new program to highlight Indiana's elite high school students for their work in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM): The Governor's STEM Team.
"Indiana is well known for its love of sports, but we must also be a state that uplifts its rock star students--especially in the STEM subjects that are fueling the innovation and entrepreneurship to build our economic future," Holcomb said. "The Governor's STEM Team will recognize our state's best and brightest young people with an honor that elevates their status, just as our society does for its finest athletes."
The program honors four outstanding high school students for their exemplary performance in one of the STEM subjects. Winning students receive $1,000 college scholarships and letterman jackets identifying them as members of the Governor's STEM Team. The submission period for the competition opens today, and applications and nominations may be submitted online at the following link: https://secure.in.gov/apps/govstemawards/. The deadline for nominations is 11:59 p.m. EDT on April 9, 2017.
"Engaging students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics prepares them for life beyond high school," said Dr. Jennifer McCormick, Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. "I am excited for the submissions we will receive and look forward to recognizing our students' creativity and passion for STEM."
The Governor's STEM Team builds on Indiana's Mr. and Ms. Math and Science awards, which were created by Gov. Mitch Daniels in 2008. The Governor's STEM Team program will honor the top high school students in STEM classes as well as extracurricular activities, work/research projects, leadership roles and community service. The nominations will be reviewed by a panel of STEM experts, including teachers, college and university instructors, and staff from the Indiana Department of Education and the State Board of Education.
Gov. Holcomb and Superintendent McCormick will announce the first members of the Governor's STEM Team in May.
