Press Release

Location: Indianapolis, IN

Indiana Governor Eric J. Holcomb today signed House Enrolled Act 1507 (HEA 1507) into law during a ceremony in his office. The law, authored by State Rep. Ed Soliday (R-Valparaiso) and sponsored by State Sen. Ed Charbonneau (R-Valparaiso), provides more options for communities to transport Hoosier students with developmental disabilities.
"This bill moved to my desk quickly with bipartisan support, because it is a common-sense, quick fix to an existing law that gives Indiana schools the flexibility they need to better serve students with disabilities," Gov. Holcomb said. "It is my pleasure to sign this bill into law."
HEA 1507 is the first bill Gov. Holcomb has signed into law as Indiana governor and the first bill of the 2017 legislative session to make its way to his desk. It passed both chambers of the General Assembly unanimously.
This law lets organizations that serve developmentally disabled students rent school buses for non-state supported events, such as the Special Olympics. Previously, state statute only allowed school buses to be rented to "state supported agencies." HEA 1507 also allows this transportation to be provided for students who live outside school boundaries.
State Rep. Soliday, State Sen. Charbonneau and Special Olympian students from Valparaiso gathered in the governor's office for the bill signing.
This law takes effect immediately. Read the full language at iga.in.gov.
