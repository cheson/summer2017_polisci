Indiana Gov. Eric J. Holcomb offered the following statement on the federal confirmations of former U.S. Sen. Dan Coats and Seema Verma:
It makes Indiana proud to see so many of our own top Hoosier leaders join Vice President Pence in Washington D.C.
As our national leaders work through the details of a new plan for health care, Seema Verma is exactly the right person to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Today, I was thrilled to see my friend and mentor Dan Coats confirmed as Director of National Intelligence. He is uniquely qualified and brings a wealth of experience, incredible wit and a strong dose of Hoosier common sense. Our nation will be well served, again, by his leadership.
