Issue Position

Location: Unknown

Today, agribusiness has a $34 billion impact on our state and has the potential to reshape the economy of the I-95 corridor and expand to a $50 billion dollar impact in twenty years. Henry believes a fully integrated effort by the Department of Commerce and the Agriculture Commissioner can market existing agribusiness opportunities and explore value-added technological ones like bio-fuels and alternative uses of traditional crops.
