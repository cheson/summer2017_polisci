Henry McMaster is an avid sportsman and proud gun owner. For decades, Henry has worked with the National Rifle Association to protect our 2nd Amendment rights. But government at every level continues to intrude on gun owners' rights. That's why Henry has passionately defended our 2nd amendment rights in state and federal courts across America. Henry was instrumental in clearing the way for concealed weapons reciprocity with other states. When local government officials have attempted to encroach gun owners constitutional rights, the attorney general took action to protect gun owners' rights.
