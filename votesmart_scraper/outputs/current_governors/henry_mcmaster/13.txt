Henry loves South Carolina and the beautiful natural resources that can be found in every corner of our state. As Attorney General he helped protect our marsh islands from illegal encroachment and our states water supply from being diverted to other areas. He also was integral in giving the State Grand Jury jurisdiction in crimes committed against our environment, a powerful weapon with which to combat the tragic consequences of inflicting damage to our natural resources.
