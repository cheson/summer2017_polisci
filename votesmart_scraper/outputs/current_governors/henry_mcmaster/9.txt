Press Release
By: Henry McMaster
Date: April 19, 2017
Location: Columbia, SC

Governor Henry McMaster today issued Executive Order 2017-08 establishing the South Carolina Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Executive Oversight Group, which will serve as a task force meant to prevent cyber threats, incidents, or attacks affecting the State's critical infrastructure and key resources.
"Protecting its citizens is the most critical job a government is tasked with -- from enemies we can see and those we can't," said Gov. McMaster. "Cyber attacks are among the most common and potentially crippling offenses that face our state and country. With partnerships like this one, we are committing to being as proactive as possible in protecting our people and doing everything in our power to make sure we are as safe and secure as possible."
A copy of the Executive Order can be found on the governor's website.
The Executive Oversight Group will be responsible for enacting proposals detailed in the "South Carolina Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Strategic Plan," authored by the South Carolina Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group, which was created by former Governor Nikki Haley in June of 2015.
Details of the proposals will remain confidential as their public release could allow cyber criminals to thwart protections enacted by the State.
The Executive Oversight Group will be made up of:
* The Governor of the State of South Carolina or an employee or official from the Office of the Governor
* Chief of the State Law Enforcement Division
* Director of the South Carolina Department of Administration
* The State of South Carolina's Chief Information Security Officer
* One Cyber Executive, designated by the Chief of SLED, upon consultation with the Office of the Governor, to lead the SC CIC Program at the direction of the Executive Oversight Group
