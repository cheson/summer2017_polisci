Gov. Henry McMaster Holds Ceremonial Bill Signing For S.198
Press Release
By: Henry McMaster
Date: May 8, 2017
Location: Columbia, SC

Governor Henry McMaster today held a ceremonial bill signing of S.198 and a public reading of the proclamation designating the month of May as Foster Care Awareness Month.
The governor was joined by DSS Director Susan Alford, DMV Director Kevin Shwedo and foster parents from around the state to celebrate the bill, which makes it easier for teens in foster care to obtain a driver's license by expanding the list of approved adults to sign the application. Previously, only parents and legal guardians were legally approved signees.
Video of the bill signing can be found on the governor's YouTube page.
A copy of the governor's proclamation can be found on his website.
"This a terrific example of cabinet agencies working with the General Assembly to pass laws that will truly make a difference in the lives of South Carolinians," said Governor McMaster. "Our young people will one day be the leaders of our great State, and the ones who will now have the opportunity to get their driver's license will gain independence and learn responsibility that will serve them for the rest of their lives."
DMV and DSS have worked collaboratively with the General Assembly to develop the law and it was passed overwhelmingly before the governor signed it on April 5.
"As of this month, there are 916 children between the ages of 15-18 in foster care," Director Alford said. "The passage of S.198 ensures that children in foster care can experience the normal rites of passage that mark their development to adulthood, as well as develop skills critical to independent living. We appreciate the support of Governor McMaster, Sen. Shealy, Rep. Thayer, and the General Assembly to provide normalcy for children in care."
