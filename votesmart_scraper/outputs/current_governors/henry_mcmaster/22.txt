Henry believes improving and reforming our education delivery system is also critical to our state's economic success. And he wants every South Carolina child to be able to read at grade level by the third grade. Parents must have the opportunities for their children that choice and competition provides. Teachers who meet or exceed goals should be paid and promoted based on merit, free of burdensome red tape and paperwork. And our classrooms must be safe and properly funded.
