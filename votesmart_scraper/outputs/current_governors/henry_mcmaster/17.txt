During Henry's tenure as Chief Prosecutor for South Carolina, he stood up for the safety and security of our states residents, in particular those who are most often unable to defend themselves.
He declared criminal domestic violence a top priority, and changed the standards and expanded the resources available for prosecution. Under his tenure, thousands of offenders were successfully convicted.
He wrote the law outlawing the use of the Internet by child sex predators, trained and built a network of over fifty law enforcement agencies which have arrested hundreds of these criminals, and when they caught them he made sure they were convicted with a 100% conviction rate.
