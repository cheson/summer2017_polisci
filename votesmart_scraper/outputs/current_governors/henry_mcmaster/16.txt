When Governor Haley recognized that the ethics laws in our state were not serving the people the first person she called was Henry. She asked him to lead the South Carolina Commission on Ethics Reform, a bipartisan group, to develop ways to strengthen our states outdated, and often ineffective, ethics laws. With Henry's leadership they put together what is considered the blue print for a more ethical government, a government that works for the people. We are now closer than ever to enacting real ethics standards for our state's elected officials that keeps them honest and holds them accountable.Led the Way for Ethics Reform.
