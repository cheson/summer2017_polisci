Traditional South Carolina values are the foundation for strong families, safe communities and prosperous states. Throughout his career in public service, including two terms as attorney general, Henry McMaster has defended traditional South Carolina values. He led the statewide effort to constitutionally define traditional marriage as a union between one man and one woman. He defended our right to express religious faith publicly on "I Believe" license plates. He stood up to ACLU lawyers who said we can't pray to Jesus Christ in public. And he cracked down on websites that peddle pornography and prostitution. Henry McMaster will be a governor who champions traditional values.
