Governor Henry McMaster today released the following statement in response to the statewide unemployment rate decreasing to 4.1 percent in May from 4.3 percent in April:
"With the state's unemployment rate at a near 17-year low, it's as important as ever that we continue to broaden the scope of our workforce development initiatives and ensure that South Carolinians are trained and ready when they enter the labor force. The fact that companies around the world know our workforce is one of the best is a major factor in our future prosperity, and we must continue to build on that successful reputation."
