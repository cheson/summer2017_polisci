Issue Position: Comprehensive Tax Reform
Issue Position
By: Henry McMaster
Location: Unknown

To be competitive with other states, Henry believes we must have comprehensive tax reform from top to bottom that lowers taxes, making our tax code flatter, fairer, and friendlier to economic development. Currently, our personal income taxes are the highest in the Southeast. Taxes on manufacturing are the highest in the nation, and we have the seventh highest commercial property taxes. This puts our state at a disadvantage.
