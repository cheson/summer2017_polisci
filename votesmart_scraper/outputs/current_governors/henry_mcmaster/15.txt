Henry understands the challenges facing many businesses, both large and small. He knows our government must not overburden employers with unnecessary red tape and high tax rates. He also understands the assets South Carolina brings to the table for large companies looking for a new home.
In his position on South Carolina Ports Authority -- an international gateway for commerce -- he was a part of the leadership team that has repeatedly broken export records. In 2013, the South Carolina exported $26.1 billion to 202 separate countries. Henry will use this knowledge and personal experience to be a strong advocate for continuing our economic recovery.
