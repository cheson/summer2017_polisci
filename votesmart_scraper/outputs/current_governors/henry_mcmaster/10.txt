Gov. Henry McMaster Backs Automatic Stay Bill
Statement
By: Henry McMaster
Date: April 13, 2017
Location: Columbia, SC

Governor Henry McMaster today announced his support for a bill that would limit the time frame in which both public and private projects could be delayed by individuals or groups without first properly demonstrating legal grounds or standing. The Senate has approved the bill, S. 105 sponsored by Senate Judiciary Chairman Luke Rankin, and it awaits action in the House Judiciary Committee.
"Currently, court challenges can automatically stop work in important construction projects for unnecessarily long periods of time," said Gov. McMaster. "Under this bill, the time period for which a court may issue an 'automatic stay' is limited to a reasonable and practical 90 days. Lengthy delays and uncertainty inhibit economic growth. Sound business decisions and strong environmental policies will allow our State to prosper."
"I applaud the work of the Horry and Georgetown legislators and the other leaders for their diligent work on this bill and look forward to signing it into law soon," said McMaster.
