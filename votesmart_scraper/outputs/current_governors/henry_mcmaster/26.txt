Henry knows safe streets, neighborhoods and classrooms are key to our state's future prosperity. For Henry, that begins with closing the revolving doors of our prisons and jails by enacting truth in sentencing by abolishing parole. We need new sentencing programs for non violent, first time offenders that require work and drug testing in order to stay out of jail. And we must continue our efforts on Internet predators, domestic violence and gangs.
