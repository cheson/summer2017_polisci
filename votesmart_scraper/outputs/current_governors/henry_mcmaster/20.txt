Issue Position: Restructuring and Accountability
Issue Position
By: Henry McMaster
Location: Unknown

Restructuring state government is important. Henry believes strongly that state government should be as transparent, efficient, accountable and responsive as possible. Taxpayers deserve to know how state government spends every dime. As governor, Henry McMaster will push for every state government agency, board and commission to make all spending, official decision and actions available online in real time. Henry also supports on-the-record voting in the General Assembly, all state government boards, commissions and committees. But technical issues of government structure should not distract the state's chief executive. In South Carolina, there is not so much a restructuring problem as there is a leadership problem. The governor has all the power he needs to grow the economy and create jobs. The Path to Prosperity for South Carolina requires leadership working overtime to unleash the free market and re-ignite South Carolina's greatness. That's what Henry would do as governor.
