By: Phil Scott

Location: Montpelier, VT

Governor Phil Scott today issued the following statement:
"As many around the state are working to assess damage and continue recovery efforts from this weekend's rain and flooding, I want to remind Vermonters to stay alert in affected areas and continue to put safety first.
"I want to thank the local city and town officials and first responders for their efforts to prepare for and respond to the flooding, and ongoing work to help each affected community assess damage and plan for recovery.
"I also commend the Agency of Transportation (VTrans), Department of Public Safety, Division of Emergency Management & Homeland Security (DEMHS) and all of our emergency personnel for their work to keep Vermonters and our infrastructure safe.
"While visiting affected communities in Brandon, Rochester, Hartford and Thetford, I was again reminded of the incredible spirit of Vermonters, who are always ready and willing to roll up their sleeves and help neighbors or communities in need.
"My administration will continue to monitor recovery efforts and work with local municipalities to assess and repair the damage done."
