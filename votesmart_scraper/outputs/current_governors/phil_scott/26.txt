Governor Phil Scott today issued the following statement:
"I want to thank the local, state, and federal agencies who collaborated on this long investigation, resulting in 26 arrests. This enforcement effort stemmed from a sudden surge of overdoses in Orleans County, and reflects our commitment to ending drug trafficking in our local communities.
"I applaud the Vermont Drug Task Force, Vermont State Police, Orleans County Sheriff's Department, Newport City Police Department, the Orleans County State's Attorney's Office and the Vermont Attorney General's Office for their efforts. And I thank our federal partners for their support and collaboration, including the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Vermont, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United States Marshals Service (USMS) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
"Under the leadership of Commissioner Thomas Anderson, the Department of Public Safety will continue to focus on enforcement efforts among a broader network of individuals selling opiates within their own communities. In addition to these efforts, my Administration remains equally committed to combating the opiate epidemic with a focus on prevention and treatment, as part of our multi-faceted approach to one of the most serious challenges we face."
