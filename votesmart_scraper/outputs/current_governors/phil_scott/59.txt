In keeping with his strong support of renewable energy investment, Lieutenant Governor candidate Phil Scott will participate in several green energy conferences and forums this month that offer opportunities for an exchange of ideas and expertise about ways to decrease Vermont's reliance on fossil fuels.
Scott will attend the 9th Annual Renewable Energy Future Conference at the Sheraton Conference Center in Burlington Friday, October 1, the Vermont Green Business Conference at the Sugarbush Gatehouse Lodge in Warren Wednesday, October 6 and the Vermont Environmental Consortium 10th Annual Expo and Trade Show at Middlebury College Tuesday, October 19th.
During his 10 years of service in the Vermont State Senate, Scott chaired the Institutions Committee, which invested millions of dollars for biomass plants in schools, geothermal projects in state buildings and initiated energy conservation efforts.
"Asserting our independence and self-reliance, taking responsibility for our future energy needs and revitalizing the state's economy and business climate are the principal themes of my candidacy," Scott said. "I see the renewable energy sector as offering a lot of potential to help us accomplish all of these goals, and these conferences provide an invaluable exchange of ideas and information between entrepreneurs, scientists, consumers and state leaders."
The Renewable Energy Future Conference is designed for members of the general public looking for renewable energy options for home or business and for those working in the renewable energy and general energy sector. It intends to examine the newest energy policies and developments that will help Vermont create a more sustainable, clean, safe and vibrant energy future. Topics scheduled for presentation include Sustaining Biomass Energy, Financing for renewable developers, the Smart Grid, Wind Project Siting and the Vermont Sustainable Job Fund.
