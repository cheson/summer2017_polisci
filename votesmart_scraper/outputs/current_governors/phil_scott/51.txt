Lt. Governor Scott is the only Republican member of the Democratic Governor's cabinet. While a member of the Vermont Senate, he was one of only two Republican committee chairs in a Democratically-controlled Legislature.
Always a believer in moderation and balance, Lt. Governor Scott is proud to call himself a Republican, but he doesn't believe party labels should define us. He finds plenty of common sense on both sides of the aisle, and he's been very successful in bringing those sides together to move Vermont forward.
One recent example was his important, but behind-the-scenes role in reaching a decision on the location of the new state office complex.
After Tropical Storm Irene devastated the historic campus in Waterbury, debate continued for months over whether the complex could, or should, be re-built in a floodplain; whether the state should aim to restore the existing buildings or forge ahead with new construction; and what the state's responsibility was to various communities that have previously, or could in the future, play host to the 1,000 jobs in various state agencies.
Once the state's architectural consultants presented four alternative proposals that covered the full range of possibilities, Lt. Governor Scott brought together the Chairs of the House and Senate Institutions Committees, local officials from Waterbury and Barre, and members of the Administration, and achieved a compromise that all parties felt good about.
By ending a debate that was focused on "either-or" alternatives, Lt. Governor Scott opened up a path forward that everyone had a stake in.
