Phil's Comprehensive Economic Plan

I am the only candidate for Governor who knows what it is like to live paycheck-to-paycheck while raising a family (two talented, independent, beautiful young women!) and growing a family business in Vermont. As a small-business owner, I put my faith in the skills, work ethic and ingenuity of working Vermonters everyday. That's why you can count on me to lead a state government that leverages these core values -- a talented workforce and our commitment to hard work and innovation -- that focuses on restoring the economic and fiscal fundamentals that support job retention and creation and result in a vibrant economy that expands the middle class and lifts wages.
After six years dominated by one party, a shrinking workforce, $700 million1 in new taxes and fees, chronic budget deficits and a series of failed -- and incredibly expensive -- experiments, current and future generations of Vermonters cannot afford more of the same. To take Vermont's economy in a more prosperous direction, economic growth and making Vermont more affordable for families and businesses must be Montpelier's highest priorities. And they will be when I am Governor.
