Governor Phil Scott Continues Efforts to Ensure Federal Health Care Reform Protects Vermonters and Coverage Gains
Statement
By: Phil Scott
Date: June 27, 2017
Location: Montpelier, VT

Today, Governor Phil Scott sent the following letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer regarding the Senate's consideration of the Better Care Reconciliation Act.
Governor Scott remains concerned over the potentially harmful impact this legislation would have on Vermonters, including provisions in the bill relating to the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
"Vermont has achieved great success in providing near universal coverage, having one of the lowest uninsured rates and highest performing health systems in the nation. Any legislation passed by Congress must protect the progress we've made in health care," said Gov. Scott. "Neither bill, in their current form, meets these standards and both would be harmful to our state and our people if passed. I therefore cannot support the current bills and have urged Congress to delay action and work with the states to address our concerns."
The letter to Senate leadership follows up on a letter Governor Scott sent to House leadership in January. The full letter to the U.S. Senate can be found here, and the letter to the U.S. House can be found here.
