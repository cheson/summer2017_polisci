Location: Montpelier, VT

A number of Vermont education leaders have released the following statement, which has also been signed by Governor Peter Shumlin and Governor-elect Phil Scott.
"Vermont has fought for centuries for freedom and unity, equity and openness. Vermont remains a beacon of hope and opportunity, community and shared humanity. Vermont was the first to commit to the abolition of slavery in our state constitution and a leader in the fight for marriage equality. We will continue to support all Vermonters and welcome people of all backgrounds to the Green Mountain state.
"We, the undersigned, condemn any acts of unlawful discrimination, violence, and intimidation that target differences in national origin, race, sex, gender, religion, disability, or political viewpoint across our nation. Such acts run counter to the rights and freedoms upon which our country was founded and to the core values of the state of Vermont.
"Vermont is committed to fostering welcoming communities and an equitable, diverse, and inclusive society."
