Have you heard the expression, "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help?" Usually, this is meant sarcastically -- but Lt. Governor Scott takes it seriously.
This past spring, he wrote an op-ed piece discussing the opportunities he sees for state government to do more pro-active education and counseling, to help Vermonters achieve prosperity within the guidelines of the law.
In keeping with this pro-active spirit, Lt. Governor Scott has made open doors and constituent outreach a top priority in his office. He holds a well-attended coffee hour once a week, during which legislators, lobbyists and members of the general public can meet each other and discuss priorities and concerns in an informal setting. He and his staff act as a conduit to put Vermonters in touch with the agencies that can address their concerns. He takes frequent phone calls from people who "aren't sure where to start", and makes referrals to an actual live person who can help them out.
