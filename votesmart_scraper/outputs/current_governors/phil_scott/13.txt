Statement from Governor Phil Scott on the President's Decision to Withdraw from Paris Climate Agreement
Statement
By: Phil Scott
Date: June 1, 2017
Location: Montpelier, VT

Governor Phil Scott today issued the following statement:
"The President's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement is disappointing and concerning, particularly given the widespread and non-partisan support from business and political leaders for remaining in the Agreement.
"Vermont has taken a leadership role in addressing climate change, and the President's decision today only strengthens our commitment. We have strong, regional multi-state partnerships through the Coalition of Northeast Governors (CONEG) and have made much progress in reducing the region's carbon emissions, and we will maintain this work because it is the right and responsible thing to do.
"We will continue to do our share in a way that creates jobs, makes our state more affordable for families and businesses, and protects our environment for future generations."
