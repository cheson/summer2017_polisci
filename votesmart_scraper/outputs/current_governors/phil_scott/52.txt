During the summer of 2011, Lt. Governor Scott attended parades, fairs and farmers markets throughout the state, spreading the message "Buy Local: It's not just for hippies anymore."
What does he mean by "it's not just for hippies?" Buying local doesn't have to mean buying organic or paying more for products and services. Buying local also doesn't have to be a strictly "liberal" message, although it's often been portrayed that way in the past. Supporting our neighbors has no partisan affiliation. Buying Local is for everyone.
The Lieutenant Governor's office offers an excellent opportunity to promote Vermont products and the Vermont brand. While it's important to market Vermont outside the state, Lt. Governor Scott wants to make sure we don't ignore the opportunities to market ourselves within our own communities.
(And by the way, "Candidate Scott" walks the walk: In all of his election campaigns, Phil Scott has worked exclusively with vendors and consultants within Vermont's borders.)
