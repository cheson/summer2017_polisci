Senator Phil Scott, candidate for Lt. Governor, was surprised to see that his opponent has mis-represented his views in a negative TV ad that hit airwaves yesterday.
For instance, the ad claims that Scott is pro-life and was endorsed by pro-life groups. In fact, Phil Scott is pro-choice, a position that he has explained publicly throughout the campaign at forums and through survey responses.
"So many Vermonters have complimented me on the positive, issue-focused campaign that I've run, and that characterized the entire Lieutenant Governor's race until yesterday morning," Scott said. "I'm proud of my positive campaign, and I think it's very unfortunate not only that my opponent has chosen to go negative, but also that his negative message is actually untrue. I am, and always have been, a pro-choice candidate."
