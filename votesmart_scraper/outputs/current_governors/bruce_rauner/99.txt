Governor Bruce Rauner visited with employees at the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) office in Springfield today to discuss the work they have done to increase opportunities for Illinois students.
"The employees at IBHE are instrumental in providing our students with a world-class education while overseeing grants and program review. Their focus on expanding opportunity and access to quality education across Illinois is inspiring," Governor Rauner said. "We must ensure their good work continues and our higher education proposal does just that."
During his visit, the Governor received an update on current projects within the agency including initiatives to expand college opportunity within Illinois, especially for low income, first generation, adult and students of color. He was also briefed on what the IBHE is doing to encourage efficiency within Illinois public colleges' as a way to curb the rising cost of higher education.
Higher education funding is a cornerstone of the Governor's stopgap budget bill. The bill offers $1 billion for higher education on top of $600 million already approved in FY16. This plan would ensure that universities are able to open on time and complete the full fall semester. It also includes $151 million in funding for MAP for spring semester 2016. This goes to public and private colleges, for all students who were awarded MAP grants for the spring semester.
