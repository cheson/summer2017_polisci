Rauner: Quinn Refuses to Cooperate with Investigations
Press Release

Location: Batavia, IL

Illinois gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner today called on Governor Pat Quinn to quit stalling investigations into his administration and release all documents related to both NRI and illegal patronage hiring.
"Pat Quinn continues breaking promises and refuses to come clean with the people of Illinois," Rauner said at the NFIB endorsement press conference in Batavia. "After promising the people he would fully cooperate with the investigations, we learned just yesterday that he's refusing to disclose emails to the Legislative Audit Commission regarding NRI."
Yesterday, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Governor Quinn is refusing to disclose emails regarding NRI, prompting the co-chair of the Legislative Audit Commission to request Attorney General Lisa Madigan to enforce the subpoenas.
"That's not the sign of someone fully cooperating," Rauner said. "What is this governor hiding and who is he protecting?"
