We need to increase efficiency and transparency in government.
We're constantly hearing new reports about waste in our government. Thousands of individuals improperly taking state health benefits -- many from other states. Billions of tax dollars designated to improve transportation are instead spent elsewhere in state government.
Lobbyists, special interests, and career politicians might think wasting our dollars is business as usual. I don't.
We need to make government spending more accountable. To do that, we can:
*Audit every dime.
*Reform the pension system so we can spend more money on priorities like education, roads, and public safety.
