Note: Veto Message is below
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
The veto message is as follows:
To the Honorable Members of
The Illinois Senate,
99th General Assembly:
Today I veto Senate Bill 51 from the 99th General Assembly, one of several budget implementation bills, in order to protect Illinois taxpayers from an unbalanced and unconstitutional budget.
The General Assembly's budget makes spending promises that exceed available revenues by nearly $4 billion. I therefore vetoed that budget and am today vetoing its accompanying budget implementation bills.
I again call on the General Assembly to be a partner in enacting a balanced budget, structural reforms inside government, and economic reforms that stimulate our economy and bring new jobs to Illinois.
Therefore, pursuant to Section 9(b) of Article IV of the Illinois Constitution of 1970, I hereby return Senate Bill 51, entitled "AN ACT concerning State government", with the foregoing objections, vetoed in its entirety.
Sincerely,
Bruce Rauner
GOVERNOR
