Statement on Moody's Ratings Downgrade
Statement
By: Bruce Rauner
Date: June 9, 2016
Location: Springfield, IL

The Office of Governor Bruce Rauner issued the following statement on the ratings downgrade by Moody's Investors Service. This is attributable to Catherine Kelly, Press Secretary for the Governor:
"When the General Assembly adjourned without passing a balanced budget, the Administration warned the super majority in the legislature there would be consequences. This report underscores the need for real structural changes to repair the years of unbalanced budgets and deficit spending by the majority party on Illinois' finances. Every rank-and-file Democrat who blindly followed the Speaker down this path is directly responsible for the downgrade."
