Illinois gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner today renewed his call for Governor Quinn to fire all of the illegal patronage hires made during his administration.
"Just like Rod Blagojevich, maybe Pat Quinn thought he wouldn't get caught," Rauner said. "Pat Quinn has been a loyal foot soldier for Patronage, Inc. his entire career and now he's running the outfit. The people of Illinois are drowning in Pat Quinn's cesspool of corruption -- it's time to drain the swamp and put an end to this corruption once and for all."
Late on Friday afternoon, Governor Quinn, in an effort to avoid responsibility for his actions, released the names of all illegal patronage hires at IDOT over the last decade, revealing that more than 60% of the patronage hires occurred on his watch.
A few weeks ago, Pat Quinn misled the people of Illinois and left the impression that he fired all the illegal patronage hires. Today we know that is not even close to being true. Pat Quinn is protecting almost twice as many people as he fired.
"One of my first acts as governor will be to sit down with Michael Shakman and work out a settlement that includes a federal hiring monitor and firing everyone who was illegally hired," Rauner said.
