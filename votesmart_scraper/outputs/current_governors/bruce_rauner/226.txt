Illinois gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner and running mate Evelyn Sanguinetti today proudly accepted the endorsement of the National Federation of Independent Business.

"I am honored to accept the endorsement of the NFIB because it is time to end the struggle small business owners are facing in this state and give them the confidence they deserve from their state government."
"NFIB proudly endorses Bruce Rauner for Governor," said Kim Maisch, NFIB Illinois State Director. "Bruce's business savvy and entrepreneurial instincts will help move Illinois' economy in the right direction, and we know in a Rauner Administration small business ideas and opinions will be sought, will be heard and will be appreciated."
The NFIB represents more than 11,000 small businesses in Illinois. FlagSource, where Rauner accepted the endorsement, is a 95 year-old family flag making business in Batavia.
