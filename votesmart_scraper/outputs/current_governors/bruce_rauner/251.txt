Gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner and running mate Evelyn Sanguinetti today announced the launch of Amigos de Rauner-Sanguinetti.
The coalition consists of a broad range of Latino community and political leaders who endorse Bruce and Evelyn.
"Bruce and I are running to create better schools and more jobs, especially for the Latino community where unemployment is unacceptably high," said Evelyn Sanguinetti. "By working together, we can bring back Illinois."
"It is an honor to be running with Evelyn Sanguinetti who when we win will be the first Latina lieutenant governor in state history," said Bruce Rauner. "Evelyn and I are ready to work on behalf of all Illinoisans -- and especially this remarkable community."
