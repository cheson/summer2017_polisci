Location: Chicago, IL

Governor Bruce Rauner announced today the members of the newly created Local Government and Unfunded Mandates Task Force. The task force is comprised of municipal and county leaders, representatives of school districts, state legislators, and experts in consolidation. They represent all areas of Illinois. The task force is chaired by Lt. Governor Evelyn Sanguinetti.
This task force will identify ways to help local governments consolidate and eliminate duplicate governmental bodies, school districts and taxing authorities. Streamlining these services will help prevent waste and use taxpayer dollars more efficiently. It will also find ways to reduce the number of unfunded mandates the state imposes on local communities.
"Illinois has an excessive number of local government units and the state severely limits local governments' ability to control their own costs," Gov. Rauner said. "Consolidating local government and reducing the burden of unfunded mandates imposed by the state will reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve delivery of services."
"Streamlining local governments will help them better provide core services to the hard-working families in Illinois," Lt. Gov. Sanguinetti said. "I am honored to work for the taxpayers by helping their local governments become more efficient so they can better serve the people they represent."
