Location: Springfield, IL

The Office of Governor Bruce Rauner issued the following statement on the passage of SB 2059 attributable to Press Secretary Catherine Kelly:
"By passing this bipartisan agreement, lawmakers in both chambers put aside political differences to provide emergency assistance for higher education, ensuring universities and community colleges remain open and low-income students can pay for school. We are hopeful the General Assembly will build on this bipartisan momentum in the weeks ahead as we negotiate a balanced budget with reform for Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017."
