Governor Bruce Rauner issued a proclamation declaring Friday, September 11, 2015 Patriot Day in Illinois. All entities governed by the Flag Display Act are ordered to fly the United States and state flags at half-staff in honor of the victims of the terror attacks 14 years ago today.
"It is important as Illinoisans that we observe Patriot Day to honor the thousands of men and women who lost their lives or were injured during the heinous attacks on 9/11," Governor Rauner said. "We must also thank the first responders who rushed to help in the days following the attacks, and the military personnel who defended our country's freedoms. As Americans, this day will forever live in our memories, which is why I am ordering the United States and Illinois State flags to half-staff as a tribute in honor of the victims."
