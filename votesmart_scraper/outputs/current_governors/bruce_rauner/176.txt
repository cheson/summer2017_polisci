BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Bill No.: SB 1893
An Act Concerning Safety
Action: Vetoed
Veto Message for SB 1893:
To the Honorable Members of
The Illinois Senate,
99th General Assembly:
Today I veto Senate Bill 1893 from the 99th General Assembly, which repeals Section 3c of the Disabled Persons Rehabilitation Act, for technical reasons.
Senate Bill 1893 contains identical language to House Bill 4107, which I signed into law. Senate Bill 1893 is therefore moot. I thank the sponsors of Senate Bill 1893 and House Bill 4107 for their efforts.
Therefore, pursuant to Section 9(b) of Article IV of the Illinois Constitution of 1970, I hereby return Senate Bill 1893, entitled "AN ACT concerning State government", with the foregoing objections, vetoed in its entirety.
Sincerely,
Bruce Rauner
GOVERNOR
