Gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner today expressed serious concerns over Governor Quinn's refusal to support a travel ban applied to countries affected by Ebola.
"I support Senator Kirk's call on the State Department to issue a visa and travel ban on those attempting to travel from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone," Rauner said. "It is troubling that Governor Quinn would not support a travel ban particularly given that O'Hare is one of the world's busiest airports. Pat Quinn has failed Illinois on jobs, on education, on taxes, and on crime; we can't afford another failure on a potentially very serious public health hazard."
Senator Kirk's proposal is common sense and supported by the vast majority of people in Illinois and America. It has won bi-partisan support.
