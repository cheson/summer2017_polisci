Location: Springfield, IL

Governor Bruce Rauner today declared DeKalb and Ogle counties state disaster areas after severe storms and tornadoes ripped across Illinois. At least two people in DeKalb County are reported dead and roughly a dozen more injured. Dozens of homes and businesses have been damaged or destroyed.
"Our hearts and thoughts go out to those impacted by yesterday's storms," said Gov. Rauner. "The State will do everything it can to help these families and communities recover and heal, while providing response resources."
The state disaster declaration makes available a wide variety of state resources that can help affected communities respond and recover from the storms. The state of Illinois has mobilized personnel and assets to help local government officials with disaster recovery, including conservation police officers, communication equipment and light towers.
All state roads, with the exception of a two-mile portion of Illinois 72 just north of Fairdale, are open. The state has started damage assessment flights around the hardest hit areas.
The State Incident Response Center (SIRC) in Springfield was activated Thursday afternoon and will remain operational as long as necessary. Liaisons from several state agencies are working with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) to coordinate the deployment of state personnel and assets to assist local governments in the affected areas.
