Bruce Rauner today issued the following statement in response to Pat Quinn's continued celebration of thousands of Illinoisans giving up on finding work over the last few months.
"Tens of thousands of people are giving up looking for work because of Pat Quinn's failed policies," Rauner said. "More than 63,000 people have given up hope on finding a job since April and Pat Quinn is out celebrating -- it's downright offensive to struggling families around Illinois."
In case you missed it, Peoria WMBD TV reported that "despite a report last week from the state showing more jobs created in Illinois and a lower unemployment rate, new data released Monday by the U S Bureau of Labor Statistics, paints a different picture."
