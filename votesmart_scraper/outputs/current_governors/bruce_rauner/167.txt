All eligible units of the Teamsters union have signed onto a new four-year collective bargaining agreement with the state of Illinois. The current agreement expired June 30, 2015.
The state previously announced an agreement with Teamsters Local 700, which covered 300 state workers in Cook County. Today's announcement covers Teamsters throughout the state and increases the number of covered employees to 4,600. Members of the Teamsters will vote to ratify the agreement within the next few weeks.
"This agreement is good for taxpayers and good for state employees," Governor Bruce Rauner said. "We were able to reach an agreement with the Teamsters quickly because all parties negotiated in good faith, something we are committed to doing with all unions representing state employees."
