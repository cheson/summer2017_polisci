Governor Rauner activated the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) in Springfield to ensure state personnel and equipment are ready to be quickly deployed if needed to help local emergency responders with public safety issues following tornado touchdowns in several communities in northern Illinois.
"I activated the State Emergency Operations Center to ensure we're prepared to act quickly if any local responders need our assistance," said Governor Rauner. "The Illinois Emergency Management Agency is in close contact with local emergency managers in several counties and stands ready to coordinate deployment of state resources if needed to support local response efforts."
Representatives from several state agencies are reporting to the SEOC. The center will remain activated as long as necessary.
