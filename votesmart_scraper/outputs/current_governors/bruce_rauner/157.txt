Illinois Lieutenant Governor Evelyn Sanguinetti today formally presented Governor Bruce Rauner with the Local Government Consolidation and Unfunded Mandates Task Force's final report.
"Part of reforming and turning around Illinois includes empowering local communities. This report shows the efficiencies and inefficiencies within local governments and provides concepts on how to give the people of Illinois more control over their future and their tax dollars," Governor Rauner said. "I thank the Lt. Governor and the Local Government Consolidation and Unfunded Mandates Task Force for their hard work and dedication to the people of Illinois."
