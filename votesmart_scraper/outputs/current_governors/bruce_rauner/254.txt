Rauner: Quinn Commands Culture of Patronage in Illinois
Press Release
By: Bruce Rauner
Date: July 2, 2014
Location: Chicago, IL

Bruce Rauner today issued a statement regarding news that the head of the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) has resigned amid questions about illegal political hiring practices at the agency:
"Pat Quinn commands a culture of patronage, corruption and cronyism in Illinois -- a fact left unchanged by the resignation of one of his patronage lieutenants. Quinn promised to end patronage in 2010, but that was just another broken promise from a career politician who rose from Dan Walker's patronage chief to Rod Blagojevich's defender-in-chief. There's a reason Pat Quinn is doing everything he can to block Michael Shakman's lawsuit -- from NRI to pay-to-play to IDOT patronage, Pat Quinn will do or say anything to stop the truth from coming out."
