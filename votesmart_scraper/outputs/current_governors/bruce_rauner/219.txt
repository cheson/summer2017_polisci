Bruce Rauner today called on Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn to submit to an independent investigation of lawmaker allegations that his administration improperly funneled taxpayer money to a slush fund that is now paying groups linked to the Neighborhood Recovery Imitative, which is currently the subject of two federal criminal investigations.
"This isn't a partisan issue; this is about about transparency and accountability," Rauner said. "I urge the governor to submit to an independent investigation by a respected auditor like Bill Holland so the people of Illinois can find out the truth without politics getting in the way."
Yesterday, lawmakers in Springfield held a news conference questioning the transfer of $5 million from a statewide program for at-risk youth to fund Chicago-based "organizations caught up in the 2010 probe of the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative." One lawmaker said the transfer appeared to be "another attempt by the governor to use taxpayer dollars to benefit his own political aspirations."
