"Property taxes are out-of-control and Pat Quinn's done nothing about it," Bruce Rauner said. "I'll freeze property taxes. It's time to put taxpayers back in charge -- no more tax hikes without voter approval."
Last month, Bruce launched www.FreezeMyTaxes.com which details how property taxes have increased under Pat Quinn and encouraged homeowners to sign a petition supporting Bruce's property tax freeze.
