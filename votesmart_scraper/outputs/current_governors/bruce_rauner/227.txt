As Pat Quinn finds himself embroiled in two ethics scandals, Bruce Rauner released his latest plan to transform state government, the Bring Back Blueprint: Ethics Reform.
"Pat Quinn is under investigation by two U.S. Attorneys and is protecting more than 100 political cronies who he illegally hired," Bruce Rauner said. "He has betrayed the public's trust. We need real ethics reform to restore integrity and confidence to state government."
