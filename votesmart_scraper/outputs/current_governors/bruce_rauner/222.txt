Illinois gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner today proudly accepted the endorsement of the Economic Empowerment Forum.
"My wife and I have devoted much our lives to improving opportunities for families throughout Chicago and have had an intense focus on improving schools for African-American students and parents. As governor, I will continue to do that," said Rauner. "I am honored to accept the endorsement of the Economic Empowerment Forum and will go to work for every person in Illinois. It is clear that Governor Pat Quinn has failed the African-American community -African-American unemployment remains scandalously high and all too often African-American children are stuck in failing schools. As governor I will change that."
"This year we have an opportunity to change directions," Dr. Willie Wilison said. "We have a candidate, Bruce Rauner, who has been working in our community for many years."
The Economic Empowerment Forum consists of American American ministers in the South and West Sides of Illinois who endorse Bruce Rauner for governor.
