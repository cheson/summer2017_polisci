Governor Bruce Rauner issued the following statement today on the Illinois Supreme Court's decision to deny the motion for rehearing regarding the redistricting referendum on the November ballot:

"Today's court decision is very disappointing, but not unexpected. Now that the courts have denied Illinoisans the right to vote on a redistricting referendum in November for the last time, it is up to the General Assembly to address political reform - term limits and independent redistricting - as soon as they reconvene this fall."
