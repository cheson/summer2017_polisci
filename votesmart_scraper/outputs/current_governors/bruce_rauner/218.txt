Bruce Rauner's campaign today issued the following statement in response to Pat Quinn's decision to double down on his pledge to push through a permanent income tax increase during the lame duck session of the General Assembly:
"Pat Quinn disrespects every Illinois family by pledging to ram an income tax increase down their throats the day after he gets thrown out of office," Rauner campaign spokesperson Mike Schrimpf said. "Bruce Rauner is going to win on November 4th and he's going to do all he can to stop a lame duck governor and lame duck legislators from raising taxes."
Quinn's comments came after Bruce Rauner this morning called on Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton to block any tax votes until the new General Assembly is seated in January.
