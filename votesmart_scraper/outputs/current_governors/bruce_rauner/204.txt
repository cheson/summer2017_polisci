Governor Bruce Rauner signed Executive Order 15-10 today to increase government transparency.
Under Executive Order 15-10, Rutan-exempt employees will be published on the Illinois Transparency and Accountability Portal (ITAP) website, finally giving the people of Illinois a way to easily find the state's political hires.
"The IDOT hiring scandal proved the public deserves a way to easily find out who are all the political appointees in state government." Gov. Rauner said. "We need to restore faith in state government if we expect the people of Illinois to help the government in its mission. This Executive Order is a first step towards earning back the people's trust."
The Executive Order also instructs the Illinois Department of Central Management Services (CMS) to assist units of local government in providing information about their employees for posting on the ITAP website.
"Taxpayers at every level of government deserve to know more about how their money is being spent," Gov. Rauner added. "The action we are taking today will help build a more open and accountable government."
