Yesterday, after Bruce Rauner urged Illinois legislative leaders to oppose Pat Quinn's push for an income tax hike vote during the lame duck session of the General Assembly, the Chicago Tribune reported that Quinn tried to walk back his recent comments:
Quinn on Monday declined to discuss the timing of his push to make the tax increase permanent, instead saying he'd work "with the legislature in the course of the fiscal year to make sure we have a balanced budget."
Nice try, governor, but we've seen this movie before -- four years ago. The people of Illinois deserve an air-tight assurance that you will not try to raise their taxes in your last gasp as governor following a Rauner victory in November.
So let's hear it, governor -- yes or no, if you lose the election, will you take any tax increase during the lame duck session off the table?
