Governor's Request for Agricultural Disaster Declaration Approved
By: Bruce Rauner
Date: Aug. 12, 2015
Location: Springfield, IL

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has granted the request of Governor Rauner for disaster designation in 87 Illinois counties and 14 contiguous counties that suffered losses due to rain and flooding this year.
"Illinois has suffered a lot of storm and rain damage throughout this Spring and Summer," Rauner said. "I am pleased our request for federal assistance was granted and encourage farmers throughout these counties to contact their local Farm Service Agency for questions."
The governor issued an official letter to USDA Secretary Vilsack on July 23, 2015. The 19 members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation also signed a letter to President Obama to endorse the governor's request for this designation. Counties eligible for assistance were determined through the Loss Assessment Reports reviewed by the USDA.
"I am grateful to all the members of our Illinois Congressional delegation for their strong and united support for securing this assistance for farmers throughout the state," Rauner added.
Farmers who believe they may be eligible for assistance should contact their county Farm Service Agency office. Loan applications are considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the extent of losses, security available and applicant's repayment ability. Farmers who have questions should contact the state FSA office at (217) 241-6600.
