Governor Rauner Takes Clemency Action
Press Release
By: Bruce Rauner
Date: Jan. 15, 2016
Location: Springfield, IL

Governor Bruce Rauner today granted five and denied 149 clemency petitions. A little more than 900 petitions remain from previous administrations.
The 154 clemency petitions Governor Rauner acted upon today are part of dockets dating back to July 2009. This is the seventh set of petitions the governor has reviewed since taking office. Each person granted clemency has recently undergone a criminal background check through the Illinois State Police's Law Enforcement Agencies Data System.
A granted clemency request for a pardon with expungement allows the petitioner to seek expungement of their conviction through the court system.
