Gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner and running mate Evelyn Sanguinetti today announced support from the agricultural community in Illinois.
The Agriculture Coalition consists of a broad range of members of the agricultural community who endorse Rauner for governor.
"Agriculture is the backbone of the Illinois economy," Rauner said. "Our farmers feed people around the world and help drive our economy. As governor, I will be a champion for Illinois agriculture -- reducing tax and regulatory burdens on family farmers and expanding agricultural export opportunities around the globe."
"Bruce Rauner is a visionary who has proven he can lead," said coalition co-chairman Len Corzine. "Family farms like ours need new leadership in Springfield."
"As a family farmer, I am excited about the prospect that a successful businessman like Bruce Rauner will be our next governor," echoed coalition co-chairman Donna Jeschke. "As a farmer, my family cannot easily move our business to some other state to escape the increasing regulatory and tax burdens that Illinois imposes on its family businesses. Only a thriving business climate can turn around our economically-stressed state. I believe that Bruce Rauner will work to create jobs, improve our infrastructure, and lessen government-inflicted regulations that impede the success of family businesses and rural Illinois. Not only will Bruce Rauner be good for Illinois farm families but for each Illinois citizen as well."
