Illinois has one of the most expensive state governments in America, yet we have the worst run government bar none.
Why?
Illinois has been completely taken over by special interest groups that get money from government. The lobbyists write the bills for special interests, the career politicians in both parties let it happen -- and we, the taxpayers, get left with the bill. It's time to make government work for us, not the other way around.
Government union bosses and trial lawyers run this state. They wholly own the Democrat Party, but they also own parts of the Republican Party, too. We don't like to talk about it, but it's true.
I'm not interested in a political career and don't need money from the special interests. As governor, I will take them on directly and bring accountability back to state government. To do that, we can:
*Push for term limits. No governor should be allowed to serve for more than 8 years, and the legislature should be term limited as well.
*Allow state workers to choose whether they want to join a government employees union, instead of being forced to do so.
*Control spending, because bigger government means more corruption.
