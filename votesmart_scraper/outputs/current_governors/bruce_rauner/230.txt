Breaking: Quinn in Court Filing Says No to Hiring Monitor, Stands by Cronies
Press Release

Pat Quinn told a federal court as far back as February 19, 2010 that he had taken "concrete and meaningful steps to abolish any prohibited use of patronage considerations in state employment."
Over the next three months, he made 17 illegal hires at IDOT alone, 12 of whom still work for the state today.
Yesterday, Bruce Rauner declared that if elected governor one of his first acts would be to sit down with Michael Shakman to clean up the cesspool at IDOT and submit to a federal hiring monitor to drain cronyism out of state government.
However, late last night, the Associated Press reported that despite all the recent revelations about patronage and cronyism at IDOT, Pat Quinn made a court filing fighting Shakman and any hiring monitor.
"This is a flagrant betrayal of the public's trust," Rauner said. "If Pat Quinn was willing to brazenly mislead a federal court, there is no reason to start trusting him now."
Protecting cronies, public deception, misleading the courts -- those are not supposed to be the actions of a governor.
Those are the actions of someone leading the outfit -- and make no mistake about it, Pat Quinn is leading a patronage and cronyism outfit in Springfield and Chicago.
