Bruce Rauner, who for months has called on Gov. Pat Quinn to allow a federal hiring monitor at the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), today issued the following statement after a federal judge confirmed that Pat Quinn cannot be trusted:
"A federal judge just confirmed what we've known all along -- Pat Quinn is corrupt and cannot be trusted to clean up state government. Pat Quinn is a phony reformer and a federal judge just confirmed it. I applaud today's decision and commit that my administration will work closely with the federal hiring monitor to root out Pat Quinn's patronage and corruption."
