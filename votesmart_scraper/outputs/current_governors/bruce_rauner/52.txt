Governor Bruce Rauner today released the following statement:

"This has been a long, grueling campaign cycle, both nationally and locally. For the good of the people of Illinois, let's put the election behind us. Let's come together and focus on the future and improving the quality of life for every family in our state.

"The people of Illinois deserve prompt, bi-partisan action to solve problems and get good things done -- to make Illinois more competitive so we can be more compassionate -- to enact truly balanced budgets along with reforms that grow more jobs and protect taxpayers.

"Now is the time to move forward together."
