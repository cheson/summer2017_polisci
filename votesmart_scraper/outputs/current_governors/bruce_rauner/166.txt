Governor Bruce Rauner issued the following statement following the House's vote to sustain his veto of SB 1229:
"I want to thank every House member who stood with taxpayers today. It is encouraging that many legislators recognized the dire financial impact this legislation would have had on our state.
While House members chose to help us avoid digging a deeper financial hole, we still have a lot of work to do and time is of the essence. We have now entered our third month without a balanced budget, which only the legislature can pass, and court orders have shown that I can't simply reduce the budget and balance it without legislative changes.
I hope today's action marks the beginning of serious negotiations over how we can deliver needed structural reforms and a balanced budget."
