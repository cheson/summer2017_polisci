Republican Bruce Rauner called on Gov. Pat Quinn Wednesday to disassociate himself from one-time chief of staff Jack Lavin, who has emerged as a central figure in both a patronage-hiring ethics probe and a federal investigation into a 2010 anti-violence grant program.
"He's part of the corruption in Springfield, part of the patronage of Springfield. He's under investigation. He is not cooperating with the investigation, and Pat Quinn has got to end the corruption by speaking out against what Jack Lavin is doing," Rauner told reporters.
The Winnetka Republican made his remarks at a joint campaign appearance with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, at a downtown Springfield sports bar a few steps from what once was Barack Obama's favorite capital city restaurant.
During a debate Tuesday, Quinn acknowledged that Lavin played a role in recommending patronage hires to the state Department of Transportation. Last month, a report by state Executive Inspector General Ricardo Meza questioned the legality of more than 250 hires into IDOT jobs in which politics wasn't supposed to be a factor under Quinn and imprisoned predecessor Rod Blagojevich.
Lavin, who left state government in 2013 and now is a lobbyist, also had his emails related to Quinn's failed Neighborhood Recovery Initiative anti-violence grant program subpoenaed in July by federal investigators probing the state grant program.
"I'm calling on Pat Quinn to speak out now, tell everyone in the admin, everyone in the General Assembly, "Do not speak to Jack Lavin.' We have to end lobbyists who come from the government, engage in corruption and then make more money engaging in the government process," Rauner said.
