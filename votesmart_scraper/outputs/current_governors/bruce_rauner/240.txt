Bruce Rauner today issued the following statement in response to Gov. Pat Quinn's declaration that he will "prevail" in his efforts to block Michael Shakman's request for a federal hiring monitor at the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT):
"Pat Quinn's comments are offensive to the hard-working people of Illinois who want to put an end to the Quinn-Madigan culture of corruption, cronyism and patronage. First Pat Quinn opposed our term limits proposal and now he is fighting tooth and nail to protect his patronage empire. It's time to show career politicians like Pat Quinn the door -- it's time to shake up Springfield and bring back Illinois."
Key Background Points on Pat Quinn's IDOT Hiring Scandal:
-The Better Government Association found one of the biggest agencies under Gov. Pat Quinn's control -- the Illinois Department of Transportation, or IDOT -- has been skirting federal hiring guidelines.
-IDOT jobs under Pat Quinn have gone to political insiders, not qualified workers.
-Famed anti-patronage attorney Michael Shakman is suing for access to documents and a federal hiring monitor to prevent more Quinn patronage.
-Pat Quinn refuses to turn over thousands of hiring documents and won't allow a federal hiring monitor.
-Bruce Rauner has called on Quinn to withdraw his motion in federal court and allow a federal hiring monitor at IDOT.
-The Illinois Executive Inspector General has asked to join the Shakman case in federal court and has suggested he is conducting his own investigation of illegal hiring practices under Quinn.
