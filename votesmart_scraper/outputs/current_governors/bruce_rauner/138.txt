Statement on HB 2990
Statement

Location: Springfield, IL

Governor Bruce Rauner issued the following statement today on the House's passage of HB 2990:
"Instead of considering any one of the real solutions that have bipartisan support to fund MAP grants and higher education, House Democrats passed a plan that isn't paid for. Only in Illinois is that considered "compromise'.
"Plain and simple, Illinois taxpayers cannot afford HB 2990. Instead of leaving town for a month, the House should continue to meet and focus on the real bipartisan solutions that have been introduced as fully funded bills, instead of voting on sham bills and continuing a crisis for political gain."
BACKGROUND A number of bills have been introduced that would achieve major taxpayer savings to pay for higher education and MAP grants. Governor Rauner supports any one of these pathways.
HB 6409
Bipartisan legislation sponsored by Rep. Dunkin, Rep. Phillips, Assistant Majority Leader Turner and Rep. Ford
Provides $160 million and $40 million in emergency assistance to public universities and community colleges, respectively.
Paid for by eliminating the repayment requirement on funds borrowed from other state funds in FY15.
HB 4539
Appropriates $1.6 billion to Illinois universities, community colleges and MAP grants.
To ensure a balanced budget, allows the Governor to reallocate funds and reduce spending in other areas.
Funding Bills Tied to Reforms That Achieve Taxpayer Savings
Procurement Reform (HB 4644/SB2400)
Pension Reform (Waiting for President Cullerton)
Workers' Compensation Reform (HB 4248/SB 2154)
Selling the JRTC (HB 4313/SB 2187)
Enacting some combination of these proposals can achieve savings to fully fund MAP grants and higher education.
