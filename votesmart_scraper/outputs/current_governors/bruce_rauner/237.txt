Press Release

Gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner and running mate Evelyn Sanguinetti today announced the launch of the Students for Rauner Coalition.
The coalition consists of students from a broad range of Illinois colleges and universities who endorse Rauner for Governor and are working to organize their campuses.
"Like all Illinoisans, our students are suffering under Pat Quinn," Rauner said. "Pat Quinn cut grant funding for students who need financial support while so many more face uncertain job prospects. Students deserve better and I'm excited to go to work for them."
"Bruce Rauner is a transformational candidate -- and he's running against a governor that broke his promises to young people across the state," said Daniel Zehe, a senior at the University of Illinois and Downstate Director of Students for Rauner. "Democrats, Republicans, Independents alike -- students are coming out in droves to support Bruce Rauner."
As part of the coalition roll-out, the Rauner campaign launched www.StudentsForRauner.com where students across Illinois can join the campaign to shake up Springfield and bring back Illinois.
