After the Illinois Supreme Court sided with Quinn-Madigan against nearly 600,000 Illinoisans who signed a petition to put term limits on the November ballot, Bruce Rauner's campaign for governor today launched a new television ad urging voters to hold Pat Quinn and Mike Madigan accountable for opposing Rauner's term limits initiative.
"Pat Quinn, Mike Madigan and the Springfield crowd don't care what you think -- they'll say or do anything to keep power," Rauner says in the new 30-second spot entitled "Kick." "They let term limits get kicked off the ballot, but come November it's our turn to kick them out of office."

"Term limits go to the heart of corrupt political self-dealing," Rauner spokesperson Mike Schrimpf said. "Term limits speak to a governor and a legislature who first promise that a massive tax increase on working families will be temporary, and then break that promise and try to make it permanent. Term limits speak to a governor and legislature who campaign as champions of public schools, and then break that promise and cut half a billion dollars out of public schools, resulting in teacher layoffs and crowded classrooms. And term limits speak to the newest Quinn-Madigan corruption revelations we've seen over the last few days -- from illegal patronage hiring to federal subpoenas to misuse of taxpayer funds."
