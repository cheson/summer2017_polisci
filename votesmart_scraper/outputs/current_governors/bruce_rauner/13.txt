Governor Discusses Changes To Get Illinois Back on Track
Press Release
By: Bruce Rauner
Date: April 17, 2017
Location: Moline, IL

Governor Rauner today joined the Quad Cities Chamber of Commerce and discussed working together to make changes to fix Illinois' broken system and increase job growth in the Quad Cities.
"The Quad Cities is an important region for Illinois. You encapsulate everything that is good about Illinois with a great location, hardworking people and a great infrastructure network," said Governor Rauner. "The Quad Cities have every reason to thrive and succeed, but the lawmakers in Springfield have been holding it back. We need real lasting solutions to protect taxpayers like a truly balanced budget, term limits and a property tax freeze."
Governor Rauner discussed the administration's efforts to bring economic growth into the region and transform Illinois. In December, Governor Rauner signed the Future Energy Jobs Bill. The administration worked with stakeholders, the General Assembly and the Quad Cities communities to keep high-quality jobs in Illinois and protect both taxpayers and ratepayers.
Currently, the administration is working to make Illinois more competitive for small businesses by cutting the administrative red tape, freezing property taxes and empowering local voters to decide when and if their property taxes go up.
The Quad Cities Chamber of Commerce has nearly 2,000 member businesses and is the largest business organization in the region. The vibrant community has a labor force of 588,000 people and is home to a number of Fortune 500 companies including John Deere and 3M.
