Rauner Calls on General Assembly to Vote on Constitutional Amendment for Term Limits in Fall Veto Session
By: Bruce Rauner
Date: July 25, 2016
Location: Chicago, IL

On the heels of a Cook County Judge ruling against putting a popular measure on the ballot that would create independently drawn legislative maps, Governor Bruce Rauner today reiterated his push for good government reforms including a call for the Illinois General Assembly to vote on a term limits constitutional amendment in the fall veto session.
Following his speech in Chicago, Governor Rauner will take his message directly to the people of Illinois on a two-day swing from Rockford to Mt. Vernon.
Remarks as prepared for delivery:
Over the past two years, the people of Illinois, Democrats and Republicans alike, have demanded reform. In 2014 the entrenched politicians holding power in Springfield ignored those demands. They used the Illinois court system to stop proposals for term limits and fair maps that could have led to the reforms the people want.
Term limits and fair maps would give the people of Illinois more control over our broken political system.
But the politicians holding power said no.
Last week they said no again. A lower court threw out this year's Fair Maps proposal that has the support of nearly 600,000 Illinois citizens, support from both Democrats and Republicans.
We cannot let this stand. The only way to overcome entrenched political power is for the people of Illinois to never give up, to keep pushing forward for reform. That's why we're here today.
