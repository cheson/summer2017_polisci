Press Release
By: Bruce Rauner
Date: July 1, 2015
Location: Springfield, IL

Governor Bruce Rauner today announced that residents affected by the June 22, 2015 tornado and severe weather that devastated parts of Grundy and Lee County will now have until December 31 to file tax returns that were due between June 22 and December 31 of 2015. The extended deadline will provide relief for individuals and local businesses trying to file their returns or payments on time while recovering from the storms.
"Now is the time for our impacted communities to heal and begin the slow process of recovery from these devastating storms," said Governor Rauner. "Once they have the chance to recuperate, families and businesses can gather the essential paperwork to file and pay their taxes."
Taxpayers who opt to mail their deferred returns and payments should write Tornado June 2015 on the outside of the envelope in red ink and on the top of each page of the tax filing, so the account can be updated and handled appropriately. Filers using MyTax Illinois or electronic filing methods are instructed to refer to the Illinois Department of Revenue's website: Tax.Illinois.Gov
