We are in a jobs crisis. Illinois has the worst unemployment rate in the Midwest and the second highest in the nation.
That's unacceptable.
Illinois is blessed with tremendous natural resources, world-class cities and towns, and dedicated, hard-working people. It's the politicians in charge of Springfield who are holding us back.
Our state's tax and regulatory environment is so anticompetitive that our state government hands out millions of dollars per year just to keep employers in Illinois. We should be out recruiting new businesses and jobs to Illinois instead of spending our time and resources struggling to hang onto the jobs we have.
We need to lower the cost of doing business in Illinois and make job creation our top priority. To do that, we can:
*Get rid of the Quinn-Madigan tax hikes and replace them with a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code that is fair to all taxpayers.
*Create Right-to-Work zones and allow local communities to decide whether workers must join a union in order to get a job.
*Enact tort reform and limit lawsuit abuse.
*Reform the workers' compensation system to make Illinois competitive with neighboring states.
