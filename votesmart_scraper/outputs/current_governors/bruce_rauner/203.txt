Governor Bruce Rauner signed Executive Order 15-12 today designed to help bring more economic opportunities to minorities and veterans.
"Illinois is an incredibly diverse state, and we benefit from that diversity," Gov. Rauner said. "But the unemployment rate for minorities and veterans is way too high. This Executive Order will help reveal some of the causes and identify ways to solve this injustice."
Executive Order 15-12 orders state agencies to require every labor organization, contractor or subcontractor that is party to a state contract to obtain and report within thirty days the total number of minority and veteran participants in any offered training program as well as the minority and veteran participation rate in said programs.
CMS is also ordered to conduct a thorough review of all goals, preferences and considerations provided under state law and regulations concerning the hiring and training of veterans and the awarding of contracts to veteran-owned businesses. CMS is also to study the participation of minority-owned and veteran-owned businesses' ability to obtain opportunities in the State of Illinois. The goal of the study is to identify any disparity in awards and make recommendations to fix those differences.
"We need to ensure jobs and business opportunities are open to everyone, but especially those who serve our country or are underrepresented in the economy," Gov. Rauner added. "I will be a governor who champions our veterans and historically-disadvantaged communities. This Executive Order will help give my administration the tools to do exactly that."
