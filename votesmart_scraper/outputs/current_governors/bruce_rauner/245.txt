Republican governor candidate Bruce Rauner on Tuesday sought to publicly pressure the Illinois Supreme Court to rule in favor of putting his term limit proposal on the November ballot, saying voters want a chance to weigh in on the idea.
But Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn's running mate, Paul Vallas, contended the proposal is constitutionally flawed as drafted because Rauner decided to "throw in the whole kitchen sink."
Rauner held a news conference a few blocks away from the Capitol with a deadline looming Friday for state election officials to certify what's on the Nov. 4 ballot. In June, a Cook County judge ruled Rauner's legislative term limit question invalid because it exceeded what citizens can put on the ballot. Last month, the Illinois Supreme Court declined to hear a direct appeal, and the case now sits before an appellate court, which has yet to rule.
The Republican challenger is in position to play the term-limit card whether it makes it on the ballot or not.
If justices rule it's constitutional, he can continue to tout the measure and spend more of his personal money to promote the referendum. If the question doesn't end up before voters, it plays into Rauner's message that Springfield needs reform. On Tuesday, the candidate provided a possible preview of a political argument "in the tragic case, the very sad case, that the court does not act in time for this to get on the ballot."
