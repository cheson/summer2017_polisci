Gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner today announced the launch of the Veterans for Rauner Coalition.
The coalition consists of Senator Mark Kirk, Congressman Adam Kinzinger and Illinois veterans who endorse Rauner for governor.
"As Americans, we owe everything to our veterans and I am proud to earn the support of so many Illinois veterans," Rauner said. "Veterans, like all Illinoisans, are suffering under Pat Quinn's record job losses, 67% income tax hike, runaway property taxes and broken education system. We need to shake up Springfield and bring back Illinois to ensure our veterans have the opportunities they deserve."
"Bruce Rauner is a strategic thinker and a proven leader who knows the challenges that Illinois service members, veterans, and family members face each and every day," said Dave Leckrone. "With his keen awareness of these challenges, Bruce is laser-focused on rebuilding the Illinois economy and importantly providing vocational and technical educational opportunities; and the essential supportive services for our Illinois veterans. This multifaceted approach will set up our Illinois veterans and their families for success."
"Our veterans gave everything to defend this country and the least we can do is make sure they have jobs when they return," Senator Kirk said. "We need a governor who will create job opportunities for Illinois veterans -- our veterans need Bruce Rauner."
Today's event was held at A Safe Haven where Bruce and his wife Diana have been involved for many years. The group works to fight homelessness and helps homeless veterans transition to a stage where they are employed, self-sufficient and maintaining permanent housing.
