Statement on Labor Relations Board Ruling
Statement
By: Bruce Rauner
Date: July 7, 2016
Location: Springfield, IL

The following statement is attributable to Jason Barclay, General Counsel to Governor Rauner:
"While we are disappointed in the result, we voluntarily agreed to these impasse proceedings with AFSCME and will continue to respect and follow the Labor Board's decisions throughout. This will hopefully also put an end to the reprehensible attacks that AFSCME has made against the independence and integrity of the administrative law judge and the Board."
