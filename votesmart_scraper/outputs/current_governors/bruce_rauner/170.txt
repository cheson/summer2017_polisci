Governor Bruce Rauner has issued the following statement on the Senate's decision to override his veto of SB 1229:
"Every Senator who voted to overturn our veto chose special interests over the taxpayers. They made it abundantly clear that they'd rather raise taxes than stand up to the politically powerful. It is now up to House members to take the responsible, pro-taxpayer position and uphold our veto."
