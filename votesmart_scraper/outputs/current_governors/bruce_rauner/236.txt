Bruce Rauner: "Illinoisans don't just pay a higher income tax under Pat Quinn, they pay a significant corruption tax too. This morning's IDOT patronage revelations are just one more reminder why we need term limits on career politicians like Pat Quinn. Our political system is broken. We need to shake things up."
As we wait to hear whether the Illinois Supreme Court will take up an emergency petition to rule on Bruce Rauner's term limits initiative, the Chicago Tribune this morning reports that the state's top ethics investigator found "Gov. Pat Quinn failed to rein in patronage abuses at the state transportation agency after replacing now-imprisoned Rod Blagojevich, and Quinn's directors repeatedly hired politically connected workers in violation of the rules, the state's top ethics investigator found."
