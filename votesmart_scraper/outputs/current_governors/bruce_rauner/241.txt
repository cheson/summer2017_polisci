Gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner and running mate Evelyn Sanguinetti today announced the launch of the Asian Americans for Rauner Coalition.
The coalition consists of a broad range of community and political leaders who endorse Rauner for governor.
"Asian Americans are an important and growing voice in Illinois," Rauner said. "As governor I am committed to not only providing more opportunities for Asian Americans here in Illinois, but also strengthening the relationship between Illinois and our partners throughout the Asia-Pacific region."
"We are tired of back room deals and red tape stifling small business owners except those who are politically connected," said Hamilton Chang. "High taxes and a labyrinth of momentum-crushing bureaucracies prevent us from efficiently re-investing the fruits of our hard work back into Illinois. I know that Bruce has the right vision, savvy, and determination to get Illinois back on track."
"Bruce Rauner supports business development and education for Asian Americans," said Lori Yokoyama. "He knows of the struggles of a business owner and the sacrifices we have made to give our families equal opportunity. The Asian American community needs to support Bruce Rauner!"
