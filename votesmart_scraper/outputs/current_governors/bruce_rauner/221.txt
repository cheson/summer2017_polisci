Bruce Rauner today welcomed the endorsement of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce, the largest broad-based business association representing businesses of all sizes and industry sectors in Illinois.
With today's announcement, Rauner has now been endorsed over Pat Quinn by three of Illinois' leading job creation groups: the Illinois Manufacturers' Association, the National Federation of Independent Business and the Illinois Chamber of Commerce.
"Job creators across the state share our vision of job creation and economic growth," Rauner said. "They want the Quinn-Madigan tax hikes rolled back. They want an end to Springfield's never-ending red tape. They want lawsuit reform and workers comp reform. And they want an end to Pat Quinn's corruption tax."
"When it comes to jobs and those who create them, Pat Quinn still doesn't understand what it takes to grow our economy," said Todd Maisch, president and CEO of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce. "Luckily, this election year presents us with a clear alternative -- a candidate with a vision to restore Illinois' mantle as the economic engine of the Midwest. Bruce Rauner will be a champion for Illinois job creation and we are proud to endorse him."
The Illinois Chamber of Commerce endorsement came during a visit to PM Mold, a more than 50-year-old Illinois business specializing in tooling, molding and prototyping.
