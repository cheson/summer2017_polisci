"While Pat Quinn's special interest allies are spending millions attacking me and trying to hijack the Republican primary, I'm taking the fight directly to Quinn. He's the worst governor in America and the people of Illinois are ready to sweep him into the dustbin of history," Rauner said. "Pat Quinn has failed on jobs, taxes, education and term limits -- that's why I'm running. I'll work to create a booming economy, reduce the tax burden, improve schools and enact term limits on the career politicians -- and I'll get the job done."
