Bruce Rauner issued the following statement regarding the news that former campaign manager and top White House aide for President Obama David Plouffe is joining ride-sharing company Uber:
"David Plouffe's first order of business should be to encourage Governor Pat Quinn to veto the anti-ride sharing bill pending right here in President Obama's home state. Ride-sharing companies like Uber are exactly the type of innovative companies Illinois should be welcoming and recruiting -- I know it and the President's top people know it. Pat Quinn should know it too."
