Bruce Rauner today released his latest proposal to improve the future of Illinois.
The Bring Back Blueprint: Education Reform outlines a bold plan to help Illinois build a world class education system.
"Education is the fundamental building block to improving opportunities for Illinois children," Rauner said. "A high-quality education is the key to economic empowerment, higher lifetime earnings and a competitive, world-class workforce. It's time we revamp, rethink and redo our approach to education in Illinois."
Key components of the plan include:
-Investing in our children
-Supporting great teachers
-Allowing more educational innovation
-Enhancing educational opportunities
-Reforming and reducing costly bureaucracy
-Reforms to make higher education more affordable

"Unfortunately, Pat Quinn is failing the children, parents and teachers of Illinois," Rauner said. "Our plan provides Illinoisans with a cradle to career approach that will strengthen education in Illinois and give all children here a brighter future."
