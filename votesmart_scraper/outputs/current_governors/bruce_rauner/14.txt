Governor Discusses Cutting Red Tape at Illinois Competitiveness Council Forum
Press Release

Location: Springfield, IL

Governor Rauner today discussed the administration's efforts to cut the red tape in state government and make Illinois more competitive with surrounding states at the Illinois Competitiveness Council Forum.
"Excessive red tape has been a barrier blocking small business and entrepreneurs from wanting to grow and expand in Illinois," said Governor Rauner. "That's why we created the Illinois Competitiveness Council nearly six months go to see where we can streamline and improve the restrictions in government."
Governor Rauner signed an executive order last year to form the Illinois Competitiveness Council and undertake a comprehensive review of the Illinois Administrative Code. The governor has directed the agencies working with the Illinois Competitiveness Council to reduce regulations by 20 percent. The Council led by U-Jung Choe will work with agencies from those areas to reduce regulatory burdens and cut the red tape.
"We are deeply committed to this mission. We will listen to all suggestions, make immediate changes when possible, and do all we can to advance Illinois' economic climate," said U-Jung Choe, chairwoman of the Illinois Competitiveness Council.
The Council solicited assistance from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University to analyze the Illinois Administrative Code to best understand where red tape existed, where to cut it, and how to improve Illinois' business climate. Illinois' current administrative code is significantly larger than a majority of states, according to the analysis by the Mercatus Center. Illinois has more than 259,000 restrictions that make up more than 15 million words.
