Statement on Failed Override of HB 580
Press Release

Location: Springfield, IL

The Office of Governor Bruce Rauner issued the following statement after the House of Representatives failed to override the Governor's veto of HB 580. This is attributable to Catherine Kelly, Press Secretary for the Governor:
"HB 580 was unprecedented and unaffordable, and simply another attempt by the Majority Party in the legislature to insert themselves into the contract process and put hard working families in Illinois on the hook for a $3 billion tax hike. The Governor thanks those members who took the pro-taxpayer position today, and believes it is now time to move forward and find compromise on a balanced budget with structural reforms that will put our state on the path to prosperity."
