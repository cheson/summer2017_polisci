Press Release
By: Bruce Rauner
Date: April 29, 2016
Location: Springfield, IL

Governor Bruce Rauner today submitted his statutorily-required Statement of Economic Interests as well as a Supplemental Statement of Economic Interests required by the governor's Executive Order 15-09.
When filling out his Statements of Economic Interests, the governor used a broad definition of "doing business in Illinois" to determine what to include. For example, the governor lists "Pittsburgh Steelers Sports, Inc." even though he owns a minority stake in the organization and the Steelers did not play a game in Illinois during the calendar year.
