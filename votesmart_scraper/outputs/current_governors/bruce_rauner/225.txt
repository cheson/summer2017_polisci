Rauner: Quinn Should Direct Staff and Agencies to Cease Communication with Former Chief of Staff

Illinois gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner today called on Governor Pat Quinn to direct his staff and agencies to cease communications with Quinn's former chief of staff and lobbyist Jack Lavin.
"Jack Lavin is the poster boy for cronyism and corruption in Pat Quinn's administration," Rauner said. "Governor Quinn should direct his staff and agency directors to cease communication with Lavin and urge legislators to do the same."
Just today it was reported that Lavin is a lobbyist for a medical marijuana company that is part of a selection process that is neither open nor transparent. Lavin is now at the center of the criminal investigation into Quinn's NRI slush fund but yesterday Quinn named him as the key player in the illegal hiring scandal at IDOT as well. Despite his central role in two ongoing investigations, Lavin is allowed to continue making money off his political connections and ties to Quinn.
"He is Pat Quinn's best friend, and Quinn not only kept him on after Blagojevich went to jail, he gave Lavin a promotion and made him his chief of staff," Rauner added. "Pat Quinn should do everything in his power to keep his closest associate away from taxpayer money. Cleaning up Springfield begins with sending the message that if you are involved in patronage or under federal investigation, you can't profit off your connections, even when your best friend is the governor."
Lavin previously worked for Tony Rezko, and it was Rezko who got Lavin his job with Blagojevich.
