Governor Rauner Extends Tax Filing and Payment Deadlines for Businesses and Individuals Impacted by Recent Tornado
Press Release
By: Bruce Rauner
Date: April 14, 2015
Location: Springfield, IL

Governor Bruce Rauner today announced that residents affected by the April 9, 2015 tornado and severe weather that devastated parts of DeKalb and Ogle County will now have until October 31 to file tax returns that were due in April of 2015. The extended deadline will provide relief for individuals and local businesses trying to file their returns or payments on time while recovering from the storms.
"These devastated communities should be focused on healing and recovery, not deadlines," said Governor Rauner. "Once families and businesses have had time to recuperate, they can gather the essential paperwork to file and pay their taxes."
Taxpayers who opt to mail their deferred returns and payments should write Tornado April 2015 on the outside of the envelope in red ink and on the top of each page of the tax filing, so the account can be updated and handled appropriately. Filers using MyTax Illinois or electronic filing methods are instructed to refer to the Illinois Department of Revenue's website: Tax.Illinois.Gov.
