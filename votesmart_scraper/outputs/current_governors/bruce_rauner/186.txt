Governor Bruce Rauner signed House Bill 3763 today making appropriations for General State Aid, Early Childhood Education, Bi-lingual Education and the Teachers' Retirement System.
Governor Rauner has always made clear that improving education is his highest priority. While the legislature's bill does not increase education spending by as much as the governor's proposal, it does increase K-12 education spending by $244 million and early childhood education funding by $25 million.
"Education is the most important thing we do as a community. I would have done more for our schoolchildren, but I am taking action today to ensure our teachers are paid and our schools are open and funded," Governor Rauner said. "I refuse to allow Speaker Madigan and the legislators he controls to hold our schools hostage as part of their plan to protect the political class and force a tax hike on the middle class without real reform."
As part of his budget plan, the governor proposed increasing K-12 education by $312 million and early childhood by $32 million.
