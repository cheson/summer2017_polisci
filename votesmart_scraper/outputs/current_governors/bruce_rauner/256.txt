"Illinois is a diverse state and one party doesn't have a monopoly on good ideas," said Rauner. "The people of this state need a leader who, rather than playing the politics of division, will work with Republicans, Democrats and Independents to bring back Illinois from the economic death spiral created by Governor Quinn." Since Tuesday's Primary Election, more than 20 community leaders have come together to form Democrats and Independents for Rauner.
"I know Bruce better than anyone. He is as compassionate as he is passionate and cares deeply about the people of Illinois," said Diana Rauner. "There's no doubt in my mind that he is a leader who will bring people together to create jobs and opportunities for a better life."
"As a longtime member of the Democratic Party, I'm taking a leave of absence from the Democratic Party's campaign for governor in November and will vote for Republican Bruce Rauner for governor," Newton Minow wrote in a letter published by the Chicago Tribune. "We need change, and Rauner will lead us in the right direction and improve the future for our families." "I have led many Democratic federal, state and local races, including serving as a member of the Democratic national finance committee, and I believe Bruce Rauner is a centrist who will stop the fiscal insanity in Illinois," said Manny Sanchez.
