U.S. Senator Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner today released the following statement on the U.S. Department of Energy's decision to end federal funding of FutureGen, the public-private clean coal project in Meredosia, Ill.:
"We are thoroughly disappointed in the Administration's decision to hastily end the bipartisan FutureGen project. This decision will block advancements in clean coal and more than 1,000 new jobs in Central Illinois. We will not give up on this state-of-the-art technology and bringing new jobs to the state."
