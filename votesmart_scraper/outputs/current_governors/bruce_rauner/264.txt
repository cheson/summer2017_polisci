The Quinn-Madigan 67% income tax hike.
Out-of-control property taxes.
A broken tax system. Giveaways for big businesses with no regard for the small businesses that are the jobs engine of our economy.
The result? Among the highest taxes in the nation and the worst unemployment in the Midwest.
We need to completely overhaul the tax code; not just tinker around the edges. To do that, we can:
-Get rid of the Quinn-Madigan 67% income tax hike.
-Get rid of the Quinn-Madigan 45% corporate tax hike.
-Ensure your property taxes never go up if the value of your home decreases.
-Overhaul the tax code so that is fair to all taxpayers.
