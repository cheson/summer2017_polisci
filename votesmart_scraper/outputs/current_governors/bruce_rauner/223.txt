Bruce Rauner announced today that he received the endorsement of the Illinois State Police Command Officers Association (ISPCOA). The endorsement is believed to be the first ever made by the ISPCOA in a governor's race.
"I have tremendous admiration for every member of our state police force. They are heroes who are willing to risk their safety for all of us, and they deserve the best in return," Rauner said. "I'm humbled and grateful to have the support of the State Police's top leaders with the endorsement of Illinois' Police Command Officers."
"Our Association strongly supports your effort to establish term limits for elected leaders in our state and sincerely appreciates your support of law enforcement and public safety," ISCPOA President James Alexander wrote in the endorsement letter. "We enthusiastically support your candidacy."
