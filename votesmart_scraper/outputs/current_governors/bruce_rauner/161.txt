"I want to thank General Assembly members on both sides of the aisle who helped craft and ensure reasonable and responsible compromises to the issues addressed today. As a result of their efforts, now we are able to move forward on providing child care for working families in a more financially-responsible way, and we are able to continue our long-term transformation towards better and community-based care for our seniors.

"This week, we were also able to reach an agreement on unemployment insurance reform so we can take a small step forward in our effort to make Illinois more competitive and grow jobs. I urge the legislature to act on this legislation as soon as possible and send the unemployment insurance reform bill to my desk.

"While we made progress today by working together, we did not accomplish all that we could, and the biggest issues remain. We still need major structural and economic reforms. We need term limits and a truly balanced budget. We need true, long-term property tax relief while finding ways to help school districts and local units of government. I know that not all of these are easy, but I'm confident we can accomplish a tremendous amount if everyone is willing to work together."
