Governor Greg Abbott today signed HB 1, the General Appropriations Act, into law. Upon signing the 2016-2017 budget, Governor Abbott released the following statement:
"I am proud to sign a Texas budget that cuts taxes, provides a record amount of funding to secure the border, improves our schools and builds more roads. This budget proves that government can control its spending while ensuring the essential needs of its citizens are met."
In order to further reduce our state's debt burden and restrain growth in government, Governor Abbott has vetoed nearly $233 million in discretionary spending and made over $295 million in overall reductions.
