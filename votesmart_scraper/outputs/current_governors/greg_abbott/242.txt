Governor Abbott Urges Texans To Use Energy Responsibly As Statewide Demand Grows
Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: Aug. 12, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today urged all Texans to use energy responsibly during peak hours -- between 3:00 PM and 7:00 PM -- to combat the growing statewide demand for electricity. For the first time since 2011, electricity usage in Texas has set a monthly record, and the state's electric grid will face continued stress as seasonably hot weather conditions are expected to persist. Adding to the stress on the electricity grid, several generation units have been forced out of service due to the persistent weather and high demands.
"I encourage all Texans to implement responsible energy practices," Governor Abbott said. "In order to mitigate stress on our state's electricity grid, Texans should take simple measures to save as much energy as possible."
