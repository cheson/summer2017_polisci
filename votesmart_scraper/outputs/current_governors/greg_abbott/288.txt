Governor Greg Abbott released a statement following the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' unanimous ruling that the State of Texas may require all but one abortion clinic to meet HB 2's requirements.
"This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women," said Governor Abbott. "I am pleased with the Fifth Circuit's decision to uphold HB 2 and the State of Texas will continue to fight for higher-quality healthcare standards for women while protecting our most vulnerable - the unborn."
