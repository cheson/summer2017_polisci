Governor Abbott Statement On WOTUS Withdrawal Proposal
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: June 27, 2017
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott released a statement after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced today that he will propose to withdraw the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. This rule was implemented under President Obama and allowed the Army Corps of Engineers to monitor irrigation ditches -- including on private land.
"As Attorney General, I was among the first to oppose this mandate that sought to take away rights from Texas landowners by regulating ponds and ditches on private property," said Governor Abbott. "Not only was the Waters of the United States Rule another Obama-era, job-killing regulation, it was an attempt by the federal government to usurp the power of the states and centralize it at a federal level. I applaud Administrator Pruitt for his action today in proposing that this unconstitutional rule be withdrawn."
In 2014, then Attorney General Abbott sent a letter to the Obama administration laying out his objections to this rule.
