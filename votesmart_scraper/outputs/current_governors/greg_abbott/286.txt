Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott has announced an elevated activation of the Texas State Operations Center (SOC) as a tropical system is expected to impact parts of Texas this week. Governor Abbott has also approved the use of state resources that have been staged for rapid deployment as needed to assist local officials during this significant weather event. Texans are also encouraged to prepare for severe weather in their area.
"As this tropical system develops, the state stands ready to provide support to communities as needed, and we urge Texans to closely monitor the changing weather conditions in their area and heed warnings from local and state officials," said Governor Abbott. "Any additional rainfall will exacerbate already saturated grounds, which could quickly lead to dangerous flash flooding and extended river flooding."
Current forecasts indicate the projected path of this tropical system is expected to begin impacting the Texas coast as early as Monday evening. Associated with this tropical system, there is the possibility of significant rainfall, flash flooding, large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes through at least Thursday. In preparation, the SOC -- in coordination with the Texas Emergency Management Council -- will continue to monitor weather conditions and coordinate with the National Weather Service, as well as coordinate state resources and assistance to local jurisdictions as needed.
