Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: March 18, 2016
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today requested Individual Assistance and Public Assistance for Orange, Jasper and Newton counties from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). If the request is granted by the President, affected citizens in these counties may be eligible for Individual Assistance grants of up to $33,000 from the federal government, and low-interest disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. If granted, and as further damage assessments are conducted in coordination with local officials, additional counties may be added as they meet their federally required thresholds for assistance.
"Texans have experienced enormous challenges in dealing with severe weather and rising floodwaters in the Southeast portion of our state," said Governor Abbott. "As Southeast Texas continues to face severe weather, it is imperative that Texans receive the vital assistance needed to begin rebuilding and restoring their communities."
