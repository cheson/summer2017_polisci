Statement
By: Gregory Abbott

Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today welcomed the U.S. Department of Defense's new Austin outpost of the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx). DIUx is an initiative that will connect the Department of Defense with hundreds of private sector entrepreneurs and firms to enhance the technological capabilities of the U.S. military while growing innovative enterprises in Texas. Austin joins Silicon Valley and Boston in hosting the DIUx outposts, which will give entrepreneurs and leading research institutions access to capital investment for technology startups.
"Texas is the new frontier in innovation, and with the arrival of DIUx, the Department of Defense's best technologists will be right here in Austin," said Governor Abbott. "A DIUx outpost in Austin leverages two of Texas' greatest strengths -- our enduring commitment to the mightiest military in the history of the world and our faith in the innovators who drive this thriving economy. I would like to thank Secretary Carter and the Department of Defense for bringing DIUx to Texas and recognizing the talent, innovation, and opportunity that the Lone Star State has to offer."
Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and University of Texas System Chancellor William McRaven announced the opening of the DIUx Austin outpost at the Capital Factory in Austin today, and highlighted opportunities for Austin-area innovators to engage and partner with the Department of Defense to develop cutting-edge technologies to address our nation's most pressing security challenges.
