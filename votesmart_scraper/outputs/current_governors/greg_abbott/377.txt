Texas Governor-elect Greg Abbott pledged quick action to President Barack Obama's immigration plans Thursday night, saying he is prepared to challenge it in court.
"President Obama has circumvented Congress and deliberately bypassed the will of the American people, eroding the very foundation of our nation's Constitution and bestowing a legacy of lawlessness,"Abbott, a Republican and the state's current attorney general, said in a statement.
"Texans have witnessed firsthand the costs and consequences caused by President Obama's dictatorial immigration policy and now we must work together toward a solution in fixing our broken immigration system," he continued.
"Following tonight's pronouncement, I am prepared to immediately challenge President Obama in court, securing our state's sovereignty and guaranteeing the rule of law as it was intended under the Constitution," Abbott concluded.
In a primetime address to the nation Thursday, Obama announced sweeping executive actions on immigration that will allow nearly 5 million people who have entered the country illegally to remain in the U.S. for three years without fear of deportation.
