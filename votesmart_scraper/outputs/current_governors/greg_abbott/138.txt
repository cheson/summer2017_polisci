Texas Governor Greg Abbott has announced that the Texas State Operations Center (SOC) will be elevated to Level 3 activation at 7:00 A.M.

State resources are available for rapid deployment as needed to assist local officials during this significant weather event. Texans are also encouraged to prepare for severe weather in their area.

"We urge all Texans to closely monitor developing weather as the state prepares for the possibility of heavy rainfall, tornadoes and flooding," said Governor Abbott. "It is crucial that Texans stay clear of rising waters and heed warnings from state and local officials, who stand ready to assist and support communities impacted as this weather system passes through Texas."

Current forecasts indicate the possibility of large hail, tornadoes and flooding rainfall. In preparation for these storms, the SOC -- in coordination with the Texas Emergency Management Council -- will continue to monitor weather conditions and coordinate with the National Weather Service.
