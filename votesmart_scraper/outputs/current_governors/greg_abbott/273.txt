Governor Abbott Statement On SCOTUS EPA Ruling
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: June 29, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today issued the following statement on the Supreme Court's decision to reject the EPA's regulations on power plants:
"The Supreme Court rightly held that the EPA violated the law when it imposed a multi-billion-dollar regulation on power plants without considering whether the cost was justified. While today's decision is good news for Texas, the EPA continues to push an agenda with little regard for the price tag these regulations would impose on employers and ultimately, Texans. Texas will stand ready to continue our fight against an over-bearing federal government that stands in the way of economic prosperity."
