Location: Austin, TX

At the request of the State of Florida and through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), the State of Texas today approved sending resources for disaster relief in preparation for Hurricane Matthew. These resources include Texas A&M Forest Service All-Hazards Incident Management Teams (AHIMT), which currently consist of 30 personnel and may be augmented as the situation develops. Other Texas state agencies are on stand-by to respond to any further requests from impacted areas.
Additionally, Governor Abbott has called Governor Rick Scott of Florida, Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia and Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina to offer any assistance as their states prepare to deal with Hurricane Matthew.
"As Hurricane Matthew prepares to impact the United States, it is crucial that our fellow Americans receive the assistance they need," said Governor Abbott. "I am confident that Texas' dedicated emergency response professionals will strengthen the disaster response efforts at a time when local resources may be strained. I ask that all Texans keep those in the path of Hurricane Matthew in their thoughts and prayers as they brace for the impact of this major hurricane."
EMAC is a state-to-state mutual aid system where the requesting state is responsible for the reimbursement of mission costs. For more information, visit http://www.emacweb.org
