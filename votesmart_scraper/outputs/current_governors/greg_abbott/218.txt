Governor Greg Abbott today issued a statement following the release of IBM's 2015 Global Location Trends Facts & Figures report, which named Texas the #1 state in the United States for foreign and domestic investment, based on number of jobs. IBM's annual report examines the factors, strategies and decisions that drive companies to relocate or locate new operations and facilities around the world.
"Texas is a state best characterized by its competitive advantage in diversity of talent, market and economic resources, and it's no surprise we've again been named a top state for investment," said Governor Abbott. "Unleashing the power of entrepreneurs and securing Texan's freedom to innovate and aspire has - and always will be - the model of success for the Lone Star State, and I'm confident Texas will continue to lead the nation."
According to the report, the United States is the top-ranking country for foreign investment measured by number of jobs, with Texas being the top individual state.
