According to recently released numbers from the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement, Texas not only ranked #1 in the nation for amount of child support collected, but also ranked #1 in the categories of cost effectiveness and amount of child support collected per employee under Attorney General Greg Abbott.
Greg Abbott has a reputation for protecting the well-being of Texas children through his diligent work with the Child Support Division of the Attorney General's Office.
Since taking office in 2002, the Child Support Division has collected more than $30 billion in child support payments. During the last fiscal year alone, Greg Abbott's office collected $3.6 billion.
While other parts of the country have been experiencing declines in child support collections since 2008, Greg Abbott has continued to protect the rights of Texas children:
Thanks to the hard work and dedication of Child Support Division employees, child support collections continue to increase in the State of Texas. This success not only helps children all across the State, but it also ensures that parents financially support their children -- not the taxpayers.
-Greg Abbott
As governor, Greg Abbott will continue his fight to better the lives of Texas children.
