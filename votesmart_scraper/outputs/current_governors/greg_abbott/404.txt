"Higher education is one of the best ladders to success," says Greg Abbott in the video. "The fourth part of my education plan focuses on getting more students graduating on time. We must increase online college learning opportunities and count successful completion of those courses toward degree requirementsÂ…We must help every Texan climb the ladder of success. For Texas to remain number one in the nation for job creation, Texas must become number one in the nation for higher education."
