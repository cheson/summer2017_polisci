In the upcoming special legislative session, Sen. Brandon Creighton and Rep. John Smithee will author pro-life insurance reform legislation. This is one of 20 items that Governor Abbott previously announced will be added to the special session agenda.
Governor Abbott issued the following statement applauding Sen. Creighton and Rep. Smithee for their leadership on this issue in the upcoming special session.
"No Texan should be forced to pay for insurance that covers elective abortions," said Governor Abbott. "As Governor, I will always fight to protect Texas values and ensure Texans are not coerced into funding a procedure that ends the life of an unborn child. I am grateful to Sen. Creighton and Rep. Smithee for working on this important issue, and look forward to this bill reaching my desk."
"No one should be forced to subsidize the cost of another's elected abortion," said Sen. Creighton. "As a pro-life state, we need to change our policies when it comes to health care. I am appreciative Governor Abbott has included protecting our unborn Texans in the upcoming special session and I look forward to leading on this important issue."
"This legislation is a matter of personal freedom for all Texans and a way to push back from an over-intrusive federal government," said Rep. Smithee. "I applaud Governor Abbott for placing this item on the special session agenda, and look forward to insuring its passage into law."
