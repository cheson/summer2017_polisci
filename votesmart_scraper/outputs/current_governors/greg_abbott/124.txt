Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: May 9, 2016
Location: Austin, TX

Chief Executive Magazine today announced that in its annual Best & Worst States for Business survey, Texas was rated the best state in which to do business for the 12th year in a row. Today's announcement follows the news last week of three companies that decided to relocate and expand their business operations in the Lone Star State.
"For the 12th straight year, CEOs across America have agreed there is no place better for conducting business than Texas," said Governor Abbott. "Our winning formula is simple - low taxes, reasonable regulations and investment in a quality workforce. As Governor, I will continue to promote policies that attract businesses looking to expand or relocate their operations, ultimately creating even more jobs and opportunity for Texans."
