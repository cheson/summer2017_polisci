Governor Greg Abbott today addressed the National Federation of Independent Business' (NFIB) Small Business Day Luncheon where he highlighted his plan to make Texas number one in the nation for women-owned businesses.

"Texas ranks #2 in the nation with over 740,000 women-owned businesses and #2 in the nation with Hispanic women-owned businesses. In Texas, we don't accept #2 rankings -- I want Texas to be #1 in the nation for women-owned businesses," said Governor Abbott. "As governor, I am focusing on growing the number of women-owned businesses in Texas by putting the Women's Commission under the Economic Development Division so the Commission is sharply focused on promoting and expanding our women-owned businesses and the jobs that they create."
