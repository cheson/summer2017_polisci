Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today appeared on Fox News Channel's Fox and Friends to discuss border security and Texas' plan to attract more jobs and businesses to the Lone Star State.
"I believe the Obama Administration has not done enough, which is exactly why Texas stepped up and began doing what the federal government has failed to do," said Governor Abbott regarding Texas' plan to secure the border. "This past legislative session, we passed the toughest border security program any state has ever had in the history of this country. One reason is so we can better crack down on cross border cartel-based activity."
Governor Abbott also took the opportunity to discuss the many reasons why Texas is the premier state to live and do business in.
"We just finished a legislative session where we cut taxes in Texas even more. We have no personal income tax, no corporate income tax and now we have cut the business franchise tax by 25%. We have sped up the permitting process and we are elevating our education system so that we will have the best workforce in the United States of America."
