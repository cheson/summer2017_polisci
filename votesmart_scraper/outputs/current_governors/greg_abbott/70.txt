Governor Greg Abbott today attended the launch of the Texas A&M Transportation Institute's Freight Shuttle System (FSS). The FSS allows cargo to travel on elevated platforms at sea ports, border crossings and other heavily congested areas in order to expand shipping capacity, expedite trade and reduce congestion on highways. Additionally, the FSS will enhance road safety, improve efficiency and significantly lower emissions and pollution. Governor Abbott was joined by Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp and Port of Houston Authority Executive Director Roger Guenther for the announcement.
"As we march forward into the heart of this century, Texas is fast becoming known as the home of innovation, and Texas A&M is demonstrating the central role that universities play in advancing that innovation," said Governor Abbott. "The Freight Shuttle System is another way that Texas is using emerging technologies to meet the increasing demands of the 21st century economy. I'm proud to join with Texas A&M as it once again reveals more than what we are today - it reveals what we can achieve tomorrow."
