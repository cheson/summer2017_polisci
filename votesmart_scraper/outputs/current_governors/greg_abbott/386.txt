Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: Oct. 28, 2014
Location: Austin, TX

Texans for Greg Abbott today released a new web ad, the second filmed during Greg Abbott's 25-city Get Out The Vote Tour. The web ad, titled "Crisscrossing The State" features footage of Texan and action hero Chuck Norris, who endorsed Abbott and is accompanying him on the campaign trail for several days during his tour.
"If you want to make sure that your values are represented in Austin, Texas, I need you to take personal responsibility in helping to achieve that goal," says Abbott in the video.
"I am Chuck Norris, and I want you to get out and vote for Greg Abbott," adds Norris -- and every Texan knows that when Chuck Norris says get out and vote, you get out and vote.
