Governor Abbott to Order National Guard to Carry Guns on Base
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: July 18, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott announced today he will authorize the Adjutant General John Nichols of the Texas National Guard to arm National Guard personnel at military facilities across Texas. This order comes following the recent shooting on two military facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee that resulted in the deaths of four United States Marines and one Navy Sailor.
"It is with a heavy heart that I issue this order," said Governor Abbott. "After the recent shooting in Chattanooga, it has become clear that our military personnel must have the ability to defend themselves against these type of attacks on our own soil. Arming the National Guard at these bases will not only serve as a deterrent to anyone wishing to do harm to our service men and women, but will enable them to protect those living and working on the base."
