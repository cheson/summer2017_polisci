Governor Greg Abbott issued the following statement in support of Attorney General Ken Paxton's decision to renew their efforts to seek emergency relief from Syrian refugees coming to Texas:
"In light of alarming comments made by the House Homeland Security Committee Chairman and testimony by the Deputy Director of Homeland Security at the Texas Department of Public Safety, it is essential that a judge consider halting the Syrian refugee process -- at least on a temporary basis -- to ensure refugees coming to the United States will be vetted in a way that does not compromise the safety of Americans and Texans."
