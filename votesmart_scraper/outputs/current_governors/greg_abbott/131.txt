Date: May 2, 2016
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today attended the Texas National Day of Prayer Breakfast in Austin where he delivered remarks and presented his official proclamation declaring May 5, 2016 the Texas National Day of Prayer. Following the Governor's remarks, coordinator Evelyn Davison led attendees in prayer.
Excerpts from Governor Abbott's Prepared Prayer Breakfast Remarks:
"These are trying times, and there is an urgent need to pray. America is at a time of crisis as some try to silence the faithful and purge God from the public square."
(...)
"We all know that we live in the greatest country in the history of the world. But we must also realize how our nation has become broken. Our nation was founded by the rule of law originally handed down by Moses. We have strayed from that law. We must come together to remain unbowed and respond to the challenges we face as a nation."
(...)
"We all have opportunities to hail God's greatness in our lives. We can use them to be a witness for God's grace, not just on prayer days like today, but every day. We must do this if we are to steer America back on course."
(...)
"We must never be shaken. America must never be shaken. As long as we build our fortress on the rock of God, America will never be shaken."
