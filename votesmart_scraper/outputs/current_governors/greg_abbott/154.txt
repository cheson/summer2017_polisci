Location: Austin, TX

Governor Abbott today announced that California-based Pegasus Foods will be expanding new operations to Texas. Pegasus Foods will construct a new, 80,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Rockwall, Texas in order to expand its food production capacity. The expansion is projected to create at least 325 jobs and $10 million in capital investment.
"Once again, a California company has decided there is no better place to grow and operate a business than the Lone Star State," said Governor Abbott. "Less government, lower taxes, smarter regulations and right-to-work laws create an economic framework that allows free enterprise to flourish and attracts employers to our large cities and small towns. Texas offers room to grow, and I look forward to welcoming even more businesses from California."
"We are excited to grow our business in the Lone Star State where the political leaders understand the importance of creating a business-friendly environment," Pegasus Foods Principal Jim Zaferis said. "We will proudly become part of the community of Rockwall and manufacture safe food of great quality while employing and improving the quality of life for our newly hired fellow Texans."
