Location: Austin, TX

The Texas Workforce Commission today announced that Texas added 7,100 jobs in the month of February, with the unemployment dropping to 4.3 percent, down from 4.4 percent in January 2015. Following the release, Governor Abbott issued the following statement:
"Texas continues to be a model for economic growth and prosperity across the nation. However, there is more we can and must do. I am working with the legislature to ensure we pass legislation that lowers the tax burden on businesses, guarantees long-term funding for transportation, and provides economic development opportunities -- including in higher education - to further diversify our economy. By implementing these changes, Texas' economy will continue to flourish and create even greater opportunity for all Texans."
