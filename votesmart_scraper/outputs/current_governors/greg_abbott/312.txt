Texas Governor Greg Abbott has announced an elevated activation of the Texas State Operations Center (SOC) as severe storms are expected to impact parts of Texas through early next week. State resources are available for rapid deployment as needed to assist local officials during this significant weather event, and Texans are also encouraged to prepare for severe weather in their area.
"We urge Texans to closely monitor the changing weather conditions in their area and heed warnings from local officials, as these storms have the potential to bring dangerous flash flooding, damaging winds and hail, and the possibility for tornadoes." said Governor Abbott. "Ensuring the safety of Texans is paramount, and the state stands ready to provide support to our local leaders as this weather system moves through our state."
Current forecasts indicate the possibility of severe thunderstorms, large hail, damaging winds, flash flooding and tornadoes across the state through Tuesday. In preparation for these storms, the SOC -- in coordination with the Texas Emergency Management Council -- will continue to monitor weather conditions and coordinate with the National Weather Service.
