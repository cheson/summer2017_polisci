Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott spoke this morning with Peter St. James in New Hampshire on WTPL's, "The Pulse" radio program to discuss New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan's decision last week to veto a budget that included business tax cuts. In the interview, Governor Abbott highlighted the recent tax cuts passed by the Texas legislature and invited New Hampshire businesses to relocate to Texas, where we are wide open for business.
"Texas has been known as a great place for doing business before this legislative session," Governor Abbott said in the interview. "But now, I am able to go across the country and tell employers that Texas has no personal income tax, no corporate income tax and we just cut our business franchise tax by 25 percent. I look forward going out and selling this model to businesses across the nation."
