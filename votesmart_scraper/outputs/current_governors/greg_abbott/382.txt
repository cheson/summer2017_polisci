Location: Austin, TX

As millions of voters across Texas head to the polls on Election Day, Texans for Greg Abbott released a new web ad encouraging everyone to get out and vote. The web ad features footage from Greg Abbott's statewide Get Out The Vote Tour, which concluded Monday evening.
"Speeches don't win elections, TV ads don't win elections -- I need you to go cast that vote," says Greg Abbott in the web ad. "I want to emphasize to you the magnitude of the challenge that we're dealing with right now: Barack Obama operatives are organizing across the state of Texas for the purpose of turning Texas blue. We must work together to ensure we turn out the vote, to ensure that we keep Texas the best state in the United States of America."
