Governor Greg Abbott today signed Senate Bill 788 (Eltife, R-Tyler; Paddie, R-Marshall), also known as "Kari's Law" , to require direct dialing of 9-1-1 from multi-line telephone systems across the state. Governor Abbott was joined by members of Kari's family at a signing ceremony hosted in the Governor's Public Reception Room.
"There's a lesson virtually every parent teaches their child -- if you face an emergency, call 9-1-1," Governor Abbott said. "I am signing Kari's Law to ensure that whenever there is an emergency, any child and any adult who dials 9-1-1 is going to be able to connect with emergency personnel to ensure they come to the rescue of those who need help the most. Today cements in history the important role Kari Hunt has played and I'm thankful for her and her family in changing the course of the future of the State of Texas."
