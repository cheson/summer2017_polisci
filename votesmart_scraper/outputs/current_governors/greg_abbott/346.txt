Location: Austin, TX

The Texas Workforce Commission today announced the addition of 20,100 jobs in January 2015 and an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, down from 4.6 percent in December 2014. Governor Greg Abbott released the following statement:
"The State of Texas is continuing to lead the nation in job growth by leveraging our state's greatest natural resource -- the people of Texas who've developed an incredibly robust and resilient economy. And while the January job numbers are a testament of the strength of Texas' economy, there is more we must do to boost our job market beyond our borders and compete on the global stage. By diversifying investments, streamlining regulations and reducing the business franchise tax, we will cultivate an even stronger, more effective economy where all Texans are afforded the opportunity to innovate and to prosper."
