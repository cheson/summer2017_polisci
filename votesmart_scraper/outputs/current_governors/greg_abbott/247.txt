Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: Aug. 3, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott responded to President Obama's announcement today of an environmental rule imposing steep cuts on greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants.
President Obama continued his unilateral executive overreach by seeking to take unprecedented control over each state's power market through his new environmental regulations," said Governor Abbott. "Not only will this rule result in higher energy prices for consumers, it will cost thousands of jobs. As we have in the past, Texas will lead the fight against an overreaching federal government that seems hell-bent on threatening the free-market principles this country was founded on."
