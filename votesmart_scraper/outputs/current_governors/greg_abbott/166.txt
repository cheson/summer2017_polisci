The Office of Governor Greg Abbott today released its first "Report to the People of Texas," which highlights the shared successes of Texas during the Governor's first year in office. The report takes a look at the economy and businesses that expanded or relocated to Texas, in addition to providing an overview of legislation passed to cut taxes, improve Texas' public and higher education systems, build new roads, secure our border and chart a course that keeps the Lone Star State a beacon of individual liberty and economic opportunity.
"The promise of the future knows no bounds, and the Lone Star State remains the best place to raise a family, build a business and create a better life," said Governor Abbott. "The true secret to the robust strength and resilience of the Texas economy is our greatest natural resource: the hardworking people of Texas. It is a privilege to serve the people of this great state, working by your side to ensure the future is bigger and brighter for generations to come."
The report also spotlights the dedication of Texas' law enforcement officers and first responders, our men and women in uniform and everyday Texans who help make our state the envy of the nation.
