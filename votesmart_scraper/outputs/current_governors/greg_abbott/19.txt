In the upcoming special legislative session, Rep. Craig Goldman and Sen. Kelly Hancock will author legislation to crack down on mail-in ballot fraud. This is one of 20 items that Governor Abbott previously announced will be added to the special session agenda. Governor Abbott issued the following statement applauding Rep. Goldman and Sen. Hancock for taking on this issue and making it harder for this crime to be committed.
"The right to vote is sacred in this country, and ensuring the integrity of the ballot box is one of the most fundamental functions of government," said Governor Abbott. "I prosecuted countless cases of mail-in ballot fraud as Attorney General, but the problem continues to exist today. I applaud Rep. Goldman and Sen. Hancock for their commitment to strengthen penalties for those who undermine the integrity of our elections. I look forward to working with them and members of both chambers to ensure mail-in ballot fraud legislation reaches my desk."
"Protecting the integrity of our elections is of the utmost importance," said Rep. Goldman. "That is why I am proud to work alongside the Governor during the special session and sponsor legislation that will put an end to mail-in ballot fraud."
"In North Texas, we have a real problem with mail-in ballot fraud--as evidenced by the massive investigation underway at the Dallas County District Attorney's Office," said Sen. Kelly Hancock. "We must address this problem and that's why I will file legislation during the special session to crack down on mail-in ballot fraud".
