As Governor Abbott prepares to deliver his State of the State address, the Office of the Governor today released a web video featuring Texans talking about the issues they want to hear Governor Abbott discuss in Tuesday's speech. In the video, Texans talk about improving education, growing jobs, building better roads and helping Texas veterans. Each of these issues are key components of Governor Abbott's Bicentennial Blueprint policy plan, which forms the foundation of the agenda he will detail in the State of the State.
"I have spent the last two years traveling across our great state, hearing from thousands of Texans about the challenges they face and the solutions they want to see from their leaders," said Governor Abbott. "I have cast a vision to address those challenges to provide greater opportunity for all Texans; tomorrow, I will chart a course to make my vision a reality as I lay out my agenda for this legislative session. I look forward to working with each and every legislator to ensure that even the future is bigger in Texas."
