Governor Greg Abbott released the following statement after another video featuring Planned Parenthood's Houston Gulf Coast Clinic surfaced:
"The latest video showing Planned Parenthood's treatment of unborn children in a Houston clinic is repulsive and unconscionable. Selling baby body parts is the furthest thing imaginable from providing women's healthcare, and this organization's repeated and systematic disrespect for human life is appalling. The State of Texas is aggressively investigating this matter and must use all available legal remedies to address this depraved conduct."
