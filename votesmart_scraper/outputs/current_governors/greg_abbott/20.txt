As Tropical Storm Cindy approaches the Gulf Coast, Governor Greg Abbott today ordered the State Operations Center (SOC) elevate its readiness from level four (normal conditions) to level three (increased readiness) starting at 12:00 p.m. on Wednesday, June 21st. Additionally, Governor Abbott has activated four Texas Task Force 1 boat squads and two Texas Military Department vehicle squads (5 vehicles each) to respond to any emergencies that may occur as a result of Tropical Storm Cindy. The Governor has also placed the Department of State Health Services Emergency Medical Task Force, Texas Military Forces Aircraft, and shelter and feeding teams on standby.
"I have directed Texas emergency personnel to prepare to respond as Tropical Storm Cindy prepares to make landfall along the Gulf Coast," said Governor Abbott. "As we have learned in the past, weather patterns can change rapidly and without warning. That is why I am imploring all Texans in the Gulf region to stay updated and heed warnings from your local officials, avoid high water areas and refrain from attempting to drive through roadways or over bridges that have the potential to flood. We stand ready to assist local communities in the event of an emergency, and I ask all Texans to keep those in the storm's path, and our brave first responders, in their prayers as they prepare for this storm."
Other state resources currently engaged in the emergency preparation effort include:
Texas Department of Public Safety
Texas Department of Transportation
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
Texas Parks & Wildlife Department
Texas Department of State Health Services
Texas Public Utility Commission
Texas A&M Forest Service
Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX)
