Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today invited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to come to Texas and review Texas' Zika Virus Preparedness and Response Plan. Last week, Governor Abbott participated in a conference call hosted by the White House to discuss strategies to address the Zika threat and efforts to combat the virus.
"Like the CDC, the State of Texas, along with our local partners, is taking steps to prevent and prepare for local transmission of the Zika virus," Governor Abbott writes in the letter. "With the benefit of the CDC assets on the ground in Texas working with DSHS and our Task Force on Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response, we can ensure that we are developing and implementing the strongest possible Zika virus response."
Governor Abbott also urged the CDC to move swiftly to approve the Texas Department of State Health Services funding requests for three important projects to assist in funding Texas' Zika response plan:
$1.5 million to support Zika preparedness and response efforts
$360,000 to support Zika-related birth outcomes surveillance
$9.2 million to strengthen epidemiology and laboratory capacity and improve health information systems
