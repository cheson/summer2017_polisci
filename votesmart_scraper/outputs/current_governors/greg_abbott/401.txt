On this 13th anniversary of September 11th, let us honor and remember the innocent lives that fell victim to the evil attacks of that day.
Today, we express our deepest gratitude to the brave men and women who have put their lives on the line to ensure the United States of America remains a beacon of freedom that even the most heinous acts cannot extinguish. We will never forget the lives that were lost, and we are forever indebted to their courage and sacrifices.
As a nation, we were challenged that day -- and we were ultimately brought closer together.
Thirteen years later, let us renew that unity, reflecting on the values that tie our nation and our communities together.
And as Americans, let us never take for granted the price of freedom.
God Bless,
Greg Abbott
