Safeguarding against the overreaching and unlawful regulations that the EPA has attempted to impose upon Texas, Greg Abbott has repeatedly defended Texas' environmental protection laws against the federal government. Greg Abbott's rejection of federal infringement on our sovereignty has saved Texas jobs, and his enforcement of environmental laws have helped keep Texas' water pure, air clean, and surroundings safe for Texas families.
As Texas has proven in other lawsuits against the EPA, this is a runaway federal agency that must be reined in. The EPA's job-killing regulations impose burdensome costs and economic hardships on employers in Texas and across the country, threatening the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working Americans.
In response to the EPA, the state of Texas has filed numerous legal actions challenging the EPA's illegal regulatory scheme. Since March 2012 alone, federal courts have ruled against the EPA and in favor of Texas in three separate lawsuits.
