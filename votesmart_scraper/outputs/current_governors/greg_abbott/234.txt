Governor Abbott Sends Letter To Texas Congressional Delegation Urging Opposition To Iran Deal
Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: Sept. 1, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Ahead of Congress' return from recess next week, Governor Greg Abbott today sent a letter to each member of the Texas Congressional Delegation urging them to vote against President Obama's deal with Iran and reaffirm the United States' support for Israel.
Governor Abbott also declared the State of Texas' intention to continue its efforts in prohibiting public investment in Iran and called on private enterprises to follow suit should a deal pass.
"Entering into an agreement with a country that consistently calls for "death to America' and expecting them to live up to this deal is not only short-sighted, it is turning a blind eye to geopolitical realities," Governor Abbott writes in the letter. "I call upon the Texas Congressional delegation to reject President Obama's deal with Iran, reaffirm our nation's support for Israel, and uphold states' rights to prohibit investment that would benefit Iran."
