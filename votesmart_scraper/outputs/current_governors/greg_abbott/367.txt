Governor Abbott Statement on Prosecution of Governor Perry
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: Jan. 27, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today released the following statement regarding the decision to allow legal proceedings against former Governor Rick Perry to move forward:
"The Texas governor is endowed by our Constitution with the authority to veto legislation, and it is outrageous and inappropriate that a Governor would be prosecuted for exercising that authority. The continued legal proceedings against Governor Perry conflict with the authority granted to all Governors by the Texas Constitution, and I trust they will be ultimately resolved in a manner consistent with the Constitution."
