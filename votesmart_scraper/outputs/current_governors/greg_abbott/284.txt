Governor Greg Abbott today visited the Texas State Operations Center (SOC) to receive a briefing on state resources being dispatched to areas impacted by inclement weather. The Governor's visit follows Monday's elevated activation of the SOC, and his decision to stage resources for the rapid deployment to assist local officials as Tropical Storm Bill made landfall in Texas. Additional resources may be activated as the situation develops.
"I want to express my deepest gratitude for the first responders across the State of Texas who have done a tremendous job in the face of this challenge," said Governor Abbott. "Because of their swift response in dealing with the challenges that have quickly arisen, we've done a very effective job of saving lives, and we will continue to do the very best we can to reduce any kind of damage to property. I urge all Texans to closely monitor the changing weather conditions in their area and heed warnings from local and state officials."
During the briefing, Governor Abbott was informed of the latest developments in the state's coordinated response to this tropical disturbance including local cleanup efforts, power/utility issue resolution and providing resources to local officials amidst ongoing recovery efforts.
Attendees at the Governor's briefing included the Department of Public Safety, Texas Division of Emergency Management, Texas Department of Transportation, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, National Weather Service/West Gulf River Forecast, Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service Task Force-1, Texas Military Forces, Texas A&M Forest Service, Public Utility Commission and the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department.
