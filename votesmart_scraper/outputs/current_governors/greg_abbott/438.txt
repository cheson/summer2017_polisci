Texas' greatest freedom enumerated in our Constitution is the Tenth Amendment.
This country is seeing a federal government that aggressively intrudes into our personal lives, our businesses, and our bank accounts--completely disregarding the powers delegated to the states by the United States Constitution.
To combat an overreaching federal government, Greg Abbott has filed 29 lawsuits against the Obama Administration to protect Texas' sovereignty.
From the EPA to ObamaCare, Greg Abbott has challenged every attempt by the federal government to erode our states' rights. He has led Texas to resounding legal victories that shield our state laws and ensure that our Tenth Amendment rights are not infringed upon.
Greg Abbott will relentlessly continue to make sure that Texas' constitutional rights are never held hostage by the federal government.
