Governor Greg Abbott today appeared on Fox News' "Fox & Friends" to discuss National Security and the Texas-Israeli relationship. Governor Abbott also discussed his recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Texas' continued divestment in Iran.
"I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that his strongest ally in the globe is the State of Texas," said Governor Abbott. "I have instructed all state agencies in the State of Texas to either divest or to not invest in any type of Iranian business so we can continue to fight back against those who declare America as their enemy, such as Iran, while we also build a closer relationship with our strong ally, Israel."
Governor Abbott also appeared on Fox Business Network's "Varney & Co." to discuss the Texas Economy and his push to bring more business to Texas while participating in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
"We learned during the downturn in the 1980s the importance of diversifying, and that is actually one thing that I'm doing here at Davos," said Governor Abbott. "Mark my words, in 5 to 10 years, Texas is going to be the home of innovation."
