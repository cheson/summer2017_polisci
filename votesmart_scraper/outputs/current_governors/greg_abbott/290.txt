Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: June 3, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

The Office of Governor Greg Abbott today released a web video highlighting Governor Abbott's transportation funding initiative, which he named as an emergency item this legislative session, and the resulting legislation enacting his plan to build more roads without raising fees, taxes, tolls or debt. The Governor signed several bills on Wednesday that will implement his initiative and stated his support for SJR 5, which, if approved by voters this November, will represent the single largest increase in transportation funding in Texas history.
"Not only are we dedicating more money to building roads, we're also ending diversions and as a result, providing greater transparency," said Governor Abbott. "This legislation will have a tremendous and positive impact on the lives of people across the State of Texas."
