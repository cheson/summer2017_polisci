Governor Abbott Meets With Senators McConnell, Cornyn And Cruz To Discuss Texas Response To EPA Overreach
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: May 26, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Texas Governor Greg Abbott today met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz in Washington, D.C. to discuss the federal Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed "Clean Power Plan," as well as other forthcoming EPA rules, and their grave consequences for the State of Texas.
"The EPA's latest attempt at imposing burdensome regulations represents an unprecedented meddling with Texas in order to push the Obama Administration's liberal climate change agenda. The EPA's newest suite of rules, led by the Clean Power Plan, seeks unprecedented control over the State's energy mix that will certainly result in higher energy prices for Texans and will threaten the reliability of Texas' electric grid," said Governor Abbott. "During my conversation with Senator McConnell today, I, along with my fellow Texas leaders, expressed grave concerns that the EPA's proposed action will burden Texas far more than any other state, killing jobs and stagnating Texas' unprecedented economic growth, and I offered my full support for his efforts to fight this federal government overreach."
Governor Abbott has repeatedly acted to defend Texas sovereignty against EPA overreach. As Texas' Attorney General, Governor Abbott consistently took legal action to reign in an out-of-control EPA. Since taking office as governor he has signed on to a multi-state letter calling on the agency to refrain from issuing new ozone standards that would stifle economic growth and job creation, and submitted comments challenging the EPA's proposed "regional haze" rule as unlawful and unconstitutional.
