Democratic Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi infamously said about ObamaCare that, "we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it." Congresswoman Pelosi was right, and now Texas and the rest of America are beginning to see the consequences -- from rising healthcare costs to businesses being forced to lay off employees.
Greg Abbott knew this was a bad law from the beginning. So on the day ObamaCare was signed into law, he filed a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality. The Supreme Court agreed with General Abbott that Congress illegally tried to seize the states' Medicaid systems. Although, the Supreme Court upheld other onerous parts of ObamaCare, General Abbott has not given up the fight. He continues to challenge this unworkable law and the unprecedented tax it imposes on Americans.
