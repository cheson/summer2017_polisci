Governor Greg Abbott today announced that GM Financial will expand operations in Texas by building a financial servicing center in San Antonio, Texas. This project is expected to create at least 490 jobs and at least $20 million in capital investment in the State of Texas. A Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF) grant offer of $2.5 million has been extended to GM Financial.
"Texas is proud that GM Financial has chosen San Antonio as the home of its next financial servicing center," said Governor Abbott. "Thanks to our low-tax, low-regulation environment, GM Financial will be creating nearly 500 jobs and investing tens of millions of dollars in the Texas economy. As Governor, I will continue to pursue policies that encourage this type of investment with the goal of making Texas an even better place to live, work and raise a family."
