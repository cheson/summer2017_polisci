GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: TEXAS GOVERNOR-ELECT AND STILL THE STATE'S ATTORNEY GENERAL, GREG ABBOTT, insisting he will sue President Obama over his executive action on immigration. Governor-elect and current attorney general, Greg Abbot, joins us. Good evening, sir.
GREG ABBOTT, TEXAS GOVERNOR-ELECT: Good evening, Greta.
VAN SUSTEREN: Sir, tell me, what's the difference? Two Republican presidents have done essentially the same in terms of granting amnesty or not deporting someone, and the president has prosecutorial discretion on who he prosecutes, who -- as the head of the executive branch. So what's wrong with what he is doing compared to the others?
ABBOTT: Well, you raised two issues. Let me try to answer them both. First, with regard to other presidents doing this in the past, one, remember, no one ever filed a legal challenge about those issues so no court ruled on it. However, I can tell you there is a difference. The difference is both the Presidents Reagan and Bush were executing laws that were passed by the United States Congress when they issued those executive -- those executive orders.
What President Obama is doing is he is issuing an executive order because Congress will not pass a law. That's completely different. As it concerns the prosecutorial discretion, understand this, while the president or his attorneys may have the discretion whether or not to prosecute someone, they don't have the authority to give rights to people they are not prosecuting and put burdens on other agencies to carry out all these orders. So this is, as you know, far from prosecutorial discretion.
