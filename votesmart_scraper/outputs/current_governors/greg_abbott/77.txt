Governor Abbott Statement On Texas Voter ID Law
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: July 20, 2016
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today released the following statement on the 5th Circuit Court's Voter ID ruling:
"The 5th Circuit rightly reversed the lower court's finding of discriminatory purpose, but wrongly concluded the law had a discriminatory effect. Voter fraud is real, and it undermines the integrity of the election process. As Attorney General I prosecuted cases against voter fraud across the State, and Texas will continue to make sure there is no illegal voting at the ballot box."
