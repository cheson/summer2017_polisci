It's been an honor to serve as your Attorney General, but now I am ready to fight for the future of Texas as the next governor of the Lone Star State. But none of this happens without you. It takes one thing, and that is votes -- we need your votes. Election Day is happening right now today. Working together as an entire team, we will keep Texas the best state in the United States of America.
-Greg Abbott
