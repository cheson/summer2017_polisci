Texas is the envy of every other state.
Let's make sure it stays that way, building on our Texas values to make our state even better.
We are entering the final month of this campaign, and I need your support to help us across the finish line.
There is so much as stake, and we have to protect the values that have made Texas a beacon for job creation and economic prosperity.
Today, I am asking you to join my team as we gear up for the final days of this campaign. Every contribution gets us closer to the goal post.
Can I count on you?
Sincerely,
Greg Abbott
