Governor Abbott Statement On Latest Planned Parenthood Video
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: July 21, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Following the release of another video showing a Planned Parenthood official detailing disturbing abortion procedures, Governor Greg Abbott issued the below statement:
"This latest video showing yet another Planned Parenthood senior official negotiating the price of unborn baby body parts is more than just callous and morally bereft, it may be criminal. The video appears to directly contradict Planned Parenthood's statement last week that they do not earn a profit for selling body parts. Today's new grotesque revelations necessitate that Texas expand its investigation into this abhorrent practice."
