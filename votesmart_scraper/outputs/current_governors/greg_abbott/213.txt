"These valiant warriors, like the generations before them, have fought and bled for our nation, our values and our freedoms, and we are eternally grateful for the sacrifices they have made. On behalf of the State of Texas, I express my sincerest gratitude to these soldiers and to all of the brave men and women who have served our country, worn the uniform with honor and who have courageously placed themselves in harm's way on our behalf."
