Issue Position

General Abbott has sought stricter oversight of public pension funds in order to protect retirees and taxpayers. He urged pension boards to ban fund trustees and managers from working for companies doing business with the boards, require registration of pension fund actuaries, and require boards to have at least one member with investment expertise. Sound public pension funds avoid taxpayer bailouts.
