We must do more.
Because of the Obama Administration's failure to act, the State of Texas will take all action possible to secure our border, recoup the costs to Texas taxpayers and keep our communities safe. But there is more we must do.
That's why I unveiled my proposals to increase penalties for human smuggling today, as part of my Securing Texans plan.
Organized criminal networks are playing a significant role in the border crisis, directly putting lives at risk. And human smugglers are profiting, at great costs to their victims.
Human smuggling is not a victimless crime. One more life lost is too many.
It's time for this lawlessness to end. For more than a decade, my office has aggressively fought the cartels and gangs who profit from human smuggling. And as governor, I will strengthen our state laws to deter these criminal enterprises and protect all Texans.
We must greatly increase the risks for smugglers and cartels. My plan will increase penalties for smugglers that commit heinous crimes, add new offenses related to smuggling, and update the definition of human smuggling to reflect the reality on the ground.
As governor, I will make the safety and security of Texans my top priority.
