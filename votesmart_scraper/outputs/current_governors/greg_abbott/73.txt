Press Release

Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today sent a letter to President Obama urging his administration to immediately approve the expenditure of funds for Zika virus preparedness and response. In the letter, Governor Abbott expressed concern that money for Zika preparedness and response is not flowing quickly enough to the state and local health departments. Governor Abbott asked the president and his administration to dispense a meaningful portion of the approximately $400 million available to sufficiently combat against the growing threat of Zika in Texas.
"In light of the mosquito-to-human transmission of the Zika virus in Florida -- and rising concerns about Zika in Texas -- it is imperative that the federal government act now to free up whatever funds are available to combat Zika," Governor Abbott writes in the letter. "I express this sentiment not only on behalf of the State, but also on behalf of local government leaders seeking relief and protection from Zika. We request that immediate aid be provided to combat the spread of Zika and, in turn, protect our fellow Texans."
