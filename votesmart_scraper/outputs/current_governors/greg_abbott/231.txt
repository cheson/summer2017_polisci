Date: Sept. 3, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott will lead a delegation to Mexico City where he will hold meetings and events from Sunday, September 6th to Tuesday, September 8th. During his visit, Governor Abbott will meet with President Enrique Peña Nieto, Secretary of Foreign Affairs Claudia Ruiz Massieu Salinas, various Mexican cabinet officials and business leaders from across the country. This will be Governor Abbott's first international trip, which will focus on strengthening Texas and Mexico's deep cultural and economic ties.
"Texas and Mexico have a deep cultural and economic history founded on common interests and values," said Governor Abbott. "As I travel to Mexico--on my first international visit as Governor of Texas--I look forward to continuing my discussions with Mexican officials to improve bilateral relations, expand our long-standing trade partnership and ultimately create more economic prosperity on both sides of the border."

Governor Abbott will be joined on the trip by Secretary of State Carlos Cascos, Tracye McDaniel, CEO of TexasOne, members of the Governor's staff and various business and economic leaders from around the state. The trip will be sponsored and paid for by TexasOne, the state's Economic Development Corporation.

Governor Abbott's trip stems from an invitation by Mexico's former Secretary of Foreign Affairs, José Antonio Meade Kuribreña, who visited the Governor's Mansion in July.
