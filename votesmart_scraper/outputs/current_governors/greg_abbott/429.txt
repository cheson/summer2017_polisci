Abbott: Students Need to Learn Without Limits
Statement

Learning is no longer limited by bricks and mortar. It is expanded exponentially by bytes and bandwidth.
As governor, I want students in Amarillo and throughout Texas to graduate from the best school system in the country. Texas is already No. 1 in job creation, and employers in Amarillo added more jobs last month. For Amarillo to continue to grow, we must prepare students not only for the next generation of high-tech jobs, but also for high-paying, skilled technical jobs.
Expanding technology in our classrooms will help Amarillo teachers build that pipeline of qualified graduates. And expanding technology in our classrooms will help our students learn without limits.
