First Lady Cecilia Abbott today attended the grand opening and ribbon cutting for the Presbyterian Night Shelter's new Women and Children's Center in Fort Worth, Texas.
"No mother or child should feel helpless, with no place and no one to turn to," the First Lady said. "I want to thank the Presbyterian Night Shelter for the work they are doing to help provide meals, shelter, safety, and a path to a brighter tomorrow for so many here in Fort Worth."
The First Lady also called on the Fort Worth community to consider the new Women and Children's Center as a place to volunteer and give their time to those in the greatest need. Through her statewide Texanthropy initiative, the First Lady is encouraging Texans to increase their volunteer and philanthropic activity.
The Presbyterian Night Shelter is a nonprofit that was created in 1984 by three Presbyterian churches in Fort Worth to provide overnight shelter for homeless persons. The shelter relies on assistance from volunteers, donations of items and monetary contributions.
