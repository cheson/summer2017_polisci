Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: March 5, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today released the following statement regarding Attorney General Ken Paxton's decision to file a motion for discovery after the Obama Administration granted thousands of work permits to undocumented immigrants, contrary to what was presented in U.S. Federal Court:
"I commend Attorney General Paxton for continuing to hold the Obama Administration accountable, and I'm confident an investigation would find the Administration knowingly or recklessly misled a Federal Court in issuing thousands of amnesty documents illegally," said Governor Abbott. "President Obama has continued to show complete disregard for the Rule of Law by acting beyond his Constitutional authority at every stage of this process."
