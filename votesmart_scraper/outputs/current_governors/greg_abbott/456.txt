On behalf of all 50 states' attorneys general, General Abbott filed a "friend of court" brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in California, urging the justices to uphold the Pledge of Allegiance as a constitutional reflection of our national heritage. In 2009, General Abbott successfully argued to uphold the amended Texas Pledge containing the words "under God" to a US District Court.
