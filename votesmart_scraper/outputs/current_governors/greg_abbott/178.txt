Governor Abbott Statement On President Obama's Executive Actions
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: Jan. 5, 2016
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott released the following statement in response to President Obama's executive actions imposing gun control measures across the country.
"The Bill of Rights was added as a specific safeguard to prevent the federal government from denying Americans those guaranteed rights," said Governor Abbott. "Today, the President trampled the purpose and substance of the Bill of Rights by unilaterally imposing Second Amendment restrictions. After failing to pass gun control measures through Congress, the President is yet again resorting to unilateral executive action in place of the democratic process. Despite the President's latest attempt to undermine our liberty, Texas will take every action to protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens."
