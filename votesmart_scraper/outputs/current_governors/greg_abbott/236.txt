Governor Greg Abbott today ordered Texas flags in Harris County to be lowered to half-staff in honor of the life and public service of Harris County Deputy Sheriff Darren Goforth, who was murdered late Friday.
"Texas has sustained a deliberate and heinous crime against a law enforcement officer in Harris County," Governor Abbott said in a letter to Harris County Judge Ed Emmett. "Texans revere the men and women in law enforcement who put their lives on the line every day to protect and service their communities. As such, it is fitting that Texas flags should be lowered to half-staff in memory of this dedicated and brave deputy sheriff."
The Texas flags located at the state capitol in Austin will also be lowered to half-staff in honor of this directive.
