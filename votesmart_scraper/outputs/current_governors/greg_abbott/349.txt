Governor Greg Abbott today accepted the 2014 Governor's Cup, an award given annually by Site Selection Magazine to recognize the top performing state for capital investment attraction in a season that lasts all year. 2014 was the third year in a row and sixth year since 2004 that Texas has been honored with the award.
"I'm honored to accept Site Selection Governor's Cup on behalf of the people of Texas," Governor Abbott said. "It's no surprise Texas is again named the top state for the most new and expanded corporate facilities -- this is the third year in a row Texas ranked #1 and the sixth time in the last 11 years. Unleashing the power of entrepreneurs and innovators and securing Texans' freedom to aspire is the model of success for Texas, and I'm confident Texas will continue to lead the nation."
