Governor Greg Abbott today announced Texas Secretary of State Carlos Cascos will travel to Mexico City on April 27th-30th to deliver a message of bilateral collaboration on behalf of the State of Texas.
"An open and effective relationship between Mexico and Texas is vital for our state's future, as well as for the future of the United States," said Governor Abbott. "I am confident Secretary Cascos' visit will mark a new chapter of continued rapport with Mexico and strengthen our long-term partnership."
During his visit, Secretary Cascos will meet with Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Affairs Jose Antonio Meade Kuribre√±a and U.S. Ambassador to Mexico E. Anthony Wayne.
Secretary Cascos will be accompanied by a small delegation from his office. The Texas delegation will participate in multiple meetings hosted by the SRE (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and SENER (Ministry of Energy) to discuss Mexico's border infrastructure and energy reform initiatives.
The delegation will also attend a reception hosted by Mexico's Texas Exes and Texas A&M alumni, and will visit El Palacio Nacional (The National Palace), Templo Mayor (Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan) and the Catedral Metropolitina (Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral).
This will be Secretary Cascos' first official international mission since being sworn in as Secretary of State in March.
