At the invitation of Governor Greg Abbott, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today reviewed Texas' Zika Virus Preparedness and Response Plan with the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) and the Governor's Office, and heard from state health officials about their efforts to protect Texans. The CDC observed a DSHS Table Top Exercise (TTX) on Zika response and provided feedback on Texas' actions to prevent and prepare for local transmission of the Zika virus.
"Today's meeting was a crucial step in making sure Texas is prepared to address the threat of the Zika virus," said Governor Abbott. "Working with our local and federal partners, Texas will continue to take all steps to ensure our state develops and implements the strongest possible Zika virus response plan."
During the visit, DSHS discussed:
The state's action plan for local transmission
Coordinating with the CDC and local and state health departments
Narrowly identifying an area of potential risk following local transmission
Monitoring lab capacity to meet potential testing demand
Clear communication of risk and precautions
Additionally, DSHS announced it will be having a statewide Zika workshop in McAllen on July 6.
