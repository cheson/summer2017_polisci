Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: Aug. 8, 2016
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today attended and delivered remarks at the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Harbor Bridge over the Port of Corpus Christi's Main Turning Basin. The Harbor Bridge Replacement project will improve safety, connectivity and level of service in Texas' Costal Bend region. When completed, the new Harbor Bridge will be the largest cable-stayed bridge in the United States and the third largest in the world.
"I would like to congratulate TxDOT, the Port Authority and the City of Corpus Christi on this achievement," said Governor Abbott. "The new Harbor Bridge will mean more exports, more economic growth, and that means more jobs. This bridge will do so much more than just help people get from one side of the bay to the other, it will transport this region from one economic era to an even more prosperous one."
New Harbor Bridge Facts:
Substantial completion projected for April 2021
Cable-stayed bridge design with a main-span of 1,665 feet
205-foot navigational clearance above the Main Turning Basin waterway -- large enough that the former Harbor Bridge could fit beneath it
New clearance will allow largest ocean-going vessels, including those crossing the newly expanded Panama Canal, access to the Port of Corpus Christi
Utilizes advanced bridge technologies, materials and construction techniques that allow for a life span of more than 170 years
