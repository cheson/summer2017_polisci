Letter

Location: Austin, TX

To all participants in the 2015 Texas Science and Engineering Fair:
You are all already winners.
Not just because you are here today among the best and brightest young minds in Texas, but because you dared to ask a question. A question that began: Why? How? And what if?
From the limitless expanses of space to technologies too small to be seen, all great ideas, new discoveries and innovative solutions began with those questions.
There are so many questions yet to explore; so many answers for you to find.
Congratulations on your hard work. I hope you enjoy learning from each other this weekend, and I look forward to learning more from the students who advance to the Govemor's Science and Technology Champions Academy.
There are many career paths ahead for you, and we want you to reach your dreams. Because when you succeed, Texas succeeds.
All that we ask is that you keep exploring, keep leaming and keep asking questions like "why'' and "how" and "what if."
I'd like to share a special thank you with all the parents, educators, mentors and industry professionals who have invested so much time in their students' success and the success of this fair.
