Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: Sept. 10, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today presented the Star of Texas Awards to peace officers, firefighters, citizens and emergency medical first responders who have demonstrated extraordinary valor and courage in serving and protecting their communities. The Star of Texas Awards were created by the State of Texas in 2003 to honor men and women who have been killed or have sustained injuries in the line of duty.
"Today Texas continues its legacy of celebrating and honoring those who have served in the most challenging circumstances," said Governor Abbott. "It is with the highest esteem and depth of gratitude that I present the Star of Texas award to 28 Texans. The Star of Texas award is aptly named -- it goes only to those who are truly stars in the State of Texas -- those who have shined in their service to our fellow Texans, those who self-sacrificed and it has allowed Texas to continue to shine as the lone star of our great nation."
