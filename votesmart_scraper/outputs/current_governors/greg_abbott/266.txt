Statement
By: Gregory Abbott

Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today hosted a ceremonial bill signing for House Bill 3994 (Morrison, R-Victoria; Perry, R-Lubbock), which reforms Texas' existing judicial bypass laws to improve the protection of a minor seeking an abortion.
"Lawmakers made significant strides to further protect innocent life and ensure the health and safety of mothers across Texas with this bill," Governor Abbott said. "HB 3994 successfully closes loopholes in current judicial bypass laws that were often exploited to circumvent parental authority and yielded more abortions to minors. I am proud to have signed HB 3994 into law, and as Governor, I will continue to ensure the State of Texas leads the way in protecting our most vulnerable -- the unborn."
