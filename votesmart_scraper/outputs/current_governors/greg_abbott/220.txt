Governor Greg Abbott today visited the VA Health Care Center and the University of Texas Health Science Center in Harlingen to discuss ways to expand healthcare options for veterans in the Rio Grande Valley. During his visit, Governor Abbott participated in a roundtable discussion with U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald, U.S. Senator John Cornyn, and members of the Texas congressional delegation.
"Men and women who have put their lives on the line to fight for freedom in this country have bled, sweated and toiled for the freedom that we all enjoy today. Yet, they are stuck in waiting lines, unable to get appointments, some even losing their lives, not on foreign battlefields, but waiting for access to healthcare that was promised to them as part of their service to protect our freedoms," said Governor Abbott.
"Today is a step toward solving those problems. Our veterans have waited too long. Their care and their need is too high. The time is now when we can come together in this state, in the United States Military, in Congress, and in the Obama administration to work to serve our men and women who have served us by giving them the urgent care they need."
