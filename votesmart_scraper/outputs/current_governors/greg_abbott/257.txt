Governor Greg Abbott today issued a statement following the death of Texas Department of Criminal Justice Correctional Officer Timothy Davison:
"The State of Texas mourns for the family of Officer Timothy Davison, who was murdered by an inmate at the Telford Unit in New Boston, Texas. On behalf of the entire state, Cecilia and I extend our deepest condolences to the Davison family during this incredibly difficult time. Officer Davison was a public servant in the truest sense of the phrase, but more importantly, he was a parent to two children who will remain in our thoughts and prayers as they grieve the loss of their father. The State of Texas will ensure that the inmate responsible for this heinous act is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
