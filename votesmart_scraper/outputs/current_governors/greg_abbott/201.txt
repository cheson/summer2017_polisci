Governor Greg Abbott today issued a statement following the State of Texas' lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) "Clean Power Plan":
"The EPA's latest power grab -- disguised as a "Clean Power Plan' -- takes already burdensome federal regulations a step further by driving up energy costs, stagnating job growth, threatening the reliability of our electric grid and treading all over the State of Texas' sovereignty," said Governor Abbott. "With seemingly no concept of what it costs to support a family, start a business or save for retirement, the federal government has yet again proven its readiness to sacrifice American jobs in the name of expanding bureaucratic authority and pushing its liberal agenda. I applaud the Attorney General's challenge to the Clean Power Plan and offer my full support for all efforts to fight federal government overreach."
