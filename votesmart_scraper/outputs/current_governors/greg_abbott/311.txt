Governor Abbott Statement On Obama Administration Unlawfully Implementing Executive Amnesty
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: May 8, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Texas Governor Greg Abbott today issued the following statement after the U.S. Department of Justice admitted to violating a federal court order by granting approximately 2,000 extended work permits to undocumented immigrants under President Obama's expanded executive amnesty:
"After months of obfuscation and stall tactics by the Obama Administration, the President's lawyers have been forced to admit that they acted outside the law by implementing President's executive amnesty - even after a federal judge had ordered them to stop. Not only did President Obama's executive action violate the U.S. Constitution; his lawyers' actions show a blatant disregard for the Rule of Law that has become typical of this Administration and directly violates one of the fundamental principles upon which our nation was founded."
