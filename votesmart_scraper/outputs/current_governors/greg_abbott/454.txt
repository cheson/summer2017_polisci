An open government is the bedrock of a free society. The Attorney General is responsible for ensuring that Texas government is open and accessible to all citizens. A 2005 recipient of the James Madison Award for unwavering commitment to open government, General Abbott has championed the free flow of information throughout his administration; he supported bills passed by the Texas Legislature to require public officials to undergo training in Texas' open government laws and to open the investment of public funds to more scrutiny.
