Governor Greg Abbott today issued a statement following the Texas Supreme Court's decision to uphold the divorce of a same-sex couple in Austin, TX:
"The Texas Supreme Court's decision is disappointing and legally incorrect. The Court mistakenly relied on a technicality to allow this divorce to proceed. Importantly, the Supreme Court did not address the Texas Constitution's definition of marriage--and marriage in Texas remains an institution between one man and one woman. The Texas Constitution continues to stand as the governing law for marriage in the State of Texas. The State and all political subdivisions in Texas remain prohibited by the Texas Constitution from giving effect to a same-sex marriage or any document recognizing one--including the divorce decree in this case."
