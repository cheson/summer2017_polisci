Governor Abbott Statement On Biennial Revenue Estimate
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott

Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today released the following statement on Comptroller Glenn Hegar's Biennial Revenue Estimate:
"Texans expect their government to live within its means, and I fully expect to sign a budget that does just that. As fiscal conservatives, we must treat our state budget the way families do -- by funding our priorities, while constraining the size and growth of government. I will work with the Legislature this session to craft a budget that funds our most vital services without growing faster than the growth of population and inflation."
