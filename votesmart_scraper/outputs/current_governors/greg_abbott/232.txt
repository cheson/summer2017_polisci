Governor Greg Abbott today ordered Texas flags across the state to be lowered to half-staff on Friday, September 4th, the day of Harris County Deputy Sheriff Darren Goforth's funeral. Today's order follows Governor Abbott's call for law enforcement officers across the state to honor Deputy Goforth and all those who wear the uniform by activating their red and blue lights for one minute at 11 AM Friday, the moment Deputy Goforth's memorial service in Houston is set to begin.
"Texans across the state are uniting in support of Deputy Goforth and every law enforcement officer who puts their life on the line each day in order to keep Texas safe and strong," Governor Abbott said. "We must come together to honor Deputy Goforth and the essential role law enforcement plays in serving and protecting our states's families and communities. Therefore I ask all Texas flags to be lowered to half-staff on Friday, September 4th, to honor the bravery, the dedication and the everlasting memory of Deputy Darren Goforth."
