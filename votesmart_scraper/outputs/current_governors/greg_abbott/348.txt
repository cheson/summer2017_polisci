Governor Greg Abbott visited Midland today as part of his State of the State tour, where he toured Midland ISD's Ralph Waldo Emerson Elementary, meeting with the school's Superintendent and Principal as well as teachers and students in several classrooms. At the school, Governor Abbott highlighted his early education plan and his announcement of his Pre-K plan as his first emergency item as governor.
"Early education is so important to the future of our state, and I've come away from visiting these classrooms today very excited to see how much these young students are learning," said Governor Abbott. "If we are really going to build a better Texas, we have to start with building a strong foundation for education, and that means early education. I want every child reading and doing math at grade level by the time they finish the third grade; to achieve that we have to start at the Pre-K 4 level."
