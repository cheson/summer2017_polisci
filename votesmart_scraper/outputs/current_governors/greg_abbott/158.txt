Press Release

Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today met with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in Houston to discuss continued collaboration and progress on the joint energy task force -- an agreement reached on the Governor's visit to Mexico last year that will aid Texas in leveraging the vast investment and business opportunities made possible by Mexico's recent energy reforms.
"Today's meeting affirmed Texas and Mexico's continued commitment to addressing shared challenges on both sides of the border," said Governor Abbott. "I would like to thank President Peña Nieto for his dedication to working with Texas on cross-border energy infrastructure. Working together, I am confident we will continue to strengthen our economic and cultural bonds."
Mexico is the Lone Star State's biggest trading partner and Texas exports more goods to Mexico than any other state. In 2014, Texas exported more than $100 billion in machinery, technology and other commodities to Mexico, about 35 percent of the state's total exports. These exports sustain tens of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses in Texas and more than 1.1 million jobs, the most in the nation. Texas also imported more than $90 billion of goods from our southern neighbor last year.
