Statement

Location: Austin, TX

The United States Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics recently released information detailing state-by-state graduation rates in 2012-13, with Texas' Class of 2013 graduating at a rate of 88 percent and outpacing the national average of 81 percent. This was the third consecutive year the state's high school graduation rate eclipsed the national average.
"The Department of Education's data release is reflective of our state's enormous strides to ensure all students are educated and graduate on time -- but there is still so much work left to be done," Governor Greg Abbott said. "By returning genuine local control to school districts, reducing one-size-fits-all mandates and empowering families to make meaningful educational choices for their children, the state of Texas will ensure graduation numbers continue to rise so more of our students graduate high school college- or career-ready."
