Our most precious Texans are also among the most vulnerable.
Greg Abbott has made protecting children and removing dangerous predators from our communities a top priority as Texas' Attorney General.
He launched the Cyber Crimes and Fugitive units in 2003, directly resulting in the arrest of more than 4,454 fugitives, sex offenders, parole violators, and other felons.
In addition to fostering safety for our children in our communities and online, one of the most important responsibilities of the Attorney General is the collection of child support.
Child support directly benefits the children and saves Texas taxpayers money by avoiding additional state welfare costs. Under Greg Abbott's watch, the Attorney General's office has collected over $26 billion in child support for Texas children.
