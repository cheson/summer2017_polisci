Location: Austin, TX

Pursuant to a joint resolution approved by the United States Congress on December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 11, 2015, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. As a part of this commemoration, President Obama has called for the lowering of the United States flag to half-staff.
In accordance with this proclamation, all flags in Texas, including the State of Texas flag and any other flags, should fly at half-staff on Friday, September 11, 2015, since no flag may fly higher than the United States flag at any time. Flags should return to full-staff on the next day.
