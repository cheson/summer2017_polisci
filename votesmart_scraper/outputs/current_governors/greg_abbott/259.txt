Governor Greg Abbott issued the following statement after footage of a Planned Parenthood executive detailing abortion procedures surfaced:
"The video of a high-level Planned Parenthood executive discussing the details of internal abortion procedures -- including harvesting of baby body parts -- is unnerving and appalling. In light of the video, I have directed the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to conduct an immediate investigation of this alleged practice in addition to a separate investigation ordered by the Texas Office of the Attorney General."
