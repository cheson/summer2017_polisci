Governor Greg Abbott today released the following statement in response to District Court Judge Andrew Hanen's order denying the Obama Administration's request for a stay of the Court's earlier ruling. Judge Hanen also granted the Texas-led coalition's request for early discovery, made after it came to light that U.S. Department of Justice lawyers misrepresented the Administration's actions to implement President Obama's executive amnesty to the court:
"Texas can claim another victory for the Rule of Law and the Constitution with the District Court's decision to deny the President's request to proceed with his unlawful executive action. The administration's request had no legal grounds and proves that we are dealing with a President that disregards the Rule of Law and the system of checks and balances that are key to the Constitution. I am confident that Texas, along with the 25 other states that have joined us in challenging the President's executive overreach, will continue to prevail at every stage of the legal process as this case works its way to the Supreme Court."
