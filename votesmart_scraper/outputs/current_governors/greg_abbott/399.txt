"My Healthy Texans plan will expand access, improve care and keep costs from continuing to spiral out of control. We must improve access to more doctors and healthcare providers. With advances in technology, we can quickly expand access and bring care closer to the patient, especially in underserved, rural areas," says Greg Abbott in the web ad. "A healthier tomorrow for more Texas families is within our reach. My plan helps us get there."
