Governor Greg Abbott today appeared on CNBC's Squawk on the Street to discuss the Texas economy, the high quality workforce in the Lone Star State and the investments in education and infrastructure the legislature made this past session.
"Texas has continued to grow jobs because we have a very vast and diversified economy," said Governor Abbott. "We lead the nation in technology exports. We have the largest medical center in the entire world. Today in Arlington, Texas, General Motors is investing $1.4 billion in another manufacturing facility. We run the gamut as far as a broad-based economy is concerned and that's why we're here attracting even more businesses to Texas."
