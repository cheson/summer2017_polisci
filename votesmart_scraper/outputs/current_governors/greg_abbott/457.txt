General Abbott champions the values that define Texans. Under his leadership, the Office of the Attorney General successfully defended the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments displayed on the Texas Capitol grounds all the way to the United States Supreme Court. He has represented all 50 states in defending the words "under God" in our Pledge of Allegiance and allowing for a prayer during the Presidential Inauguration ceremony.
