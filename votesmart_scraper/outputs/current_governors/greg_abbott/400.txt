Texans must have access to affordable, quality health care, without the bureaucratic red tape that comes from Washington, D.C.
The federal government has shown it cannot be a dependable vehicle for reform. Texas must lead the way. Today, I unveiled my Healthy Texans plan -- for a healthier tomorrow for more Texas families.
My proposals will:
-Increase funding for women's health programs by $50 million and add optional screening and treatment for postpartum depression through CHIP Perinatal and Medicaid.
-Increase funding to provide more residency positions for medical school graduates so more doctors trained in Texas stay in Texas.
-Compensate doctors for being available to their patients via telephone consultations.
-Extend loan forgiveness to mental health professionals in underserved areas.
-Raise wages for personal care attendants for seniors and people with disabilities.
-Provide no-cost mental health screenings to veterans and service members.
-Request Medicaid funds in the form of a block grant to allow for more efficient and effective use of funds.
First, we must ensure better access to preventive care to avoid future health care costs and save lives. We must also make sure that quality health care is available to help patients when they are most vulnerable.
From expanding women's health programs, to demanding block grants for Medicaid, to helping doctors who are educated in Texas stay in Texas, my plan will enact meaningful reforms to foster a healthier Texas.
Together, we will make sure even more Texans can access quality health care.
For Texas,
Greg Abbott
