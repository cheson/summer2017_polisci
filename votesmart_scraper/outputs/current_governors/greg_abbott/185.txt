Governor Abbott Takes Action To Combat Illegal Border Crossings
Statement

Location: Austin, TX

With the significant increase in the number of illegal crossings across the Texas border, Governor Greg Abbott today took action in the wake of federal inaction.
"In September, I warned Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson "about the significant increase in unaccompanied minors who are once again pouring across our border,'" said Governor Abbott. "I asked for his "immediate and bold action to prevent this from escalating into an uncontrollable crisis.' Despite the warning -- followed by a phone discussion about the matter -- my request for more border patrol agents and strategic resources to secure the border were ignored. Now, the concern I warned about has turned into reality: A substantial spike in illegal crossings has occurred at a particularly unsuspecting time, once again challenging Texas' security and resources. The Federal Government compounded its negligence by failing to give advance notice so that the state and local governments could prepare for the Obama administration's unilateral decision to relocate nearly a thousand foreign nationals in Texas."
