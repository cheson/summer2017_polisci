We're approaching the final six weeks of this election.
I am so honored and humbled by the support we've received in this campaign so far. We've made unprecedented efforts in every corner of Texas. But there is still more work to be done.
We have to reach even more voters in these final weeks, and I am asking for your help. Will you contribute to help us get to victory on Election Day?
Texas is truly exceptional. We are already number one the nation for job creation, exports, farms, energy and so much more -- and I will keep Texas growing. But I will also work to build a brighter future for the next generation.
The time has come to set a new aspiration. Texas should be the top state in the nation for educating children. As your governor, I will work to fulfill that aspiration.
And I will keep Texas the land of opportunity -- the place where hopes and dreams can still be realized; the place where more freedom and less government still matters.
I'm running for governor, and I'm asking for your support to make Texas even better. Can I count on your contribution?
Sincerely,
Greg Abbott
