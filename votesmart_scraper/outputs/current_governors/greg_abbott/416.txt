Blog: Greater than Ourselves

More than 19,000 veterans were out of work last year in Texas. That is unacceptable.
Texans have long defended the nation, sending our sons and daughters to fight in the trenches of Europe, on the high seas and remote islands in the Pacific, in the jungles and mountains of Asia, in the desert sands of the Middle East, and beyond.
More than a million from Texas have served, and many more have trained and lived on military installations in Texas.
We must honor our commitments to those who selflessly answer the call of duty. A simple "thank you for your service" is inadequate to truly repay the debt of gratitude we owe our heroes.
As governor, I have a plan to get vets back to work in Texas. Read what Texas will do under my administration to
Exempt new businesses formed by veterans from state registration fees and exempt them from the state franchise tax for five years
Waive licensing exams and fees for veterans with existing education, training, and experience
Authorize local option property tax exemption for newly-hired vets by commercial property owners
As a stateas a nationwe must re-dedicate ourselves to a cause greater than ourselves.
