Greg Abbott believes the right to keep and bear arms was settled in 1791 when the 2nd Amendment was adopted to the U.S. Constitution. On behalf of 31 states, Attorney General Abbott championed a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision (District of Columbia v. Heller) that struck down a handgun ban and protected an individual's right to bear arms.
Greg Abbott continues to protect 2nd Amendment rights by preparing to challenge potential federal laws that limit gun rights. He was also one of the first Attorneys General in America to challenge the Obama Administration's efforts to use the United Nations to regulate guns in the United States.
As an avid hunter and member of the Texas State Rifle Association and National Rifle Association, Greg Abbott will continue to fight any federal government overreach that aims to disrupt the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding Texans.
