Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: July 31, 2014
Location: Austin, TX

Attorney General and candidate for governor Greg Abbott visited Galveston, TX on Wednesday evening to address members of the Share the Gulf Association, representatives from Galveston's fisheries and local supporters at Katie's Seafood Market. Abbott was introduced by Buddy Guindon, owner of Katie's Seafood who is also known for his appearances in a series of commercials for the H-E-B chain of supermarkets.
Describing the accident that put him in a wheelchair, Abbott said, "I learned a lesson that every B.O.I. ["born on the island"] knows in their heart and in their soul -- that our lives are not defined by how we're challenged; we define our lives by how we respond to the challenges we face."
