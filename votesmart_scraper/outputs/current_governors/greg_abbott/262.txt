"What we did this past legislative session is we made Texas an even better place to do business. While a lot of states are talking about increasing taxes, we just cut taxes by about $4 billion. On top of cutting taxes, we invested in securing the border, we invested in higher education and we are spending $4 billion in transportation infrastructure, without raising a single penny in taxes, fees, tolls or debt."
