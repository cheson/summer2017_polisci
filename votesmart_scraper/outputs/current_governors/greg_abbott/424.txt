On Wednesday Texas Governor Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, and Speaker Joe Straus directed the Texas Dept. of Public Safety (DPS) to enforce the Texas/Mexico border through surge operations. The decision comes as thousands of immigrants--most of whom are from Central America--continue to cross into the U.S. illegally every day. As the federal government has not provided adequate law enforcement along the border to control the border crisis, state resources will now be utilized.
The state will spend $1.3 million per week to secure the border.
Texas General Attorney Greg Abbott has spoken out in strong support of the Texas-led surge.
In a press release Abbott said, "Texas is stepping up and doing what the federal government has failed to do -- secure the porous border. The Obama Administration's failure to enforce the rule of law has empowered transnational gangs and cartels to smuggle people into our state from around the world -- including members of deadly gangs like MS-13."
He continued, "The Department of Public Safety will have the tools and resources it needs to curtail illegal smuggling, horrific human trafficking and cartel imported crime. Securing the border will reduce the illegal activity which -- in turn -- will promote the legitimate trade that helps make Texas the leading exporting state in the country.
