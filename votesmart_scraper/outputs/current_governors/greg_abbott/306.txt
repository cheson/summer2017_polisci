Texas Governor Greg Abbott today signed Senate Bill 835 (V. Taylor, R-Plano) into law to take effect September 1, 2015. SB 835 increases the penalty for the offense of presenting a fraudulent or fictitious military record. Governor Abbott issued the following statement:
"The United States Military is one of the most revered institutions in the history of the world. Anyone who would fraudulently claim to have served our nation honorably for their own personal gain should be held fully accountable for their actions, and increasing the penalty for this illegal act is the right thing to do," said Governor Abbott. "Too many brave American men and women have put their lives on the line for our country to have their records tarnished by someone making a false claim. I am proud to sign this bill into law and I look forward to continuing to work with the Legislature to protect all of our soldiers and veterans."
