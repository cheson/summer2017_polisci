Texans for Greg Abbott today released a new web ad featuring former Hewlett Packard CEO and native Texan Carly Fiorina endorsing Greg Abbott, and highlighted Greg Abbott's appearance on KSKY's "Ladies Can We Talk?" with host Debbie Georgatos Sunday morning, where he discussed his goal to make Texas #1 in the nation for women-owned businesses. Texas currently ranks second in the nation, boasting over 737,000 women-owned businesses.
"I think when barriers are taken out of your way, women are going to succeed," says Fiorina in the web ad. "One of the things that I so appreciate about Greg Abbott is that he knows that the highest calling of leadership is to unlock the potential of others, and that is why he's going to be a great governor for the State of Texas."
In the interview with Georgatos, Abbott outlined his strategy to encourage the growth of women-owned businesses: "[M]y job as governor, and the state's job, is to not impose heavy-handed mandates from government, but allow the genius of women entrepreneurs to start a job, create a company, and let it grow."
Abbott continued, "We're so proud of all the jobs that women are creating in the State of TexasÂ…one of my goals is to make Texas #1 in the nation for women-owned businesses."
