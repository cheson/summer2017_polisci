Texas law defines marriage as an institution between one man and one woman. Attorney General Abbott has fought efforts to undermine Texas' law and the basic family structure in our state. He understands that traditional marriage is the cornerstone for a strong and stable family. A wealth of empirical data demonstrates the unmatched potency of the family to combat social ills, foster strong communities, and promote happier, healthier lives.
