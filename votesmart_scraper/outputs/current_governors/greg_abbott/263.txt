Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: July 10, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott will visit New York City on Monday, July 13th and Tuesday, July 14th to discuss with business leaders and industry experts Texas' open and flourishing business climate. The trip will include a number of media appearances, a tour of the New York Stock Exchange and events conducted in partnership with TexasOne, the state's Economic Development Corporation that will sponsor Governor Abbott's trip for the purpose of promoting and marketing Texas as the premier state in which to live and do business.
While in New York, Governor Abbott will share with industry leaders and employers Texas' latest successes in becoming an even better state to conduct business by cutting over $4 billion in taxes for businesses and homeowners, further reducing burdensome regulations and prioritizing spending for transportation infrastructure and education without growing government or raising taxes.
"This legislative session, Texas opened more doors for opportunity than ever before and I'm confident that by showcasing our success in cutting the business franchise tax and reducing regulations, we will continue encouraging companies to bring their business to the Lone Star State," said Governor Abbott. "Unleashing the power of entrepreneurs and innovators and securing Texan's freedom to aspire has always been the model of success for Texas, and I look forward to selling that model nationwide."
The economic impact of this two-day mission is significant. The state will have conversations with more than 30 global business leaders representing 22 corporate entities, which translates into the potential retention of more than 11,500 jobs in Texas. In addition, the state will be connecting with 15 corporate real estate advisors that could result in bringing additional jobs and investment to the Lone Star State.
Governor Abbott's visit comes after Texas was recognized as Site Selection Magazine's Governor's Cup recipient for the sixth time in the last eleven years, Chief Executive Magazine's "best state for business" for the eleventh year in a row and CNBC's second best state for doing business.
