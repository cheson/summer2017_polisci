ICYMI: Governor Abbott Discusses Border Security On The Sean Hannity Show
Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott

Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott spoke with FOX News radio host Sean Hannity today to discuss how Texas is stepping up to secure our border in the wake of federal government inaction by signing into law the most comprehensive border security plan in the nation. Texas' border security plan will invest $800 million in state funds to increase the number of Department of Public Safety troopers, aircraft, surveillance cameras, technology, and training equipment in order to bolster security along the Texas-Mexico border.
"Texas took matters into its own hands. We passed our own plan to secure our border, doing what the federal government has failed to do," said Governor Abbott. "Texas is stepping up and securing the border because Republicans and Democrats in Washington, D.C. are not taking care of a constitutional responsibility to protect the sovereignty of the United States of America."
