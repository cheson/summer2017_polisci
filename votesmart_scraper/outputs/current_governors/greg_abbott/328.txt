Governor Abbott Supports Florida's Decision To Take Legal Action Against Expansion of Obamacare
Statement

Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today issued a statement supporting Governor Rick Scott's (R-FL) decision to take legal action against the Obama administration for halting federal funds in an attempt to force states to expand Obamacare:
"When the federal government exceeds its constitutional authority, the States must take action. In NFIB v. Sebelius, 26 States secured an important decision from the Supreme Court protecting States against coercion by the federal government. The Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution prohibits the federal government from threatening to withhold billions in Medicaid funding from States that do not accept Obamacare's massive expansion of an already broken and bloated Medicaid program. Chief Justice Roberts called this lawless threat "a gun to the head.' The Supreme Court made it very clear that the Constitution does not allow the federal government to use these coercive tactics against the States.
"I commend Governor Rick Scott's decision to take legal action to protect these important constitutional principles. Texas will support Florida in its litigation against the federal government. Medicaid expansion is wrong for Texas. Florida's approach should be determined by Floridians, not coerced by federal bureaucrats."
