Greg Abbott Touts Texas Economy at Press Conference in Austin
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: July 10, 2014
Location: Austin, TX

Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott held a press conference earlier to discuss Texas' economic success and highlight women in business. Hours before President Obama's speech in Austin, TX, Abbott spoke of the Texas economic model that promotes opportunity and rewards ingenuity. Abbott was introduced by businesswomen Jenai Hales and Stephanie Phillips, who spoke to the merits of conservative leadership and how it has helped their businesses succeed.
"Women are a huge part of the Texas economic success," Abbott said. "Women have helped make Texas number one in the nation for job creation, exports and energy production. Barack Obama's economic policies and costly mandates are not aiding this progress -- they are making it more challenging for women to succeed in business. As governor, I will promote policies that keep Texas working -- especially for women. If President Obama truly wants to get the American economy growing again, he'll need to saddle up and adopt the Texas model."
