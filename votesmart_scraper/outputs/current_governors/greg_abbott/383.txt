On the morning of Election Day, Greg Abbott interviewed on radio shows across the state encouraging Texans to get out and vote.
"Texans aren't satisfied with Barack Obama and his agenda," Greg Abbott said on KNTH's "Sam Malone in the Morning." "If you, the listener, disagree with the Barack Obama agenda, I need you to make sure that you go cast your vote today, to make sure we keep Texas going in the right direction."
