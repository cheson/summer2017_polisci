Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: Nov. 24, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Abbott will lead a delegation to Havana, Cuba where he will hold meetings and events to focus on travel, trade and exports from Monday, November 30th to Wednesday, December 2nd. While in Cuba, Governor Abbott will meet with officials from Cuba's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Investment, Port of Mariel, Cimex (Cuban Export-Import Corporation), Cuba Chamber of Commerce, Alimport (Cuban Export Company and Food Importer) and various economic institutions. This will be Governor Abbott's second international business development trip since taking office.
"With a new era of eased trade and travel restrictions between the U.S. and Cuba -- and as the 12th largest economy in the world - Texas has an opportunity to capitalize and expand its economic footprint at home and abroad," said Governor Abbott. "Opening the door to business with Texas will expand free enterprise and the freedom that flows from it. I look forward to expanding business opportunities for both Texas and Cuba."
