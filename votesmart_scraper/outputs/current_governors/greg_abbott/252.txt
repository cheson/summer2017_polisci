Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: July 24, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today issued a statement following the Texas Supreme Court's ruling that requires the Houston City Council to repeal the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance or place it on the November ballot for a vote.
"Freedom of expression can only exist once government removes itself from stifling free speech, repressing religious liberty and interfering with the lives of its citizens. Today's decision by the Texas Supreme Court appropriately returns jurisdiction over this matter to voters while reassuring the people of Houston that their personal values remain beyond the reach of government."
