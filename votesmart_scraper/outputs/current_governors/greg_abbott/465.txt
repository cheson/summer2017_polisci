In 2009, General Abbott championed legislative efforts to help make affordable health insurance available to hundreds of thousands of children who are served by the child support system. The new law allows the Office of the Attorney General to work with private health plans to pool coverage for children whose families do not have access to employer-based coverage. The new program, ChildLINK, does not impose new financial obligations on parents. Rather, it simply shifts their duty from an obligation to pay cash medical support to an obligation to pay health insurance premiums. Unlike typical government insurance programs, ChildLINK offers a free-market solution to the problem. And it comes at no cost to the taxpayers because parents, not government, pay the monthly premiums.
