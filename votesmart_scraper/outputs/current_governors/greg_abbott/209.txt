Location: Austin, TX

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer and second most common cause of cancer-related death among Texas women. It is expected that as many as 15,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year.
Additionally, it is important to realize that breast cancer does not only affect women. According to the American Cancer Society, about one in 1,000 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer in his lifetime. But because this is not well-known, many men may not recognize the warning signs or may feel embarrassed about seeking treatment.
As with many illnesses, prevention and early detection are the keys to survival. Knowing your body and your family history are also critical to lowering your risk for breast cancer. It is important to be aware of assistance programs that doctors, state entities and nonprofit organizations can provide, such as screenings, treatments and breast reconstruction services.
Each October, organizations throughout the nation promote awareness of breast cancer, prevention options and ongoing steps toward a cure.
At this time, I encourage all Texans to participate in this effort and to support breast cancer patients, the families and friends of those affected by this disease and the medical professionals who provide invaluable care. Through information and education, we can work toward a brighter, cancer-free future for the Lone Star State.
There, I, Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, do hereby proclaim October 2015 to be Breast Cancer Awareness Month in Texas, and urge the appropriate recognition whereof. In official recognition whereof, I hereby affix my signature this 23rd day of September, 2015.
