Governor Greg Abbott today announced the award of $133 million in criminal justice and victim services grants to local law enforcement agencies, domestic violence shelters, child sex trafficking victims programs and other governmental and non-profit agencies across Texas.

"Nothing is more important than ensuring the safety of all Texans," said Governor Abbott. "And on behalf of the State of Texas, I am proud to announce we have secured over $100 million for our state Criminal Justice Division. These grants will help ensure that in every community, victims of domestic violence and child sex trafficking will have a safe place to turn in order to remove and prosecute abusers, prevent domestic violence and allow victims the therapy, shelter and education resources needed to flourish."
