Statement

The Texas Workforce Commission today announced the State of Texas has achieved its lowest unemployment rate since 2007, dropping to 4.2 percent in March despite a seasonally adjusted employment decrease of 25,400 jobs.
"While the State of Texas has achieved enormous success in creating jobs and spurring economic growth, it's time to renew our focus on promoting smarter tax policies that energize our economy and empower entrepreneurs to reinvest their capital in the Lone Star State," Governor Abbott said. "We must do more to keep government small, taxes low and promote reasonable regulations. And by diversifying our state's economy, Texas can -- and will -- remain the beacon of economic opportunity for the nation."
