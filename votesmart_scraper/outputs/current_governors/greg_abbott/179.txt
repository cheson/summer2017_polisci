Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today announced that CGT U.S. Limited will construct a new manufacturing facility in New Braunfels, Texas. CGT anticipates creating at least 275 jobs and $80 million in capital investment in the State of Texas. The project will reshore part of the company's manufacturing from China and increase North American capacity. A Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF) grant offer of $2 million has been extended to CGT.
"I am proud to welcome CGT to the Lone Star State and look forward to seeing their business grow and create jobs in Texas," said Governor Abbott. "Thanks to our skilled workforce, low-tax and low-regulation climate, Texas will continue to attract industry leaders like CGT. By choosing Texas as the location to reshore part of their manufacturing efforts, we are proving that when given the opportunity, the Lone Star State can compete and win against any economy in the world."
