Governor Greg Abbott today announced that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is relocating its U.S. headquarters from New York to Texas. MHI is one of the world's leading industrial firms, providing services and products across a wide range of industries including energy, transportation, aerospace and aviation. The new Houston headquarters will oversee MHI operations throughout North America.
"Texas is home to around 1,200 MHI Group employees and we are honored that they have chosen Houston for their new U.S. headquarters," said Governor Abbott. "In Texas, free enterprise flourishes thanks to our low taxes, reasonable regulations and right-to-work laws, and I look forward to Texas' continued growth as a North American hub for global trade and investment."
"I am delighted that we have been able to set up a new base in Houston to better serve our customers and oversee our Group operations in North America," said MHI President & CEO Shunichi Miyanaga. "As a city with a heavy concentration of cutting-edge industries, Houston holds great promise as a key driver of America's economic development long into the future."
Houston currently hosts the headquarters and manufacturing plants for two other MHI Group companies, MHI Compressor International Corporation and Mitsubishi Caterpillar Forklift America, Inc. The Greater Houston area is home to the sales and service bases of MHI's Environmental & Chemical Plant Division. MHI's Oil & Gas Business Development Department also has a base in Houston.
