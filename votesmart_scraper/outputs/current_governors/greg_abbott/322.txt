Governor Abbott Statement On Supreme Court Same-Sex
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: April 28, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Texas Governor Greg Abbott released the following statement in advance of the United States Supreme Court hearing oral arguments today in a series of cases over whether states' same-sex marriage bans are constitutional:
"Texans voted overwhelmingly to define marriage in this State as the union of one man and one woman. As Texas' attorney general, I defended the definition of marriage in the Texas Constitution against court challenges, and I commend Attorney General Paxton for continuing that work. Texans--not unelected federal judges--should decide this important question for their State. I sincerely hope the U.S. Supreme Court will respect the sovereign right of States to define marriage."
