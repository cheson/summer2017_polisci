Texas Governor Greg Abbott today released the following statement regarding Texas being ranked the #1 best state to do business in by Chief Executive's 2015 Best & Worst States to Do Business survey of top CEOs. 2015 is the 11th year in a row Texas has topped the list.
"Everything is bigger in Texas, and that includes our business climate," said Governor Abbott. "Despite being the number one state to do business for 11 consecutive years, Texas will do even more to empower businesses and increase economic expansion. That's why I'm promoting policies to cut the business franchise tax, further rein in regulatory regimes and elevate our higher education system to bolster our workforce so that Texas keeps creating jobs and opportunity."
