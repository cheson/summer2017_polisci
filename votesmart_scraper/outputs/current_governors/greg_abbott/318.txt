Governor Abbott's Prayer Breakfast Remarks:
**Gov. Abbott often deviates from prepared remarks.
The First Lady and I are honored to join you this morning. My very being here this morning is proof that prayers work. I prayed to God that my alarm clock would wake me in time to get here.
Let me begin today with Romans 8:28. In all things God works for the good of those who love Him -- who have been called according to His purpose.
That applies to my two dear friends here today -- Chuck and Gina Norris. I was with them on Saturday for a gala for their Kick Start Kids program. Chuck Norris is a world famous movie star and everyone's favorite Texas Ranger. He has over a billion fans around the world. He could take it easy. He could live a Hollywood-style, ego-filled life. Instead, Chuck and Gina have devoted their lives to improving the lives of others. Their Kick Start Kids program has helped 80,000 kids in Texas, most from middle school and from troubled circumstances. It teaches them discipline, hard work, respect and character. If all of our kids were products of these programs, there would be far fewer laws needed in Texas. Chuck and Gina are -- indeed -- showing that God uses all of us for His good.
As we gather for this Day of Prayer, it's worthwhile remembering Luke 18:1. People should always pray and not lose heart.
Have you ever noticed how prayers increase during times of great need? I have no doubt prayers will increase as we near the end of session.
