Statement

My office has worked alongside the state's top leaders to provide the decisive action needed to address the crisis at the border and send 1000 National Guard troops to protect our families and communities.
This is more than a border crisis limited to a few states--it is a national crisis, affecting communities and taxpayers.
The National Guard troops will protect Texans from cartels and criminals perpetuating grievous crimes, including human trafficking. One life lost because of a border that is not secure is one too many.
Texas is, once again, leading the way, and we are prepared to continue this effort as long as it takes to fulfill our duty to our citizens to secure the border. While Texans are willing to put boots on the ground, but we expect Washington, DC to foot the bill.
As governor, I will marshal the tools we need to secure our border and I will enforce the rule of law. I'll add more boots on the ground, more assets in the air and on the water, and deploy more technology and tools for added surveillance.
