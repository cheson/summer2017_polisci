Office Of The Governor Awards Second Round Of Grants To Texas Military Installations
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: April 1, 2016
Location: Austin, TX

The Office of the Governor has awarded a second round of over $15 million from the Texas Military Preparedness Commission's Defense Economic Adjustment Assistance Grant (DEAAG) program to various military communities across the state of Texas. Under the leadership of Governor Abbott, $30 million was allocated to the DEAAG program in the final budget. This program assists defense communities which may be negatively impacted by a future Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round. The grant money will be invested in infrastructure projects and other initiatives to increase the military value of installations in Texas, thereby mitigating the potential negative effects of a BRAC round on our state's installations.

"Texas remains at the vanguard of supporting the U.S. military and the communities in which they serve," said Governor Abbott. "Now more than ever, it is incumbent upon the State of Texas to dedicate the resources needed to preserve the installations of the brave men and women in uniform just as they have preserved our freedom for generations."
