Dear Ms. Garfield:
As a result of severe storms in Van Zandt County that occurred on April 29, 2017, many homes and businesses were affected in the area, creating an economic emergency for the residents of the county.
Pursuant to the provisions of 15 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(2) and 13 C.F.R. ยง 123.3(a), I request the Small Business Administration declare Van Zandt County a disaster area for the purpose of making long-term, low-interest-rate physical disaster home and business loans and economic injury disaster loans available to citizens and businesses affected by the disaster. A preliminary survey indicates that there are more than 25 homes and/or businesses that suffered an uninsured loss of more than 40 percent in the county.
Thank you for your consideration in this matter. If you need any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact W. Nim Kidd, Texas Department of Public Safety Assistant Director for Emergency Management, at (512) 424-2443.
Sincerely,
