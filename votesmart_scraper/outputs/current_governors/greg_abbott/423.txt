What will the Texas of tomorrow look like for a child born in McAllen today?
While Texas leads the nation in jobs, energy and exports, the health of our economy and the health of our children are at risk.
Two out of three adults in Texas are considered overweight or clinically obese. The resulting higher risks of diabetes, heart disease and other weight-related health problems increase healthcare costs for many families and employers in South Texas and throughout the state.
If trends continue, projections show this obesity epidemic will cost Texas employers more than $30 billion annually in increased health care, disability, sick leave and lost productivity costs by 2036 -- the year a child born today will graduate from college. And an unhealthy workforce will discourage businesses from expanding here in the future.
But beyond the economic impact to the state, the most damaging cost is to our childrens' health. They follow our example and obesity among children is a nationwide public health crisis.
In Texas, 20.4 percent of children ages 10 to 17 are obese, compared to 16.4 percent of children in the United States. And studies show that obese children are more likely to be overweight or obese as adults.
That is not the legacy we want to leave for the Texas of tomorrow.
