The Governor's Committee on People with Disabilities today announced the winners of the 2015 Barbara Jordan Media Awards, as selected by a panel of judges consisting of journalists, professionals in the field of disabilities and individuals with disabilities.
"These awards are named for a remarkable woman who was known for breaking barriers and building bridges, and this year's winners reflect Barbara Jordan's spirit of inclusion with their respectful portrayals of people with disabilities," said Governor Abbott, "The First Lady joins me in congratulating the winners of the 2015 Barbara Jordan Media Awards. Your work reminds us that our lives aren't measured by how we are challenged; instead we are measured by how we respond to those challenges."
As part of the University of Texas at Austin's annual Heman Sweatt Symposium, the winners will be honored at the Barbara Jordan Media Awards Ceremony dinner in San Jacinto Hall on Saturday, April 18th at 6:00 PM CT. The event is hosted by the UT Division of Diversity and Community Engagement and is open to the public by reservation.
