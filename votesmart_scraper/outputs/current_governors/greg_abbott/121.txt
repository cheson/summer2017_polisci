First Lady Cecilia Abbott yesterday addressed "High Heels for Hot Meals," an annual event benefitting The Kitchen, which operates the Meals on Wheels program for Wichita Falls. Through her recently announced Texanthropy Initiative, Mrs. Abbott is promoting volunteerism and service to others as her primary focus as First Lady of Texas.
"It is an honor to be with so many who are willing to give of themselves to help others, which is precisely what you are doing by supporting The Kitchen and its four wonderful programs," the First Lady said. "Thank you for answering the call to serve your neighbors here in Wichita Falls."
In addition to Meals on Wheels, The Kitchen serves as the parent organization to three other programs serving the Wichita Falls community: the Red Door Senior Citizens Center, the Green Door Senior Citizens Center, and Kid's Meals. The mission of The Kitchen and its four programs is to "provide nutritious meals and complementary services" to the citizens of Wichita Falls.
