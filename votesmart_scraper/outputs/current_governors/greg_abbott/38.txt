County Judges and Mayors:
Thank you for your continued efforts to safeguard your communities against Zika virus. Your role as county judges and mayors places you at the forefront of emergency response. We know you are committed to protecting your community, and we are asking for your help carrying out certain critical functions in your jurisdiction. With the ongoing risk posed by Zika, we are requesting your continued assistance in delaying locally transmitted Zika virus in Texas this year by promoting precautions to prevent mosquito bites and taking action to reduce mosquito breeding grounds in your communities.
Due to the Zika virus' ability to cause birth defects, the public health measures we take together will help prevent serious health impacts on the next generation of Texans. We expect local mosquito transmission of Zika to resume and persist as the weather warms and mosquito activity increases. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) stands ready to provide technical expertise as you prepare your locality's Zika response plans or prepare to conduct community engagement efforts. Further, we ask that you please lead the organization of certain activities for your local community:
Coordinate community clean-up of areas known for having items or areas that collect water and allow mosquitos to breed around human habitation;
Host or ask volunteers to host community events for stakeholders to answer Zika questions, conduct clean-up demonstrations and provide educational materials;
Coordinate neighborhood outreach about precautions individuals can take to protect themselves and their families from mosquito bites; and
Initiate or enhance monitoring and surveillance of mosquito activity and accelerate mosquito abatement efforts, including use of larvicide.
