Governor Abbott Statement On EPA Water Regulations
Statement
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: May 27, 2015
Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today released the following statement regarding the federal Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Water Rule:
"The EPA's latest regulatory overreach represents a new level of absurdity by attempting to define ditches and ponds as part of the "navigable waters' under the Clean Water Act. It is clear this rule serves the sole purpose of enabling the federal government to regulate businesses and property owners on an increasingly granular level. The EPA's action is contrary to multiple rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court limiting its jurisdiction, and represents yet another power grab by the Obama Administration seeking to impose heavy-handed regulations on every facet of the lives of Americans."
