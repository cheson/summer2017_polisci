In the upcoming special legislative session, Sen. Bryan Hughes and Rep. Jason Isaac will author legislation that prohibits both state and local governments from deducting union dues from public employees' paychecks. This issue was one of the 20 items Governor Abbott previously announced will be added to the special session agenda. Governor Abbott thanked Sen. Hughes and Rep. Isaac for their work on behalf of Texas taxpayers.
"Texas taxpayers should not be on the hook for collecting union dues," said Governor Abbott. "The legislature made strides in advancing this measure during the regular session, and with the upcoming special session I feel confident we can get this measure across the finish line. I am thankful to Sen. Hughes and Rep. Isaac for working on behalf of taxpayers by filing this bill that will put an end to this practice."
"We're thankful for our government employees, and they're free to join whatever organizations they want to, but the taxpayers shouldn't be responsible for collecting their dues," said Sen. Hughes.
"Texans don't ask much of their government, but one thing they do expect is responsible and transparent stewardship of their hard-earned money," said Rep. Isaac. "Texas is a right-to-work state, and it's simply not appropriate for labor unions to be given preferential treatment. It's long past time to end the outdated practice of using taxpayer-funded resources to collect dues for private organizations."
