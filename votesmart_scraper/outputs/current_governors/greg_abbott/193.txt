Governor Greg Abbott appeared on Fox News' "Hannity" Wednesday to discuss his opposition to President Obama's plan to resettle Syrian refugees in the United States. Governor Abbott also emphasized that he and other U.S. governors have the legal authority to control refugee resettlement programs within their respective states.
"This is a very real situation that Texas is having to deal with," Governor Abbott said in the interview. "The narrative out there is absolutely false when they say Governors have no authority to do anything about this, because we do. Under Section 8 of the U.S. Code, Section 1522, it specifically authorizes the states to control these refugee programs."
