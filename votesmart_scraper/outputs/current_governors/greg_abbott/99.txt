Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today participated in a conference call for Governors hosted by the White House and led by Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell and Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden to discuss strategies to address the Zika threat and efforts to combat the virus.
"Texas is working with our local and federal partners to ensure Texans are protected from the Zika virus," said Governor Abbott. "With the recent floods, and as we enter the height of mosquito season, I encourage Texans to take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito exposure and heed all warnings and recommendations from health officials."
Governor Abbott has activated the Texas Task Force on Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response. The Task Force and the Department of State Health Services are currently finalizing the Zika Virus Preparedness and Response Plan.
The Governor is also working with federal and state agencies to determine potential funding available to aid local communities in addressing the Zika threat.
The most important thing Texans can do is to remain vigilant, including when traveling abroad to countries experiencing Zika outbreaks and eliminating standing water. For additional precautions and to find information on Zika in Texas, visit http://www.texaszika.org/.
