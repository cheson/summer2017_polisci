Location: Austin, TX

Governor Greg Abbott today announced that Jamba, Inc. will be relocating its headquarters from Emeryville, California to Frisco, Texas. Jamba is a leading health and wellness brand that owns and franchises Jamba JuiceÂ® stores, offering specialty beverages and foods. A Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF) grant of $800,000 has been extended to Jamba, Inc.
"Nothing is sweeter than another company moving its headquarters to the Lone Star State," said Governor Abbott. "Companies like Jamba relocate to Texas because of our prosperous economic environment, skilled workforce and low cost of owning and operating a franchise. I am proud to welcome Jamba to Texas as they continue to grow their brand through franchises across Texas, the United States and the world."
"Jamba Whirl'd Center" Facts:
25,000 square foot office and collaboration space in LEED certified, state-of-the-art facility in Hall Office Park in Frisco, Texas
Will include a world-class test kitchen for product innovation
Will employ over 100 people, including newly hired team members in Texas
Will serve as headquarters for company's operations, business development, sales and marketing, finance, supply chain, technology and human resources
The Texas Legislature created the TEF in 2003 and reauthorized funding in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015 to help attract new companies to Texas and expand existing businesses to create more jobs throughout the State. TEF projects must be approved by the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the House. The fund has since become one of the state's most competitive economic development tools.
