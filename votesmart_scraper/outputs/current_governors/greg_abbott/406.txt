Higher education is the ladder to success.
Our graduating high school students today are the workforce of tomorrow, and they must be equipped with both the technical and critical thinking skills needed to compete in our thriving economy.
Texas' diverse economy provides diverse job opportunities for Texans in every industry. These high paying jobs require more than just a high school education -- many require postsecondary education or training. Our high school students must learn to earn-- so Texans are filling Texas jobs!
Today, I unveiled the final phase of my Educating Texans plan, "Learn to Earn." This phase focuses on making our higher education system more affordable, accessible and accountable to Texans by:
-Incentivizing the state's institutions of higher education to improve graduation rates;
-Leveraging technology and online learning;
-Making sure tuition exemptions for military families are fully funded; and
-Elevating our national research standing.
We need to get more of our students graduating on time -- prepared to work, prepared to think, and prepared to earn. Read the final phase of my Educating Texans plan here.
For Texas,
Greg Abbott
