Governor Greg Abbott today appeared on Fox News Channel's The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson to discuss his call to support law enforcement following the murder of Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Darren Goforth last week.
"We're seeing Texans come together and say "enough is enough' when it comes to the attack on law enforcement in this state and in this nation," said Governor Abbott in the interview. "Americans are coming together because we know the vital role law enforcement plays in keeping America safe and it's time to honor those who serve."
