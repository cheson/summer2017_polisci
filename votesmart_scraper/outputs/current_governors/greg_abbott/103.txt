Location: Austin, TX

First Lady Cecilia Abbott today attended and led the Sickle Cell Association of Texas Marc Thomas Foundation's 5th Annual 3K Walk for Sickle Cell Disease. The annual event raises funds to help Texas families affected by sickle cell disease by helping to send children to Camp Cell-A-Bration, a free camp for children ages six to 14 with sickle cell disease.
The First Lady thanked those in attendance at the walk, calling them "an inspiring example of Texanthropy, which is Texans giving generously of their time, talent and treasure."
"As First Lady, my priority is motivating and encouraging Texans to help their fellow Texans through service to others, and that is what you are doing today by participating in this walk and "stepping towards a cure'," the First Lady continued.
The Sickle Cell Association of Texas Marc Thomas Foundation was stablished in 1997 by the late Pastor Marc Thomas, who suffered from the blood disease. The Foundation serves thousands of children, adults and families in Central Texas, San Antonio, the Texas Gulf Coast and other areas affected with sickle cell disease and those carrying sickle cell trait by providing education and outreach, raising awareness, holding support group meetings, and other assistance.
