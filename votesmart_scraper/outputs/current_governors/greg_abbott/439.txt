Justice will be served to those who take advantage of Texas consumers.
From stopping malicious Internet scams to exposing deceptive trade practices and Medicaid fraud, under Greg Abbott's watch, the Office of the Attorney General has litigated and enforced Texas statutes to protect Texas consumers.
During times of natural disaster, Greg Abbott worked aggressively to prevent disaster scams such as price gouging, deceptive door-to-door clean up and repair, and reprehensible fake charity solicitations.
One of the hallmarks of Greg Abbott's tenure as Attorney General has been the stopping of fraudulent, deceptive, and illegal practices within the healthcare system.
He promoted fair competition by healthcare providers, ended deceptive marketing of unproven dietary supplements, and took action to end fraudulent health discount cards from being sold to Texans without health insurance.
