Governor Greg Abbott today released the following statement after President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the United States Supreme Court:
"The U.S. Supreme Court and the United States is at a Constitutional tipping point. It is essential that the Supreme Court vacancy be filled with a true Constitutionalist in the form of Justice Scalia. Americans have grown concerned about the role of the Supreme Court in America today, and because this is one of the pivotal issues in the current presidential election, Americans should have the opportunity to vote for a president who will fill this vacancy."
