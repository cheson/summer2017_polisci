Texas Governor Greg Abbott today released the following statement regarding President Obama's announcement that his administration will seek a stay of the ruling by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas that halted the President's executive action on immigration:
"The President's stay request should be denied. A stay is typically granted to have the status quo maintained. Here the status quo is the immigration law passed by Congress, not the executive action by the President that rewrites immigration law. The President's lawless trampling of the Constitution thwarts the status quo."
