Governor Greg Abbott issued a statement following the passage of HB 4 to third reading by the Texas House of Representatives:
"The road to elevating Texas to become first in the nation for education begins with pre-k, and I applaud the Texas House of Representatives for recognizing the critical importance of providing high-quality pre-k for our children to build a strong foundation for future success. Today's vote is an important first step toward transforming the foundation of our state's early education system for generations to come, and I look forward to signing this legislation into law."
