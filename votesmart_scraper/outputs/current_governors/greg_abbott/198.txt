Governor Greg Abbott today released a statement following the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to halt President Obama's Executive Amnesty action.
"The court's decision is a vindication for the Rule of Law and the Constitution," said Governor Abbott. "The President's job is to enforce the immigration laws, not rewrite them. President Obama should abandon his lawless executive amnesty program and start enforcing the law today."
