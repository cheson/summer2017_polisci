Governor Greg Abbott today announced that LiveOps, the global leader in cloud contact center and customer service solutions, will relocate its corporate headquarters from Redwood City, California to Cedar Park, Texas. This relocation will result in the creation of 155 new jobs and $5 million in capital investment in the Lone Star State. A Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF) grant offer of $1.2 million was extended to LiveOps.
"Thanks to our low-tax, low-regulation environment that allows all businesses to thrive, the State of Texas has become the national leader for technology job creation, and we continue to attract tech companies from around the country and around the world," Texas Governor Greg Abbott said. "On behalf of the State of Texas, I am pleased to welcome LiveOps to the Lone Star State as the company seeks to transform cloud-based customer service. With their help, the State of Texas can, and will, continue to lead the nation in job creation within the technology sector."
"LiveOps is entering the next phase of its growth -- one that depends on ready access to a rich and diverse talent pool," said Vasili Triant, CEO of LiveOps. "Texas has become a respected international technology hub and maintains a vibrant community of technology talent in the Cedar Park area. We believe that this new location not only supports our organizational plans, but that it also affords our valued staff a family-oriented environment with a greatly reduced cost of living. We're looking forward to making Texas our new corporate home."
A new, 25,000 square foot facility for LiveOps will be built in Cedar Park, Texas. All of the company's 80 Redwood City, Calif.-based employees have been offered positions at this new Texas location or another U.S. LiveOps office.
