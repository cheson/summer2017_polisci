"I'm proud of the first responders across the State of Texas who have protected life as we've faced these challenges. We will continue to work collaboratively with local officials to do everything we can to keep the people of Texas, their families and their communities safe."
During the briefing, Governor Abbott was informed of the latest developments in the state's coordinated response to this tragic weather event including search and rescue missions, ongoing medical assistance, local cleanup efforts, power/utility issue resolution and providing shelter to those who have lost their homes.

With the current forecast indicating a possible continuation of inclement weather, the SOC -- in coordination with the Texas Emergency Management Council -- is continuing to monitor weather conditions and coordinate with the National Weather Service.
