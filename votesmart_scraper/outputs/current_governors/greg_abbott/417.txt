Location: McAllen, TX

Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott today unveiled a new set of policy proposals that will expand job opportunities for Texas veterans. Speaking to The American Legion in McAllen, Abbott emphasized the importance of encouraging and supporting entrepreneurship among Texas veterans. In discussing his proposals, Abbott offered the following recommendations:
*Facilitate employment of skilled veterans by waiving examination and fee requirements for veterans obtaining licenses issued by state agencies.
*To increase employment of veterans, allow for a local option property tax exemption for each newly-hired veteran by a commercial property owner.
*To increase entrepreneurship among veterans, exempt newly-created, veteran-owned businesses from the Texas Franchise Tax (margins tax) for the first five years that the business is in operation.
*Exempt newly-created, veteran-owned businesses from business registration fees.
*Implement strategic planning to prevent base closures in Texas during the next phase of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process.
In the included remarks, Abbott discussed his vision for Texas veterans, saying, "As governor, I have a plan to get vets back to work in Texas. I will work with community and military leaders to develop a plan that will improve infrastructure, job training and educational opportunities for military families. No state offers greater support for the mission of the military and its servicemen and women than Texas. I will keep it that way."
