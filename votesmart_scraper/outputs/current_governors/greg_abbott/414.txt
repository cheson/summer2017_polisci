Thirty years ago today, my life changed forever when my spine was crushed by a tree. The falling tree crushed my spinal cord -- piercing my body with pain -- leaving me forever paralyzed. I would never walk again.
Piecing my life back together began with doctors piecing my vertebrae back together. Those doctors inserted two steel rods up and down my vertebrae that will remain in my back for the rest of my life.
Some politicians talk about having a spine of steel. I actually have one. I will use my steel spine to fight for you and for every Texas family!
Texans aren't defined by the way we are challenged, but by how we respond to challenges.
Join with me in fighting for the ideals and values of the greatest people to inhabit this Earth: the people of Texas.
