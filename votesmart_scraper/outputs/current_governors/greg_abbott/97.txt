Public Statements
Federal Disaster Declaration Granted For Texas Counties
Press Release
By: Gregory Abbott
Date: June 11, 2016
Location: Austin, TX

The President today granted Governor Greg Abbott's federal disaster request for Individual Assistance for all 12 counties affected by the recent flooding, including: Austin, Brazoria, Brazos, Fort Bend, Grimes, Hidalgo, Hood, Montgomery, San Jacinto, Travis, Waller, and Washington.
Public Assistance Category B (Emergency Protective Measures) for local and state response costs and sheltering was also granted. Category A (Debris) remains on hold as water continues to recede, and pending additional damage assessments.
"I would like to thank the President and FEMA for their quick response in granting assistance to those affected by the severe weather and flooding of the past couple weeks," said Governor Abbott. "Texans have always risen to meet the challenges they face and this time will be no different. With this latest development Texans can now begin the process of rebuilding their lives after experiencing some of the worst flooding in recent history."
Additional counties may be added to the Governor's request for assistance once they meet the threshold required by the federal government to request federal disaster aid.
