Public Statements
Bill Cole Is Controlled by Special Interests
Press Release
By: Jim Justice, Jr.
Date: July 28, 2016
Location: Charleston, WV

Today, Senate President Bill Cole will head to Houston, TX for another fundraiser with out-of-state special interests. Like one of his used cars, Senator Cole is trying to sell himself to the highest bidder.
The powerful special interests are one of the reasons nothing ever gets done in Charleston. Bill Cole will do anything to lick the boots of big money donors-- including holding fundraising events during the state budget crisis.
Key Difference In The WV Gubernatorial Race: Bill Cole will sell out to anyone willing to open their checkbook, and Jim Justice can't be influenced by the special interests.
"All Bill Cole cares about is helping Bill Cole-- not the people of West Virginia," said businessman Jim Justice. "The special interests want Bill Cole because he's promising them a four-year lease to call the shots in our state. They'll never control me; I can't be bought."
