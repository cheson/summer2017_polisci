Today, Governor Jim Justice released the following statement:
Cathy and I are praying for the family and friends of the coal miner who lost his life last night in Wyoming County. It's never easy to see someone so young leave us and it breaks my heart when West Virginia loses a member of the coal community. I spent many years of my childhood in Wyoming County and my roots are deep there. Great coal mining families always come together, and that's what we have to do at this time.
