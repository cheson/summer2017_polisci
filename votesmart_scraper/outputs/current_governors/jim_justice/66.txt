this morning, surrounded by supporters, businessman Jim Justice filed the necessary paperwork to officially become a candidate for governor. Justice emphasized that his campaign will focus on creating jobs.
"Politicians just love to talk, but they can't create jobs; I can," said businessman Jim Justice. "I am tired of all the excuses in Charleston. If you're happy with the job the political class is doing, I am not your guy-- I will take this state where it's never been before. I'll take West Virginia on a jobs rocket ride like no one could ever believe."
Nick Casey will serve as treasurer for the Justice campaign. Casey is the former state Democratic Party Chairman under Governor Joe Manchin, and current treasurer of the American Bar Association.
Nick Casey stated, "There is nobody who understands how to create jobs better than Jim Justice. I am confident that Jim can truly change this state, and take West Virginia where we need to go. Jim's record demonstrates that he will be a fighter for working families, and I am proud to be a part of the campaign."
