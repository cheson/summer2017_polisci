Justice Statement On Special Session for Flood Recovery
Statement

Today, businessman Jim Justice issued the following statement on the start of the special session to address West Virginia's flood recovery:

"Governor Tomblin did the right thing and stopped Bill Cole's irresponsible plan to drain West Virginia's Rainy Day fund during the special session on the budget.

"The Rainy Day fund is for extreme emergencies like we saw this past June. Bill Cole wanted to raid the taxpayers' savings account in order to sweep the budget crisis under the rug in an election year. That's not leadership; that's a typical politician running for the hills.

"Governor Tomblin did right by our people and protected our cash reserves. I hope this special session moves quickly, and the recovery effort can continue without the politicians in Charleston slowing it down
