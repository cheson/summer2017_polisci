Today, businessman Jim Justice released a new television ad that focuses on his vision for creating new jobs and shoots down the dishonest attacks of Senate President Bill Cole. The spot will air across West Virginia on broadcast and cable.

"I'm no politician; all I care about is helping the people of West Virginia," said businessman Jim Justice. "If we all pull the rope together, we can get our coal miners back to work, bring new industries to West Virginia, and create good jobs. You can count on me to always give you nothing but the straight truth."
Bill Cole has been telling a lot of tall tales on the campaign trail. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported that Cole's attacks on Jim are "tenuous" and "out of context." Yesterday, well-respected radio host Hoppy Kercheval told Justice during an interview, "No, I don't think you gave money to Barack Obama. I'm with you on that." Listen to the audio here.

Yesterday, Jim Justice made it clear he won't be engaging in the presidential campaign. Read the full statement here.
