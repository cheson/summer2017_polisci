As governor, Jim Justice will:
Exempt the remainder of our veteran's military retirement from the state income tax -- a way to support our veterans since many surrounding states do not tax this income. The estimated cost is under $2 million; however, reducing this burden will attract many talented professionals to our state creating new jobs, growing revenues, and strengthening the workforce.
Continue improvements and enhancements to the Don C. Kinnard State Veterans Cemetery to honor our fallen heroes.
Work with our state and federal officials to improve medical care for our veterans in West Virginia.
