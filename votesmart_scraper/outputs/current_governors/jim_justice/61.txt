Today, the Jim Justice campaign for governor announced its leadership team for Kanawha County. As the campaign continues to ramp up and gain momentum, local leaders across the state are stepping up to help Jim win big in 2016.
"This campaign is all about creating jobs; no one in this race can match my record of putting people to work and that's why we are leading in all of the polls," said businessman Jim Justice. "I am fed up with our state being last in everything and all of the sorry excuses from the politicians. I am going to bring together community leaders from across the state to play a big part in my campaign to turn around West Virginia. From veterans to coaches to teachers to coal miners, we are building a strong team in Kanawha County and beyond."
"West Virginia needs a business person like Jim Justice to turn this state around," said County Commissioner Dave Hardy. "Jim knows how to create jobs, and that is what this state needs. We must not only vote for Jim, but we also need to work hard to help him transform the Mountain State."
Martha Walker said, "West Virginia needs Jim Justice, because he is passionate about the future of West Virginia and our people. He gives me hope that we can put people back to work and attract business to state."
