Jim Justice is calling on Senate President Bill Cole to take all the money he raises tonight at his campaign fundraiser and give it to the state of West Virginia to defray the cost of the taxpayer money wasted on not having a budget.
Cole has been criticized for not canceling tonight's fundraiser and not fulfilling his responsibility to pass a budget. There is still no budget, but Cole is still moving forward with his campaign event. Cole's failure to pass a budget has cost taxpayers $385,000.
"I will not take a salary as governor because I don't want anything from the taxpayers," said businessman Jim Justice. "Bill Cole should give every single dollar he raises tonight to the state. He's wasted time and taxpayer money all to benefit his campaign for governor. Since Bill Cole charged taxpayers $385,000 on this budget session; the least he could do is own up to his failure to pass a budget.
