Today, businessman Jim Justice announced he will participate in two statewide debates: the October 4th debate hosted by the West Virginia Press Association and the October 11th debate organized by the West Virginia Broadcasters Association.
"I'm looking forward to doing two high-quality debates focused on jobs and education," said businessman Jim Justice. "The people of West Virginia deserve better than a political sideshow. I want to share my vision and new ideas for creating jobs for West Virginia and transforming our education system. Politicians have made debates a circus, and are always trying to hide behind sound bites-- not me."
