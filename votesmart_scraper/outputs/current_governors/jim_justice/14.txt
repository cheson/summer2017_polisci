Today, Governor Jim Justice announced that he will sign House Bill 2459, legislation that exempts financially distressed hospitals in acquisition proceedings from going through the traditional Certificate of Need process.

The Governor partnered with Senator Ryan Ferns (R - Ohio) and Tom Takubo (R - Kanawha) to pass this important legislation to protect hospital jobs. HB 2459 will save 1,500 jobs at the Ohio Valley Medical Center in Fern's district.
"This legislation is important because it saves jobs and gives a lifeline to distressed hospitals in West Virginia," said Governor Jim Justice. "This was too important to let politics get in the way of doing the right thing for the people of West Virginia. Political party doesn't matter to me; I'm so thrilled Senator Ferns and I could work together on this project."
