Letter to West Virginia State Leaders - Sign Coal Commitment
Letter
By: Jim Justice, Jr.
Date: Sept. 13, 2016
Location: Charleston, WV

Dear Friend:
I am writing to ask that you join me in committing to fight for the future of West Virginia's coal industry and the safety of our coal miners. This is a critical election for the people of West Virginia, and I am reaching out to build a coalition in our state that is united and dedicated to putting our coal miners back to work.
I am sending this Coal Commitment letter to every legislator, legislative candidate, statewide candidate and officeholder, and our entire congressional delegation. This is not about Democrat or Republican; this is about standing united to keep our coal miners safe on the job and to put them back to work.
I have enclosed a Coal Commitment for you to sign. I hope that you will sign it, post it on social media, and return it so we can keep a running list on our website. We must all pull the rope together to demand a better deal for West Virginia coal and our mining families, from the Capitol in Charleston to Washington, D.C.
The Coal Commitment can be filled out online by going to www.JusticeForWV.com/CoalCommitment.
Transforming West Virginia requires a united front, and it cannot wait until after the election. We are all in this together.
Best,
