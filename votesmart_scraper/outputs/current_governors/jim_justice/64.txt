Location: Charleston, WV

Today, former West Virginia Governor Gaston Caperton announced his support for Jim Justice in the 2016 gubernatorial race. Caperton is backing Justice because of his proven record creating jobs, his passion for the people of West Virginia, and his drive to turn the state around.
"West Virginia needs a businessman like Jim Justice in the governor's office because he is prepared to create jobs on day one," said former governor Gaston Caperton. "He is not a politician--I wasn't either when I first ran for governor-- and Jim knows how to make big things happen. I've been impressed by everything Jim has accomplished, from rescuing The Greenbrier to putting more coal miners back to work. I've been there before, and I'll tell you that the only way to move West Virginia forward is to bring people together and rally the state around big ideas--I firmly believe Jim Justice can do just that."
"Governor Caperton always put the people of West Virginia first, and it means a lot to have him in my corner and his help turning around this state," said businessman Jim Justice. "I want greatness for West Virginia, and that starts with creating jobs for the working families in our state."
Caperton added, "Jim is one of the most qualified West Virginians ever to run for governor, and he is the best equipped to create jobs in every corner of the Mountain State. I look forward to helping Jim's campaign in any way I can."
