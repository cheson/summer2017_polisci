Statement On Budget Catastrophe
Statement
By: Jim Justice, Jr.

Location: Charleston, WV

Today, businessman Jim Justice issued the following statement on the state legislature's budget impasse:
"It's a real shame that the incompetent politicians can't even pass a budget--it's no wonder they can't create jobs, and West Virginia is 50th in everything. The political elites in Charleston wasted this session dividing our state, pointing fingers, and passing raw milk legislation. It's time for us outsiders to step up, create more jobs and turn this state around."
