Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin endorsed Jim Justice for governor. The Senator stressed Jim's record of putting people back to work and his vision for the future of West Virginia. Jim Justice leads in all of the polls, and this major endorsement adds even more momentum to his campaign.
U.S. Senator Joe Manchin:
"There are three extremely capable candidates in the Democratic race for Governor, but I believe that Jim Justice is uniquely qualified to handle the major challenges that West Virginia is facing. I saw first-hand the ability, experience and vision Jim has when he stepped up and saved thousands of jobs in West Virginia. I believe this is the type of leadership we need to lead our state through the next four years. As governor, Jim Justice will step to the plate and create opportunities for more jobs in West Virginia. That is why I am supporting Jim Justice for governor."
Jim Justice:
"It's truly an honor to have Senator Manchin on my team for this rocket ride to create jobs and transform West Virginia. I worked with Joe when we helped save The Greenbrier, and I could tell then that he loves this state as much as I do. I thank the Senator for joining this team that has so much momentum, and I look forward to working with Joe to turn this state around and put our folks back to work."
In the 2016 election, Justice has landed several high-profile endorsements, including the United Mine Workers, the West Virginia Education Association, the largest employee union at The Greenbrier, and former West Virginia Governor Gaston Caperton.
