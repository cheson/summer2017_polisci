Today, West Virginia Senate Minority Leader Jeff Kessler announced he is endorsing Jim Justice for governor. Kessler sought the Democratic nomination for governor this spring and is urging his supporters to vote for Jim Justice in the general election.
"Jim Justice is a proven job creator and the only one in this race who can put our people back to work," said state Senator Jeff Kessler. "Jim understands that we need to invest in public education, colleges and universities so our kids are ready for good paying jobs with benefits. I've been impressed with what Jim's accomplished at The Greenbrier and his passion for our state. I'm proud to support him in this campaign."
Justice said he is honored to have Kessler's support. Kessler will be helping the Justice campaign in the Northern Panhandle.
"Jeff Kessler is a good man who has dedicated his life to fighting for hard-working West Virginians," said businessman Jim Justice."Jeff has been extremely effective for the Northern Panhandle. He's never forgotten where he came from, and that means a lot to me. It's going to take all hands on deck to turn around West Virginia. I look forward to working with Jeff and all West Virginians who are ready to transform our state with new jobs and better schools."
