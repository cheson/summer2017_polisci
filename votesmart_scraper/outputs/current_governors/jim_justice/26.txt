Justice Promises to Bring Manufacturing Back to WV

Today, businessman Jim Justice announced his vision to revive West Virginia's manufacturing sector and expand the timber industry. Justice sees a path forward to spur furniture manufacturing rooted in West Virginia.
Jim's plan utilizes West Virginia's fast-growing forests, close proximity to two-thirds of the U.S. population, and current timber manufacturing operations.
"We need to use our world-class hardwoods and our proximity to major markets to make West Virginia an anchor for furniture manufacturing," said businessman Jim Justice. "It makes no sense to ship our valuable woods to factories in Mexico and China, we should be doing that work here -- significantly cutting emissions and transportation costs. When you go buy a crib or a coffee table, it should be made with our woods and stamped "Made in West Virginia.'"
The federal government subsidizes sugar, ethanol, and cheese. Jim will seek a federal subsidy for states that are over 70% forested to bring back the furniture making industry in the United States.
The environmental subsidy would be based on the huge contribution our forests are making to the cleansing of emissions from our air. West Virginia's forests contribute mightily to preserving clean air for our planet.
Justice hopes to add thousands of new jobs connected to timber and the manufacturing of floors, cabinetry, and furniture in West Virginia.
Senate President Bill Cole's reckless budget hurt the timber industry by forcing the layoff of 37 West Virginia foresters.
