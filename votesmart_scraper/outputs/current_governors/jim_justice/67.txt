Today, the Justice for Governor campaign released new polling numbers that show businessman Jim Justice leading his Democratic primary opponents, Senator Jeff Kessler and Booth Goodwin, by a wide margin. In December, the Justice campaign released polling showing Jim Justice with a 12-point lead over Senator Bill Cole.
"This race is all about putting people back to work, and I know how to create jobs because I've done it before," said businessman Jim Justice. "What this state needs most is new jobs."
Democratic Primary Poll
Jim Justice -- 39%
Jeff Kessler -- 19%
Booth Goodwin -- 13%
"The polling is clear: West Virginia is looking for a businessman, like Jim Justice, who has a record of creating thousands of jobs-- not professional politicians with lengthy careers in government," said Grant Herring, Justice for Governor spokesman. "Jim Justice has proven he is the most qualified to put people back to work. The ruling political class can't fix West Virginia, and that's why we need a leader like Jim to turn around the state-- just like he turned around The Greenbrier."
