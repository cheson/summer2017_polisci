Statement

Location: Charleston, WV

Today, businessman Jim Justice issued the following statement on the Miners Protection Act currently before Congress:
"I applaud Senator Manchin and Senator Capito for working together to move the ball forward for our retired coal miners. The rest of the politicians in D.C. need to do their job and pass the bill to help our retired coal miners and their families.
"It's not right that political games have held this up for so long. This country was built on the backs of coal miners and walking away from them now would be criminal."
