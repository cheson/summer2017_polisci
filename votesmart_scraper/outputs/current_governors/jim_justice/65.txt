Justice Statement On Coal Severance Tax
Statement

Today, Jim Justice released the following statement on the proposed coal severance tax cut:
"Let's be honest, a further cut in the coal severance tax will not reopen one coal mine or put one miner back to work. Even though these cuts would mean more money in my pocket at my coal operations, it's irresponsible at this time to do anything that will choke off support for fixing our crumbling roads and schools across West Virginia. It's not the answer to creating jobs. I've been in the coal business all my life, and I am completely committed to the future of coal and putting all our miners back to work. At a time when everyone is shutting down coal operations; recently I have reopened two major mining complexes and put over 250 miners back on the job."
