Press Release

Location: Charleston, WV

Yesterday, businessman Jim Justice visited Bridgeport High School in Harrison County and announced his plan to retrofit West Virginia's older schools, public buildings, and commercial properties. In Harrison County alone, 19 school facilities have been upgraded and are already seeing lower energy bills.
By making older structures more energy efficient, Justice wants to cut costs and put people to work. His initiative is budget-neutral and aims to lower utility costs by retrofitting public schools, hospitals, college campuses, airports, libraries, state agencies, and other old buildings across West Virginia.
Jim Justice will work toward the goal of $200 million in energy savings projects over the next 4 years, the anticipated utility cost reduction will be $260-$300 million over the next 20 years. This could generate roughly 1,000 West Virginia jobs (NAESCO.org).
Justice will encourage banks to make it easier to finance legitimate energy saving programs to reach the goal of $200 million by 2021. Retrofitting buildings will rein in energy waste, and improve indoor air quality with updated ventilation systems.
"At The Greenbrier we've cut costs and put people to work by investing in energy efficiencies," said businessman Jim Justice. "I want to retrofit buildings across the state so that we can cut utility bills and create new jobs."
JIM'S RETROFIT INITIATIVE
Cut Utility Costs And Save Money Long Term. Jim Justice wants to identify $200 million in energy savings across West Virginia. In 2010, $70 million was spent in West Virginia on utilities for K-12 public schools. Many places of public benefit can see a 25% to 30% cost reduction after a retrofit project is complete.
