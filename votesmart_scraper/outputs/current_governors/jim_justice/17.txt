Today, Governor Jim Justice made it clear that he is in favor of legislation to expand broadband access in West Virginia. The Governor and his administration support House Bill 2998 because it will provide incentives, like tax credits and loan insurance, to grow broadband in unserved communities by allowing for more last mile projects across West Virginia.
"I want to make it clear that my administration fully supports HB 2998 because expanding broadband is essential to creating jobs and improving the quality of life in West Virginia," said Governor Jim Justice. "We need to do everything we can to expand last mile projects that are so critical to linking families and businesses directly to broadband."
