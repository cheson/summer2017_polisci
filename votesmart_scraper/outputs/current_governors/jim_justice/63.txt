Justice Calls For Referendum on Prevailing Wage and Right-to-Work

Today, businessman Jim Justice announced that he is calling on the West Virginia legislature to put both prevailing wage and right-to-work on the ballot this year for a referendum to amend West Virginia's constitution. Because these are such important issues that would change the culture of West Virginia, Justice wants to remove special interests and politicians from the equation. Jim Justice realizes that turmoil like this will turn away major investors that could create thousands of jobs in West Virginia.
"Eliminating the prevailing wage and right-to-work are issues that are too important to leave in the hands of career politicians in Charleston; so, I want the people to decide," said businessman Jim Justice. "Even though I may have my own views, as governor, I will always support the will of the people. Washington-style politics have crept into Charleston and created a mess. Instead of the politicians and special interests dividing the state, we should let West Virginians vote on this."
Implementing referendums has been part of the West Virginia GOP platform for many years. To amend West Virginia's constitution through a referendum, each ballot question will need to pass both bodies of the legislature with a two-thirds majority and then be approved by a majority of West Virginia voters.
Justice continued, "I love our state, and I hate to see it so divided. We can cure it by allowing the people to make this call. Let's be honest, the politicians don't know how to create jobs-- the proof is in the pudding. There are enough people on the outside throwing rocks at West Virginia and trying to keep us down; that's why we need to be working together to put people back to work."
