Hire WV Workers To Rebuild Our Devastated Communities
Statement

Businessman Jim Justice is calling on all companies and government agencies taking part in the flood recovery effort to hire out-of-work West Virginians.
Justice is encouraging FEMA, WV state agencies, and businesses involved in restoring flood-ravaged communities to hire unemployed craftsmen and coal miners from West Virginia. The Justice Corporation has already requested for all of the recovery work being done at The Greenbrier to include as many job-seeking West Virginians as possible.

Jim Justice wants local workers on the job so the state can recover quickly.

"We are blessed to have so many talented workers across West Virginia who have the skills to rebuild communities devastated by massive flooding," said businessman Jim Justice. "I've asked the company restoring The Greenbrier to hire local people searching for a job, and I am calling on FEMA and other government agencies to do the same. The more West Virginians we put to work during the recovery, the faster our people can get back on their feet."
