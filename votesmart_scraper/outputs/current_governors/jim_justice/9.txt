Press Release

Location: Charleston, WV

Today, Governor Justice announced that he is putting the brakes on the recent announcement by the Division of Natural Resources to charge park visitors a $2 fee.
The Governor called the DNR announcement an error and ordered the pilot program canceled. The initiative was put in motion without the Governor's approval.
When Justice found out about the proposed park fees he canceled the pilot project.
"West Virginians are struggling and at this time there is no way I can go along with charging a fee to enjoy our state parks," said Governor Jim Justice. "The move was announced without my approval. It's a bad idea and I'm going to fix it."
Justice declared, "West Virginia's state parks will remain free and open to the public. When I see a mistake, I make it right."
