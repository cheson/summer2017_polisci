Location: Charleston, WV

Today, the WV Hospitality & Travel Association Political Action Committee (WVHTA-PAC) announced they are supporting Jim Justice in the 2016 election. The PAC is supported by leaders in the tourism industry who are excited to endorse one of their own for governor.

The PAC recognizes that Jim Justice, the owner of The Greenbrier and The Resort at Glade Springs has created and saved hundreds of new tourism jobs. This will be the first time that a candidate for Governor is from the tourism industry.

Jim Justice is tourism in this state, and we know that he will think big and will grow tourism jobs in West Virginia," said Dewey Guida, Treasurer of the WVHTA-PAC.
"Jim rescued The Greenbrier and has taken The Greenbrier to new heights that no one thought were possible. The tourism industry is proud to support one of their own who will help make our state a world-class travel destination."
"When it comes to tourism, we are only getting the parsley at the edge of the plate, and our state needs to make a stronger investment in tourism," said businessman Jim Justice. "The good Lord has blessed us with four beautiful seasons and so many tourism opportunities. I want everyone in the world to have a reason to visit West Virginia."
