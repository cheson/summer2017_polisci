Public Statements
Bill Cole Owes Jim Justice An Apology
Press Release
By: Jim Justice, Jr.

Location: Charleston, WV

It's bad enough that Bill Cole can't do his job and pass a budget on time, but now Bill Cole's campaign has resorted to calling Jim Justice a liar.
Cole is either trying to deliberately mislead people or has no clue what's going on. On two separate issues this week Bill Cole and his campaign made claims that are totally false.
Here are the facts and Bill Cole can decide if he wants to apologize.
2) After Jim Justice had turned down the state's $1.75 million sponsorship of The Greenbrier Classic, Bill Cole's campaign called Jim Justice a liar. Cole said the money in question was for 2017-- not this year.
THE TRUTH: The 2016 Greenbrier Classic will not receive state sponsorship. No taxpayer money has been issued to support The Greenbrier Classic this year. An open apology from Cole would be accepted.
2) After Cole had been exposed for trying to hold a fundraiser tonight with lobbyists, his campaign called Justice a liar and tried to deny it.
WOAY- News:
Cole consultant Kent Gates said, "They need to get their facts straight and stop lying about things. Just like Jim Justice's attack [Monday] about the Greenbrier, this is another lie."
THE TRUTH: Bill Cole is still having a lobbyist fundraiser during the budget crisis. It just got moved from Wednesday (5/25) to Tuesday (5/31). The only one not telling the truth about his event is Mr. Cole.
