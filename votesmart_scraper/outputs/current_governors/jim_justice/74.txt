Location: Charleston, WV

Today, businessman Jim Justice issued the following statement on the 2016 presidential race:
"I'm not a politician; I'm not going to get involved in the national political circus. I respect the office, and I'll work with whoever the next president is to bring jobs and opportunity to our state.
"Bill Cole knows I've never supported Barack Obama, and lying about me isn't going to get him elected.
"I've never given a dime to Obama and didn't vote for him either. The people of West Virginia know that I'm a businessman and a coal man, and I'm focused on putting our coal miners back to work and creating good-paying jobs across our state."
