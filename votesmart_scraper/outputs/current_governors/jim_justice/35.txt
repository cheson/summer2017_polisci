Today, Teamsters Local 175 announced their endorsement of Jim Justice in the race for governor. The Teamsters represent working families across West Virginia and are standing with Jim Justice because of his record of putting people to work.
"Working people in our state can't afford any more of Senator Bill Cole's agenda that cut wages, killed jobs, and wasted $600,000 of taxpayer money failing to pass a responsible budget on time," said Ken Hall, President of Teamsters Local 175 and General Secretary-Treasurer of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. "Jim Justice isn't a politician; he's a businessman who knows how to create jobs. He's on the side of workers. When Jim stepped in to save The Greenbrier, he immediately restored worker benefits that had been cut."
Hall added, "Jim understands how important it is for West Virginia to address its crumbling infrastructure. He will put people to work fixing our roads and bridges. Jim is the only candidate who will stand up to the out-of-state special interests that want to control our state. For working families in West Virginia, Jim Justice is the clear choice for governor."
The Teamsters are part of a broad coalition supporting Jim Justice for governor. On the campaign trail, Justice has talked about his ideas to make West Virginia a central logistics hub to lure more trucking and warehouse jobs to our state.
"I'm grateful to have the Teamsters in my corner," said businessman Jim Justice. "I'm running because I want to bring new jobs and opportunities to West Virginia. The politicians just don't get it; we need a governor who can get results."
