Today, Governor Jim Justice issued the following statement congratulating President Trump on his inauguration:
"Congratulations to President Trump on being sworn in today to lead our nation. Cathy and I are praying for our new commander-in-chief and the Trump family as our nation begins its next chapter. If President Trump and his administration succeed, West Virginia will succeed.
"Our new president cares deeply about the people of West Virginia. We now have a pathway to the White House, and President Trump and I will work together to bring opportunity and hope to West Virginia families.
"Political party doesn't matter to me. All I want is greatness for West Virginia, and I'll work with anyone who is ready to help me turn this state around. West Virginia will partner with this new administration to put our coal miners back to work, fix our roads and bridges, and expand tourism."
