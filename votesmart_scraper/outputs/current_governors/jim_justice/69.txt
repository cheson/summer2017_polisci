West Virginia's professional politicians have bent over backwards to protect their cozy relationship with special interests and advance their personal agenda, and Jim Justice wants to put a stop to that.
Jim will end the free lunch for politicians by:
Banning all fundraising activity during the regular legislative session for all state government officials. No elected official at the state level will be able to accept contributions during the legislative session or solicit political donations of any kind. Many states, including Maryland and Virginia, impose fundraising restrictions during legislative sessions.
Capping lobbyist meals for lawmakers at $75 per meal, and limiting the number of meals to four every year. No more than $300 can be spent annually by lobbyists trying to curry favor with state lawmakers.
Mandating that all legislators request an employment exemption from the West Virginia Ethics Commission, when seeking private-sector employment. It will establish a publicly available record of when members of the House and Senate are seeking outside jobs.
Requiring more transparency from "dark money" groups who try to influence West Virginia elections. Increasing disclosure will stop "dark money" organizations from playing shell games to conceal exactly where the money is coming from to pay for political advertising. West Virginians deserve to know who is spending money on our elections.
