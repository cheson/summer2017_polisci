Today, the campaign of businessman Jim Justice released a new TV spot, "Justice Knows Jobs." It highlights Jim's success in creating jobs in coal, agriculture, and tourism. The ad will begin airing today on broadcast and cable television across West Virginia.
" I understand jobs; the politicians don't," said businessman Jim Justice. "I've created thousands of good jobs in West Virginia, and I'll bring even more jobs as governor. There is no excuse for us being 50th in everything; I'll fix that by growing jobs and diversifying the economy."
