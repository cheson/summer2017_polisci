Today, the Southern WV Carpenter Locals PAC endorsed Jim Justice for governor. The Carpenters know that Jim Justice is the most qualified candidate to create jobs and will always put working families first.
"We are proud to stand with Jim because he knows how to create jobs and put people to work," said Chad McCallister, Council Representative for the Southern WV Carpenter Locals PAC. "Jim has the vision and the leadership to turn this state around and create opportunity for working families. Carpenters are ready to help Jim rebuild West Virginia."
"Our people are hurting; all they want is the opportunity to grab their dinner bucket and go to work," said businessman Jim Justice. "I know how to create jobs; I've put thousands of people to work. West Virginia is just too good to be 50th in everything coming and going, and I'll fix that as governor. I am honored to have the Southern WV Carpenters with me in this campaign to transform our state."
