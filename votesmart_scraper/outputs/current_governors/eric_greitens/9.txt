Today, Governor Eric Greitens announced that he is bringing the legislature back for a special session on Monday with one topic: the steel mill bill. At the end of the 2017 legislative session, some career politicians in the Senate blocked efforts to bring a steel mill and other projects to the state of Missouri. Those projects could create hundreds of jobs in southeast Missouri.
Governor Greitens released the following statement, "We are fighting to bring more jobs to the people of Missouri. Some career politicians failed to do their jobs and then went home. That's wrong. We're cancelling their summer vacations and calling a special session to get this done."
This issue was championed by Rep. Don Rone (R-Portageville)during the 2017 legislative session, and an amendment aimed at addressing the issue was passed by the House (148-2) but blocked in the Missouri Senate.
The special session will begin at 4:00 P.M. on Monday.
