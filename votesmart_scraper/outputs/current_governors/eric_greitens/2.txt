This morning Governor Eric Greitens sent the Steel Mill Bill to the Secretary of State to become law. The bill will help bring a steel mill and other projects that could create hundreds of jobs to the state. The Governor announced the signing in a Facebook video. The video states:
"Hey guys, hope everybody's doing great. I wanted to let you know we signed the Steel Mill Bill. So now, we're going to be able to bring a steel mill and hundreds of quality jobs to the state of Missouri. So proud of the work that so many of you did all over the state of Missouri to make this happen. And I wanted to let you know, leaving for the White House to talk with them about what we've done here in Missouri. About how all of us are standing up and saying really clearly: The people of Missouri don't want welfare. People want to work. So we're working to bring back American jobs. It is an honor to be working with you and fighting for you every single day. God bless you."
Governor Greitens will meet with President Donald Trump and other governors in the White House today to discuss workforce development and job creation.
