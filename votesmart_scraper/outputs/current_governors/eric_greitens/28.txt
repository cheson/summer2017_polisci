Greitens Statement on Latest Missouri Unemployment Rate
Press Release

According to data released by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, Missouri experienced the worst unemployment rate increase in the country. Missouri's unemployment rate jumped .4 percent from last month and is now above the national average.
"Under the leadership of career politicians, Missouri's economy has stagnated," Eric Greitens said. "More than 45 states have grown faster than Missouri since the recession ended and now this month we learned that Missouri experienced the biggest unemployment rate jump in the country. Missouri can't afford to continue business as usual in Jeff City. We need new leadership that's focused on jobs. That's what I'll do as Governor: jobs will be my number one job."
