Issue Position: We Can Improve Education for All Missourians
Issue Position

I believe every child in Missouri has the right to a first-rate education. Too many Missouri children and parents are trapped in failing schools. I will lead efforts to provide more choices and opportunities for kids who need it most. I strongly oppose "Common Core" and believe local parents and teachers -- not Washington bureaucrats -- should be in charge of our children's education.
