I believe in results and accountability. It's not enough to talk about solving problems; I believe that if you care about people, then you have to care enough to get results. We must ask of every agency of government and every line item in the budget, a simple question: what is your mission. What results did you produce for the money that you've spent? I pledge to shrink government, to eliminate waste and fraud, and to act as a budget hawk, who looks after your every dollar.
