Issue Position: The American Dream is Still Possible for All

I believe that the most vulnerable in our communities can still achieve the American dream, and live a life of meaning and purpose. Children in foster care, survivors of abuse, those who battle against learning disabilities, and so many others just need someone with compassion to understand and help. I promise that every day I will be a champion for those who our society has forgotten.
