When government over-regulates, over taxes, over spends, overreaches--it hurts our businesses, damages our hospitals, injures our middle class, and holds back those struggling to make it into the middle class. It makes life difficult for our teachers, and it threatens our freedom and our prosperity. We must eliminate burdensome regulations that are destroying jobs right here at home.
