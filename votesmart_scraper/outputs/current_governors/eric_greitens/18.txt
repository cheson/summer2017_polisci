Today, Governor Eric Greitens visited with first responders and those affected by last night's storms in Oak Grove. He posted the following statement via Facebook:

I'd ask all Missourians to stop today and say a prayer for the people affected by last night's storms. Families across Missouri were caught in severe rain, hail, and destructive winds that reached 152 MPH, particularly in a few towns on the western side of our state. It is God's grace that no one was killed.
Today, we visited with first responders and victims of the storm in Oak Grove. We were there as families dug through their destroyed homes to find precious personal items and anything they could save.

We also saw incredible resilience in this community. Dozens of volunteers and family members were out with wheelbarrows, work gloves, and the will to rebuild and recover. On the other side of this suffering is strength. And the strength of this community and this state was clear in the faces of everyone out in Oak Grove today
As a state, we are using every resource to work alongside those affected by this storm. Our emergency response teams deserve special credit for their exceptional work.

We know that Missouri's greatest resource is our people. And the courage and grit of our people was obvious today as we watched a community come together to support one another after last night's destruction. We'll be praying for those dealing with the damage tonight. Your entire state stands with you. Stay strong.
