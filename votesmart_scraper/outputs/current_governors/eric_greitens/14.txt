Joined by farmers and ranchers in Southeast Missouri, Governor Greitens held a signing of House Bill 662. The bill protects farmers and ranchers by increasing penalties for the off-label use of herbicides.
Governor Greitens said, "This is an important issue, both for the southeast region and for every one who values agriculture in Missouri. I am proud to stand up for our farmers. I'm also grateful for strong leadership from Rep. Don Rone who has been working hard to get this done. We're fighting for our farmers and ranchers to protect our state's top industry."

House Bill 662 increases the civil penalty for the off-label use of an herbicide on a crop. If the herbicide comes into contact with another person's property and causes damage, the Missouri Department of Agriculture shall have the authority to assess a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation. If the person who knowingly used the herbicide is deemed a chronic violator, then the department has the authority to assess a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation.
