I believe in the dignity of work. As Governor, my top priority will be jobs; to help build an economy that creates more private sector paychecks and bigger private sector paychecks. I've seen veterans come home and get a quality job and it's changed their lives, the lives of their families, and it's strengthened our communities. There's purpose and meaning and dignity in work, and as governor, I will build a prosperous state rooted in the values of hard work and personal responsibility.
