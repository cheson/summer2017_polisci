Today, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that they will extend the implementation of a rule affecting farmers across the country. Following a meeting at the Governor's office in Missouri, Administrator Scott Pruitt took action to ensure that Missouri farmers, and farmers across the country, have adequate time to comply with this rule. Governor Greitens made the recommendation at the request of farmers and ranchers across the state.
Governor Greitens released the following statement, "Administrator Pruitt proved today that the old way of doing business at the EPA is over and done with. We presented them with a problem, and they took quick action to begin fixing it. Missouri farmers have waited a long time for common sense government, and now it's on its way. I'm grateful for this new leadership, and look forward to continuing to work with this administration to curb regulations that are killing jobs and hurting our farmers. It's time for government to get out of the way and let our farmers farm,"
The release from the EPA is copied below.
