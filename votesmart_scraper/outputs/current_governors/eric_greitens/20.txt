Following news of the arrest of a Missouri man in connection with recent threats on Jewish Community Centers, Governor Greitens posted the following statement to Facebook:
An arrest was made this morning in connection with threats against Jewish centers and schools. The suspect is from St. Louis, and while the facts are still being determined and the authorities are still doing their work, it is shocking to learn that these disgusting actions might have originated here.
We have said before, and we will say again: Anti-Semitism has no place in this state. If you threaten religious institutions in our state, you will be found and brought to justice. We are grateful for the work of FBI and law enforcement on this case, and we pledge to support them however they need.
