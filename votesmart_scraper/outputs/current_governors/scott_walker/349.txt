Governor Scott Walker Delivers Remarks at La Crosse Area Development Corporation Meeting
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Dec. 8, 2015
Location: La Grosse, WI

Governor Scott Walker attended the annual meeting of the La Crosse Area Development Corporation (LADCO), where he discussed ways to grow the economy in La Crosse and improve workforce readiness with LADCO leaders.
"Wisconsin's unemployment rate is 4.3 percent, which is the lowest it's been since April of 2001, and La Crosse County is down to 3.1 percent," Governor Walker said. "This is great news for the people of Wisconsin, but our work is far from complete. We remain focused on building and maintaining a strong workforce, which is why we continue to invest in workforce development initiatives that provide our students with the practical knowledge and skills they need to obtain, family-supporting jobs. Investing in these initiatives ultimately boosts our economy by providing business and industry leaders with a dependable and capable workforce."
