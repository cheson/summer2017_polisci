Hi. I'm Scott Walker.
This week, at a family farm in Cecil, Wisconsin, I signed our Blueprint for Prosperity tax relief plan into law. We return the vast majority of the state's budget surplus back to the people who earned it -- you, the hard-working taxpayers of Wisconsin.
A typical homeowner will see their property taxes go down by more than $100 dollars. That means that property taxes on that home will actually be lower in December of 2014 than they were in December 2010.
We also added more income tax relief to what we enacted last summer. Because of that tax relief, the state will take less for withholding starting next week on April 1st. No fooling, that means a typical working family with two kids will see an extra $522 in their paychecks yet this year. That's real money.
Overall, we've reduced our tax burden by $2 billion. More money back in the hands of the consumers and employers in this state will lead to even more jobs and more prosperity for the people of Wisconsin.
