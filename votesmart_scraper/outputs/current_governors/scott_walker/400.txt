Governor Scott Walker joined Department of Workforce Development (DWD) Secretary Reggie Newson today in encouraging Wisconsinites to submit nominations for the first annual Wisconsin Job Honor Awards. The new award program celebrates those who have overcome significant barriers to employment, and recognizes the employers who hire them.
"The Wisconsin Job Honor Award is one more way to recognize employers and employees who have bridged the desire to work, with the appropriate skill set, to fill in-demand positions," Governor Walker said. "With proper training and necessary resources, people with the desire to work can overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of the freedom, independence, and confidence that comes from having a job."
