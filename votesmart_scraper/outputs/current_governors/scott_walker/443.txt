Freedom, endowed by our creator, defined by our Constitution, but defended each and every day by the men and women who proudly wear the uniform of these United States.
As you gather together with family and friends this weekend and celebrate the anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence -- I ask that you take a moment to pause and reflect on those whose selfless service protects the freedoms and liberties we cherish every day.
It's important to remember freedom is not free. It comes with a price paid for by the brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines serving at home and abroad. These military members protect and preserve the freedoms that our founding fathers risked everything for back in 1776. The ideas that all men are created equal and entitled to certain unalienable rights - among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
If you see a veteran or service member at a parade or community event over the holiday weekend, please take a moment to say thank you. Thank them for their service and for protecting our liberty because we should honor their commitment to freedom not just on Independence Day, but every day.
