Governor Scott Walker Releases Statement on Wisconsin Joining Lawsuit Challenging 111(d) Rule
Statement

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today released the following statement regarding the Attorney General's announcement that Wisconsin is joining a lawsuit challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) final rule:
Today, Wisconsin is joining 23 other states in a lawsuit challenging the EPA's final 111(d) Rule. This rule clearly exceeds the Obama Administration's authority while pursuing the least efficient way to make environmental gains at the expense of Wisconsin ratepayers and workers.
President Obama's unilateral action in pursuit of a purely political agenda could increase costs for Wisconsin ratepayers and businesses by up to $13 billion, unnecessarily harming families and killing manufacturing jobs throughout the state.
As the Attorney General takes necessary action to protect Wisconsin from the impact of the Obama Administration's overreach, the Department of Natural Resources will continue working with the Public Service Commission to fully evaluate the financial impact of the final rule.
