Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker was joined by community and state leaders, as well as citizens of Wisconsin in honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. today, celebrating his life and the lasting impact of his peaceful and courageous actions.
"Today, we celebrate a man who inspired a nation and called upon leaders to affect change," Governor Walker said. "Though he faced animosity for his beliefs, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. refused to abandon his ideals and fought for freedom and tolerance. His legacy continues to live on, and our nation is stronger and more unified thanks to his determination and efforts. Dr. Martin Luther King once said that darkness doesn't drive out darkness, light does. And hatred doesn't drive out hatred, love does. Let that love unite us - here in Wisconsin, across the country, and around the world."
Governor Walker attended two events commemorating the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his endeavors to achieve civil rights. The first event was the 18th annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. breakfast this morning, which was hosted by the YMCA of Metropolitan Milwaukee, followed by the 35th annual state of Wisconsin tribute and ceremony celebrating Dr. King's life this afternoon.
