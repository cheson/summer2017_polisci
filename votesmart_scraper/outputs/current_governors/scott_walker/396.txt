Location: Cameron, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined Mosaic Telecom employees and Barron County officials today in celebrating "October is Cooperative" Month. The celebration featured cooperative exhibits and displays, a Red Cross blood drive, a food drive for the Cameron food pantry, and other community-based activities.
"Wisconsin was one of the very first states in the nation to create legislation authorizing cooperatives," Governor Walker said. "Today, with over 700 cooperatives based in Wisconsin, we remain one of the top cooperative states. Mosaic Telecom, and other cooperatives like it, are crucial to Wisconsin's economy and help keep jobs and financial resources within our local communities."
