Statement

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker issued the following statement today regarding the scheduled vote by the United States Senate on House Joint Resolution 42, which overturns the unemployment insurance drug testing rule under the Congressional Review Act:
I urge members of the United States Senate to pass House Joint Resolution 42 and grant states greater flexibility in administering unemployment insurance benefits.
Here in Wisconsin, we want everyone who wants a job to find a job. We frequently hear from employers that they have available jobs but need their workers to be drug-free. That's why we want to expand drug testing for those seeking public assistance.
This is not an effort to prevent people from finding work. In fact, it works to remove barriers to employment. If someone fails a drug test, we will provide treatment to get them healthy and back into the workforce.
We believe public assistance should be a trampoline, not a hammock, and House Joint Resolution 42 will empower the people of our state to move from government dependence to true independence by helping them obtain and thrive in a family-supporting career.
