Governor Walker on State Transportation Budget: "Get it Done"
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 25, 2017
Location: Neenah, WI

Governor Scott Walker called upon lawmakers to get the state transportation budget done without delays at the site of the 10/441 project today. The call from Governor Walker comes in response to the suggestion that transportation be broken away from the full state budget.
"Delaying, or worse yet, returning to 2015 funding levels on the transportation budget jeopardizes the investments our budget would make in safety and maintenance," Governor Walker said. "I proposed a transportation budget months ago that provides significant funding increases for local governments to maintain our roads, keeps borrowing down at historically low levels, and invests in major projects to keep them on schedule. Our budget proposal proves you don't have to raise taxes or fees to have a safe and strong transportation network."
If the Legislature separates transportation from the overall budget process, projects across our state could face delays including 10/441 in Neenah, Interstate 39/90 from the Wisconsin/Illinois border to Madison, and the Verona Road project. It will also prevent more money from going to local governments to fix their roads and bridges.
