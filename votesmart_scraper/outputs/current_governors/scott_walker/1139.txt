Recently the PEW Center on the States released a study, which ranked each state's public pension system. Wisconsin's pension system (the Wisconsin Retirement System or WRS) is the only one in the nation to be 100 percent funded and it was labeled a "solid performer."
The reforms we enacted last year will only make Wisconsin's pension system stronger by protecting current and future retiree benefits and keeping the state fiscally strong. Because of our prudent decisions, state programs as well as our employers and taxpayers will not be under the imminent stress of increased taxes and/or cuts like other states. Wisconsin is leading the nation forward to a more prosperous future.
The PEW study also pointed out that Wisconsin is one of only seven states to have retiree health benefit obligations 25% (or more) funded.
