Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "HARIBO a Great Fit in Wisconsin."
Hi, Scott Walker here.
HARIBO just announced that they will open their first North American manufacturing facility right here in Wisconsin. The company's $242 million investment is expected to create 400 good-paying jobs. This project will mark one of the largest investments in new operations by an overseas company in Wisconsin history.
Over the past several months, HARIBO officials, state, local, and regional officials have all worked in cooperation to secure a site in Kenosha County that will be home to one of the largest confectionery manufacturing facilities in the entire United States. This major investment by HARIBO is more evidence that our economy and workforce are strong and our reforms are working.
More people are employed in our state than ever before, our unemployment rate is down to 3.7 percent, which is the lowest it's been since November of the year 2000. And the percentage of people working in Wisconsin is among the best in the country.
The bottom line is Wisconsin is working. And HARIBO recognizes Wisconsin is a great place to expand and that our people, our resources, and our business climate are all tremendous assets.
Together, we're working and winning for Wisconsin.
