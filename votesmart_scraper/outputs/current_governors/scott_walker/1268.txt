Today the State Senate passed Senate Bill 357 on a voice vote, which is a part of Governor Walker's Wisconsin Working plan. This legislation recognizes military training as meeting the requirements for certain state licenses.
"Allowing veterans to receive credit for the top notch training, education and experience they gained through the Armed Forces will make it easier for those returning to our state to reenter the workforce," said Governor Walker. "I would like to thank State Senator Terry Moulton for helping usher this bill through the State Senate."
