Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker announced that he asked legislators to remove the two proposed agency mergers from the budget, as well as asked the bill authors of separate merger legislation to not move forward. Governor Walker released the following statement:
After hearing concerns from legislators, stakeholders, and the WHEDA and WEDC Boards, we asked legislators to remove the proposed agency mergers from the state budget and we asked the bill authors to not move forward with the proposed separate legislation. My sincere thanks to the bill authors, Senator Gudex, Representative Hutton, Senator Roth, and Representative Ballweg, for their hard work and collaboration on these bills. Given the issues raised at the recent joint WEDC/WHEDA board meeting, it is not the appropriate time to pursue these proposals.
Governor Walker had proposed a merger of the Department of Financial Institutions and the Department of Safety and Professional Services into one regulatory agency for all businesses and a merger of the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) into one authority focused on housing and economic development.
