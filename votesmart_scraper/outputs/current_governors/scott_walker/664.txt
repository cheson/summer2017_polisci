Governor Scott Walker today welcomed Wisconsinites and visitors to the 165th Annual Walworth County Fair, located in Elkhorn. The fair runs August 27th through September 1st and coincides with the celebration of The Wisconsin 4-H Foundation's 100-year anniversary.
"Wisconsin fairs are the perfect opportunity to experience all that the state has to offer," Governor Walker said. "With delicious food, talented artists, truck and tractor pulls, a demolition derby, and other events and activities for kids of all ages, the Walworth County Fair is fun for the whole family. It is also an ideal occasion to recognize and celebrate Wisconsin's 4-H Foundation, founded here in Walworth County 100 years ago. In the past century, 4-H has made a tremendous impact on the lives of countless children, providing the opportunity for youth to pursue excellence in the areas of leadership, citizenship, and life-skills, thus helping transform the youth of today into the leaders of tomorrow."
A partnership between the University of Wisconsin Extension, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and county government, Wisconsin 4-H is an active organization whose primary objective is to promote innovation and learning for youth. Currently, 350,000 youth between the ages of 5 and 19 are enrolled throughout the state youth development programs, which offer diverse programs and projects encompassing all interests and relating to citizenship and civic education as well as personal development and leadership.
Governor Walker also declared Wednesday, August 27, 2014 to be "100 Years of 4-H in Walworth County Day."
