Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker announced the state Public Service Commission is now accepting applications for Fiscal Year 2016 Broadband Expansion Grants. Walker's 2013-15 state budget tripled the local grants to extend broadband to underserved areas of the state more quickly.
"Improving access to the digital marketplace for Wisconsin businesses is critical to the economic growth of our state," said Governor Scott Walker. "Reliable and efficient broadband ensures job creators can position themselves to capitalize on new technologies and access information they need to prosper in today's global economy."
Governor Walker established the program, which provides reimbursement for equipment and construction expenses incurred to extend or improve broadband telecommunications service throughout the state, in the 2011-13 biennial state budget. The recently-passed 2015-2017 state budget triples the total amount of grants to be awarded each year from $500,000 to $1,500,000.
