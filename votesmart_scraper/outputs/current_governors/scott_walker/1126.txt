Federal Government Approves Wisconsin's Family Care Renewal Request
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 23, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approved Wisconsin's Family Care renewal request. Governor Walker moved forward with a plan to remove the enrollment caps on Family Care last December.
In response to this announcement, Governor Walker released the following statement:
Both Democrats and Republicans support extending Family Care. The approval of our waiver today allows us to move forward on an issue that we can work together on.
Family Care provides patient-focused care that saves taxpayers money, while keeping people out of higher cost facilities. This program often integrates community based care which, when used appropriately, allows individuals receiving assistance to retain a level of independence that is not possible when care is provided through a full time institution.
The renewal of Family Care is a win-win for both taxpayers and those in need of assistance.
