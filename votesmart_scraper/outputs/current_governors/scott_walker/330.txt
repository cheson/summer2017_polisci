Governor Scott Walker joined faculty, staff, students, lawmakers, and community members at UW-Green Bay today to highlight his college affordability legislative package. This legislation targets ways to make higher education more affordable for Wisconsin's working families and students. Governor Walker discussed steps that have already been taken to make higher education more affordable in Wisconsin, such as the historic four-year tuition freeze for the University of Wisconsin System, and additionally explained how this legislation would help make higher education more accessible and affordable for Wisconsinites.
"One of the best things we can do for higher education in our state moving forward is to focus on making college more affordable for Wisconsin's students and families," Governor Walker said. "Part of this legislative package focuses on transparency so information, like cost and student loan rates, is provided upfront, enabling students and families to make the financial choices that are best for them. This knowledge will help students make informed decisions, making them more likely to obtain their degree in a timely manner and begin their career."
