Hi, Scott Walker here.
In this week's radio address, I want to talk about the positive path ahead of us as we continue our work together to build a better Wisconsin not only for today, but for the next generation.
We hit some major milestones during our first term. With our reforms - schools and local governments have saved more than $3 billion. We turned a $3.6 billion budget deficit into a surplus. And we lowered the tax burden in the state by more than $2 billion.
Now, we're busy working on the next state budget. Because of our prudent management of your dollars -- the taxpayers' dollars, we can make progress investing in our priorities.
That means we'll continue our work to create more good-paying, family-supporting jobs.
We'll ensure people have the opportunity to learn the skills that they need to get those high-demand, high-paying jobs.
We'll help people move from government dependence to true independence through work.
And we will build on the progress we've made in lowering the tax burden, so the hard-working taxpayers of this state get to keep more of your hard-earned money.
