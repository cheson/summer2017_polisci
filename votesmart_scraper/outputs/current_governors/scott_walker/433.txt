Governor Scott Walker Releases Statement on Wisconsin Department of Justice Lawsuit
Statement

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today regarding the lawsuit filed by the Wisconsin Department of Justice seeking a declaratory judgment to move Wisconsin's entitlement reforms forward:
Our most recent budget builds on our record of enacting big, bold entitlement reforms to restore programs to their original purpose--a safety net, not a hammock. We are focused on helping people move from government dependence to independence because we want people to know the dignity that comes from work.
In Wisconsin, we are taking a compassionate approach to ensuring individuals on certain public assistance programs are workforce ready. By requiring able-bodied adults to be drug free, we aren't making it harder to get government assistance; we are making it easier to get a job. Our reforms offer a hand up to those who need it, so they can get back on their feet through drug treatment and access to employment training.
As we work to implement our bold reforms, it has become apparent that the federal government is not accurately applying the law. As it relates to Wisconsin's FoodShare program, we are seeking a declaratory judgment from the court to ensure we can move our reforms forward and maintain federal funding for this program.
