Location: West Allis, WA

Today, Governor Scott Walker helped kick off the Wisconsin State Fair in a ceremony at State Fair Park in Milwaukee. The fair begins today and runs through Sunday, August 10.
"The Wisconsin State Fair is up there with Packer and Badger games, opening day at Miller Park, hitting the road on my Harley, and deer hunting, as some of my favorite Wisconsin traditions," said Governor Walker. "This 11-day event is a great way to feature the best of the best in Wisconsin -- from our livestock and agriculture, to our Made in Wisconsin products, to our great Wisconsin companies. Whether you come for the food (cream puffs!), the music, the rides, or the animals, the Wisconsin State Fair has something for everyone."
The Wisconsin State Fair hours are 8AM-11PM Sunday-Thursday, 8AM-12AM Friday-Saturday, and 8AM-10PM the final Sunday.
