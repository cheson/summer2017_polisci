Governor Scott Walker signed Assembly Bill 277 today at the Wisconsin Bankers Association Capitol Day in Madison. Assembly Bill 277 passed the Assembly on a voice vote and passed the Senate 20-12; it is Act 136.
"Thank you to Representative Dave Craig (R-Big Bend) and Senator Rick Gudex (R-Fond du Lac) for their leadership on this bill, which further streamlines government and brings administrative rules up-to-date," said Governor Walker.
Assembly Bill 277 -- streamlines regulations by modifying or repealing several obsolete administrative rules at the Department of Financial Institutions including:
Remote Terminals Accessing Financial Accounts -- modifies rules relating to chargeback procedures for disputed sales and customer liability for unauthorized uses.
Collection Agencies -- repeals rules about information that must be included by a collection agency in their advertisements. Individuals using a debit card to settle an account will be charged the same fee as those using a credit card to settle an account.
Adjustment Service Companies -- extends the hours when a debtor can review their account with the adjustment service company.
Mortgage Bankers, Mortgage Brokers, and Mortgage Loan Originators -- approval of a trade name for mortgage bankers, brokers, or loan originators no longer needs to be completed in writing.
Sales Finance Companies -- eliminates the rules provision which establishes a maximum rate at which a retail installment contract is refinanced or consolidated.
Review Procedure -- eliminates the requirement that an aggrieved party must submit eight copies of a notice of appeal to the Banking Review Board.
