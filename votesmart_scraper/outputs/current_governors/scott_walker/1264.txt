Location: Madison, WI

Yesterday the Legislature passed Governor Scott Walker's Wisconsin Working package. Specifically the Legislature passed AB 450, AB 429, and AB 438.
"Reforming unemployment benefits will ultimately improve the economic climate in Wisconsin," said Governor Walker. "Allowing unemployment recipients to gain useful job training without losing benefits will help those seeking work gain meaningful experience. State Representative Mark Honadel and State Senator Van Wanggaard did a fantastic job authoring and providing leadership on this important bill."
The Wisconsin Wins legislation, AB 450, was proposed by State Rep. Mark Honadel and Senator Van Wanggaard to allow Wisconsinites receiving unemployment benefits to take part-time training jobs with employers potentially looking for full-time employment. This legislation will allow current job seekers to receive training and demonstrate their skills for potential employers.
"Making it easier for veterans to find jobs is good for all of Wisconsin," said Governor Walker. "Eliminating barriers for veterans will help those returning home transition into gainful employment easier. I would like to thank State Representative Evan Wynn and State Senators Terry Moulton and Pam Galloway for introducing these bills and working to deliver them to my desk."
AB 429 and AB 438 remove employment hurdles for unemployed veterans, such as waiving the initial license fee for certain occupational licenses and allowing military training to fulfill requirements for specific professional licenses.
