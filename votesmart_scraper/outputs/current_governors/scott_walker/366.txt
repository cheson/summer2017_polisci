Governor Scott Walker toured the Sojourner Family Peace Center today as a part of Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Serving thousands of people every year, the Sojourner Family Peace Center is the largest non-profit provider of domestic violence prevention and intervention services in Wisconsin.
"We are committed to safeguarding and advocating for Wisconsin's most vulnerable," Governor Walker said. "In our most recent budget, we increased funding for domestic abuse grants, which help to support shelters like the Sojourner Family Peace Center. The work of this nationally-recognized shelter, and others like it throughout the state to protect victims and their families is remarkable, and we will continue to support important resources like these that work towards ending the cycle of domestic abuse in our state."
