Governor Scott Walker signed Assembly Bill 553 into law today at the Mathy Center in La Crosse. The bill relates to sales tax exemptions for occasional sales by nonprofit organizations in Wisconsin.
"Nonprofit organizations play a vital role in our communities and when it comes to raising funds for their cause, many of our nonprofits reach the limits currently in place," Governor Walker said. "Assembly Bill 533 increases the threshold for sales tax exemptions, which means fewer nonprofits will have to hold a seller's permit and collect and remit sales tax on their sales. Ultimately, this reduces the burden placed on nonprofits in Wisconsin and increases the money available to provide services to our communities."
Assembly Bill 553 -- increases the thresholds for the nonprofit occasional sales exemption from the requirement to collect and remit sales tax. Under current law, a nonprofit is required to hold a seller's permit and collect sales tax on its sales if the nonprofit make sales on more than 20 days during the year and those sales exceed a total of $25,000. The nonprofit is additionally required to hold a seller's permit and collect sales tax if they sell admissions to an event where the entertainment cost is greater than $500. This bill increases those thresholds to 75 days and $75,000 in total sales, as well as increases the entertainment threshold to $10,000. Authored by Representative Mark Born (R -- Beaver Dam) and Senator Richard Gudex (R -- Fond du Lac), the bill passed the Assembly with a vote of 92-0 and was concurred by the Senate with a vote of 32-0. It is Act 364.
