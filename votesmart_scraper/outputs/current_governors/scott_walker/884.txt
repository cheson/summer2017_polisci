Newly released data from the federal government's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) today show Wisconsin's economy is continuing to grow and continues to add jobs. Governor Scott Walker released the following statement on the new data:
The actual jobs data show Wisconsin's economy continues to move forward and create jobs. This jobs data lags by about six months, so it is important to look at all economic indicators to fully understand Wisconsin's economic performance. During the last six months, Wisconsin's economy saw the strongest job growth we've seen since 1997. Our unemployment rate is down to 6.5 percent, the lowest since 2008 and lower than the national rate, new business formations are up, housing permits are up, and tax revenue collections are up 8.4 percent over the last fiscal year. All of these and more point to a stronger Wisconsin, and more people are going back to work as businesses expand and create more jobs. This is in stark contrast to the four years before we took office, when 134,000 of our fellow citizens were left out of work.
Our economic and fiscal reforms are working, and Wisconsin continues to move forward in the right direction with a growing economy and more jobs for the people of our state.
