Protecting Life
"I believe government has no higher purpose than protecting its citizens, particularly those that cannot fight for themselves." -- Scott Walker
Tonette and I have a strong belief in the protection of all innocent life. That is why our family believes in the sanctity of all human life -- from conception to natural death. I am 100% pro-life.
In my campaign for governor, I am proud to have been endorsed by Wisconsin Right to Life, which recognized my long commitment to right to life issues and noted that my election "would greatly contribute to building a culture of life where the most vulnerable members of the human family are welcomed and protected."
I was also endorsed by Pro-Life Wisconsin which said that a Walker Administration "will have far-reaching, positive effects for Wisconsin citizens who value the dignity of all innocent human life."
