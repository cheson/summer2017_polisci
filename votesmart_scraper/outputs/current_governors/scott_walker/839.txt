Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Feb. 10, 2014
Location: Pewaukee, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker spoke with members of the Autism Society of Southeastern Wisconsin at the Successful Employment for Adults with Autism seminar and recognized contributing members of the workforce who live with autism.
"The Year of A Better Bottom Line focuses on the unique abilities of every individual," Governor Walker said. "People with disabilities have more than an ability to work, they desire to work. Individuals who are able to work gain dignity and pride in themselves. Today's discussion about adults with autism was enlightening and I hope it will lead to more businesses reaching out and seeking to employ adults with autism."
The Autism Society of Southeastern Wisconsin's mission is to improve the lives of all affected by autism. Founded in 1976, the non-profit organization provides public awareness on the challenges facing a person living with autism and offers services for those currently living with the disorder. The organization provides support and resources to parents with a child who has been recently diagnosed, workshops for educators, parents, and professionals, a lending library which provides up-to-date information and a resource directory for providers and agencies.
