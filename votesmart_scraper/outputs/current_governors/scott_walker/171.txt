Governor Walker Meets with Jalisco Governor Sandoval
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: June 15, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker met with Jalisco Governor Jorge Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz during the business development mission to Mexico leading up to the opening ceremonies of the CIGAL Trade Show, an international dairy trade show.
"Like Wisconsin, Jalisco is recognized as a leading dairy state," said Governor Walker. "We face many of the same challenges and this is a great opportunity to exchange ideas relating to dairy production, learn more about the market potential in Mexico, and build off our sister-state relationship we've had since 1990."
The purpose of the mission is to strengthen trade and investment ties between Wisconsin and Mexico. Mexico is Wisconsin's second most valuable agricultural export market, importing over $290 million in ag-related products in 2015.
"Just as we did during our trips to Europe, Canada, and the United Kingdom last year, we want to take this opportunity to promote Wisconsin's strong business climate and outstanding workforce as compelling assets for successful business operations in Wisconsin," said Governor Walker. "The state is strong, and this is the perfect time for businesses in Mexico to consider investing in Wisconsin."
