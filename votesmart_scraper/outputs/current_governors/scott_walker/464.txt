Governor Scott Walker joined members of the Boys & Girls Club and community leaders today in celebrating the positive impact and success the Boys & Girls Club of Walworth County has had with local youth since November 2013, when it officially opened its doors.
"Boys & Girls Clubs of America have provided a safe after school alternative for children across the United States for more than a decade and this organization provides youth with the tools they need to pave a path to success in the future," Governor Walker said. "The Boys & Girls Club here in Walworth County is no exception. Since they opened their doors, they have provided local students with tutoring and homework help, positive role models and mentors to look up to, and a productive space to unwind after school with their friends. The Boys & Girls Club of Walworth County is a great asset to children, the community, and the State of Wisconsin and helps the youth of today in building a strong foundation for tomorrow."
In the 2013-2015 Budget, Governor Scott Walker allocated $1.65 million in funding from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant for the Boys & Girls Club of America, which helped fund programs that improved the social, academic, and employment skills of low-income youth. These programs focused on teaching good study habits, intensive tutoring with special emphasis on the subjects of Math and English, and exposing youth to career options and role models.
