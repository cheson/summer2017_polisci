Governor Scott Walker, Major General Don Dunbar, and Wisconsin Emergency Management Administrator Brian Satula met in La Crosse today to tour damage caused by a storm Saturday night.
"Since summer storms change so rapidly, it is crucial for residents to be prepared and aware of impending weather," Governor Walker said. "Thank you to all of the emergency responders and local officials who worked diligently to assess damage and help with clean-up. I hope residents around the state take this opportunity to sign up for emergency alerts through Ready Wisconsin -- being well-prepared is the best defense when disaster or severe weather strikes."
The storm this weekend brought heavy rains and damaging wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour. Most of the damage occurred in the City of La Crosse and included downed trees and power lines. An industrial park by the airport sustained particular damage including siding and roof damage; several homes in the downtown area were also impacted. There were no reported injuries.
