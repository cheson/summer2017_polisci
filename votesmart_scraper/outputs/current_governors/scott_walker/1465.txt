Scott Walker, Milwaukee County executive and Republican nominee for governor, today released the following statement on Jim Doyle's continued funding of attack ads in the Wisconsin governor's race.
"Jim Doyle's additional $500,000 to the Greater Wisconsin Committee means that he has already spent $1.5 million in attack ads against me to ensure his handpicked successor, Tom Barrett, is elected to continue his legacy," said Walker. "The people of Wisconsin are sick and tired of the taxing and spending from Jim Doyle and Tom Barrett, and no amount of smear tactics will cover up their record of job losses and financial ruin. That's why the voters of Wisconsin are flocking to our plan to get government out of the way and bring 250,000 jobs to Wisconsin."
