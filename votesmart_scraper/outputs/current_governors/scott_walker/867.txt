Press Release

Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker delivered remarks at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Wisconsin (HCCW) Advanced Manufacturing Conference today to discuss the skills gap in Wisconsin and present awards for the Hispanic Business of the Year as well as Manufacturer of the Year.
"Business owners around the state repeatedly tell me the skills gap is a critical problem facing the state and their ability to fill jobs," Governor Walker said. "Many employers require more education than a high school degree, but less than a college degree, and connecting workers with the necessary training sets them up for success in a highly skilled career."
The Hispanic Chamber of Commerce continues to work closely with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to secure grants for a seed capital of Revolving Loan Funds (RLF). In 2013, the WEDC approved a grant to assist the Chamber to help offset the administrative costs associated with their goal of raising $5 million for the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Wisconsin--Community Development Fund.
WEDC's Minority Business Development office aims to qualify and extend small business loans to 30 certified minority businesses, and deliver specialized training for up to 50 small and mid-sized businesses, all in fiscal year 2014. The Governor's Task Force on Minority Unemployment has set high goals for the future: work with Revolution Labs to increase entrepreneurship; increase academic and career planning for Milwaukee-area students; use mobile labs to engage individuals seeking improved vocational skills; and promote careers in transportation by partnering with Schneider National.
