Governor Scott Walker Announces Kentucky Elk Released into Wisconsin Wild
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Aug. 24, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Twenty-three elk transported to Wisconsin from Kentucky as part of a plan to restore Wisconsin's elk population are now free to roam the Black River State Forest in Jackson County. The gates to a seven-acre acclimation pen are open, allowing the elk to roam as they please.
"We have reached another milestone in our efforts to reintroduce elk to Wisconsin," said Governor Walker. "The release of these elk marks a successful first year of a multi-year effort to establish a new elk herd in Jackson County and the Clam Lake area. A healthy and thriving herd will not only enhance our wildlife resources, positively impact tourism, and ultimately grow our economy. "
The elk were trapped in southeast Kentucky last winter and tested for disease before being transported to Wisconsin in March. Upon arrival in Jackson County, the elk were held in a secure facility to complete a second round of health testing and become acclimated to the area.
