One-Year Anniversary of the Sikh Temple Tragedy
Monday, August 5th was the one-year anniversary of the tragedy at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek. One year ago, in the wake of the senseless violence, our friends and neighbors in the Sikh community showed us the best way to respond to the tragedy was with love. It is amazing that in the midst of so much personal loss, the greatness of American character shines through.
Tonette and I join with others in our state and across the nation to offer our prayers and support to the survivors and families who lost loved ones as they continue to heal.
Tour of Storm Damaged Communities
Yesterday, I toured damage in New London caused by storms earlier this week, which affected Brown, Clark, Chippewa, Jackson, Outagamie, Marinette, Monroe, Waupaca, Winnebago, and Wood counties. Recent storms caused damage in many communities, and it was important for us to show our support for those affected.
The following state agencies have been directed to assist local communities:
- Wisconsin Emergency Management -- will work with local communities to review damage, coordinate resources, and apply for any assistance they may be eligible to receive. Updated information on the storm event can be viewed at www.emergencymanagement.wi.gov.
- Department of Administration -- will work with communities to make emergency assistance funds available to eligible homeowners for rehabilitation. Funds for qualifying businesses will also be made available as well as funds to repair public infrastructure, where eligible. Local communities should work with the Division of Housing to apply.
- Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection -- will connect affected farmers with crop damage and livestock shelter needs with assistance and counseling through its Farm Center and Animal Health Division. The connection can be made by dialing 1-800-942-2474. More information can be found using this link.
- Office of the Commissioner of Insurance -- will make available assistance for property owners filing claims. Homeowners can contact the OCI helpline for assistance with their homeowner insurance coverage. Individuals can visit www.OCI.wi.gov or call 1-800-236-8517.
