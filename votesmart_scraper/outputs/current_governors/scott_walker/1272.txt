Governor Walker issued the following statement today regarding the Legislative Fiscal Bureau Projections.
For over a year, we have been committed to making the tough choices to turn Wisconsin around. The numbers from the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau show that our tough choices have us heading in the right direction. According to the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau we will finish this fiscal year with a surplus.
Moving forward, we're confident in our ability to finish the biennium with a balanced budget. As we have done in the last year, we will continue to manage the Wisconsin taxpayers' money well, so we can keep the state's fiscal house in order. We'll keep our budget balanced without the job-killing tax increases implemented in the years before we took office; tax increases that led to over 150,000
Wisconsinites losing their jobs in the years before we took office. In contrast, we've added thousands of jobs this year, have the lowest unemployment rate since 2008, lowered the tax burden and will end the year with a surplus.
Our actions also stand in stark contrast to recent announcements by other states of what they are doing. In Illinois, Governor Quinn is proposing $2 billion in cuts to Medicaid and higher taxes, on top of the massive tax increase he implemented last year. In Maryland, the Governor proposed raising taxes by a billion dollars this year, including raising the gas tax by 18 cents. All told a Maryland family making about $30,000 a year would see their taxes go up 6%.
When compared to the past and to other states Wisconsin is heading in the right direction.
