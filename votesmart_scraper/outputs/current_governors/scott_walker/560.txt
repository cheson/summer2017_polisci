Governor Scott Walker kicked off his "Freedom and Prosperity for All" Budget Tour today by heading to La Crosse, Eau Claire, Stevens Point, De Pere, and Oconomowoc. The 2015-17 Biennial Budget is based upon growth and opportunity, which ultimately leads to freedom and prosperity for all.
"My family has helped to instill in me a deep belief in the possibility of the American Dream," Governor Walker said. "They helped me to realize that with hard work, I could achieve anything. I believe the same to be true for all citizens of Wisconsin, and the common-sense reforms we've included in our budget proposal will help to restore the American Dream right here in our great state."
