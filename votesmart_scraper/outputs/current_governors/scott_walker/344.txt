Governor Scott Walker Announces New Cyber Protection Team
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Dec. 14, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker announced today that the National Guard Bureau has selected Wisconsin to be the home of a new cyber protection team, to help Wisconsin and the nation defend itself from the ever-present cyber threat. Information technology exists in almost all of our daily tasks, and the cyber threat poses risks to Wisconsin's critical infrastructure, transportation systems, power grids, consumers using credit cards, and to individual citizens.
"A National Guard cyber protection team is a great resource and represents an opportunity for Wisconsin and the Midwest to effectively collaborate on cyber defense," Governor Walker said. "Our National Guard already has existing relationships with local governments and private industries, and this team will be a critical asset in sharing resources and defending our cyber infrastructure."
