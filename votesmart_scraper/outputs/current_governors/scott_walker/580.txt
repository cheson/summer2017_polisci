Hi, this is Scott Walker.
This past week, I gave my fifth State of the State Address and I'm proud to report the state of our state is strong.
Over the past four years, we put the power back into the hands of the citizens of this great state. In turn, Wisconsin is now more free and prosperous.
Today, more people are working, while fewer are unemployed. Budgets are set based on the public's ability to pay, instead of the government's hunger to spend.
School scores are up and more students are graduating, and we are helping more of our fellow citizens transition from government dependence to work.
The Wisconsin Comeback is working.
This session, I'm calling on the members of the State Legislature to pass legislation holding all schools receiving public funds accountable, giving parents the information and ability they need to decide what is best for their children.
Going forward, I want to make it clear no school district in the state is required to use Common Core standards. I believe curriculum should be decided at the local level, because parents, school board members, and teachers know what is best for our students.
My plan also puts an emphasis on streamlining government and removing bureaucratic red tape. I've asked the Legislature to consolidate several state agencies with overlapping roles, providing savings and improving services. Plus it's common sense.
In Wisconsin, we have a chance to lead and we are answering that call. We continue to make government more effective, more efficient, and more accountable -- and we will continue moving Wisconsin forward.
