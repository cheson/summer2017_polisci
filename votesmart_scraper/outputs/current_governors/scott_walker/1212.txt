Governor Walker Announces Cell Phones for Soldiers Program
Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Throughout the month of April, all Wisconsin state government agencies and the non-profit Cell Phones for Soldiers Inc. are teaming up to help troops call home by donating gently-used cellular phones.
"Cell Phones for Soldiers is a great way to honor our men and women in service as a part of observing the Year of the Veteran," Said Governor Walker. "Helping active service members to keep in touch with their loved ones honors the contributions of our veterans."
With ongoing deployments to combat areas and elsewhere, as many as 369,000 troops are serving in the U.S. military overseas. By donating gently-used cellular phones to Cell Phones for Soldiers, state employees can provide troops with that precious connection to loved ones back home.
In 2004, 12-year-old Robbie Bergquist and his 13-year-old sister, Brittany, founded Cell Phones for Soldiers. The charity has since provided more than 114 million minutes of free talk time to service men and women stationed around the world. On average, Cell Phones for Soldiers distribute 12,000 calling cards each week to bases around the world, care package programs, deployment ceremonies and VA hospitals.
"Each year we have been humbled by the amount of people and organizations that take the initiative to support our troops," said co-founder Brittany Bergquist. "We have also watched the communication gap between our armed forces and their loved ones continue to grow as more troops are deployed for their third or fourth tour overseas."
Donated phones are sent to Michigan-based ReCellular for recycling. For every donated phone valued at just $5, Cell Phones for Soldiers is able to provide two and a half hours of free talk time to deployed troops.
