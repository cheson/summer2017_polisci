Governor Scott Walker hosts the 24th Annual Governor's Blue Ribbon Meat Products Auction this evening, which directly benefits Wisconsin's 4-H Foundation and 4-H youth through leadership development, programs, and scholarships.
"Our state boasts quality agriculture products, from dairy and cheese to our meat products," Governor Walker said. "This is an event I look forward to every year, and it's a great opportunity to support Wisconsin agriculture as well as Wisconsin youth. The auction not only recognizes Wisconsin's excellent meat products, but also raises money for the Wisconsin 4-H Foundation, which in turn supports our state's youth by providing funding for conferences, teaching materials, workshops, and youth development programs."
