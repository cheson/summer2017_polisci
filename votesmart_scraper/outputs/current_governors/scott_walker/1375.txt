Today Governor Walker signed Senate Bill 93, legislation enacting concealed carry, into law.
"By signing concealed carry into law today we are making Wisconsin safer for all responsible, law abiding citizens," said Governor Walker. "This legislation has been in the works for a long time--I co-sponsored a similar bill when I was a member of the State Assembly. I am pleased the Legislature approved a bill that included training and permits. Today I would like to specifically thank Senator Galloway and Representatives Mursau and Suder for moving forward this important public safety bill. "
