Governor Scott Walker Speaks at Badger Girls State Inauguration
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: June 25, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Tonight, Governor Scott Walker addresses young women from across Wisconsin who were selected to attend the 72nd session of Badger Girls State. This is a remarkable 6-day experience in which participants are grouped into cities and counties, thereby forming a "51st state." Over the course of the week, students have the ability to elect their own representatives at a local and state level in order to carry out the functions of their cities, counties, and state, which provides them with a first-hand experience and deeper understanding of representation and government in the United States.
"Badger Girls State is an important program that will help these young women better understand how government works," Governor Walker said. "As they work together throughout the week they will also develop skills in communication, teamwork, and leadership, all of which I am sure they will carry with them as valuable tools to help them achieve much in their future endeavors."
Badger Girls State is a program of the American Legion Auxiliary Department of Wisconsin and is held annually with approximately 740 young women attending each year. First held in 1937, the program is hosted by the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.
In order to attend, students must be between their junior and senior years of high school. Candidates are selected by American Legion Auxiliary Units and local high school educators, who evaluate candidates based on several factors, including their academic record, character, participation in extra-curricular activities, and interest in government. All participants of Badger Girls State must rank in the upper half of their classes.
