Governor Scott Walker signs Assembly Bill 453, also known as the Family Care Bill, into law at the Rock County Courthouse in Janesville today. The bill requires that Family Care benefit and self-directed service options be provided in Rock County.
"Wisconsinites deserve access to quality health care options, where they need it and when they need it," Governor Walker said. "Without the legislation we are signing here today, the residents of Rock County would have to wait until Family Care 2.0 is implemented to get the care they need. This bill provides Rock County residents with a long-term care option that will improve patients' quality of life while also working to ensure they can remain as independent as possible."
Assembly Bill 453 -- requires the Department of Health Services to expand Family Care and IRIS programs to Rock County so the benefit is available by July 1, 2016. Authored by Representative Amy Loudenbeck (R -- Clinton) and Senator Stephen Nass (R -- Whitewater), the bill passed the Assembly on a voice vote and was concurred on by the Senate by a vote of 33-0. It is Act 127.
Family Care and IRIS services are currently available in 64 of Wisconsin's 72 counties, and the eight counties that do not currently operate Family Care and IRIS provide home and community-based services through existing legacy Medicaid waivers. By joining Family Care now, they can begin to reduce the wait list and save money in both the long term and the short term.
