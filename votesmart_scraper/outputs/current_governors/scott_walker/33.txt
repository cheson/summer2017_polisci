Governor Scott Walker addressed the Wisconsin Conservation Congress (WCC) today at its 83rd Annual Convention in Oshkosh regarding the state's efforts to protect Wisconsin's natural resources.
"Every year, tourists travel to our state to experience all of Wisconsin's natural beauty -- from fishing and hunting to spending time with family on our lakes and in the great outdoors," Governor Walker said. "The Wisconsin Conservation Congress helps us protect our natural resources as well as manage and conserve our environment. The feedback provided by Wisconsin citizens and WCC delegates every year during the spring hearings is invaluable to us and helps us with our ongoing efforts to preserve our land and water resources for generations to come."
Wisconsin citizens elect five delegates from each county to WCC, which works to advise the Natural Resources Board and Department of Natural Resources (DNR) on how to responsibly manage Wisconsin's natural resources for present and future generations. They accomplish this through open, impartial, broad-ranged actions.
On Monday, April 10, the 2017 Spring Fish and Wildlife Rules Hearings and Wisconsin Conservation Congress county meetings were held. Over 5,000 people attended these public hearings, which were held in all 72 counties at the same time. The hearings gave Wisconsin citizens the opportunity to comment and provide input on proposed fish and wildlife rule changes, Natural Resources Board advisory questions, and Conservation Congress advisory questions, as well as the chance to submit resolutions for changes they hope to see in future years.
Results of the hearings can be found here.
