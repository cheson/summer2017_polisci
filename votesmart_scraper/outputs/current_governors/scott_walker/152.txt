Hi, Scott Walker here.
On Monday, we celebrate the birth of our nation, as well as the freedoms we enjoy every day in America.
This year, we marked the 100th anniversary of the celebration of Flag Day, which started here officially in Wisconsin.
As you see the flag in your Fourth of July celebrations and parades, remember our Founders, who dedicated their lives to giving us the strong foundation upon which our nation is built. Also, remember those who served under our flag to safeguard our freedom and independence.
We honor those who currently serve in our Armed Forces. We thank you for your service and pray for your safe return home.
From our family to yours, Tonette, Matt, Alex, and I wish you a very safe and fun Fourth of July. God Bless America.
