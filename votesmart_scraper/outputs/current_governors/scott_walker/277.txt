Governor Scott Walker announced today more than 52,000 business entities have been created in Wisconsin since he took office, according to data released by the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (DFI). When Governor Walker ran for office in 2010, he promised to get government out of the way to help the private sector create 10,000 new businesses in Wisconsin.
"This news marks yet another important milestone for our state's growing economy," Governor Walker said. "With jobs and business creation on the rise and our workforce stronger than ever, we will continue to promote pro-growth policies that get government out of the way and help our citizens, businesses, and communities thrive."
