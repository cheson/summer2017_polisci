This week I joined a bipartisan group of governors, local policy makers and business leaders at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's 2012 Jobs Summit. We discussed policies that produce economic growth and examined how states across the country are increasing competitiveness.
A study was unveiled at the Summit, which finds that states that boost exports, foster innovation, provide businesses with certainty and reasonable taxes, insist on excellence in education, and prioritize infrastructure are leading on job creation and economic growth. The study, Enterprising States, was commissioned by the National Chamber Foundation and prepared by The Praxis Strategy Group. The Enterprising States study reported that we in Wisconsin launched several initiatives specifically focused on job creation, with a goal of creating 250,000 new jobs by 2015. Our "Wisconsin Working" plan, designed after gathering input from workforce and business stakeholders, is leading efforts to bring the state's colleges, government departments, and businesses together to reform and expand workforce training in the state. Also our "Wisconsin Workers Win" program will help individuals receiving unemployment take advantage of on-the-job workforce training, helping connect companies to workers who are looking to build new job skills.
It was wonderful to get a chance to talk about how we are transforming Wisconsin from the job loss in the past to the job growth we see today. I was honored to be on a bipartisan panel of governors talking about ways to further improve the economy in our states and our country.
Other governors participating in the Jobs Summit included Dave Heineman (R-Nebraska), Gary Herbert (R-Utah), and Jack Markell (D-Delaware).
