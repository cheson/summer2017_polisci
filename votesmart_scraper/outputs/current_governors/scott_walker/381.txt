Today, Governor Scott Walker toured Ministry Saint Joseph's Hospital in Marshfield to highlight their Project SEARCH partnership. Project SEARCH is a one-year transition program that provides training and education to young adults, ages 18-25, with disabilities.
"Project SEARCH programs, like the one here at Ministry Saint Joseph's Hospital, are helping our workers with disabilities acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to obtain employment," Governor Walker said. "This improves the bottom line for businesses in Wisconsin and spurs economic growth. More importantly, it allows our workers with disabilities to use their unique abilities in the workplace and demonstrate that their disability is only one facet of who they are as a person."
