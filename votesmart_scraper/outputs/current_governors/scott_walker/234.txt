Governor Scott Walker met with members of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers today to discuss ways Wisconsin can continue to strengthen its manufacturing industry.
"Manufacturing is a crucial industry in Wisconsin by contributing to our economic well-being and serving as a major employer throughout the state," Governor Walker said. "It was great to meet with members of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers and hear from them about what it takes to keep manufacturing strong. As we look for new ways to strengthen manufacturing, one of the most important things we can do is connect employers with skilled workers. That is why we will continue to invest in programs to provide our students with the practical skills they need to meet the ever-growing demand for quality workers in the manufacturing sector."
The Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM) is an international trade association based in Milwaukee representing more than 850 companies and 200 product lines in the agriculture, construction, forestry, mining, and utility manufacturing sectors. AEM members in Wisconsin support around 13,000 jobs across the state.
