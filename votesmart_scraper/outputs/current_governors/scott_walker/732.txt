Governor Scott Walker released the following statement congratulating the Milwaukee 7 on the federal designation as a Manufacturing Community:
I am thrilled to congratulate the Milwaukee 7 on being named one of the first Manufacturing Communities as part of the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP) initiative by the U.S. Commerce Department. This is a testament to the comprehensive work Milwaukee 7 is doing to develop our workforce, grow our economy, and create jobs. This designation will help boost economic development in the Transform Milwaukee area, and all of southeastern Wisconsin, which will have a positive impact on our great state.
Milwaukee 7 is one of 12 communities selected out of 70 applicants, for demonstrating the significance of manufacturing in the region, and plans to invest in six key areas: workforce and training, research, infrastructure and site development, supply chain support, trade and international investment, and operational improvement and capital access. The 12 designated Manufacturing Communities will receive coordinated support for their long-term economic development strategies from eleven federal agencies, including eligibility to apply for $1.3 billion in federal economic development assistance.
