Governor Walker Participates in Inauguration of the Hindu Temple of Wisconsin Expansion
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: June 25, 2016
Location: Pewaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined community members and presidents of the Hindu Temple of Wisconsin today at the inauguration ceremony of their temple expansions.
"The Hindu Temple of Wisconsin has been a model of volunteerism and service for nearly two decades," Governor Walker said. "The expansions here in Pewaukee will allow members of the Hindu community to continue long-held traditions of aiding the underprivileged and promoting unity among the various faith communities throughout Wisconsin."
The Hindu Temple of Wisconsin was originally completed in June 2000. This expansion was needed to accommodate a tremendous increase in the Hindu community. Completion of the Dhwaja Stambha, an essential flag column for all Hindu temples, and the new welcome center will help meet the worship needs of members and provide room for continued growth.
