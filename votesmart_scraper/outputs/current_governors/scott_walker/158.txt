Governor Walker Addresses Students at 2016 American Legion Auxiliary Badger Girls State
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: June 23, 2016
Location: Oshkosh, WI

This evening, Governor Scott Walker will address young women from across the state nominated to attend the 73rd session of American Legion Auxiliary Badger Girls State. Students selected to attend are grouped into cities and counties to form a "51st state," and have the ability to elect their own representatives and learn what it takes to run their city, county, and state.
"Badger Girls State is a unique experience that gives young women from throughout Wisconsin a fun, first-hand experience running city, county, and state government," Governor Walker said. "Learning in the classroom is obviously very important for the academic development of Wisconsin students, but there's also something to be said about opportunities like Badger Girls State, which allow them to take that knowledge and apply it in real life situations."
Badger Girls State is a program of the American Legion Auxiliary Department of Wisconsin. First held in 1937, the program has grown to host around 740 women every year at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.
To attend, students must be between their junior and senior years of high school. Candidates are selected by American Legion Auxiliary Units and local high school educators, who evaluate candidates based on several factors, including their academic record, character, participation in extra-curricular activities, and interest in government. All participants must also rank in the upper half of their classes.
Governor Walker has also proclaimed the week of June 19 -- June 24 as American Legion Auxiliary Badger Girls State Week.
