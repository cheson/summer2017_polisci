Democracy Requires Participation

The budget repair bill is now in the hands of the Legislature. Although it is getting a lot more attention than most bills, it is still just a bill working its way through the process. In our state, budget bills are introduced by the Governor, reviewed by the Joint Finance Committee and then brought before the State Assembly and State Senate.
Legislators can debate budget bills in committee and on the floor of their respective houses and offer amendments. Most importantly they have the responsibility to vote, much like citizens do at the ballot box during elections.
The public offered suggestions and we made changes to the bill because of their participation in the public process. I also applaud Assembly Democrats for publicly debating the budget repair bill I introduced two weeks ago.
In contrast, their counterparts in the Senate fled the state in an effort to prevent democracy from working, stifle debate, and ultimately try and negate the results of the election that took place last November.
The reason Senate Democrats claimed they left the state was because citizens needed more time to debate the issue. This is ironic because 12 of the 14 missing Senate Democrats passed Governor Doyle's budget repair bill, which raised taxes by a billion dollars, within 24 hours of introduction and without a public hearing in February 2009. Senate Republicans vehemently disagreed with the bill and the process Democrats used to ram it through; however they stayed in Wisconsin, debated the legislation and made the choice to participate in democracy by casting their vote in opposition.
The Legislation has been public for two weeks and the Joint Finance Committee listened to more than 17 hours of public testimony on the budget repair bill. Yet Senate Democrats still remain out of state endlessly holding media interviews.
