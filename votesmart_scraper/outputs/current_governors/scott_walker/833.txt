Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Feb. 17, 2014
Location: Neenah, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker addressed business leaders from Green Bay, Appleton, Oshkosh, Fond du Lac, and all of the Fox Cities, at the Northeast Wisconsin Chambers Coalition in Neenah.
"As I detailed in my State of State address our positive reforms are working and yielding results," Governor Walker said. "My Blueprint for Prosperity puts more money back into the hands of the hard-working taxpayers, so together, we can continue moving the economy and Wisconsin forward."
Blueprint for Prosperity:
Cut property taxes by $406 million. The typical homeowner will see a reduction of $101 dollars on their next property tax bill over their previous tax bill.
Cut income taxes by $98.6 million. Targeted to the lowest income tax bracket. Savings for a typical family of four making $40,000 will be $58. No one will get a bigger savings than that.
Adjust withholding for state income taxes by $322.6 million, so you can keep more of your hard-earned paycheck. Beginning in April, a typical family of four will see $57.90 more in their paychecks each month.
Increase the Wisconsin Fast Forward program by $35 million to focus on three new areas:
Invest in technical colleges to eliminate waiting lists for high demand fields including manufacturing, agriculture, and Information Technology;
Help high school students get training in high demand jobs through dual enrollment programs between our high schools and technical colleges;
Support the Year of the Better Bottom Line initiative, which helps people with disabilities enter the workforce.
