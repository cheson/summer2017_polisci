Location: Madison, WI

Together, state agencies and Kwik Trip collected more than 5,200 cell phones for the non-profit charity Cell Phones for Soldiers. In November 2012, Governor Walker announced state agencies would once again team up to help our troops call home. The collection was expanded to partner with Kwik Trip locations statewide.
"Our new partnership with Kwik Trip provided more than 13,000 hours of free talk time for service men and women," said Governor Walker. "Collecting cell phones to help our troops stay in touch with their loved ones is a great way to show our appreciation for all they do."
The Department of Administration, AT&T, and Kwik Trip, Inc. are partners for the Cell Phones for Soldiers campaign. State agencies partnered with AT&T and Kwik Trip to expand the Cell Phones for Soldiers campaign this past holiday season. The holiday season was the perfect time to collect phones for our troops as many people give and receive new phones as gifts.
With every donated phone valued at $5 or more, Cell Phones for Soldiers is able to provide two and a half hours of free talk time to deployed troops. Cell Phones for Soldiers has provided more than 114 million minutes of free talk time to our troops since they were founded in 2004.
