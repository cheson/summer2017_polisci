Governor Scott Walker Applauds Signing of Historic Universal Transfer Agreement for Students
Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

The University of Wisconsin (UW) System President Ray Cross and Wisconsin Technical College System (WTCS) President Morna Foy signed the Universal Transfer Agreement today, which allows students to transfer certain core general education credits between the two institutions. Governor Scott Walker introduced the proposal in the biennial budget last summer.
"This historic, common-sense agreement offers students greater opportunity and flexibility to build their skill sets and pursue higher education," said Governor Walker. "Our universities, colleges, and technical colleges provide a high quality education, and this transfer agreement removes barriers and speeds up the process for those working to finish their degree. Many times students are working their way through school or switching their major; easing the transfer of credits will reduce the cost and time it takes for students to reach graduation. I'd like to thank University of Wisconsin System President Ray Cross, Wisconsin Technical College System President Morna Foy, and their teams for working together to make this happen."
The Universal Transfer Agreement will go into effect on July 1, 2014. The Agreement identifies general education courses that students either at the UW System or at WTCS will be able to transfer to the receiving institution. All private or tribal institutions are welcome to participate. Students will be allowed to transfer up to 48 core credits, but are encouraged to still work with an academic advisor to ensure the most efficient transfer of credits.
