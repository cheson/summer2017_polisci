Governor Scott Walker signed six bills into law today assisting veterans and encouraging thriving veteran businesses and quality veteran homes.
"Our veterans have offered their time and talents in the service of our state and our country," Governor Walker said. "I am honored to sign these bills, which will assist them in their transition back home and ensure they receive the top medical care they deserve. Those who protect our freedom should have every opportunity for prosperity and independence in their own lives."
"Over the past three years, we have taken deliberate steps to improve the quality of life for Wisconsin's veterans," said John A. Scocos, Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs. "The legislation signed today will give us additional tools and resources that will allow us to continue to assist Wisconsin's heroes."
