Governor Walker Builds Trade Ties with China
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 12, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker met today with Governor Zhao Zhengyon of Shaanxi Province to increase Wisconsin's trade ties with China. China is currently Wisconsin's 3rd highest trade export destination after Canada and Mexico. Ten years ago it was 13th. Last year, Wisconsin sold $1.3 billion worth of products to China, about 6.7 percent of all Wisconsin exports.
"China is a major and growing export market for Wisconsin products," said Governor Scott Walker. "It's important for our state's economic recovery to continue to develop trade relationships with growing markets like China."
Wisconsin exports to China in 2010 were over ten times greater than what was sold there in 1998. The leading product categories in 2010 were industrial machinery, $421 million, electrical machinery, $250 million, and optical and precision/medical instruments, $232 million.
In addition to meeting with Governor Walker, the delegation from China also visited with Wisconsin companies with ties to China.
