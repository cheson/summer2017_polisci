In the last week, Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP) Secretary, Ben Brancel, traveled to China and signed a Letter of Intent making our state the preferred supplier of dairy goods and services to the Shanghai Dairy Group.
DATCP hosted the Shanghai Dairy Group during World Dairy Expo 2011 in Madison and introduced the Group to University of Wisconsin-Madison officials. Building off of this relationship, Secretary Brancel was on hand during a signing ceremony last week where the Shanghai Dairy Group and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, signed a separate Letter of Intent that will lead to the establishment of a university sponsored dairy technology center in Shanghai.
Secretary Brancel also met with other Chinese government officials and investors to discuss additional initiatives, projects, and potential partnerships. China has been an important agricultural trade partner -- in 2011, 41% of Wisconsin's ginseng crop was sent to China.
Expanding exports to other countries like China will help farmers and other agricultural related employers continue to grow jobs in Wisconsin.
