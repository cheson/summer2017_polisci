Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today issued Executive Order #157, which declares a State of Emergency in Wisconsin due to an increased likelihood of wildfires as a result of abnormally dry weather conditions throughout the state. The risk of significant large fires is expected to extend at least through the end of May.
"Much of our state is in a moderate drought at this time, and we're not expecting that will improve very soon," Governor Walker said. "The recent dry weather, in combination with other factors such as wind speeds and low humidity, create the perfect environment for volatile wildfires, which is a potential danger to the people of Wisconsin and their property, as well as our natural resources. Therefore, I am calling upon the Wisconsin National Guard to assist the Wisconsin Emergency Management and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in wildfire suppression efforts."
In addition to calling the Wisconsin National Guard to assist in wildfire prevention and suppression, Governor Walker also asks that all state agencies be ready to aid in potential wildfire response and recovery efforts. To ensure prompt response to a potential wildfire threat, the DNR is currently monitoring weather conditions and fire behavior, and fire departments and fire suppression resources are on high-alert.
