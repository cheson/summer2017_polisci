Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement regarding the FDA's response to concerns with the use of wood in the cheese-aging process:
Wisconsin's cheese industry is vitally important to our state, as well as the nation. I am pleased with the FDA's response to DATCP Secretary Brancel's letter, as well as others voicing concern, signaling their plans to engage members of the cheese industry as they evaluate the use of wooden shelves to age cheese, a process that follows sanitation procedures already established in Wisconsin. I look forward to working with the FDA and Secretary Brancel to ensure the use of wood in the cheese-aging process is able to continue in Wisconsin and across the country.
