Transcript below:
Hi. I'm Scott Walker.
Our state has a rich history of mining and of protecting our environment. In fact, our mining heritage is so great that mining is one of only four industries represented on our state seal. The others include shipping, agriculture, and manufacturing.
While Wisconsin has made great strides in supporting agriculture and manufacturing, the state has fallen short in supporting modern mining that can both protect the environment and create thousands of family supporting jobs. In fact, one company is considering a mine in Wisconsin that could employ 700 people with $60,000 salaries and benefits. These jobs would nearly double the median income in that region.
The job potential of the mine goes beyond these 700 jobs though. The construction of the mine would create over 3,000 jobs over two years - 3,000 jobs in one of the areas of the state that needs jobs the most.
And the jobs wouldn't be limited to just Northern Wisconsin. Almost 2,800 other jobs would be created in various parts of our state as products are made that the mine uses and the minerals are transported, produced, and packaged.
Two of the nation's premiere mining equipment manufacturers are located in Southeastern Wisconsin. There's a company in central Wisconsin that makes pumps used in mining. And there are manufacturers and foundries throughout the state including Western Wisconsin who would benefit from the mine. Businesses like these (from across our great state) would grow and add workers if we had a new mine.
