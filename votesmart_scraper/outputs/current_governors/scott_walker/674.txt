Today, Governor Scott Walker was in Eau Claire to deliver remarks at the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Energy Education Center at Chippewa Valley Technical College (CVTC). The Energy Education Center is an expansion and remodel of the current Transportation Education Center at CVTC's West Campus in Eau Claire.
"The new Energy Education Center will provide yet another way for Wisconsin's economy to grow and thrive, while equipping our workforce with the skills, training and programs they need in order to work in today's ever-changing energy industry," said Governor Walker. "This center will be a great resource for local communities and will facilitate exciting new opportunities and partnerships for businesses in the area."
The Energy Education Center is a 54,000 square-foot expansion and renovation project that includes classrooms and labs that will increase program offerings and help equip Wisconsin's workforce with the skills they need to address the demands of the energy industry. The Center will focus on three areas of energy technology: energy generation, energy distribution, and efficient utilization/conservation. The center is tentatively scheduled to open in fall of 2015.
