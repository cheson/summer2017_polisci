Governor Walker Signs Legislation Protecting Wisconsin's Children
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 19, 2016
Location: Green Bay, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed legislation today at the Brown County Sheriff's Department to protect Wisconsin's children from harm and to improve the way investigations are handled.
"Part of our job is to protect each and every person in our state," Governor Walker said. "We have a special responsibility to protect our most vulnerable -- Wisconsin's children. Assembly Bill 667 will help to improve child abuse and neglect investigations in cases that involve a child with a disability, and Senate Bill 325 criminalizes repeated acts of physical abuse."
Representative Joel Kleefisch (R -- Oconomowoc) and Senator Robert Cowles (R -- Green Bay) authored Assembly Bill 667, now Act 365, which requires the Department of Children and Families (DCF) to come up with ways to improve the way abuse or neglect cases against children with disabilities are handled.
Senate Bill 325, authored by Representative David Heaton (R -- Wausau) and Senator Robert Cowles (R -- Green Bay), now Act 366, goes after offenders who repeatedly abuse the same child physically. This bill is modeled after the current law which applies to children repeatedly sexually abused.
"We will continue to take steps to help those victims who are very young and often cannot speak for themselves," said Governor Walker.
