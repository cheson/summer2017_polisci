Throughout December homeowners received their property tax bills. The average property tax owner saw their tax bill stay the same or decrease for the first time in years.
Just last week I received a special letter from a Fox Valley area family. They said they were very thankful for our reforms, and they actually enclosed a gift card for the amount their family saved on property taxes this year. Gestures like this mean the world to me. Everything we've done is to lay the groundwork for a better future for the next generation, which is why I'll be donating the cards to various charities throughout Wisconsin.
The school portion of the property tax levy was down one percent across the state. It's important to point out that school tax levies increased on average $162 million a year--each of the last five years. By comparison, this year we put $228 million back into the pockets of property taxpayers in this area alone. That amounts to $69 for every man, woman and child in the state.
