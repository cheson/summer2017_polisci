Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today after the co-chairs of the Joint Committee on Finance released a memo on its procedures for the 2017-19 State Budget:
Thank you to the co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee for keeping the historic K-12 funding levels in place as they begin budget deliberations. As I have traveled to every county for listening sessions and visited schools districts throughout Wisconsin, one message is clear -- we need to take our Reform Dividend and invest it in K-12 education. That is what my budget does, and by keeping my proposal today, the Legislature recognizes the need to make public education a top priority.
