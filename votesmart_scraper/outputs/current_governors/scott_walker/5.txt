Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 231 into law today at the Wisconsin State Capitol.
"Senate Bill 231 is a win-win for Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "It not only brings us into compliance with federal law, it assists students to whom active duty service members have transferred their federal education benefits in pursuing a degree within the Wisconsin Technical College System."
Senate Bill 231 -- brings Wisconsin into compliance with federal requirements for charging resident fees to individuals receiving transferred benefits from active duty service members at technical colleges in Wisconsin. Federal law recently amended the definition of "covered individuals," expanding the pool of students who can use transferred benefits from veterans to also include active duty uniformed service members. Authored by Senator Jerry Petrowski (R -- Marathon) and Representative Ken Skowronski (R -- Franklin), the bill passed the Senate on a voice vote and was concurred by the Assembly on a voice vote. It is Act 24.
