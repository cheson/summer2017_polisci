Governor Walker Celebrates State Fish, Casts a Line at 40th Annual World Musky Hunt
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Aug. 25, 2016
Location: Lake Tomahawk, WI

Governor Scott Walker will join more than 70 people in Lake Tomahawk tomorrow for the 40th Annual World Musky Hunt. Contestants will fish with selected guides on the Lake Tomahawk chain of lakes from Thursday, August 25 -- Saturday, August 27, 2016.
"What originated as an opportunity to highlight our state fish -- the muskellunge, or musky -- has grown over the years to become a first-class competition drawing fishers from across the nation," Governor Walker said. "This is a great tourism event which puts Wisconsin on the map as the go-to destination for fishing."
The World Musky Hunt, an annual catch and release fishing competition, originated in 1977 as an event to immortalize the muskellunge, or musky. The event allowed the world to better understand the sport of musky fishing and worked to promote the beautiful state of Wisconsin.
Fishing in Wisconsin:
Wisconsin is home to more than 15,000 inland lakes, 42,000 miles of perennial streams and rivers, 1,000 miles of Great Lakes shoreline, and 260 miles of the Mississippi River. Anglers reel in 88 million fish every year and keep 33 million fish of all kinds. Walleye, bass, and panfish are among the most popular fish reeled in Wisconsin.
Sportfishing generates $2.3 billion in economic benefits and supports 22,000 jobs annually in Wisconsin. Fishing attracts more than 330,000 anglers to the state -- behind only Florida and Michigan.
Musky Fun Facts:
Wisconsin has 667 designated Musky Lakes and 100 river segments.
In 2015, the state stocked 121 waters with 11,950 going to the Great Lakes and 64,076 going to inland waters for a total of 76,026 musky.
Trends in the average lengths of musky captured in the Department of Natural Resources spring netting surveys show the size and structure of musky populations continue to improve.
The average length of all muskies captures has increased steadily since at least 1985.
Wisconsin claims the most world-record musky catches in the world.
