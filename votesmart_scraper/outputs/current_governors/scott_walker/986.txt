Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today after the 2013-15 State Compensation Plan was released by the Office of State Employment Relations:
"Because we made tough, but prudent, decisions over the last two years, we are now able to invest in our priorities. This includes an investment in Wisconsin's state employees. Our budget contains a reasonable one percent general wage adjustment per year over the next two years, which is the first for state employees since 2008.
"I'm confident the Joint Committee on Employment Relations will see the value in recognizing the efforts our state employees put forth every day. Their hard work, professionalism, and dedication helps improve the lives of our citizens and makes Wisconsin a better place to live.
"Our sound fiscal management is leading to greater investment and opportunity for all, and together, we're continuing to move Wisconsin forward."
