Statement on Tuesday's Election Results
Statement

Governor Scott Walker issued the following statement regarding this evening's election results:
Last November, the voters sent a message that they wanted fiscal responsibility and a focus on jobs. In our first months in office we balanced a $3.6 billion deficit and our state created 39,000 new jobs. It's clear the voters also want us to work together to grow jobs and improve our state.
With that in mind, earlier this evening I reached out to the leadership of both the Republicans and Democrats in the Assembly and State Senate. I shared with them that I believe we can work together to grow jobs and improve our state. In the days ahead I look forward to working with legislators of all parties to grow jobs for Wisconsin and move our state forward.
