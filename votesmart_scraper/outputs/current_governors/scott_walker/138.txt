By: Scott Walker
Date: July 12, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker declared a State of Emergency in eight Wisconsin counties today in response to flooding in northern Wisconsin. Heavy rains caused flash flooding, power outages, and damage to the region's roads and bridges. The counties included in the governor's declaration are Ashland, Bayfield, Burnett, Douglas, Iron, Price, Sawyer, and Washburn.
"Heavy rainstorms overnight caused widespread damage across the Northwest," Governor Walker said. "I express my thanks and appreciation to all of the first responders and officials in the area who are working hard to manage the situation. I am instructing the Wisconsin National Guard and all state agencies to aide those affected by the storms."
Governor Walker is joining Wisconsin's Adjutant General Major General Donald Dunbar, and Wisconsin Emergency Management Administrator Brian Satula this evening to speak with local residents and survey the damage.
The State of Wisconsin Emergency Operations Center was activated early this morning. State officials are working to assist counties in their response and recovery efforts.
