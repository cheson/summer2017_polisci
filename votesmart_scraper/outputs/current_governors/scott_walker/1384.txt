Governor Walker Statement on Balanced Budget
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: June 13, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Today the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau (LFB) released an analysis of the budget passed out of the Joint Finance Committee which showed property taxes would be virtually frozen over the next two years, taxes would go down, and there would be a budget surplus of more than $300 million. In response to this analysis Governor Walker released the following statement:
The budget I introduced, modified by the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee turned a $3.6 billion budget deficit into a slight surplus without raising taxes. It is a historic budget that protects core services and middle class taxpayers, saving the average homeowner $700 just in property taxes. It makes the hard decisions that other politicians avoided and lays the foundation for sustainable economic growth.
Putting state government back on sound financial footing is vitally important to ensuring that Wisconsin has a business climate that allows the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs by 2015.
