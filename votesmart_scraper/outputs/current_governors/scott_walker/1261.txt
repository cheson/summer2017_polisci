Governor Walker Renews Support for St. Croix River Project
Statement

Location: Madison, WI

Yesterday the Governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, imposed a March 15th deadline on the U.S. House of Representatives to pass S.1134, the St. Croix River Crossing Project, or he would need to repurpose the funds allocated to this project.
In response to this announcement Governor Walker released the following statement:
This St. Croix River Crossing Project provides a much-needed transportation solution, while maintaining a balance with the historic, natural, and scenic resources that make the St. Croix River Valley a treasure for residents and visitors alike. It is also estimated to create thousands of good-paying construction jobs in the region.
Without Minnesota's share of the funds, this much-needed project cannot continue. I am urging the U.S. House of Representatives to act quickly in bringing this legislation to the floor for a vote before its scheduled adjournment on March 8th.
Over the last three decades, Wisconsin and Minnesota have worked together on this project to ensure the best location was chosen, the best plan selected, and the quality of life in the River Valley would remain protected. I look forward to continuing this tradition of collaboration, but to do so Congress needs to take action now.
The entire Wisconsin delegation supports S. 1134 and the legislation holds wide bipartisan support at the federal, state and local levels.
