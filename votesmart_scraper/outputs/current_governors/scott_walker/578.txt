Governor Scott Walker today announced $250,000 in grants to 25 non-profit organizations providing financial assistance or other services to Wisconsin veterans and their families. The grants are administered by the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA).
"The great state of Wisconsin, and indeed our nation, is founded upon ideals of freedom and tolerance," Governor Walker said. "These ideals are a reality thanks to the selflessness and personal sacrifice of our active service men and women, and our veterans. While there are no words to adequately express our profound gratitude for their service, I am happy to announce today that our grants will aid Wisconsin's veterans and their families."
"These grants to non-profit organizations are a reflection of the Governor's belief and our belief that the veterans community is best served when all veterans organizations work together to provide the best possible services to veterans and their families," said WDVA Secretary John A. Scocos. "We are pleased to provide resources to and partner with these non-profit organizations to ensure that our nation's heroes receive the services they have earned by serving this great nation."
The Nonprofit Grant program was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Walker on April 6, 2014 and includes a maximum total of $250,000 for grants up to $25,000 for registered 501(c)(3) non-profits during the period of July 1, 2014 -- June 30, 2015.
Grant applications were considered by the Wisconsin Board of Veterans Affairs.
