Governor Walker Announces Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel Roundtable
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 11, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today announced that state energy officials will hold at least four public information sessions around the state to provide information to businesses and citizens about natural gas as a transportation fuel and identify opportunities to expand the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. Current market conditions result in compressed natural gas being the equivalent of $2 less per gallon than conventional transportation fuels.
"An increasing number of trucking companies, fuel marketers, engineering and construction firms, and other businesses have expressed their interest and excitement to the state about compressed natural gas for transportation use. Low natural gas prices combined with abundant supplies of a domestic fuel creates an opportunity we intend to harness to the benefit of individual citizens and our economic development efforts." said Governor Walker.
The information sessions will be at no cost to the public and the dates, times and locations will be posted on the State Energy Office website (http://www.energyindependence.wi.gov).
"Finding ways to provide manufactures with a competitive advantage through lower transportation costs aligns perfectly with our efforts to expand and grow business in Wisconsin," said Governor Walker. "I have directed my state energy officials to expand our outreach to ensure consumers and businesses are informed and positioned to take advantage of the opportunities CNG presents."
The information sessions will be coordinated by Maria Redmond and Peter Taglia of the State Energy Office, a part of the Division of Energy Services in the WI Department of Administration. Wisconsin Clean Cities and an advisory group made up of businesses from across the state have formed to assist the SEO in helping to expand the use of compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas and biogas as vehicle fuels in Wisconsin. This advisory group includes the following individuals:
· Andy Grimmer, President, ANGI Energy Systems, CNG fueling system manufacturer
· Bryan Nudelbacher, Business Analyst, U.S. Oil, Petroleum supplier with CNG fueling stations
