Governor Scott Walker Proclaims April as New Homes Month
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 2, 2013
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker proclaimed April as New Homes Month to highlight the economic impact each new house has on construction related jobs and to recognize the importance a home can have to a family.
"Every new house that is built provides a home to another family in Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "The construction tied to each new home supports at least three full-time, family supporting jobs. The economic impact of these homes is so important to the workers, community, and state since the value is felt at all levels."
New Homes Month is a chance to focus on the value of a home, both to the family living in it, but also to the community and workers that benefit from the construction. An average of $117 million in household income and $15.2 million in tax revenue is generated for every 1,000 new homes in Wisconsin.
