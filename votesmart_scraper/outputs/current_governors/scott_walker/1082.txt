Today, the Legislature announced their plan to introduce a bill to improve the process for obtaining a mining permit.
"I applaud the Legislature for focusing on mining legislation, which could lead to the creation of thousands of private sector jobs," said Governor Scott Walker. "Reforming current law to allow for a predictable and practical method to obtain a mining permit will help move our state forward. We will continue to work together with the Legislature to get a bill that reforms the permitting process, while keeping intact the environmental safeguards that protect our air, land, and water resources.
