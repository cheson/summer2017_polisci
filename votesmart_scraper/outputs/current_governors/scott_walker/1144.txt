Today Governor Walker delivered the weekly radio address that is titled "Organ Donation."
Transcript below:

Hi I'm Scott Walker.
Last week I had the pleasure of meeting a young man named Blake Parker. Blake is only 12 years old, but he's fought more battles than most people do in a lifetime.
Blake was born with a congenital heart disease (called Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome), and he needs a new heart. He's been on the transplant list for almost a year and a half.
I met with Blake because a friend of his family contacted my office. You see, Blake has a wish list, and one of the items on it, was a chance to meet the Governor. We played guitar together and sang. For a little guy with a failing heart, he sure does have a soul full of spirit.
Blake is one of 1800 people in Wisconsin waiting for an organ transplant. Across the country, every day, time runs out for 19 people on the waiting list.
It's easy to become an organ donor. You can sign up when you renew your driver's license and get the "donor dot" like I did, but you don't have to wait. You can get on the registry right now by going to YesIWillWisconsin.com. It could be a life-saving decision for kids like Blake, who, by the way, has a ways to go to complete his wish list. He also wants to meet Lady Gaga and Carrie Underwood. I would love to see that happen.
That's one of the things on my wish list.
The state has partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute brief radio address once a week. Audio files and a written transcript of this radio address can be accessed on http://www.wi-broadcasters.org and http://walker.wi.gov/Weekly-Radio-Addresses.
