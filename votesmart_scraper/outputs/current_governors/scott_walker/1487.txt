"I believe government has no higher purpose than protecting its citizens, particularly those that cannot fight for themselves like the unborn and elderly."
-Scott Walker
I am 100% pro-life and believe in protecting life from conception to natural death. As governor, I will protect the sanctity of all human life.

I am proud to be endorsed by Wisconsin Right to Life, which noted that my election "would greatly contribute to building a culture of life where the most vulnerable members of the human family are welcomed and protected."

I have also been endorsed by Pro-Life Wisconsin which said that a Walker Administration "will have far-reaching, positive effects for Wisconsin citizens who value the dignity of all innocent human life."
