Hi. I'm Scott Walker.
This week, another important part of our Blueprint for Prosperity plan went into effect. As of April 1, hardworking Wisconsin taxpayers will see more money in their paychecks each month -- and that's no fooling.
Because of the tax relief we've enacted over the last year, the state will now withhold less of your paycheck. For a typical working family -- mom and dad work with two kids -- you'll see approximately $520 more in your paychecks by the end of the year. That's real money.
By changing withholding tables, we're making sure you keep as much of your paycheck as possible. After all -- you earned it! More money in the hands of taxpayers will help grow our economy and lead to more jobs.
Since I took office, we've lowered the overall tax burden in the state by some $2 billion!
Gone are the days of billion dollar budget deficits, record job loss, and tax hikes. We're delivering significant property and income tax relief and moving Wisconsin forward.
