Hi everyone. Scott Walker here.
This week, the Badger men's basketball team ended its season in thrilling fashion -- with an appearance in the NCAA Championship game.
The excitement was contagious -- Wisconsin sports are a great unifier and the 2014-15 team will go down in team history as one of the best ever to play the game.
While the championship game didn't end up the way we hoped, the experience of watching the Badgers fight their way to the final was impressive and inspiring. Back-to-back final fours is an accomplishment many did not see coming.
Watching the way the players represented this great state, and the University of Wisconsin, in the national spotlight, was as much fun as the games themselves. The players showed class, talent, dignity and great the character we expectÂ…. Even in the shadow of defeat.
In fighting to bring home the national championship, this team left EVERYTHING out on the court. We couldn't ask for anything more.
Thank you to the players, the coaches, and the fans. You made Wisconsin proud.
