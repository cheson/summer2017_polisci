Governor Scott Walker joined cyber security experts today at Marquette University to discuss new cyber security challenges for the state of Wisconsin. The theme for the 2015 Cyber Security Summit is Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Governor Walker also proclaimed October as Cyber Security Awareness Month in Wisconsin.
"We live in an increasingly mobile world where people are constantly connected to the internet through their mobile devices," Governor Walker said. "Last year, thousands of Wisconsin citizens were victims of cyber crimes, and law enforcement officials estimate this threat will only continue to grow. Today's summit is an important opportunity for us to focus on preparing and protecting all Wisconsinites from cyber attacks."
