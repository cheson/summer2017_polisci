Whitetail Deer Trustee Final Report Released
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 10, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker's office released the final Whitetail Deer Trustee report. Governor Walker announced that he will work with Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Secretary, Cathy Stepp, and her team to review the report and move forward with implementation.
Along with the release of the final report, Governor Walker released the following statement:
Today's report marks the conclusion of an independent study aimed at evaluating our current deer herd management practices. Moving forward we need to act on the report to enhance Wisconsin's rich hunting tradition.
While DNR staff has worked hard, we need to do more to ensure hunters and conservationists have confidence in the department's ability to manage the deer herd. Dr. Kroll and his team have gone through an exhaustive process to receive and evaluate comments from the public. The input incorporated into this report from hunters and conservationists will help us restore trust in the DNR's ability to enhance Wisconsin's hunting heritage as we move forward with implementation.
I look forward to working with Secretary Stepp and her team to follow through on Dr. Kroll's report.
Last year Governor Scott Walker signed Executive Order #44, which created a Whitetail Deer Trustee position to independently and objectively review and evaluate Wisconsin's deer herd management practices.
