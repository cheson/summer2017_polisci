March is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month. Today, to mark the importance of this month, Governor Walker signed four bills to assist individuals with disabilities, all of which received bipartisan support. Governor Walker signed Senate Bill (SB) 377, legislation that changes the terminology for those with an intellectual disability.
"Changing state statute to eliminate the use of the "r' word in describing those with an intellectual disability is important," said Governor Walker. "I would like to thank former State Senator Pam Galloway and State Representative Erik Severson for introducing this legislation."
Assembly Bill 322, which provides accessible instructional materials for students with disabilities who are enrolled in the University System or Technical College System was signed into law.
"By signing this bill today I am ensuring that more students who are enrolled in the UW-System or Technical College System have access to learning materials," said Governor Walker. "I would like to thank State Senator Bob Wirch and State Representative Joe Knilans for delivering this bill to my desk."
Governor Walker also signed SB 353, which relates to the use of seclusion and physical restraint on pupils in public schools.
"Limiting the use of restraint in schools to times when a student's behavior presents a clear, present, and immediate risk to the physical safety of the pupil or others, makes sense," said Governor Walker. "State Senator Luther Olson and State Representative Steve Kestell should be commended for their hard work on this important piece of legislation."
Governor Walker also signed a bill that lifted the caps and expanded Family Care.
