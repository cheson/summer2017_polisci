By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Assembly Bill 384 into law today at the Wisconsin Energy Institute in Madison. The bill makes changes to the approval process of nuclear power plants and to the state's energy priorities policies.
"Nuclear energy is an affordable, environmentally safe, and sustainable alternative to fossil fuel," Governor Walker said. "The legislation we're signing into law here today at the Wisconsin Energy Institute provides the Wisconsin Public Service Commission with increased flexibility for Wisconsin's energy portfolio with the potential addition of nuclear facilities."
Assembly Bill 384 -- lifts the current moratorium on consideration of applications to construct nuclear generation facilities and places nuclear energy in the state's energy priorities law. Under the bill, regulators must consider sources, to the extent cost-effective and technically feasible, in the following order: energy conservation and efficiency; noncombustible renewable energy resources; combustible renewable energy resources; advanced nuclear energy using a reactor design or amended reactor design approved after December 31, 2010, by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and nonrenewable combustible energy resources. Authored by Representative Kevin Petersen (R -- Waupaca) and Senator Frank Lasee (R -- De Pere), the bill passed the Assembly on a voice vote and was concurred by the Senate with a vote of 23-9. It is Act 344.
