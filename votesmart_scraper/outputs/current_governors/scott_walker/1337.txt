Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 47 into law today which changes the makeup of the Small Business Regulatory Review Board. This bipartisan piece of legislation will increase the number of small business representatives on the board from six to seven and will eliminate the representatives from the following departments: DOA, DATCP, DCF, WEDC, DHS, DNR, DSPS, and DWD. The change seeks to improve Wisconsin's regulatory review process, increase compliance, and give small businesses a bigger voice in rulemaking.
"By reworking the representation on the board we are giving job creators a bigger voice in the states regulatory and rulemaking processes and that's good for jobs and economic growth," Governor Walker said. "I thank Senator Terry Moulton and Representative John Nygren for their leadership on this bipartisan bill."
Senate Bill 47 was authored by Senator Terry Moulton (R-Chippewa Falls) and Representative John Nygren (R-Marinette) and was passed in both the Senate and Assembly on voice votes.
