Governor Scott Walker issued this statement following the signing into law of H.R. 6014, the Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2012, by President Obama.
I am pleased the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate both passed H.R. 6014 and the President signed it into law. I have long advocated for expanding the DNA collection process for individuals, who are arrested and intend for it to be included in the state budget. This new federal law could prove to be helpful as Wisconsin looks to expand its own DNA collection program, and I look forward to working with the Administration and federal agencies on ensuring any Wisconsin program is a success. Similar enhanced DNA collection laws in other states have experienced positive results keeping citizens safer. Collecting DNA upon arrest could prevent future tragedies from occurring by repeat offenders. My priority with any DNA law in Wisconsin is to keep Wisconsin residents safe and to save lives.
