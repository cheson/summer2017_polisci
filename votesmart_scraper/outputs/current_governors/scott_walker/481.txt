To see the promise of the American dream, we need look no further than our country's small businesses: they represent opportunities seized, risks assumed and a chance for success and prosperity ahead.
Small businesses in this country are the building blocks for economic growth. If we want to create jobs and revive our economy, we need to put policies in place that support our nation's entrepreneurs and their enterprises.
The key is to foster an environment where start-ups can flourish, and in Wisconsin, we have made tremendous strides doing just that.
We've prioritized a special session on jobs, in part to address regulatory reform. This effort has led to the review and repeal of burdensome regulations. Cutting red tape and knocking down bureaucratic hurdles makes it easier for small business to get off the ground, to grow and to succeed.
Beyond reining in regulation, we've worked to increase funding for business accelerator programs in an effort to increase the number of start-ups in Wisconsin. Programs like these provide the tools and support aspiring entrepreneurs need to move from ideas to action.
