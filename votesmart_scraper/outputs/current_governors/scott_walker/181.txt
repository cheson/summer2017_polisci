Location: Prairie du Sac, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined Department of Health Services (DHS) Secretary Kitty Rhoades and Department of Workforce Development (DWD) Secretary Ray Allen today in congratulating six Project SEARCH graduates at Sauk Prairie Healthcare. Project SEARCH blends on-the-job training with classroom instruction to deliver vital career skills to students with disabilities.
"Project SEARCH remains committed to ensuring everyone who wants to work in the state of Wisconsin has the opportunity to do so," Governor Walker said. "This public-private partnership is an essential tool in advancing Wisconsin's economy and sponsors like Sauk Prairie Hospital play a key role in this effort by empowering and supporting youth with disabilities who are seeking to join the workforce."
In 2014, Governor Walker signed legislation that committed $35.4 million in additional funding to the Wisconsin Fast Forward (WFF) worker training program as part of the Blueprint for Prosperity Initiative. This funding included $850,000 budgeted towards expanding Project SEARCH across the state of Wisconsin, with the goal of bringing a total of 27 workforce development sites online over three years.
The Sauk Prairie, Reedsburg, Baraboo, and Lodi School Districts partner with Sauk Prairie Healthcare on the Project SEARCH program.
