Governor Walker Chairs Transportation Projects Commission
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 25, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker chaired the Transportation Projects Commission (TPC) today at the State Capitol demonstrating his Administration's deep commitment to improving Wisconsin's transportation infrastructure.
Today's meeting of the TPC was to provide current and new members with an overview of the Major Highway Projects' process and a status report on current and proposed transportation projects. Today was an introductory meeting--the TPC will vote on projects at future meetings.
"A smooth and reliable transportation infrastructure is vital to providing goods and services to and through Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "Our goal of allowing the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs by 2015 must be supported by a safe and efficient transportation system and this commission will aid in that effort."
The TPC seeks to:
* Approve potential major highway projects for environmental study.
* Recommend potential projects for enumeration after environmental study.
* Monitor ongoing project costs.
