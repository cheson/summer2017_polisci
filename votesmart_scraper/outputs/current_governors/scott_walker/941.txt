Governor Scott Walker announced today that the federal Department of Labor approved National Emergency Grant funds amounting to $807,193 for worker training for employees affected by the closing of the Kewaunee Power Station.
"This grant will provide much needed aid to the employees affected by the closure of the Kewaunee Power Station," Governor Walker said. "Now, workers will be able to be retrained for in-demand careers. Workers need appropriate training to be able to find work and meet the high-level qualifications employers require."
The Department of Workforce Development will administer the grant that will be operated by the Bay Area Workforce Development Board. Around 650 employees are affected by the closure of the facility. The grant will assist with training and finding new employment for workers. Individuals losing jobs due to this closure should contact their local Wisconsin Job Center to inquire about the services available.
