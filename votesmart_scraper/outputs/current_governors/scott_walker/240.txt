Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker announced $10.4 million in state funds today to complete 45 county highway improvement projects throughout the state. These funds are administered through the Wisconsin Department of Transportation's (WisDOT's) County Highway Improvement Discretionary Program (CHID).
"This program represents a state and local partnership to identify and complete key county highway improvement projects throughout Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "The quality of our state and local roadway networks serves as the foundation to support job growth and public safety."
CHID provides state funds for high-cost county highway improvement projects totaling $250,000 or more in total eligible costs. The 45 projects total nearly $55.4 million in overall project costs statewide. The CHID program can provide up to 50 percent reimbursement of total project eligible costs, depending on available funds and the total amount of awards granted.
Road improvement projects are selected based on recommendations from CHID committees comprised of county highway commissioners from each district. The construction timetable for each CHID project varies, but work will be completed over the next five years.
