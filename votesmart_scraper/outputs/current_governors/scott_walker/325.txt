Today, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau issued updated revenue projections. According to the LFB, Wisconsin will finish the biennium with a $135 million surplus. The current biennium is projected to end with a slightly higher cash balance than projected when the budget was signed.
LFB highlighted that state government is projected to spend less than previously expected. These updated projections also take into account the unexpected federal extension of a significant tax reduction for small employers. In December 2015, Congress made a Section 179 deduction for small business expenses, which was set to expire, permanent. While this will reduce state revenues, it will have a positive impact on our state's small business owners, helping them to grow their businesses and create jobs.
Governor Scott Walker released the following statement about the updated projections:
"Wisconsin is projected to finish the biennium with a $135 million surplus. We have a proven track record of keeping the state's fiscal house in order, and these projections show the impact of our sound fiscal management. Since taking office, we have ended every fiscal year with a positive cash balance. We will continue to prudently manage taxpayers' dollars while ensuring state government is more efficient, more effective, and more accountable to the public."
Wisconsin ended the most recent fiscal year with $135.6 million cash balance, up over projections. Overall, new bonding levels in the latest budget are the lowest in 20 years and the state's rainy day fund is 165 times bigger than before Governor Walker took office.
