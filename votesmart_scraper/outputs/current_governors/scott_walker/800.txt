Location: Green Bay, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined officials at Austin Straubel International Airport today to announce a $1 million expansion of the East General Aviation Ramp, with taxiway access, at the airport.
"Investing in our infrastructure is vital for growing and maintaining a strong economy," Governor Walker said. "Our roads, airports, railways, and ports connect businesses throughout the state and around the world. Companies need to have a reliable method of transportation, and visitors to our state expect an easy passage. This grant and expansion will ensure the Green Bay area remains competitive and open for business."
This is the third phase of the East General Aviation Ramp expansion at Austin Straubel; a 65,220 square-foot addition to the ramp will provide a connection to the primary taxiway to the main runway. Upon completion, the East Ramp will be 245,000 square-feet.
The expansion is scheduled to be completed in July, in time for increased traffic coming to the Experimental Aircraft Association's AirVenture in Oshkosh. The State of Wisconsin is contributing 80 percent of the funds with the airport and county contributing 20 percent.
Austin Straubel International Airport is the third largest airport in the state and one of two airports designated for international flight arrivals.
