Location: Madison, WI

Today, Moodys' released an article titled, "Wisconsin's Act 10 Ruled Unconstitutional; Credit Negative for Local Governments."
"Our budget reforms not only balanced Wisconsin's $3.6 billion budget deficit, but they also gave local units of government and school boards the ability to effectively manage their budgets," said Governor Scott Walker. "Moodys' statement about the recent court ruling underscores the importance of receiving a stay on the decision. Moody's recognizes the importance and positive impact of the reforms contained in Act 10. Hopefully local units of government in Wisconsin will not have to take on unnecessary debt obligation costs, which would likely fall on the next generation."
