Hi, Scott Walker here.
It's been a little over five years now since you, the people of Wisconsin, elected me to be the Governor of our great state.
Our goal has always been building a stronger Wisconsin with a government that performs well and at a good value to meet the needs of the taxpayers.
One of the first things we did when we took office was enact tough, but prudent reforms to get our fiscal house in order and ensure a strong foundation for future generations. This includes collective bargaining reform, which we introduced five years ago today.
Thanks to this reform, and others, the Wisconsin Comeback is a reality. Our state is strong and continues to move forward.
Last year, we saw the largest monthly jobs gain since April of 1992; our Labor Force Participation Rate is 68 percent, which is better than the national rate and puts us in the top ten states in America; and we ended the fiscal year with a $135.6 million budget surplus.
These are just a few of the good things that are happening in Wisconsin. Looking forward, we will continue looking out for Wisconsin's taxpayers by keeping more money in the hands of our hard-working families through a more effective government that works for the people of our state and provides the highest quality of service to our citizens.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute a brief radio address once a week. Audio files and a written transcript of this radio address can be accessed on http://www.wi-broadcasters.org and www.walker.wi.gov/media/weekly-radio-addresses.
