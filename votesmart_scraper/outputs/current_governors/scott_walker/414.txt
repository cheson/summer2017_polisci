Governor Scott Walker is hosting the Governor's Blue Ribbon Livestock Auction this evening at the Case IH Coliseum at the Wisconsin State Fair. This annual auction supports the Wisconsin State Fair Junior Exhibitors who raise and show the animals who have been awarded breed champions status in beef, sheep and swine. In addition to supporting Wisconsin youth in agriculture, the event focuses on the importance of the livestock industry in Wisconsin.
"The Wisconsin State Fair is built upon our state's identity as America's Dairyland and our strength in the agriculture industry, including our livestock industry," Governor Walker said. "The Governor's Blue Ribbon Livestock Auction not only highlights our agricultural strength, but also helps to ensure the future of agriculture in Wisconsin by supporting the youth exhibitors build a future in farming. Tonight, we celebrate the efforts and dedication of these youth exhibitors, and thank the buyers and supporters of the auction, whose proceeds go in part towards funding scholarships and grants for youth in agriculture."
