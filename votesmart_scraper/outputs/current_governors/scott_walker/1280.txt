Transcript below:
Hi, this is Scott Walker.
This week, I made stops in Ashwaubenon, Schofield, La Crosse, Cudahy and Chippewa Falls on our Turning Around Wisconsin tour. We heard from small business owners who are excited about growing in our state.
And the employees we met on our tour like our plans to connect job seekers to the job skills they need to get Wisconsin Working. They also like our efforts to improve education for all of our kids in this state.
They're proud of the work they do and the career that have chosen. And they appreciate our efforts to improve manufacturing in Wisconsin.
They know that we're turning things around. We're heading in the right direction. We're moving Wisconsin forward.
The state has partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute brief radio address once a week.
