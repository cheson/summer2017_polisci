Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Investing in Our Priorities."
Transcript:
Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
On Wednesday, the legislature's Joint Finance Committee wrapped up its deliberations on the budget, and now it moves onto the state Assembly and state Senate for consideration.
A few weeks ago, the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected increased revenues for this budget, and I called on the legislature to increase aid for public education and to increase my proposed tax cut for middle-class families. I'm pleased that the legislature's budget-writing committee has delivered more money for public schools and nearly $1 billion in tax relief for the hardworking taxpayers of Wisconsin, the largest tax relief package since 1999. This is great news for the people of Wisconsin.
Because of our sound fiscal management and our tough, but prudent, decisions we are now able to invest in our priorities. We're heading in the right direction, and we're moving Wisconsin forward.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute a brief radio address once a week. Audio files and a written transcript of this radio address can be accessed on http://www.wi-broadcasters.org and http://walker.wi.gov/Weekly-Radio-Addresses.
