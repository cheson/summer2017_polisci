Continuing to Strengthen Our Workforce

Hi, Scott Walker here.
Wisconsin was one of just ten states with a better average annual unemployment rate in 2015 than in 2007. That means we had a lower unemployment rate last year than we did before the recession. That's big news.
This data came from the U.S. Department of Labor last week and shows 36 states had higher unemployment rates, four states' unemployment rates stayed the same. Only ten states saw their unemployment rates decrease, and thankfully, Wisconsin was one of them.
Our state also has one of the highest rates of employment in the country. In 2015, we reached a level where more people were employed in Wisconsin than at just about any point in our state's history.
The biggest challenge we now face is finding qualified workers to fill all of our open positions. That's why we're moving millions of dollars into worker training, dual enrollment in our public schools, our technical colleges, and why we're freezing tuition on all of our UW campuses.
We can continue to grow as long as we can fill these positions, and we won't stop until everyone who wants a job, can find a job.
