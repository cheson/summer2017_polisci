Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 21, 2014
Location: La Crosse, WI

Governor Scott Walker today announced the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) will construct a new rest area along Interstate 90 near the state border in La Crosse to replace an aging facility.
"La Crosse continues to be a major area where visitors cross into Wisconsin, and their first impression is often lasting. This new rest area and space for the Convention and Visitors Bureau will allow us to put our best foot forward and give visitors the welcome they deserve," Governor Walker said.
The new facility will be built in 2016 in coordination with the planned I-90 reconstruction. Visitors to the rest area will be welcomed by staff year-round from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, with weekend hours from Memorial Day through October.
The current rest area opened in 1977 and features a short scenic trail with views of the Mississippi River, along with rest rooms, vending machines, recycling bins, and picnic and pet exercise areas. The rest area will continue to provide space for the state Department of Tourism and the La Crosse Area Convention and Visitor Bureau to assist travelers and provide information on state and local tourism attractions.
