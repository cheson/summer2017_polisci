Plexus Corp., Neenah, is planning to create up to 350 jobs related to the company's decision to establish a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Neenah. The company is eligible for $15 million in enterprise zone tax credits through the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC).
"This is a tremendous job creation investment being made by Plexus Corp. with the support of the state and city of Neenah," said Governor Scott Walker. "The decision by Plexus to do this major expansion and cement its operations in Neenah reflects the positive direction Wisconsin is heading."
Plexus Corp.'s proposed 410,000 square foot manufacturing facility will be the showcase for U.S. operations and provide for the increased space needed for future manufacturing requirements. The facility will cement the Fox Cities as the company's Americas Epicenter.
Plexus Corp. is a global leader in the highly competitive electronic manufacturing services (EMS) industry. Plexus integrates innovative product conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining services for its customers in global markets.
The tax credits will be distributed annually in direct relation to the number of jobs retained, new, full-time positions created and filled, and capital investment over a seven-year period.
