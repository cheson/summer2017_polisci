Governor Scott Walker visited the new Cancer Center of Western Wisconsin location in New Richmond today. The Cancer Center is a collaborative effort among area medical providers who partnered to offer the best possible patient care for people battling cancer.
"The Cancer Center of Western Wisconsin is an example of an incredible partnership between the six hospitals in the area," said Governor Walker. "This collaboration is an innovative approach, which affords cancer patients the convenience of the location that works best for them. I enjoyed the experience of touring the facilities, speaking with staff and seeing all they have to offer."
The Co-Op was formed in 2006 with the vision of "Ensuring all community members receive the most effective and specialized cancer prevention, treatment and recovery possible within the healing comfort and familiarity of their hometowns." The collaboration includes the Amery Regional Medical Center, Baldwin Area Medical Center, Hudson Hospital & Clinics, Osceola Medical Center, St. Croix Regional Medical Center of St. Croix Falls, and Westfields Hospital of New Richmond.
The Cancer Center's state-of-the-art facility in New Richmond opened in 2011 and is home for the Radiation Therapy Center of Western Wisconsin. Through a partnership with Minneapolis Radiation Oncology, PA, patients receive radiation therapy treatments at this facility. Chemotherapy services are provided at all six hospitals.
