Governor Scott Walker Releases Statement on Wisconsin Joining Lawsuit Challenging 111(b) Rule
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Nov. 3, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today released the following statement regarding the Attorney General's office joining a lawsuit challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 111(b) rule:
Today, Wisconsin is joining 23 other states in a lawsuit opposing the 111(b) rule issued by the Obama Administration. Like the other provisions of the EPA's Costly Power Plan, this rule also exceeds the administration's authority and further increases the cost of electricity for Wisconsinites.
The Obama Administration ignored the concerns submitted by Wisconsin and other states across the nation, instead pursuing a political agenda that will increase costs and prevent the construction of future power plants producing reliable, affordable electricity for our state.
We are deeply committed to protecting Wisconsin businesses and ratepayers from the far-reaching impact of these rules.
