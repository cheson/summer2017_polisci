Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 19, 2016
Location: Hudson, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 618 into law today at the St. Croix County Sheriff's Department in Hudson. This bill provides additional tools to combat child sex trafficking in Wisconsin and is one of several bills Governor Walker is signing into law today to shield the state's children from harm.
"It is crucial we protect Wisconsin's most vulnerable from this horrific crime," Governor Walker said. "Senate Bill 618 aligns us with the federal Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 and additionally strengthens our ability to quickly respond to and prevent child abuse in our state."
Senate Bill 618, authored by Senator Sheila Harsdorf (R -- River Falls) and Representative Amy Loudenbeck (R -- Clinton), now Act 367, aligns Wisconsin law with federal law by changing state statutes to strengthen the child welfare system's response to alleged cases of child sex trafficking. Under the new law, child sex trafficking is added to the definition of the Children's Code, child protective services is mandated to investigate all cases of suspected child sex trafficking cases, and law enforcement must report suspected cases to child protective services.
The new law strengthens Wisconsin's ability to better respond to the growing number of children falling victim to sex traffickers.
"We need to better identify potential victims and give our law enforcement and social service agencies the tools necessary to help those in need," said Governor Walker.
