Location: Madison, WI

Governor Walker released the following statement regarding the Reliable Home Heating Act, which was signed into law by President Obama on June 30, 2014.
Wisconsin and other states are actively working with the propane industry to address any potential supply and demand issues for the upcoming winter. Our goal is to take proactive steps to avoid having to utilize these emergency provisions. However, should the need arise in the future, this new law will offer states greater flexibility while keeping safety at the forefront of our actions, and it will also provide states with valuable information.
Bill Summary - Reliable Home Heating Act
Directs the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to recognize any 30-day emergency period declared by a state governor due to a shortage of residential heating fuel (and up to two additional 30-day periods) as one during which FMCSA federal motor carrier safety regulations shall not apply to any motor carrier or driver operating a commercial motor vehicle providing residential heating fuel in a geographic area designated as under a state of emergency.
Defines the term "residential heating fuel" to include heating oil, natural gas, and propane.
Directs the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, using data compiled from the Administration's Weekly Petroleum Status Reports, to notify the governor of each state in a Petroleum Administration for Defense District if that district's inventory of residential heating fuel has been below the most recent five-year average for more than three consecutive weeks.
Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to study the impacts on safety from the extension of exemptions issued by the state governors.
