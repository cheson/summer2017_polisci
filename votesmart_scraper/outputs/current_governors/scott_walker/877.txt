A Record of Caring About Wisconsin Tourism
"Wisconsin is the only state in the union to be surrounding by two Great Lakes and the greatest river in the country. We're filled with 15,000 inland lakes. We are a state blessed with tremendous natural resources, amazing attractions and rich history. Our state is a fun destination and that is why tourism is such a key part of our economy!" -- Scott Walker
Wisconsin's $12 billion tourism industry supports nearly 250,000 full-time jobs and billions in tax revenue. Sadly, the previous administration didn't seem to value the major impact of a strong tourism industry in Wisconsin.
In contrast, I am working to turn Wisconsin's tourism industry around and have increased the marketing budget for Tourism by over 50%.
As governor, I am committed to moving Wisconsin in the right direction by placing a focus on jobs and the economy. Through lower taxes and streamlined regulation, we can create over 250,000 new jobs and thousands of new businesses in Wisconsin. Now, is the time to expand the marketing of our tourism industry in Wisconsin -- as will bring more revenues and jobs into our state.
