Wisconsin's Economy is Turning Around Part 1: Unemployment Insurance Claims Dropping
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 26, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

After the first full 11 weeks of 2012, the average new claim total declined by almost one-fourth when compared to the first full 11 weeks in 2010. The average total of new Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims through the first 11 weeks of this year are one more indicator that Wisconsin's economy is headed in the right direction.
"Helping Wisconsinites get back to work and getting them off of the unemployment rolls is good for everyone in our state," Governor Walker said. "While I am encouraged by this good indicator that Wisconsin's economy is turning around, we still have a lot of work to do."
During the first 11 weeks of 2012, the average number of new UI claims has dropped by 23 percent percent when compared to the first full 11-week period in 2010, and by 12 percent when compared to the first full 11 weeks in calendar year 2011. Wisconsin has seen dramatic decreases in average weekly totals for initial claims, which haven't been lower for the 11th full week of a calendar year since 2005. In addition, continued claims have declined by 29 percent through the first full 11 weeks of 2012 compared to the first full 11 weeks of 2010.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the number of continued UI claims as one variable in calculating a state's unemployment rate, which at 6.9 percent is at its lowest point since December 2008.
