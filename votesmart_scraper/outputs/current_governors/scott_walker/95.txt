Hi, Scott Walker here.
Hunting is a time-honored tradition in our state, one I look forward to every year. And this Saturday marks the kickoff of this year's nine-day gun deer hunting season throughout the state.
This tradition brings together the citizens of Wisconsin and attracts hunters from around the world. It provides a healthy boost in tourism revenue at the local and state level, which has a positive impact on our state's economy.
Last year, we made it easier for hunters to register their deer online. This year, it's even easier for Wisconsin hunters -- you can go to register your deer and get your hunting license online by visiting our "Go Wild" website.
We've also cut down on what hunters have to carry with them into the field. Now, all they need is their carcass tags and conservation card or valid ID.
If you have any questions, get online and visit our "Go Wild" website at www.GoWild.WI.gov. That's www.GoWild.WI.gov. As always, you can also visit a vendor near you to make sure you're fully aware of any changes in this year's hunt.
We hope all Wisconsin hunters and visitors to our state enjoy this year's hunting season. Good luck, and be safe!
