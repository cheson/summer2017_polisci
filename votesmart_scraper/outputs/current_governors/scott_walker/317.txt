Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to stay the federal Environmental Protection Agency's 111(d) rule:
Today's decision is a win for Wisconsin and the other states joining with us in challenging the overreach of the Obama Administration. This rule clearly exceeds the President's authority and could increase costs to Wisconsin ratepayers and businesses by up to $13 billion. We will continue working to protect Wisconsin's families and manufacturing industry from the potentially devastating impact of this presidential overreach.
