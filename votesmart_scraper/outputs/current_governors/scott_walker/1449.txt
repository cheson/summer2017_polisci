Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Jan. 10, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker announced today that he was continuing the previous administration's Central Position Review process for all state agency staffing actions. Under the process all new hires must be approved by Department of Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch and only the most critical positions will be approved.
"Continuing this practice is about a return to frugality in state government," Governor Scott Walker said. "As we look to right-size state government, Secretary Huebsch will ensure that we are able to fulfill our core missions while making government smaller and more efficient."
