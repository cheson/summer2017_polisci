Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: June 21, 2016
Location: Watertown, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined Johnsonville Sausage, LLC leaders and members this morning at the celebration for their new Watertown facility, Perry Way Foods, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnsonville. The facility opened for production on May 9, 2016, and was built to replace Johnsonville Sausage's former facility in Watertown, which suffered a fire on May 10, 2015.
"It's great to be here today with employees and leaders of Johnsonville Sausage as they unveil and celebrate their new facility," Governor Walker said. "We are pleased Johnsonville Sausage decided to stay here in Watertown and remains dedicated to providing quality products and well-paying jobs to the people of Wisconsin."
Johnsonville Sausage was founded in 1945 by Ralph and Alice Stayer, who opened a butcher shop and named it after their hometown -- Johnsonville, Wisconsin. Today, Johnsonville Sausage, LLC, remains committed to continually improving their equipment and facilities, educating their employees, and actively pursuing new technology to further enhance their handling practices. They currently employ around 1,600 members.
Following the fire of their former facility in Watertown, Johnsonville Sausage, LLC, purchased a 63,000 square-foot industrial building, renovating and expanding it to 117,000 square feet. While the new facility was renovated, the plant's employees received full salaries, provided they did at least one of three things: volunteer at local organizations, take training classes at the local technical college, or work in other Johnsonville facilities.
