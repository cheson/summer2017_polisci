Family-Owned Business Saves Nearly $3,000 on Property Tax Bill Due to Governor Walker Reforms

Governor Scott Walker visited Vic's Carpet and Flooring in Oconomowoc today to highlight how his reforms lowered taxes for the median valued home for the first time in over a decade. Vic's Carpet and Flooring, a small, multi-generational family-owned business, saved nearly $3,000 on their 2011 property tax bill.
"For over a decade, Wisconsin property taxpayers winced at the thought of opening their property tax bills," Governor Walker said. "In 2011, for the first time in 12 years, our reforms gave property taxpayers the opportunity to breathe a sigh of relief. But, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is threatening to move us backward by lifting the property tax caps and taking away those much-needed savings if elected governor. Mayor Barrett stands with the big government special interests, not hard working taxpayers. Wisconsin voters cannot afford Mayor Barrett in the governor's office."
Since Tom Barrett has become Mayor of Milwaukee, taxes and fees combined have gone up 43 percent. From 1998 to 2011, property taxes on the median-value property taxpayer have also increased 43 percent. Based on the 2009-11 budget and without Governor Walker's reforms, the average homeowner would have paid an additional $700 over two years.
