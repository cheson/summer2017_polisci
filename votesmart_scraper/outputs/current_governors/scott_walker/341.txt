Governor Scott Walker joined Pro Products, Inc. owners, managers, and employees today for a tour of their new facility. Pro Products, Inc. recently expanded and built a 40,000 square-foot facility in Sturgeon Bay.
"Businesses here in Wisconsin, like Pro Products, Inc., are thriving and have to expand so they can better accommodate high demand," Governor Walker said. "Our unemployment rate is down to 4.2 percent and we saw our best monthly job gains this past October since April of 1992 with an increase of 16,600 jobs. As the New Year approaches, we will continue our work to grow the economy, develop the workforce, train our workers, reform government, transform education, invest in infrastructure, cut property taxes, and move Wisconsin forward."
