Hi, this is Scott Walker.
Dry conditions and extreme heat continue this week Take caution to stay out of the heat and look out for family, friends and neighbors--particularly senior citizens and people on medications.
A list of places to cool off can be found by visiting www.ready.wi.gov; or, in most areas, by calling 211.
The heat and extreme drought conditions are causing major damage for farmers. With that in mind, I declared an emergency for counties across the state.
Working with ag. organizations and local governments, we put together a comprehensive plan to help both crop and dairy farmers with resources--including connecting them to feed from other parts of the state.
For more details, please check out our website www.ready.wi.gov for more details or call the Farm Center at 1-800-942-2474.
