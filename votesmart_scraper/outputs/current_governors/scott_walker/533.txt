Hi, this is Scott Walker.
This week, we continued our work to build a better Wisconsin by announcing two new Project SEARCH sites under our Better Bottom Line initiative. Project SEARCH is a great program that helps young adults with disabilities get the employment training and skills they need to enter the workforce.
You see, when employers recognize the unique abilities of these students, it improves their bottom line. We are working to connect individuals with disabilities with the resources and the training they need to move towards greater independence and success in the workforce.
Countless employers across the state are already benefiting from working with these individuals and the hard work and dedication they bring to work, which is why we invested additional funds to expand Project SEARCH in our Blueprint for Prosperity.
Going forward, we are focused on continuing to improve workforce readiness for all Wisconsinites -- so that everyone can enjoy the freedom and prosperity that comes from work.
