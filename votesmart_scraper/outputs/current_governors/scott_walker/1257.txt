I was excited this week to announce that Precision Iceblast Corporation will relocate its production and product training facility from Wallace, MI to Peshtigo, WI. The relocation is expected to add 64 jobs.
We continue to work hard to attract businesses to Wisconsin and create a positive business environment that fosters job creation.
Precision Iceblast is an independent contracting operation that provides ice blasting services to many industries such as printing, food, paper, tape, automotive, marine, restoration, and manufacturing. It uses CO2 blasting as the modern alternative to chemical cleaning, sandblasting, water blasting, steam cleaning, manual scrubbing, scraping, and hand tooling.
