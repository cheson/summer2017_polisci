Location: Appleton, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker delivered remarks at the fourth annual Governor's Freight Industry Summit. The Summit is an opportunity for industry leaders, stakeholders, and experts to discuss issues important to Wisconsin's freight and transportation industry.
"The freight industry plays a vital role in Wisconsin's economic growth, especially for our key industries like agriculture and manufacturing," said Governor Walker. "Millions of tons of freight worth hundreds of billions of dollars are transported using our roads, bridges, waterways and airways. It is critical that we have a strong transportation network to support our freight industry and our state economy."
This year, the Department of Transportation (WisDOT) announced the creation of a Freight Advisory Committee, which will provide a regular forum to build on the progress made at the annual summit and to discuss transportation policy and investment decisions. This committee will focus on transportation issues, as well as labor force considerations, private sector goals and federal initiatives.
The summit and advisory committee are part of WisDOT's continuing Freight Friendly Wisconsin Initiative to help move Wisconsin's economy forward safely and efficiently.
