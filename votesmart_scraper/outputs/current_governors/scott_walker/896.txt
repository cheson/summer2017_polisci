As of today, the University of Wisconsin--Extension and the UW System are processing admissions for the new University of Wisconsin-Flexible Option program. The first-of-its-kind program offers a more personalized, convenient, and affordable way for students to earn their degree by allowing them to earn credit for the skills and knowledge they already have. There are about 700,000 people in Wisconsin who have some college credit, but do not have a degree.
"The UW Flexible Option has the potential to transform education on a national level," Governor Walker said. "We're pioneering a new way to offer an affordable and quality education and this model allows students to adapt quickly to ever-changing industries and businesses. I commend Chancellor Ray Cross, the University of Wisconsin-Extension, and the UW System for working under the ambitious timeline to make this opportunity available."
The UW Flex Option fundamentally differs from traditional college degree program in that it allows students to go to school at their own pace. The programs are not constrained by the typical academic semester but rather offer flexibility that allows students to take time off if needed.
The programs assess mastery of key concepts to measure progress toward a degree -- not a student's time spent in a classroom. In addition, students have the ability to take existing knowledge and immediately apply it toward their degree, thus earning UW credit for prior learning.
Classes open to registered students in January 2014.
