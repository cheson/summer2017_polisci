Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 28, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker approved $165,000 for an improvement project at the Green Bay -- Austin Straubel International Airport, contributing $132,000 in state funds. Brown County will also contribute $33,000 to the project.
"The Green Bay -- Austin Straubel International Airport is a hub of activity," Governor Walker said. "Whether it's getting the Green Bay Packers team to their away games or getting local flyers to and from their destinations, the airport serves the people of Green Bay and Wisconsin every day. This project allows for the reconstruction of a road, providing better access to several private businesses, the airport's new International Arrivals Terminal building, and the airport's rental car parking facilities. The project also helps maintain access to significant public and private investments on the eastern side of the airport terminal building."
The project will study the environmental impact of the proposed construction and draft plans and specifications for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the east service road, which runs from South Point Road to the terminal building.
Green Bay -- Austin Straubel International Airport is one of 98 facilities included in the Wisconsin State Airport System Plan, which makes it eligible for state and federal funding. The Bureau of Aeronautics at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) administers all airport improvement projects.
