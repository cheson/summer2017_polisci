Governor Scott Walker today released the following statement on the Department of Public Instruction's (DPI) 2012--13 School and District Report Cards:
Parents and caregivers need this information to make informed decisions about the education of their children. The data in these report cards show more Wisconsin schools are meeting or exceeding expectations over last year, and that's great news for parents and children across our state. While we've seen marked improvement in our schools, there is still room for improvement, and we will continue striving for the day when every school in this state meets or exceeds expectations because every child deserves access to a great education.
New to this year's data are report cards for our school districts. Now, parents and caregivers in communities across Wisconsin will be able to see how their school districts are performing, in addition to data on specific schools. I thank Superintendent Tony Evers and DPI staff for their hard work and their dedication to transparency and accountability for Wisconsin's schools and school districts.
