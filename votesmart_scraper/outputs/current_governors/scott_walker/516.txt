Protecting Your Vote

Hi, this is Governor Scott Walker.
This week, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a challenge to our voter ID law, clearing the way for us to protect the integrity of our voting process. This is great news for Wisconsin voters -- presenting a voter ID helps to ensure every vote counts.
This is a common sense reform that makes it easier to vote and hard to cheat. We know how important it is for voters to have confidence in the system.
It is your right to make your voices heard at the ballot box, and it is our duty to make sure the process is fair and protected from fraud.
This week, we continue our work with state lawmakers you elected, to build a Wisconsin that offers more freedom and prosperity for all.
