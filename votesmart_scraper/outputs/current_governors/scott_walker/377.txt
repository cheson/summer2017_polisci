Governor Scott Walker Speaks at 2015 State of Wisconsin Business Luncheon
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Oct. 20, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker spoke to job creators at the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce (WMC) State of Wisconsin Business Luncheon in Madison today. This annual event provides insight into the current economic health and future well-being of Wisconsin.
"When we took office over four years ago, we faced a massive budget deficit and our unemployment rate was high," Governor Walker said. "Our state has come a long way since then. We've put the power back into the hands of Wisconsin citizens, and as a result, our state is more free and prosperous. Our unemployment rate is down to 4.3 percent and our state ended the most recent fiscal year with a $135.6 million balance. We are committed to our work for the people of the state and will continue to move Wisconsin forward."
