Location: Wausau, WI

Governor Scott Walker kicked off his "Tax Relief for Wisconsin Tour" at Northcentral Technical College in Wausau today and called on members of the Assembly and Senate to support the 2013-15 Biennial Budget's tax relief package totaling nearly $1 billion.
"Everyone in Wisconsin who pays income taxes will receive a cut under this package, and the largest rate cuts will be for those making between $15,000 and $50,000 per year," Governor Scott Walker said. "Middle-class families deserve a break, which is why I'm calling on members of the Assembly and Senate to pass a budget providing nearly $1 billion in tax relief for the hardworking taxpayers. We've accomplished a great deal to improve Wisconsin's business climate and providing this relief will continue our efforts to make our state more competitive."
Highlights of the tax package, which passed the Joint Finance Committee last week, include:
· A total income tax cut of $650 million over two years and total tax cuts in the budget total nearly $1 billion.
· Every Wisconsinite, who pays income taxes, will receive an income tax rate cut.
· A typical family of four with an income of $80,607 will receive a tax cut of $345 for tax years 2013 and 2014.
· The largest income tax cut in 14 years.
· Our tough, but prudent, decisions resulted in a surplus of over half a billion dollars, and Governor Walker believes the surplus should be returned to taxpayers.
· Hardworking Wisconsin families should be able to keep more of the money they earn, so they can build a bright future of their choosing for their children and grandchildren.
