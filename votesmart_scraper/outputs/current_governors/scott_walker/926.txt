Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Sept. 27, 2013
Location: Green Bay, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed a Declaration of Emergency today for the Leo Frigo Bridge (I-43) in Green Bay. The declaration makes the bridge eligible for federal Emergency Relief (ER) funds to make the necessary repairs. The funds are administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and would reimburse all costs for the first 180 days of the project.
"Our number one objective is public safety," Governor Walker said. "The Leo Frigo Bridge is a critical transportation link for motorists and commerce in Brown County and the state of Wisconsin, and we are committed to fixing this bridge in a timely and responsible manner."
Department of Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb said, "We are mobilizing state and federal resources to quickly assess the bridge. The bridge will remain closed, however, while our engineers and regional bridge experts develop a plan for the necessary repairs."
"We are working with the city of Green Bay to address local traffic needs, and we will open the bridge as soon as all safety concerns are addressed and repairs completed," said Secretary Gottlieb.
The bridge was closed to all vehicle traffic on September 25 when a bridge pier had settled on the eastern side of the bridge.
