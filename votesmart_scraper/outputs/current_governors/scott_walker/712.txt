Today, Governor Scott Walker released the following statement celebrating the 4th of July:
The 4th of July is a day to celebrate the hard-earned freedoms we enjoy as Americans. Our independence comes at the price of great sacrifices made by our forefathers, as well as the sacrifices of the men and women who have fought for this great nation and of those who continue to serve today.
Our country is a powerful example of democracy, and this is a time to celebrate the freedoms we have in the United States. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
I wish everyone a safe and happy 4th of July, and God bless America.
