Transcript below:
Hi. I'm Scott Walker.
I recently kicked off the commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War at a ceremony with Vietnam Veterans in our State Capitol.
It's important to honor all veterans and specifically remember Vietnam Veterans, who in many ways faced challenges returning back home to the United States. During the ceremony at the State Capitol, I thanked our veterans and their families for their sacrifices and called on all Wisconsinites to remember those who were wounded, those who are unaccounted for, and those who died.
This war had a huge impact on our state, more than 165,000 Wisconsinites served in Vietnam and 1,239 paid the ultimate sacrifice. Vietnam veterans are the largest group of living veterans in Wisconsin, numbering about 135,000.
In honor of all veterans, I was also proud to announce state agencies and Kwik Trip collected more than 5,200 cell phones for the nonprofit charity, Cell Phones for Soldiers. This collection has paid for more than 13,000 free hours of talk time for our service men and women who are currently away from home. With every donated phone, Cell Phones for Soldiers is able to provide two and a half hours of free talk time to deployed troops.
