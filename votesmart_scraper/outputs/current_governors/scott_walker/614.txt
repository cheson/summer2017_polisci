Wisconsin outranks all other Midwest states when it comes to projected economic growth over the next five years, according to Forbes magazine's new business climate rankings.
Wisconsin ranks 18th in the nation for projected growth in the magazine's "Best States for Business" rankings released last week. Minnesota ranks 23rd, Indiana ranks 31st, Michigan is 34th, Ohio is 36th, Illinois is 40th, and Iowa is 42nd.
"Forbes' positive rankings for Wisconsin confirm that not only is our economy getting stronger every day, but that the prospects for future economic growth here are significantly improving," said Governor Scott Walker. "This is another indication the pro-business policies that we put into place are working, and the future is bright for all Wisconsin workers."
The magazine's growth prospects category measures job, income, and gross state product growth forecasts over the next five years from Moody's Analytics. Other factors include business openings and closings and venture capital investments.
Wisconsin's overall "Best States for Business" ranking moved from 41st last year to 32nd in 2014. The increase of nine spots in the ranking was the second-largest jump in this year's survey.
