Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today after the full Legislature's passage of the 2013-2015 State Budget:
I'm proud of the Legislature's work on this budget, which truly invests in Wisconsin and our priorities. Because of our sound fiscal management and tough, but prudent, decisions over the last two years, we are now able to provide nearly $1 billion in tax relief for Wisconsin families and businesses, more money for our public school system, and additional education options for parents across our state.
In addition, this budget reforms government to provide access to affordable health care options for everyone in Wisconsin and reduces the number of uninsured people by over 224,000. These reforms strengthen Wisconsin's safety net for those in need, while protecting our taxpayers from unnecessary risk and the fiscal uncertainty coming out of Washington, D.C.
This budget will help bring more prosperity to the people of Wisconsin. I plan to review changes made by the Legislature over the next several days, and I look forward to signing the bill before the beginning of the next fiscal year.
