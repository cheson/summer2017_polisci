Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Walker announced his plan to invest $6.4 billion in Wisconsin's transportation infrastructure, including $824 million in new state funds. Governor Walker's plan will prioritize existing revenue streams, replace the raids of the past with state taxpayer funds, and make sensible operational reforms so Wisconsin can continue to maintain and develop existing infrastructure projects. Governor Walker's transportation plan contains no scheduled delays for any major highway projects.
"My budget will invest in Wisconsin's strong network of roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, and freight rail," said Governor Scott Walker. "We are investing for the long term. An efficient, safe transportation system is necessary for growing our economy and creating jobs. "
Among the projects funded in the Governor's budget are:
· Zoo Interchange: Allocate $550 million toward the Zoo Interchange Project, which is the busiest interchange in the state. Primary construction will begin in 2015-2018 and will improve safety and reduce congestion. Improving the Zoo Interchange will help grow the economy of the entire state by improving the ability to ship goods quickly in and out of southeastern Wisconsin.
· Hoan Bridge: Utilize $236 million toward the Hoan Bridge and I-794 Freeway. This project will ensure convenient access to the Port of Milwaukee.
· Harbor Assistance Program: Invest $10.7 million for the Harbor Assistance Program, which provides grants to improve commercial harbors on Wisconsin's lakes and rivers. Harbor Assistance Grants help Wisconsin's ports upgrade facilities and take advantage of new technology.
