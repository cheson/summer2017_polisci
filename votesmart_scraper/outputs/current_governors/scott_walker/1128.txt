Hi, this is Scott Walker.
For months I've heard from employers who want to hire more workers, but who can't find properly trained individuals. In response we put together a coalition of Wisconsin's technical colleges, the Wisconsin Covenant Foundation and private businesses to help this skills gap.
This week the coalition produced tangible results. I visited Moraine Park Technical College in Fond du Lac, where we announced a partnership that will result in job specific training for four area employers.
We announced the creation of two 15-week Manufacturing Skills Academy boot camps; one for machine operation and one for welder training. Upon completion, each participant will receive an Entry Level Welding Certificate or a Computer Numerical Control Machine Operator Certificate. Ultimately these boot camps will result in 108 new jobs for skilled workers.
These training programs were created through a grant from the Wisconsin Workforce Partnership Program, which is privately funded by the Wisconsin Covenant Foundation.
This grant will help bridge the gap between people who want jobs and employers who need skilled workers in the Fond du Lac area.
