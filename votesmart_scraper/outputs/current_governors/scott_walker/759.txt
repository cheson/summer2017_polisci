A Safer Wisconsin: Denim Day to Raise Awareness of Sexual Assault
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 23, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker proclaimed April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month and designated April 23, 2014 as Denim Day, which was originally started in response to an Italian High Court decision overturning a rape conviction because the victim was wearing jeans.
"By wearing denim today, we stand in support of sexual assault victims," Governor Walker said. "As we work to end this violence, it's important to raise awareness and show victims, they are not alone."
International Denim Day started in 1999 and is also dedicated to understanding the healing process involved with sexual violence. Survivors of sexual violence deserve to be treated with outstanding respect and dignity, and support is imperative.
Sexual assault affects the lives of thousands of people in Wisconsin each year, and the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault (WCASA) works to help these victims in the healing process. WCASA is made up of professionals, supporters, and sexual assault programs, and they promote peace -- freedom from violence and exploitation -- within communities. Governor Walker and WCASA encourage all Wisconsin communities to join their common goals to prevent sexual violence through education and, ultimately, to put an end to all sexual assault.
Governor Walker encourages residents around the state to wear denim today to support victims and raise awareness for Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
