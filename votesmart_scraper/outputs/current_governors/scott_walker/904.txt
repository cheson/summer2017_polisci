Press Release

Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) Secretary John Scocos and Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) Secretary Mark Gottlieb today announced that starting on December 2, 2013, veterans may voluntarily request through the WisDOT a veteran identifier on their Wisconsin driver's license or state issued identification card.
"It is fitting that on Veterans Day, WDVA and WisDOT announce they are beginning to implement the veteran identifier on driver's licenses," Governor Walker said. "Our veterans have sacrificed so much for the good of our country and it is only right that we ease this burden of proof."
Veterans who choose to get the identifier must first verify they are eligible before they apply for a new card. The word "VETERAN," marked in red, will appear on the front of a driver's license or identification card at a veteran's request in order to give veterans access to certain programs and services for which certain veterans are eligible.
"Many organizations and businesses offer benefits or discounts to veterans to thank them for their service to our country," WDVA Secretary John Scocos said. "This new identifier is a way for veterans to quickly identify themselves to these organizations and businesses without having to carry confidential personal information."
"The WisDOT is pleased to be able to provide this benefit to veterans in order to make their lives a little bit easier," WisDOT Secretary Mark Gottlieb said. "However, we would like to remind veterans that in order to ensure a smooth process at the DMV, they must first verify their eligibility with the WDVA before they apply for a new driver's license or ID card."
