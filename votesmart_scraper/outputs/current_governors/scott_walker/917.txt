Governor Scott Walker today released the following statement after the Wisconsin State Assembly passed a measure that would provide $100 million in property tax relief for Wisconsin:
It is outstanding to see Republicans and Democrats in the Assembly come together, like their colleagues in the Senate, to pass meaningful property tax relief for Wisconsin families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses. I thank Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Speaker Robin Vos for their swift action to pass our $100 million property tax cut. I will quickly sign this legislation, so it will be reflected on tax bills in December.
