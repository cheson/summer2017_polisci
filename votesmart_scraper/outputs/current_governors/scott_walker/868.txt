The non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau today announced the State of Wisconsin's general fund revenue is projected to be $911 million higher than previously anticipated. Governor Scott Walker released the following statement regarding the new revenue projections:
This additional $911 million in projected revenue is a sign Wisconsin's economy continues to grow and add jobs, and it's more great news for the hardworking taxpayers. When we took office in 2011, we pledged to do away with the failed policies of the past and confront the fiscal and economic crises we faced. We made tough, but prudent, decisions over the last three years, and now our bold reforms are producing bold results for the people of Wisconsin. The additional revenue should be returned to taxpayers because it's their money, and my administration will work with the Legislature to determine the most prudent course of action.
The days of billion-dollar deficits and double digit tax increases are over, and we have led ourselves into a new era of financial responsibility and continued investment in Wisconsin's priorities. Our state is heading in the right direction, and together, we are moving Wisconsin forward.
