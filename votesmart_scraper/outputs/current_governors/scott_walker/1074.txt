Today, Governor Scott Walker delivered the weekly radio address titled "Addressing Mental Health."
Transcript below:
Hi. I'm Scott Walker.
Earlier this year, I met with mental health professionals from across Wisconsin. They gave me some tremendous insights into the needs of people suffering from mental health challenges.
My state budget will include nearly $30 million in new funding to support critical services across the state. I've heard numerous success stories about Comprehensive Community Services. Our budget plan will expand these services statewide.
This new investment will help the people of Wisconsin live healthier and more productive lives. Thankfully, our prudent budget decisions in the past helped generate a surplus which now allows us to invest in our priorities in the future.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute brief radio address once a week.
