Governor Scott Walker joined community and spiritual leaders today for the Governor's Prayer Breakfast, which honors the National Day of Prayer and draws followers of all faiths and denominations for a morning of prayer and reflection.
"This is a powerful event, and while everyone may not hold the same beliefs, many of us are united by the power of prayer," Governor Walker said. "Across the country, citizens of different backgrounds join together to pray and to celebrate our freedom to worship."
The Wisconsin Governor's Prayer Breakfast, which was organized more than 40 years ago, honors the National Day of Prayer, which was first signed into law in 1952 by President Harry S. Truman. The theme for 2015's National Day of Prayer is "Lord, Hear Our Cry," which highlights the need for individuals to place faith in their Creator.
