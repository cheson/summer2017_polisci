Location: Neenah, WI

Governor Scott Walker held a press conference today in Neenah regarding the request by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) for the Joint Finance Committee to release $200 million in general obligation bonding for the Major Highway Development and State Highway Rehabilitation programs. Governor Walker was joined by local businesses and community leaders who have a vested interest in the US 10 / WIS 441 project, which is currently under construction.
"We urge the Joint Finance Committee to approve this request to release the funds included in our most recent budget," Governor Walker said. "If the contingent bonding is not approved, the US 10/ WIS 441 project and others throughout the state will be delayed for two years. Wisconsin's thriving industries and businesses depend upon a reliable and efficient transportation system for them to conduct their business. This contingent bonding will reduce delays for major highway projects, which is important for the economic welfare of the state. More importantly, however, it is vital to ensure the safety of Wisconsin's motorists."
