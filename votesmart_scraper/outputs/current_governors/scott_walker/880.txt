Governor Scott Walker Signs Bill Extending BadgerCare and HIRSP Coverage to Address the Failed Federal Rollout of the Affordable Care Act
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Dec. 20, 2013
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today signed Special Session Assembly Bill 1 into law at the Wisconsin State Capitol. In response to the failed federal rollout of the Affordable Care Act, the bill extends current coverage for Wisconsin citizens under several medical assistance programs and the Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan (HIRSP) through March 31, 2014.
"This bill gives the federal government more time to fix major issues with the Affordable Care Act and it gives Wisconsinites more time to make a logical health care transition," Governor Walker said. "In 2014, everyone living in poverty will be covered -- for the first time -- under Medicaid in Wisconsin. The waiting lists and enrollment caps that once denied coverage to our most vulnerable citizens will be gone. I thank members of the Legislature for their bipartisan support."
According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, Wisconsin is the only state of the 26 states choosing not to expand Medicaid programs as a part of the Affordable Care Act that will not have a gap in health care coverage.
