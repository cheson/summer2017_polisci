WASDA Survey Results: A Case Study: 2011-12 vs 2004
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Nov. 14, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Last week the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators released a survey of school districts. 355 district administrators responded, which accounts for 83% of Wisconsin school districts. This is not the first time WASDA has done a survey like this, in past years they partnered with the Wisconsin Education Association Council (WEAC), the state's largest teacher's union. In 2004, the statewide K-12 school tax levy increased 8 percent, yet the WASDA survey that year had results worse than the positive survey responses released for the 2011-12 school year.
"In many ways Wisconsin schools will be faring better than they have under previous budgets," said Governor Walker. "This is good news for students."
