Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today in celebration of the Fourth of July holiday:
Today, we celebrate the birth of our nation as well as the continued freedoms we enjoy in America.
Our freedom is not free. It was hard-earned and continues to be protected every day by the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces.
As we celebrate with our friends, family, and loved ones today, we remember our Founders, who dedicated their lives to building a strong foundation for our nation; our veterans; those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation; and those who currently serve in our Armed Forces. We thank them for their service and pray for their safe return home.
From our family to yours, have a very safe and fun Fourth of July. God bless America.
