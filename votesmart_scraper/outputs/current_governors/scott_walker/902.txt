Today, Governor Scott Walker released the following statement to provide Wisconsinites an update on the ongoing Kenosha casino decision:
Helping the people of Wisconsin create more jobs is my number one priority. With that in mind, I am directing the Secretary of the Department of Administration to commence extensive discussions with the tribal governments in an effort to maximize job creation in our state.
Our administration will focus on meeting the criteria set out more than two years ago. We want to create jobs without losing jobs in other parts of the state.
The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs took nine years to approve an application for a casino in Kenosha. We will not take that long, but we will invest the time necessary to reach a positive solution for the state.
I would ask that all of the interested parties spend their time and resources working with the state's team at the Department of Administration. This will ensure an objective process.
