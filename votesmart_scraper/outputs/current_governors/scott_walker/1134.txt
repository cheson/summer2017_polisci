Governor Walker Statement on Income Growth
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 6, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) announced that wages were up 6.7% in the first quarter of 2012 in Wisconsin.
According to DWD, Wisconsin wage earners received record first quarter wages of $27.6 billion, up 6.7 percent or $1.75 billion from the first quarter in 2011. Total wages in the first quarter of 2008 exceeded $26.53 billion, but declined in the 2009 first quarter and again in the 2010 first quarter. Wages grew in the first quarters of both 2011 and 2012.
In reaction to the wage growth, Governor Walker released the following statement:
Wisconsin's economy is headed in the right direction. After years of massive job losses and staggering wage decreases we are now experiencing sustained private sector job creation and wage increases.
We have provided a stable economic climate in Wisconsin by eliminating a $3.6 billion budget deficit without raising taxes, without reducing services, and without making cuts to programs Medicaid. With the long-term structural reforms put in place last year, job creators have certainty that they can create jobs and increase wages without being penalized by state government.
Moving forward I will remain focused on making it easier for employers to create jobs and increase wages.
