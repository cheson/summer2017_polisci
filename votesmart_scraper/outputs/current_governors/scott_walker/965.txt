Governor Scott Walker issued the following statement today honoring the victims, their families, and survivors of the August 5, 2012 tragedy at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek:
"One year ago, in the wake of the senseless violence, our friends and neighbors in the Sikh community showed us the best way to respond to the tragedy was with love. It is amazing that in the midst of so much personal loss, the greatness of American character shines through.
"Tonette and I join with others in our state and across the nation to offer our prayers and support to the survivors and families who lost loved ones as they continue to heal."
