Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Jan. 23, 2014
Location: La Crosse, WI

Governor Scott Walker kicked off his Blueprint for Prosperity tour at Xetex, Inc. in La Crosse today. XeteX, Inc. is a specialty manufacturer of energy recovery and heat transfer systems including commercial air handling units such as air conditioners, energy recovery ventilators, and heat exchangers used in commercial, industrial, hospitality, schools, and other public buildings.
"The Blueprint for Prosperity puts more money back into the hands of hard-working taxpayers, which will further stimulate the economy, and help companies like Xetex continue to grow and prosper, and create jobs," Governor Walker said, "My plan also increases the Wisconsin Fast Forward program by $35 million to help workers get the skills they need for jobs available in fields like manufacturing."
Governor Walker announced his Blueprint for Prosperity plan during the 2014 State of the State address, following news of the state's $911 million surplus, created by a strong economic recovery and long-term structural reforms.
