Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today in honor of Veterans Day:
America is the land of the free and home of the brave. The rights and freedoms we enjoy every day in this nation come at a steep cost, one that is paid by our veterans and active servicemen and women. On Veterans Day, and every day, we honor our veterans for their bravery, and we will continue our work to ensure they have the resources needed to pursue their piece of the American Dream upon return from service.
