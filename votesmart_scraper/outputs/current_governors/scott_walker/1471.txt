Will Issue Executive Order Requiring Cabinet Secretaries to Meet Regularly With Frontline State Workers to Help Them Identify Cost Savings
Scott Walker, Milwaukee County executive and Republican nominee for governor today, at a Brown Bag lunch at Wingra Stone Company in Madison, announced that as governor he will issue an executive order requiring his cabinet secretaries to solicit suggestions regularly from frontline workers in their agencies to identify waste, fraud, and abuse.
"As part of my Waste, Fraud and Abuse Commission to find $300 million of savings for the taxpayers, I will issue an executive order requiring my cabinet secretaries to hold regular brown bag lunches with frontline workers to help identify cost savings and more efficient ways of providing services," said Walker.
"Frontline state workers are where the rubber meets the road. They can provide a wealth of information on more efficient ways to provide services and identify cost savings."
Soon after taking office as Milwaukee County executive, Walker held brown bag lunches with employees to get feedback.
"As governor, I'll order top to bottom reviews of exactly where our money is being spent and how we can find ways to do more, with less."
Scott Walker has previously proposed creating a bipartisan waste, fraud, and abuse commission to identify $300 million per year in savings.
