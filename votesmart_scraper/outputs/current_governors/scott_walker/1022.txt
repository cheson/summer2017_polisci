Governor Walker Statement on UW System Surplus
Statement
By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today regarding the UW System surplus:
It is very concerning to learn the UW System has been running a surplus balance of this size, especially at a time when students, families, and lawmakers have continually heard from the UW System about the need for more money to offset "devastating cuts." At a minimum, on behalf of students and their families, I am asking legislative leaders to freeze tuition increases for two years for the entire UW System during their deliberations on the budget.
Together with the Legislature, we will ensure a thorough review of UW System finances and increased transparency and accountability for students, their families, and taxpayers moving forward.
