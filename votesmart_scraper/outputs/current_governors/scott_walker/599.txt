Governor Scott Walker Joins Lawsuit to Block Unilateral Executive Action
Statement

Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker released the following statement after joining Governors and Attorneys General from 17 states in a lawsuit seeking to block President Barack Obama's executive action to unilaterally change immigration law:
"The immigration system is broken, but this is an issue that should be addressed through collaborative federal action, not unilateral action by the President. President Obama's actions represent a violation of his constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws and exceed the limits of his administrative powers.
Because of our shared concerns, at my direction, Wisconsin joined with Governors and Attorneys General from 17 other states in a lawsuit seeking to block the President's unilateral action to change the law outside of the legislative process. To be clear, this lawsuit is not about immigration. It is about the rule of law and the legality of President Obama's actions."
The lawsuit was filed by the State of Texas and addresses states' concerns regarding President Obama's recent executive memo, as well as the consequences and costs of policies enacted by his administration in regards to immigration. The lawsuit contends the President's recent executive action violates the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Code governing administrative actions.
