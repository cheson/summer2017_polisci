Governor Scott Walker is attending the Site Selectors Guild's Silver Sponsor Reception in Denver today. Site Selectors Guild members, through their expertise in economic development, assist businesses in developing location strategies. Site selectors play a key role in determining where companies will expand or relocate -- decisions that foster economic growth and job creation.
"In Wisconsin, we're making it easier for job creators who are looking for a new location to grow, expand, or start a business," Governor Walker said. "We are fueling the economy by giving employers confidence, by lowering the overall tax burden, providing a highly-skilled workforce, and streamling regulations. Wisconsin is going back to work."
The consultants at Site Selectors Guild are devoted to helping businesses with site selection on a global scale and have done so with integrity and objectivity since being founded in 2010. Site Selectors Guild members are well-accredited, peer-nominated consultants, who have shown success in their experiences in location advisory. The Site Selectors Guild's 34 members are among the top in aiding the expansion and relocating of businesses.
In addition to the meeting with the Site Selectors Guild, Governor Walker is meeting with alumni of the University of Wisconsin. The alumni event is a chance for the alumns to learn how Wisconsin is moving forward, including an improving business climate, a vibrant entrepreneurial system, and a more responsive government. Governor Walker is inviting alumni to rediscover Wisconsin and all the state has to offer as well as share their educational experiences and the successes they achieved since graduation.
