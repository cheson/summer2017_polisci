LDV, Inc., Burlington, is planning to add up to 17 new jobs through an expansion of its manufacturing capacity. The company is eligible for $107,500 in tax credits through the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to facilitate the company's expansion and planned job growth.
"Wisconsin manufacturers, like LDV, Inc., continue to show their confidence in Wisconsin's economy by investing in their businesses to take advantage of new market opportunities," said Governor Scott Walker. "Manufacturing is a key component of Wisconsin's economy that we have focused on growing since taking office."
LDV is a specialty vehicle manufacturer, specializing in emergency response and commercial vehicle interiors and upfits. To accommodate increased sales for LDV's specialty product lines, the company is proposing to expand and equip its facility in Burlington.
The tax credits will be distributed annually in direct relation to the number of jobs retained and new, full-time positions created and filled over a three-year period.
Since Governor Walker took office, Wisconsin ranks 8th in total manufacturing jobs created, with 14,400 new jobs. In 2012, Wisconsin ranks 6th in total manufacturing jobs created, with 6,500 new jobs.
Governor Walker proclaimed the week of May 6-12 as Manufacturing Awareness Week to highlight how critical the industry is to the state's economy. The manufacturing industry provides family-supporting jobs to 450,000 people in Wisconsin.
