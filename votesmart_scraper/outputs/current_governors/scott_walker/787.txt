Blueprint for Prosperity: No Fooling -- Taxpayers Keeping More of Their Hard-Earned Money
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 1, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

As part of Governor Walker's Blueprint for Prosperity, he directed the Wisconsin Department of Revenue to adjust withholding tables by $322.6 million to reflect tax cuts and inflationary adjustments to the standard deductions and withholding brackets. The changes are in effect as of April 1, which means Wisconsinites will now keep more of their hard-earned money in their paychecks.
"By changing withholding tables, we are putting more money into the hands of taxpayers across the state, instead of keeping it in Madison, which will stimulate our economy and fuel our job growth," Governor Walker said. "The total tax relief we put in place since I took office now tops $2 billion dollars. Wisconsin is indeed heading in the right direction."
Under the changes to withholding, a typical family of four will see an additional $58 in their paychecks each month, which means more than $520 for the family by the end of this year.
The withholding table changes reflect the rate cuts in the 2013-2015 budget, as well as the additional rate cuts that were recently signed into law. It also includes adjustments to the standard deduction and withholding brackets that had not yet been reflected in the withholding tables.
