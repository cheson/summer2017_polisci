Record of Defending the Second Amendment
"Protecting and preserving our constitutional freedoms is one of the most important things a governor can do. The Bill of Rights forbids the government from infringing on the freedoms unique to America, but that hasn't deterred politicians who want to treat the Second Amendment as optional and strip us of the right to keep and bear arms. I will fight these attempts to get around the U.S. and Wisconsin Constitutions and I will strive to protect our rights today and for future generations." -- Scott Walker
Our Founding Fathers knew that granting the government unchecked power and too much control over its citizens would destabilize the Republic they fought to establish. When they crafted the Bills of Rights, they declared the right to keep and bear arms in the Second Amendment to be one of the most sacred and fundamental freedoms on which our country was built. In 1998, I voted for an amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution that mirrors the Second Amendment. Throughout my career, I have earned an "A" rating from the National Rifle Association for protecting the rights of gun owners.
If our Second Amendment rights are compromised, then so too is Wisconsin's proud sporting heritage. Wisconsin's natural resources provide abundant opportunities for hunting, fishing and trapping. As an avid hunter myself, it is one of my favorite things about living here. These aren't just hobbies; they are part of Wisconsin's history and rich outdoor traditions that have endured for generations.
