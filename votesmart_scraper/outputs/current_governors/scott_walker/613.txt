Governor Scott Walker Proclaims Education Week
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Nov. 19, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker proclaimed the week of November 17--21 as Education Week.
"Our appreciation to parents, educators, and administrators extends far beyond Education Week," said Governor Walker. "They work hard each and every day to ensure that all Wisconsin students, regardless of zipcode, have access to a great education. I am thankful for their dedication to our students and schools."
Transforming and investing in education is a top priority for Governor Walker. The reforms we enacted since 2011 saved school districts hundreds of millions of dollars and allowed education leaders to put more money directly into our children's classrooms. In the last budget, Governor Walker invested $380 million in new state funds into public education, including $300 per pupil increase in school aids over the biennium. The budget also includes $250,000 in STEM grants for science, technology, engineering, and math.
