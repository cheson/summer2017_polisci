Governor Scott Walker has declared a State of Emergency for 13 western Wisconsin counties following torrential rains this week since Wednesday which caused widespread flooding and mudslides. Counties declared are Buffalo, Chippewa, Clark, Columbia, Crawford, Eau Claire, Jackson, La Crosse, Monroe, Richland, Sauk, Trempealeau, and Vernon.
"More than 10 inches of rain fell this week which caused flooding and mudslides across the region of western Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "I want to thank all of the first responders and local officials in the area who are working hard to manage the situation. I am instructing the Wisconsin National Guard and all state agencies to provide assistance to those affected by this natural disaster."
According to Wisconsin Emergency Management, a house was destroyed in a mudslide in Vernon County which claimed the life of the person inside. Numerous roads are closed due to floodwaters or mudslides.
"We are saddened by the news of a fatality," added Governor Walker. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the citizens of western Wisconsin affected by the storm as they recover."
The State of Wisconsin Emergency Operations Center was activated early this morning, and state officials are working to assist counties in their response and recovery efforts.
Executive Order #215, which declares the State of Emergency, helps local governments pay for the unreimbursed costs of damage and cleanup to public infrastructure.
