Location: Madison, WI

Recently Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce released the results of the 2011 economic outlook survey which showed the business climate improved over the last year.
"The survey released by the state's chamber of commerce confirms that while Wisconsin is heading in the right direction we have more to do to improve our job creation climate," said Governor Walker. "The foundation for success was built in 2011 and moving forward we must continue to focus on connecting skilled workers to jobs that are currently available. The positive outlook for the future exhibited by this survey can be reinforced by continuing to provide certainty in state government policies."
