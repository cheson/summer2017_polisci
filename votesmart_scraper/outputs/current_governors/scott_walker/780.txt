Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 300 into law at the Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin. Under the bill, state-regulated insurers covering intravenous chemotherapy must also cover oral chemotherapy, while limiting patient out-of-pocket co-payment costs to $100 per month.
"Oral chemotherapy is a potentially life-saving option for some cancer patients," Governor Walker said. "With all of the uncertainty in health care costs today, it just makes sense that we make sure this vitally important treatment is affordable for our citizens. I thank Senator Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) and Representative Pat Strachota (R-West Bend) for their work on this legislation, which passed with bipartisan support."
Senate Bill 300 -- requires state-regulated insurance plans covering intravenous chemotherapy to also cover oral chemotherapy treatments at an affordable cost to patients, capping out-of-pocket co-payments at $100 per month. For some cancer patients, oral chemotherapy is an effective alternative to traditional chemotherapy and is more convenient with fewer negative side effects. By keeping this treatment option affordable, the impact of chemotherapy treatment is less disruptive for some patients who no longer have the added burden of traveling to facilities.
The bill passed the Senate 30-2 and the Assembly 75-18; it is Act 186.
