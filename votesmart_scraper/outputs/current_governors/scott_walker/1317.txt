Governor Walker Stands with Workers Affected by Strikes
Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Walker today is throwing his support behind Senate Bill (SB) 346, which was introduced by Sen. Robert Wirch (D-Pleasant Prairie) and Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison).
Under current state statute, workers cannot collect unemployment for lost wages as the result of a strike, whether they initiated the strike or not. Currently, this affects 150 non-striking employees of Manitowoc Cranes, who have been laid off due to the strike through no fault of their own.
"It's unacceptable that right now Wisconsinites who are out of work, due to a strike that is beyond their control, are not eligible for unemployment benefits." Governor Walker said. "Not only have they lost their paycheck, we can't help them. That's wrong."
SB 346 would allow non-striking workers to collect unemployment benefits when they cannot work due to a strike. In a letter to the Governor, Manitowoc Cranes indicated their support for allowing non-striking employees who are affected by a strike to collect unemployment insurance benefits.
Governor Walker urged the Wisconsin Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council to take action on SB 346.
