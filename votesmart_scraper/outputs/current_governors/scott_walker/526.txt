Freedom and Prosperity for Wisconsin

Hi, this is Governor Scott Walker.
On Monday, I joined job creators, local officials, and legislators at Badger Meter in Brown Deer to sign Freedom to Work into law, making Wisconsin the 25th state in the nation to give workers the power to choose.
Freedom to Work removes any requirement that employees pay union dues as a condition of employment, allowing Wisconsin's workers the freedom to choose whether or not they wish to join a union and pay union dues. This bill is ultimately about promoting individual freedom within the workforce, and while workers maintain the right to contribute to unions, this contribution will be voluntary.
Additionally, Freedom to Work gives Wisconsin one more tool to encourage job creators to continue investing and expanding here. Combined with our investments in worker training, and our work to lower the tax burden, Freedom to Work will give greater freedom and prosperity for all the citizens across the state.
