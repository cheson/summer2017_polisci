Today, Governor Scott Walker joined local law enforcement officials, community members, and Special Olympic athletes at Wisconsin's 29th Annual Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics.
"I look forward to this event each year because it's such an extraordinary experience," Governor Walker said. "The show of support among law enforcement officers from around the state and Special Olympic athletes themselves are what make this inspirational event so special."
The Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics started in 1981 to raise funds and awareness for Special Olympics and promote the joy of competition in everyday life. More than 142,000 law enforcement volunteers participate annually in the Torch Run around the world.
Since 1986, the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Torch Run has raised over $22 million for Special Olympics. The 2015 Torch Run will finish in Stevens Point where nearly 1,800 athletes will compete in aquatics, soccer, track, field, and powerlifting at the 2015 State Summer Games June 4th -- June 6th.
Special Olympics Wisconsin promotes the overall well-being of children and adults with intellectual disabilities, and provides year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports, offering participants opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy, and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills, and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes, and the community.
