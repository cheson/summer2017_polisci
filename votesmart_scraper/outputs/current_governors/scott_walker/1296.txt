Today the State Senate Committee on Economic Development and Veterans and Military Affairs passed Senate Bill 357, which is a part of the Wisconsin Working plan. This legislation recognizes military training as meeting the requirements for certain state licenses. The legislation received bipartisan support and passed the committee 7-0.
"Allowing veterans to receive credit for the top notch training, education and experience they gained through the Armed Forces will make it easier for those returning to our state to reenter the workforce." said Governor Walker. "I would like to thank Senator Terry Moulton for helping usher this bill through the Legislature."
