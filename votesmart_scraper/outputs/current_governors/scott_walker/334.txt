Governor Scott Walker announced his college affordability legislative package focusing on making higher education more affordable for Wisconsin working families and students at Waukesha County Technical College. Today, Governor Walker also joined faculty, staff, students, lawmakers, and community members at the University of Wisconsin (UW)-La Crosse to discuss the positive impact of the historic four-year tuition freeze for the University of Wisconsin System.
"For the first time in state history, we froze tuition for four years for our UW System students and that's real savings for them and their families," Governor Walker said. "We want to continue working together to make higher education more accessible and more affordable for Wisconsin students and families. Moving forward, we are focused on helping students to afford the higher education path that best suits their career goals, whether through a training program, technical college, or a four-year program."
