Today Governor Walker's office announced the final Commission on Waste, Fraud and Abuse report. A full copy of the report can be viewed at: http://walker.wi.gov/section.asp?linkid=1727&locid=177
"The recommendations by the Commission will help state government operate more efficiently and effectively," said Governor Walker. "Moving forward I will work with members of both political parties to implement the remaining recommendations made by the commission."
Overall the Commission believes their recommendations can reduce spending by local units of government by $82.6 million and state government by $373 million for a total annual savings to taxpayers of $445 million.
State agencies have already begun to implement some cost saving measures because of the discussions they had with the Commission over the course of the last year. Below is a listing of a few examples of items agencies have already implemented:
路 The Department of Health Services has created an Office of Inspector General and has invested in cracking down on fraud in public assistance programs. Results have already been seen. Benefits saved due to fraud in FoodShare alone climbed 46% in October and payments recouped 80% compared to the first month of 2011.
路 State employee compensation plans were modified in an effort to reduce the amount of unnecessary and costly overtime.
路 DWD is working to upgrade its information technology which is expected to improve its efficiency in the department's ability to identify and correct unemployment insurance fraud.
路 Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) found that they could accommodate their agency staff in office space soon to be vacated by the former Wisconsin Department of Commerce, which is estimated to save WDVA between $300,000 and $400,000 annually.
