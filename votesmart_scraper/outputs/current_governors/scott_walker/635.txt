Governor Scott Walker applauded Airgas, Inc. for achievements in job growth and production at the company's ribbon cutting ceremony for a new, 250,000-square-foot distribution and office services center in Germantown today. Airgas, a major supplier of gases, safety, and welding equipment, is moving operations into a new, expanded facility, which will double the size of its previous facility. With this expansion, Airgas has created 20 new jobs and is expected to add an additional 60 positions by 2016.
"It's always a great day in Wisconsin when we can come together and celebrate a great company that is growing and prospering," Governor Walker said. "The decision by Airgas to expand and invest in Wisconsin is great news for our economy and demonstrates that Wisconsin is indeed a favorable business climate. It is also a great testament to the dedicated, and dependable, skilled workforce we have in this state, which drives our economy."
Founded in 1982, Airgas, Inc. employs about 16,000 people in 1,100 locations. The new distribution center in Germantown will stock welding-related supplies and safety products to streamline Airgas' supply chain to its customers and branch locations, as well as house administrative offices and Airgas Total Access, the company's telesales organization.
