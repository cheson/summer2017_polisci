Governor Walker Response to Court Ruling
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Sept. 14, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Scott Walker released the following statement in reaction to the recent Act 10 court ruling:
The people of Wisconsin clearly spoke on June 5th. Now, they are ready to move on. Sadly a liberal activist judge in Dane County wants to go backwards and take away the law making responsibilities of the legislature and the governor. We are confident that the state will ultimately prevail in the appeals process.
