Location: Madison, WI

Today the Wisconsin Legislature is having a hearing on a proposed No Child Left Behind (NCLB) waiver. Below is Governor Walker's statement related to the proposed NCLB waiver:
Continued collaboration with Superintendent Evers and a wide range of education stakeholders including teachers, administrators, and school boards will be needed to refine and submit a waiver to the federal government that will allow us to continue to innovate the way we deliver education in Wisconsin. The proposed waiver is a good starting point.
It is important to continue to focus on setting high standards, ensuring transparency and measuring what matters to ensure that all students are ready for college or a career. This includes, but is not limited to rating all schools, be they public, charter, or choice, on multiple measures of student growth and proficiency.
Ultimately we want to empower parents to make educational decisions based on quantifiable performance data. The waiver will help fight complacency by replicating success and providing assistance to schools in need of improvement.
