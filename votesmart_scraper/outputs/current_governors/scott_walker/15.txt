Hi, Scott Walker here.
As governor, workforce development has always been a top priority for me. But we had a more immediate concern when we took office. It was creating jobs. Back in 2010, our unemployment rate was 8.1 percent. First and foremost, we had to help connect Wisconsin's workers with good-paying jobs.
Today, I'm proud to announce our unemployment rate is 3.1 percent. You heard me -- 3.1 percent. That's down from last month and it is the lowest our unemployment rate has been since 1999.
Wisconsin is working again, and our focus has shifted from jobs, jobs, jobs, to workforce, workforce, workforce.
Here's the bottom line: the future success of Wisconsin depends upon our ability to provide our next generation of workers with the practical skills and knowledge that they need to thrive in our workforce.
And President Trump agrees with us here. In fact, earlier this week, he chose to kick off his Workforce Week right here in Wisconsin at the Waukesha County Technical College.
That's because we're doing such great work here in Wisconsin to strengthen our workforce. We're investing our Reform Dividend into programs and education that are helping us build the skilled and dependable workforce Wisconsin is known for.
We're putting more actual dollars into K-12 education, which includes funding for workforce development programs like Youth Apprenticeships, Fab Labs, and Project SEARCH.
