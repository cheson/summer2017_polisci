Location: Beloit, WI

Governor Scott Walker was joined by community and local business leaders today at a press conference regarding the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) request for the Joint Finance Committee (JFC) to release $200 million in general obligation bonding for construction and improvement projects for our Major Highway Development and State Highway Rehabilitation programs across the state. The press conference took place in Beloit near the I-39 / 90 expansion project, which is already underway.
"Investing in our infrastructure remains one of our top priorities, and our most recent state budget accounted for $200 million in contingency bonding for this year," Governor Walker said. "This is not new bonding, it was included in the budget that was passed by both the State Assembly and State Senate. Approval of the contingency bonding by the Joint Finance Committee is crucial for public safety and to keep projects moving forward on major highways. This bonding will be utilized to build and maintain the projects needed by communities such as Beloit."
