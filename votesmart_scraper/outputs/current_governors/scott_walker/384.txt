Location: Bangor, WI

Governor Scott Walker today visited Stella Jones, Corp. in Bangor as a part of his Working for Wisconsin tour. The Working for Wisconsin tour highlights initiatives throughout the state that are working for the people of Wisconsin. Governor Walker's visit to Stella Jones, Corp. specifically focuses on efforts to develop our workforce by equipping job seekers with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce.
"Here in Wisconsin, more people are working and fewer are unemployed," Governor Walker said. "State government is more efficient, more effective, and more accountable, and our financial condition has improved. The fact remains, however, Wisconsin is facing a skills gap. We're taking this head-on by investing in programs and initiatives that train job seekers here in Wisconsin to help employers like Stella Jones, Corp. and others across the state hire the skilled workers they need to succeed in the workplace."
