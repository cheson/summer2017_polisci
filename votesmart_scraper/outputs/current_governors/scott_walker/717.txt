Location: Milwaukee, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker participated in a test drive of Harley-Davidson's new Project LiveWire electric motorcyle at the Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee. Harley-Davidson is touring the new motorcyle at a number of dealerships and offering riders a chance to test the bike and offer feedback on the experience of driving an electric motorcycle.
"It's great to witness history in the making, especially with a classic, iconic American brand like Harley-Davidson," Governor Walker said. "Project LiveWire is a wonderful opportunity for the company to attract even more people to their products. It offers a unique riding experience, which retains the sense of freedom that makes motorcycle riding a feeling unlike any other."
Officially called Project LiveWire, this is Harley-Davidson's first attempt at manufacturing a completely electric motorcycle. The company will use information collected during this test to inform its decisions about the future of the product. Project LiveWire can reach speeds near 90 mph and goes from zero to 60 in under four seconds.
