Governor Scott Walker announced today that Spaulding Clinical Research, LLC, West Bend, is eligible for up $850,000 in tax credits through the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, creating up to 183 jobs related to the company's development expansion of its cardiac safety equipment.
"This investment by Spaulding reinforces Wisconsin as one of the leading states in the country in medical innovation," said Governor Walker. "I am pleased to announce this support for Spaulding for the creation of quality jobs for Wisconsin workers."
Spaulding Clinical Research is planning a significant investment to take its cardiac safety testing services to a new level by development and patenting equipment and a process that will establish Spaulding as a state-of-the art Cardiac Core Lab. Spaulding has created and is launching the Spaulding iQÂ™ Electrocardiograph into the non-research medical markets, especially in areas such as the Physician Office and Home Care.
The tax credits will be distributed annually in direct relation to the number of new, full-time positions created and filled over a two-year period.
The City of West Bend and Economic Development Washington County have partnered to offer a joint package of funding assistance to Spaulding Clinical Research in addition to the state tax credits
