Governor Scott Walker's Toast to Mothers
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 11, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker, with sons Matt and Alex, thanked their mothers, grandmothers, and aunts today and recognized women across the state celebrating Mother's Day.

I have had the distinct honor of being raised by a mother who always pushed me to follow my dreams and become the man I wanted to be and of being married to a woman who instilled these same values in our sons. Today, Matt, Alex, and I thank Tonette, Pat Walker, and the many women who have helped shape our lives -- you are an inspiration to us and a constant reminder to always be the best men possible.

To all the women in Wisconsin, we wish you a very happy Mother's Day.
