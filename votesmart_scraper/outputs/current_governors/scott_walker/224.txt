Wisconsin continues to climb the rankings of Chief Executive magazine's annual "Best State for Business" survey of CEOs. This year, CEOs ranked Wisconsin 11th Best State for Business in America. Wisconsin has improved 30 places in this ranking since 2010.
"This is great news for businesses and employees in our state," Governor Walker said. "Wisconsin continues to improve in this ranking every year -- from 41st in 2010 to 11th in 2016. This new ranking is yet another indication our reforms are working and continue to move Wisconsin forward. We are committed to ensuring our state is a great place to live, work, and raise a family and we will continue to implement pro-business policies to help Wisconsin businesses succeed and grow."
According to Chief Executive magazine's survey, CEOs also ranked Wisconsin 3rd overall in the Midwest.
Chief Executive magazine's "Best and Worst States for Business" survey gauges the sentiment of CEOs on a variety of measures they view as critical, including the tax and regulatory regime, quality of the workforce, and quality of the living environment.
"Wisconsin's business economy is rich with state-of-the-art companies such as Harley-Davidson and GE Medical that serve as great examples for other business leaders in lean and automated manufacturing," said Marshall Cooper, CEO of Chief Executive magazine and ChiefExecutive.net. "We recently held our 4th Annual Smart Manufacturing Summit in Milwaukee and found the state and our business partners there to be exceptional role models for others."
The survey indicated Wisconsin outranks its neighboring states, beating out Iowa (17th), Minnesota (34th), Michigan (40th), and Illinois (48th).
Wisconsin's recent rankings are as follow:
2016 -- 11th
2015 -- 12th
2014 -- 14th
2013 -- 17th
2012 -- 20th
2011 --24th
