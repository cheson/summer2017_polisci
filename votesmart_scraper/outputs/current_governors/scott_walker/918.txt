Governor Scott Walker Encourages Citizens to Contact Their Legislators to Support $100 Million in Property Tax Relief for Wisconsin
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Oct. 15, 2013
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today unveiled a "Contact Your Legislators" option on walker.wi.gov and encouraged citizens to contact their legislators in support of the $100 million in property tax relief for Wisconsin families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses.
"We encourage the people of this state to contact their legislators and say "Stand up for us, the hardworking taxpayers, and vote for $100 million in property tax relief,'" Governor Walker said. "Log-on to walker.wi.gov and contact your legislator today and tell them you deserve this much-needed property tax relief."
In the decade before Governor Walker took office, property taxes went up 27 percent on a median-valued home. Now, property taxes will have dropped in three consecutive years and, four years into Governor Walker's term, property taxes are projected to be lower than when he took the oath of office. Because of reforms and property tax controls, typical Wisconsin homeowners will save $680 over four years compared to the prior four year trend.
Citizens can log-on to walker.wi.gov and click "Contact Your Legislators" on the homepage. There, citizens can enter their address and find their senator and representative, along with the elected officials' contact information.
