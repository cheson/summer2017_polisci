Today, Governor Scott Walker delivered the weekly radio address titled "A Look Ahead."
Transcript below:
Hi I'm Scott Walker.
Two years ago, Wisconsin was facing a $3.6 billion budget deficit and the state had an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent. Today, Wisconsin has a $341 million surplus and we set money aside in the rainy day fund for the first time in two consecutive years. The unemployment rate is 6.7 percent.
In 2010, a mere 10 percent of employers surveyed said the state was headed in the right direction. Chief Executive Magazine ranked Wisconsin as the 41st state for business rankings.
In 2012, 94 percent said Wisconsin was headed in the right direction. Chief Executive Magazine moved our ranking up to number 20, while CNBC listed us at 17th and Site Selector Magazine listed as 13th.
New business formations are up 11.1 percent from this time two years ago. Now we're able to build off of this foundation as we take a look ahead.
This week, the 101st session of the Wisconsin Legislature began with the inauguration of members of the State Senate and State Assembly. I look forward to working with all four legislative caucuses to help improve our state for the next generation.
