Today, Scott Walker, Milwaukee County executive and Republican nominee for governor released the following statement on a new report released by the Institute for Justice.
"This is yet another report showing that, just like Jim Doyle, Tom Barrett's support for high taxes and excessive regulations have made Milwaukee one of the nation's worst places to do business," said Walker. "Tom Barrett's Milwaukee is the fourth poorest in the nation and the second worst city for job creation, and Wisconsin can't afford his reckless leadership."
A new report by the Institute for Justice (IJ) confirms what we have been saying all along, that the policies of Jim Doyle and Tom Barrett are making it impossible to create jobs and successful businesses in Wisconsin. The report, titled Unhappy Days for Milwaukee Entrepreneurs, details out the excessive taxes and regulations that Barrett and Doyle have put on our businesses. The report interviews several of Milwaukee's small business owners who make it clear that they are overburdened by the city and state's anti-business policies.
Among the various fees and regulations in the city of Milwaukee is a "going out of business license" where the city forces a failing business to pay for a license before they can hold a going-out-of-business sale. The report recommends that both the city and state need to ease regulations and taxes to help turn our businesses around.
Findings:
"But layers of red tape are making it difficult for the cream of Milwaukee's entrepreneurs to rise to the top."
