Hi, Scott Walker here.
On Saturday, we're kicking off Wisconsin's fishing season by attending the 51st Annual Governor's Fishing Opener in Washburn County. This is an event we look forward to every year to highlight tourism throughout our state.
This week is Travel and Tourism Week. You know, tourism has long been a big part of Wisconsin's economy, and this year is no different. Recent numbers released show our tourism economy topped $19 billion in 2015, a nearly $1 billion increase from 2014.
Over five years, tourism has grown by 30 percent at over $4 billion, and our visitor volume in Wisconsin increased by almost 13 million people.
The tourism industry also supported over 190,000 jobs in Wisconsin in 2015. Since 2010, tourism growth has resulted in an 11 percent increase in jobs supported by tourism.
Visitors to our great state generated over $1.5 billion in local revenue, saving Wisconsin taxpayers $640 per household.
With more than 10,000 inland lakes and numerous other tourists destinations, like Wisconsin supper clubs, it's no wonder Wisconsin is a leading tourist destination for people all across the country.
