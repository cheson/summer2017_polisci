Location: Madison, WI

In tonight's State of the State address, Governor Scott Walker highlighted several new businesses that have been established since 2011, as well as businesses that have created jobs in the last year.
"Some of the best news I get to deliver tonight is that Wisconsinites are getting back to work," Governor Walker said. "The state of our economy is bright -- entrepreneurs are feeling the confidence start-up the new businesses they always dreamed of, while others are expanding operations and continuing to create jobs."
Four years ago, Governor Walker pledged to help the people of Wisconsin create 10,000 new businesses by 2015; a goal which has already been exceeded. 5-Point Fabrication and SOLOMO Technology are two of the nearly 13,000 new businesses created in the last three years.
5-Point Fabrication, in Ashwaubenon, provides welding, metal fabrication, machining, laser cutting, and bending services. The company has filled 20 of the 50 full-time positions it plans to create. SOLOMO Technology, in Madison, builds mobile apps for businesses to help them interact with consumers while they are shopping.
In addition to creating 10,000 new businesses, Governor Walker laid out a bold plan four years ago, to get Wisconsin back to work. Hartford Finishing, EmbedTek, A&B Process Systems, and Greenheck Fan Corporation are among the businesses that expanded or created jobs during the last year.
Hartford Finishing, Inc., in Hartford, is one of the Midwest's largest contract powder coaters. Founded in 1986, the company houses six separate state of the art powder painting systems, a full service assembly area, stripping center, wet paint line, and 12 loading docks. They have committed to adding 94 jobs.
