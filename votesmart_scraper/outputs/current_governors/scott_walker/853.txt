Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Jan. 27, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

After meeting today with representatives from the propane industry and state government officials, Governor Scott Walker instructed the Department of Administration's Division of Energy Services to release an additional $7 million in energy assistance benefits, for a total of $8.5 million in additional funds, to help support low-income Wisconsin residents who use propane to heat their homes. The Governor also directed the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation and Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority to move forward with a combined $8 million in loan guarantee programs to help ensure propane dealers are able to obtain propane on the wholesale market and deliver it to consumers.
"Today, I met with state and industry leaders to determine if there are additional steps we can take to manage through the current crisis and help protect our citizens who rely on propane for heat," Governor Walker said. "While we cannot produce more propane ourselves, I have directed additional funds be made available to help our most vulnerable citizens pay for the fuel they need and ensure propane dealers are able to obtain and deliver the supply we do have."
