The Higher Educational Aids Board (HEAB) announced today that the 2011-2012 administrative memorandum for the Minnesota-Wisconsin Interstate Tuition Reciprocity Program has been signed by Minnesota. The Reciprocity Program will continue to serve Wisconsin residents who choose to go to Minnesota for their college education.
"This new tuition reciprocity agreement with the State of Minnesota makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents," Governor Walker said. "Smaller tuition bills widen access to higher education, and that's a win-win situation for students and Wisconsin."
The Minnesota-Wisconsin Interstate Tuition Reciprocity Program is an agreement between Wisconsin and Minnesota. It allows Wisconsin residents to attend state universities, colleges and technical colleges in Minnesota at in-state rates as specified in the agreement. Minnesota residents have the same opportunities for attending Wisconsin schools. Over 10,000 Wisconsin residents take advantage of this program each year.
Participation in this program is not automatic. While all Wisconsin residents are eligible, there is an application form that must be completed and processed by HEAB. The application for the 2011-2012 academic year is available on HEAB's website: www.heab.wi.gov. Interested residents should contact their high school, the Minnesota college they are considering, or HEAB to obtain additional information.
HEAB's website address is http://heab.wi.gov. HEAB can be reached by phone at (608) 267-2206 and by e-mail at heabmail@wi.gov.
