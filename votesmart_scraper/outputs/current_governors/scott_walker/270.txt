Statement

Location: Green Bay, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Assembly Bill 612 into law today at Lambeau Field in Green Bay. The bill relates to municipal quotas for retail liquor licenses.
"We're happy to be here at Lambeau Field, the home of the Green Bay Packers today to sign this legislation into law," Governor Walker said. "Assembly Bill 612 helps the Village of Ashwaubenon issue additional licenses for the Titletown District being constructed by the Green Bay Packers, ultimately bolstering local economic development without increasing the liquor licenses available in the region."
Assembly Bill 612-- allows municipalities to transfer an unused reserve "Class B" liquor license to another municipality that is contiguous with, or within two miles of, the transferring municipality. The bill allows a municipality to designate a premier economic development district, and to issue two "Class B" liquor licenses in connection with an economic development project within the premier economic development district. The bill also modifies the quota exception for a full-service restaurant to require an interior, permanent seating capacity of at least 300 persons. Authored by Representative David Steffen (R -- Green Bay) and Senator Robert Cowles (R -- Green Bay), the bill passed the Assembly on a voice vote and was concurred by the Senate with a vote of 32-0. It is Act 286.
