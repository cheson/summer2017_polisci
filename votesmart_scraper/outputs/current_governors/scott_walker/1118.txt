Today Governor Walker delivered the weekly radio address titled "Wisconsin State Fair."
Transcript below:
Hi, this is Scott Walker.
Wisconsin is home to one of the best state fairs in the entire country. This week I visited the fair and had the honor of kicking everything off at the opening ceremonies.
This event provides a great venue for individuals who live in urban areas to get a taste of Wisconsin's rural life--through the numerous agricultural related exhibits. Specifically, attendees will have the opportunity to do everything from learning about raising livestock to tasting some of Wisconsin's finest farm and dairy products.
My favorite part of the fair is getting the chance to eat a fresh cream puff.
If you haven't attended previously, you should definitely consider going this year. You can learn more about this great event by visiting www.wistatefair.com. I hope you'll join me in attending the 2012 Wisconsin State Fair.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute brief radio address once a week. Audio files and a written transcript of this radio address can be accessed on http://www.wi-broadcasters.org and http://walker.wi.gov/Weekly-Radio-Addresses.
