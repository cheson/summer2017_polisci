Today, Governor Scott Walker approved an emergency rule in relation to the implementation of the Deer Trustee Report at the 8th Annual National Rifle Association (NRA) and Wisconsin Firearms Owners, Ranges, Clubs, and Educators (FORCE) state convention in Weston.
"Hunting is one of Wisconsin's most unique and time-honored traditions," Governor Walker said. "These rule changes take the right approach to conservation and natural resource management, so that Wisconsin's rich heritage of deer hunting will continue to thrive for generations."
The Deer Trustee Report package consists of regulations intended to better manage the state's deer population in order to preserve Wisconsin's great hunting tradition. The changes will be implemented for the start of the 2014 gun deer season.
The main provisions of the rule include:
Simplifying the season structure by making changes to the 4-day December hunt and Holiday Hunt;
Consolidating deer management units to be based on county boundaries;
Creating Deer Management Advisory Committees in every county to evaluate local herds and report to the Department of Natural Resources;
Eliminating in-person registration stations in exchange for phone and online registration
