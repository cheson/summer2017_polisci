By: Scott Walker
Date: Oct. 29, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker was joined by Department of Workforce Development (DWD) Secretary Reggie Newson today in announcing that DWD's Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) helped 4,875 consumers achieve their employment goals during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. This represents the highest number of successful year-end case closures on current record.
"One of our top priorities for the state is developing our workforce," Governor Walker said. "A strong Wisconsin workforce enables our businesses to grow and thrive, which in turn, helps to strengthen our economy. We need workers with diverse skills, and that includes workers with disabilities, who have a unique set of abilities to contribute to Wisconsin businesses. The work DVR does to connect job seekers with disabilities to employers is outstanding, and it's a win-win for our state as we bolster our workforce and spur economic growth."
