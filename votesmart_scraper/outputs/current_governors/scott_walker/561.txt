Freedom and Prosperity: Governor Scott Walker Announces Property Tax Relief for Hard-Working Families
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Feb. 3, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today announced his Property Tax Relief plan as a part of the 2015-2017 State Budget. The past four years have seen consecutive property tax reductions for the typical Wisconsin homeowner. Governor Walker's budget proposal reaffirms his commitment to property tax relief, so that the typical homeowner will continue to see declines, as opposed to increases in the decade before Governor Walker took office.
"Largely because of our reforms and the flexibility we gave to local governments, property taxes on a typical home in Wisconsin are $131 less this year than they were in 2010," said Governor Walker. "I am proud to say that our state budget will continue those reforms, so the property tax bill on a typical home will be even lower during the next two years. Just as I promised, property taxes by the end of 2016 will be lower than they were in 2014."
In the decade prior to Governor Walker taking office, property taxes on a median value home increased 27 percent. Since the 2010-2011 property tax year, the typical homeowner has seen a decrease of more than $130 on their tax bill, about 4.4 percent.
