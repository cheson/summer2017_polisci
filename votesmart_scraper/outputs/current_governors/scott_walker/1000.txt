Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
We just welcomed home about 100 service members who were deployed in the Middle East. These welcome home events are one of my favorite things to do as your Governor.
The families have signs and flags, and there is plenty of excitement in the air as friends and families see their loved ones come off the plane.
Thankfully, it's been more than a year since we've lost a service member from Wisconsin. Tonette and I pray that this trend continuesÂ…but it is a solemn reminder, particularly as we observed Memorial Day this week, of the many men and women who made that ultimate sacrifice to protect the freedoms we hold dear.
And it should motivate all of us to go out and find veterans in our community and thank them for the sacrifices they were willing to make for our country.
