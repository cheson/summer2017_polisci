Location: Madison, WI

Governors Scott Walker and Steve Beshear offered up a friendly wager today in anticipation of the NCAA Final Four men's basketball game on Saturday.
"The Badgers have had an incredible season thus far and have represented Wisconsin admirably both on and off the court," Governor Walker said. "As we face the Kentucky Wildcats in the Final Four for the second year in a row, this game certainly won't be a "slam dunk,' but under the leadership of Coach Ryan and the talent and teamwork of the players, the Badgers have what it takes to go all the way. This Saturday, I look forward to joining fans across the state and nation in cheering our team on to victory. On Wisconsin!"
Governor Walker bet an assortment of Wisconsin cheese and sausage, and root beer, that the Wisconsin Badgers will win, while Governor Beshear wagered Kentucky bourbon for a University of Kentucky Wildcats victory.
The Badgers tip off against the Wildcats this Saturday, April 4, at 7:49 p.m. CT at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana.
