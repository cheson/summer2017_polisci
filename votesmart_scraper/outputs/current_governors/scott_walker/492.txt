Hi, this is Governor Scott Walker.
This week, I met with the boards of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) to discuss the consolidation of state services, which will help to ensure state government is more effective, more efficient, and more accountable to the public.
We announced our plan to merge state agencies and services earlier this year, as a government that is reduced in size and scope helps ensure a higher quality of living here in Wisconsin, and greater economic prosperity for our state.
The unemployment rate in the state is down to 4.6 percent -- much lower than the national rate of 5.5 percent. Our work to operate a lean and nimble government, and keep spending in check, means those who fund government -- that being you, the taxpayers - keep more of your own money -- and your spending helps fuel the economy.
Our plan to create the Forward Wisconsin Development Authority will sharpen our focus on economic development and housing needs and allow for an increased cooperation at the grassroots level with local, regional, and private sector partners to cultivate and grow our economy.
We also propose the creation of the Department of Financial Institutions and Professional Standards, which will improve Wisconsin state services by more efficiently certifying businesses and professionals who wish to operate in our state.
It is our goal that the merger of these state agencies will help to create a state government that is more accessible to the public, is less intrusive in the lives of Wisconsinites, and better serves the people of our great state.
