Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Sept. 18, 2013
Location: Middleton, WI

Governor Scott Walker today joined the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin for their annual meeting. The meeting focused on Wisconsin's transportation network and looked at areas for further growth.
"A strong infrastructure system is important for businesses all across the state," Governor Walker said. "The agriculture and manufacturing industries in particular depend on a healthy transportation system to conduct day-to-day business. We are committed to working with our local partners and local governments so Wisconsin can continue to maintain and develop existing infrastructure projects."
The Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin (TDA) works with members, policymakers, and journalists to advocate for a more effective transportation network. Wisconsin has a varied transportation system with 110,000 miles of interstate, 133 public-use airports, 29 commercial ports, 12 railroads, and 81 public transit systems. Each year, millions of tons of cargo are hauled using these means and the TDA works to ensure all methods are supported and continuing to develop.
