Today, Governor Scott Walker and First Lady Tonette Walker declared 2013 to be the Year of Well-Being. The year will focus on four main areas of well-being: be active, be connected, be informed, and be part of your community.
"There are many ways people can improve their well-being. Over the next year, we will focus on four areas: being active to encourage people to move whenever possible, being connected to engage with those around you, being informed to understand what is best for your own health, and being a part of your community to offer your time to better the place you live," said Mrs. Walker.
Throughout the year, we will take the opportunity to tap into the resources that state agencies have already taken the time to develop. But this year is meant to be a chance to delve deeper into being well whenever possible. It is an opportunity to remember to take the stairs instead of the elevator or turn the TV off during family dinners. The hope is Wisconsinites will become informed about their health and take a look at their nutritional habits, while also taking the time to better their communities. In the near future, the "Disconnect to Connect" and "Give a 10-Spot" campaigns will be launched as a stepping stone to better well-being.
"We want to make Wisconsin the best place to live and work in the country," said Governor Walker. "Promoting the overall well-being of Wisconsinites is integral to helping people live prosperous and successful lives."
Mrs. Walker will be celebrating the Year of Well-Being in Walworth County by participating in a weekend of wellness activities, as well as cheering on the members of the local Boys and Girls Club participating in the Zumbathon.
