Press Release

Date: May 23, 2016
Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Walker addressed the National Main Street Center's conference, Main Street Now, in Milwaukee today. In 2015, Wisconsin Main Street communities were responsible for the creation of an estimated 586 jobs and 115 new businesses throughout the state.
"The Wisconsin Main Street Program was established in 1987 and has since worked in over 65 communities throughout the state, helping to create an estimated 12,000 jobs and grow 2,300 new businesses," Governor Walker said. "Through the work of communities across Wisconsin in 2015, $6.3 million in public investment was leveraged to bring $91 million in private investment. This public-private partnership has led to the significant economic development and workforce growth in the last year, and we're excited to see how this program continues to transform Wisconsin communities in the years to come."
The 2016 Main Street Now Conference, co-hosted by the National Main Street Center, Inc. and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, brings together a nation-wide network of community revitalization professionals, city planners, volunteers and elected officials working to sustain the future of America's historic downtowns.
Through 15 mobile workshops and over 90 education sessions, Main Street Now provides a forum for best practices on igniting and sustaining the redevelopment of small towns, mid-sized downtowns, and urban commercial districts. Using Wisconsin as a living laboratory, attendees will examine how to strengthen downtowns of all sizes through a variety of tools, including supporting creative economies, attracting tech entrepreneurs, and developing small business. The conference, now in its 31st year, is the nation's foremost educational and networking event for those engaged in revitalizing traditional commercial districts and downtowns through historic preservation-based community development.
