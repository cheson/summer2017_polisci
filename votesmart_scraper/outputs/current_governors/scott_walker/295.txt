Today, Governor Scott Walker released the following statement on the passing of former First Lady Nancy Reagan:
Tonette and I send our prayers to the Reagan family. Nancy Reagan had such a positive impact on the lives of so many Americans.
Tonette and I had the honor of meeting her in California when I spoke at the Reagan Presidential Library in 2012. She was so interested in Wisconsin and she loved hearing of the influence her husband had on me. She will be missed by me and so many others -- across America and around the world.
