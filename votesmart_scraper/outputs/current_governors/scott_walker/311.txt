Governor Scott Walker Issues Executive Order Barring State Agencies from Developing 111(d) Plan
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Feb. 15, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker issued Executive Order #186 as part of his continuing efforts to protect Wisconsin taxpayers from potentially devastating impact of the overreaching federal rule imposed by the Obama Administration. Last week, a stay was granted for the 111(d) Rule by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Executive Order issued today prohibits state agencies, departments, boards, commissions, or any of their agents from developing or promoting the development of a state plan to comply with the 111(d) Rule until the expiration of the stay issued by the U.S. Supreme Court.
"Clearly, this rule exceeds the President's authority and would place an undue burden on the Wisconsin ratepayers and manufacturers," Governor Walker said. "The stay granted last week by the Supreme Court validates our concerns about this rule. The Executive Order we issued today protects our taxpayers from an unnecessary cost of up to $13 billion as we continue to act in the best interests of Wisconsin citizens."
