Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Aug. 9, 2013
Location: Lac du Flambeau, WI

Governor Scott Walker and members of his Cabinet today met with tribal leaders at the Lake of the Torches Resort in Lac du Flambeau. The meeting is a complement to Governor Walker's ongoing quarterly meetings with Wisconsin's tribal nations. Leaders and representatives from all 11 tribes attended the meeting.
"We had an excellent meeting today and it focused largely on economic issues," Governor Walker said. "Tribal leaders face many of the same economic issues the State faces, and we had a good discussion about promoting economic development and jobs. I was pleased to once again have the opportunity to sit down and meet with all of the tribal leaders and their councils and representatives."
"We appreciate the state being here today to discuss our common causes," Tom Maulson, Chairman of the Lac du Flambeau Tribe said. "The state recognizes our sovereignty but also understands that there are issues which affect us all and we were able to accomplish some good work today. Sitting down together is the always the start to being able to achieve more in the future."
In addition to quarterly meetings between the Governor and the tribal leaders, each Cabinet member also meets at least quarterly with the Tribes to discuss issues pertaining to individual department. After the meetings concluded, the Governor and Cabinet toured a health and dental clinic, the downtown area, and the Natural Resource building at Lac du Flambeau. The goals of each quarterly meeting are to discuss areas of concern, continue to find ways to work together, and foster a productive relationship.
