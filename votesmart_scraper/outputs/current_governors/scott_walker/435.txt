BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to "Hannity." And tonight, we're broadcasting where this crowd would like to call Scott Walkersha, Wisconsin, where earlier this evening, Governor Scott Walker officially announced that he's running for president of the United States. He will be our guest for the entire hour.
But first, here's how it all went down earlier tonight.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. SCOTT WALKER, R-WIS., 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: America is a can-do kind of country. Unfortunately, we have a was -- a government in Washington that just can't quite seem to get the job done. The good news is it's not too late. We can turn things around!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WALKER: To do that, we need new, fresh leadership, leadership with big, bold ideas from outside of Washington, the kind of leadership that knows how to get things done.
I hear from people who say they're frustrated with politicians telling people what they're against and who they're against. Let me tell you what I'm for.
