Transcript below:
Hi. I'm Scott Walker.
Despite what cynics might say, the facts are clear: our reforms are getting results. A recent survey showed that 88% of job creators in the state believe Wisconsin is headed in the right direction (versus just 10% last year). Nation-wide, Wisconsin moved up 17 states as a good place to create jobs in (that's the fastest increase in the country). All of this good news leads to an increased potential for private sector job growth.
Our fiscal reforms are getting results too. Our state faced a $3.6 billion deficit in January but now we have a budget with a projected surplus. If fact, Moody's called our budget "credit positive." Our reforms have also protected property taxpayers by holding the line on property taxes after years of massive increases. Working families, seniors and small business owners will benefit from this property tax relief.
Finally, our reforms are making governments work better too. Schools and local governments can now make personnel decisions based on merit. They can also pay for performance and put the best and brightest in our classrooms and our workplaces. That's exactly what school districts like Kaukauna are doing because of our reforms. They took a $400,000 deficit and turned it into a surplus which allowed them to hire more teachers, lower class sizes and set money aside for merit pay.
Private sector job growth, balanced budgets, protecting property taxpayers and better schools and governments. Overall, our reforms have produced positive results for Wisconsin.
