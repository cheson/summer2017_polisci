Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker signed legislation to assist people struggling to pay high heating bills as a result of the propane shortage and bitter cold winter. Under Assembly Bill 770, the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) will administer the emergency heating assistance loan guarantee program. To be approved for emergency heating assistance, applicants must have a household income no higher than 200 percent of the median income of their county, they cannot be eligible for conventional financing, and they must demonstrate reasonable ability to repay the loan.
"The propane shortage affected residents and business owners all around the state, and left many with unexpectedly high heating bills that they cannot pay in full," said Governor Walker. "This emergency heating assistance loan guarantee program will help families make ends meet and offers some relief from the burden created by the propane crisis."
