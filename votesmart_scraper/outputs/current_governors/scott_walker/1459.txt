Governor-Elect Walker Statement on Madison-Milwaukee Train Line
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Dec. 9, 2010
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor-elect Walker released the following statement:
As I said along the campaign trail, we didn't need and couldn't afford the Madison to Milwaukee rail line. While I would have preferred to have the $810 million reallocated to repair our crumbling roads and bridges, I am glad that the transportation fund will not be on the hook for a minimum of $7.5 million of operating subsidies every year.
Wisconsin taxpayers were victorious today in defeating this project. The last election showed that Wisconsinites oppose runaway government spending.
The Madison to Milwaukee train line is dead.
