Hi, this is Scott Walker.
One of our top priorities continues to be cultivating the economic climate here in Wisconsin so that all citizens have the chance to achieve their piece of the American Dream and the freedom and prosperity that comes with it.
Our reforms have put Wisconsin on the right track. According to the latest Gallup ranking of state job markets, Wisconsin is among the best in the nation. Tied with Texas and Nebraska for the best hiring climate, Wisconsin ranks second in the nation, behind only North Dakota.
This continues Wisconsin's upward trend in the Gallup poll. Our new ranking of second indicates that our reforms are working, and that businesses and employers are ready to hire.
Also this week, Chief Executive Magazine listed Milwaukee as one of the "5 Great Cities for Growing Your Manufacturing Business." Statewide, Wisconsin ranks 5th in the nation for manufacturing job creation since we took office.
Wisconsin has a rich history as a national leader in manufacturing -- and we're home to familiar names like Harley-Davidson, Master Lock, Badger Meter, General Electric, West Bend, Johnsonville, and Kohler, just to name a few. These are excellent Wisconsin manufacturers, and looking forward, we will continue to strengthen manufacturing right here in our great state.
This is fantastic news for the people of Wisconsin. We will continue this momentum so that all Wisconsinites who want a job can find a job.
