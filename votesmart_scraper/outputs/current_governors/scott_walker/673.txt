Following Governor Scott Walker's initiative to target Waste, Fraud, and Abuse, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) has released totals showing during the four tax seasons in his first term, DOR stopped $134 million in refunds related to fraud and adjustments, compared to $60 million for the four prior tax seasons, an increase of 122% or an additional $74 million.
"Targeting waste, fraud, and abuse in state government is a key priority, because it is our job to spend the taxpayers hard-earned dollars wisely," Governor Walker said. "This is a great example of how extra effort adds up, and allows us to continue to invest in worker training, and growing our economy."
In the 2013-2015 state budget, $7.4 million was provided for enhanced enforcement and identity verification. In the last fiscal year alone, the anti-fraud efforts stopped $49.6 million in refunds, driven by new programs like Identity (ID) Verification and other department initiatives.
"We are focused on preventing identity theft and protecting taxpayers through our fraud detection and identity verification initiatives," said DOR Secretary Richard Chandler. "We have stepped up efforts to deter, combat and reject tax fraud where it occurs. I am pleased with the results, and thank the Legislature for supporting the Governor's budget initiatives."
Together, in fiscal year 2014, ID Verification and other department initiatives have reduced or denied refunds by over $49.6 million, including $17.7 million in earned income credit claims and nearly $15.3 million in homestead credit claims.
