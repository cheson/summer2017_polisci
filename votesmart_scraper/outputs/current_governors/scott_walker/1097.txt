Today, Competitive Wisconsin Inc., a group focused on growing jobs in Wisconsin, released a report titled "Be Bold 2." According to Competitive Wisconsin Inc., "Be Bold 2" is a collaborative effort undertaken with international human capital expert, ManpowerGroup, to identify specific, measurable, actionable strategies that will make Wisconsin a global leader in the race to educate, train and support the talent that job creators must have.
Governor Walker released the following statement regarding the "Be Bold 2" report:
We have worked hard to build off of Competitive Wisconsin's original "Be Bold" report, which called for the creation of a public-private economic development partnership. Based on this report, last year, I signed a bill creating the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.
I look forward to fully reviewing the "Be Bold 2" report and I would like thank Competitive Wisconsin for their continued commitment to job growth in our great state.
Employers are still struggling to get enough skilled workers to fill the jobs that are currently available. This report draws attention to the need to solve this skills gap. My next budget we will make dynamic changes in workforce development to ultimately help address the current skills gap.
