Hi, this is Scott Walker.
This week the federal government verified the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages for the first quarter of 2012. It showed Wisconsin created more than 37,000 private sector jobs from March 2011 to March 2012, including a gain of 12,138 jobs in the manufacturing sector.
Wisconsin's continued private sector job growth is good news. I am particularly pleased with the gains in the manufacturing sector, which makes up a huge portion of our state's economy.
The quarterly job count data shows, yet again, the monthly job estimates are not accurate. I am hopeful that the state Department of Workforce Development will be able to work with the federal government to bring the monthly estimates back in line with the actual job numbers.
The fiscal reforms we put in place coupled with reforms like reducing frivolous lawsuits and bringing certainty and accountability to state regulations, have established a strong foundation for job growth.
Moving forward, we will continue to find ways to make it easier for the people of our state to put Wisconsinites back to work.
