Governor Walker Statement on Legislative Action
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 9, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker released the following statement regarding the action taken by the Legislature:
The Senate Democrats have had three weeks to debate this bill and were offered repeated opportunities to come home, which they refused. In order to move the state forward, I applaud the Legislature's action today to stand up to the status quo and take a step in the right direction to balance the budget and reform government. The action today will help ensure Wisconsin has a business climate that allows the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs.
