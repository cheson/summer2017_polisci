Governor Scott Walker today joined Wisconsin bioscience companies and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) at the BIO International Convention in Chicago. The event is a gathering of the international bioscience community and runs from April 22--25, 2013.
"Wisconsin is the proud home to many leaders in the bioscience industry," Governor Walker said. "The BIO International Convention gives us an opportunity to promote our bioscience community and show the world that Wisconsin is a place for growth and opportunity in the industry."
Wisconsin's bioscience industry and its growth will be highlighted at the Wisconsin pavilion with over 50 Wisconsin companies and associations in attendance. The pavilion is coordinated by BioForward, Wisconsin's association representing bioscience companies, universities, non-profits, service providers, and government agencies.
WEDC is providing branding and logistics support for the pavilion, which will be using the "InWisconsin" brand created by WEDC in 2012 to highlight the economic advantages in the state.
The BIO International Convention is the largest bioscience event in the world. It brings together leading experts to discuss trends affecting the industry and provides the opportunity to network with others in the bioscience sector.
