Governor Scott Walker Statement on EPA's Final Rule
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Aug. 3, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today relating to President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) final rule.
Yet again, President Obama is taking unilateral action and overstepping the limits of his authority to pursue a political agenda. The Obama Administration ignored the significant, overriding issues that will increase costs for Wisconsin ratepayers by up to $13 billion, unnecessarily harming families and killing manufacturing jobs.
We will examine the final plan in detail, but clearly Wisconsin's extensive, constructive comments to the EPA have fallen on deaf ears in Washington.
Wisconsin has taken every opportunity to express that the Obama Administration is not only exceeding its authority by issuing the EPA's final rule, but is pursuing the least efficient way to make environmental gains.
Today, I am asking the Attorney General to take immediate action to protect Wisconsin ratepayers and workers from the devastating impacts of the Obama Administration's actions.
In addition, I am directing the Department of Natural Resources to work with the Public Service Commission to evaluate the financial impact of the final rule.
