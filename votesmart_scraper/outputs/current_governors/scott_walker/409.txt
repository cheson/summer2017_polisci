Governor Scott Walker proclaimed September as Workforce Development Month. The month highlights the state's workforce development programs that provide Wisconsin workers and students with the tools they need to obtain family-supporting jobs that contribute to bolstering Wisconsin's economy.
"Workforce Development Month is an excellent opportunity to celebrate our success in bridging the skills gap," Governor Scott Walker said. "While we've made great strides, our work is not yet complete. The key to Wisconsin's continued success lies in a strong and talented workforce. As we continue to invest in workforce development programs, we will target areas where the skills gap still exists, and ensure that employers are able to hire Wisconsin workers who are equipped with the skills they need to succeed."
