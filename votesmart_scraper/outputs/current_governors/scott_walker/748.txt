Governor Scott Walker released a video message and a proclamation today in honor of State Employee Recognition Day.
Thank you for the good work that you do for the State of Wisconsin.
Over the years, I've met some amazing people who do incredible jobs for our state government.
From the law enforcement professionals who keep us safe, to the staff who help us place more people with disabilities into the workplace in our communities.
From the team who made state government spending transparent and online, to the pros who ensure that families have access to health care.
From the crews who build and maintain our transportation infrastructure, to those who work to manage our natural resources.
From those who help license professionals, to those who promote economic development and housing, and agriculture and tourism.
From those who take care of our veterans, to those who continue to serve today in our Wisconsin National Guard.
To all of our state employees, we say thank you. We appreciate your hard work!
