Governor Scott Walker praised Congress for giving bipartisan approval to three free-trade deals last night. The free-trade agreements were passed for Columbia, Panama and South Korea. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, exports support over 65,000 jobs in Wisconsin. According to the Department of Commerce, over 6,800 companies export products from Wisconsin.
"Thousands of Wisconsin employers rely on world markets to sell their products," said Governor Walker. "The trade agreements that were passed with bipartisan votes in Congress will improve the global marketplace for Wisconsin products and help our economy grow. The three countries that Congress approved last night represent growing markets for Wisconsin exports."
