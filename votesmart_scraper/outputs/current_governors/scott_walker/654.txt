Governor Scott Walker Approves Emergency Rule Easing Access to Identification Cards for Voters
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Sept. 12, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker approved the proposed permanent and emergency rule modifying the Wisconsin Administrative Code to ensure everyone has the ability to access documents required for issuance of an identification card for the purpose of voting, free of charge.
"This is a common sense measure that protects the integrity of our elections," Governor Scott Walker said. "It's important for all voters to have access to voter identification cards, and also, for everyone to have utmost confidence in the system when they cast their ballots."
This week, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation's Division of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Health Services announced a new process to verify underlying documents, free of charge, to make sure everyone who wants an ID for the purpose of voting, is able to get one. The DMV has been offering free voter identification cards since 2011. This measure builds on that service, so those who don't have documentation to get an ID, such as a birth certificate, do not have to incur costs to access that documentation.
The no-charge verification process will be fully operational on Monday, September 15. Applicants can obtain more information about the process online at wisconsindmv.gov or by calling 608-266-1069.
