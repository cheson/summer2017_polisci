Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined fellow Harley-Davidson riders today and rode his 2003 Harley-Davidson Road King in the House of Harley 110th Military Appreciation Day Parade. The ride is the first of the week to celebrate the 110th Anniversary of the Harley-Davidson Motor Company.
"Honoring our military service members and veterans at the beginning of this Harley-Davidson anniversary celebration is very appropriate," Governor Walker said. "No one has given more to protect our freedom than these brave individuals, and this ride was a great tribute to them."
The ride honored active duty military, veterans, and those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, and benefits Fisher House Wisconsin. The Fisher House is a private-public partnership that helps military service members and their families in times of need. A flyover by the Wisconsin Wing of the Commemorative Air Force kicked-off the event at the House of Harley before riders departed for the Civil War Memorial on the VA Medical Center grounds. After arriving at the memorial, the ceremony included a bugle call, wreath laying, rifle volley, and taps.
