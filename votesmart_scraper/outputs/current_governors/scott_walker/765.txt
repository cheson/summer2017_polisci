Governor Scott Walker Declares Energy Emergency in Response to Continuing Cold Temperatures and Need for Propane
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 17, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker declared a ten-day energy emergency in response to the continuing cold temperatures and the ongoing demand for propane. The declaration allows propane delivery vehicles to exceed special weight limits in Wisconsin related to propane transportation, particularly for the limits imposed on the state's local roads during the spring thaw.
"The health and safety of our citizens is our number one priority, and this step allows the efficient transportation of fuel to the areas most in need," Governor Walker said. "Since last fall, we have been working to help lessen the burden of the propane shortage on Wisconsin. We know the burden isn't over for our friends and loved ones who rely on propane to heat their homes and businesses during this long heating season."
With the continuing cold temperatures and burden of propane costs over the winter, some propane tanks are at very low levels, and the demand for delivery remains high. Weight limit restrictions on some roads prevent propane delivery vehicles from accessing residences, which results in risks to the health, welfare, and economic well-being of residential customers and other end users who rely on propane heating systems. By declaring an energy emergency, propane delivery vehicles can exceed local weight limits during this ten-day period.
