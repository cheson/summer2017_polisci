Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker will attend the Governor's Auction Committee Reception this evening in Milwaukee to celebrate the success of the 2015 Governor's Blue Ribbon Livestock Auction, thank 2015 auction buyers, and promote the upcoming Wisconsin State Fair in August.
The auction not only highlights Wisconsin's deep agricultural history but also provides scholarships to Wisconsin youth who raise and care for animals competing in the event.
"Agriculture is a major industry here in Wisconsin, and the youth exhibitors here tonight are the future of this industry in our state," Governor Walker said. "The Governor's Blue Ribbon Auction gives them a chance to show off all their hard work to raise and care for their animals. Thanks to the buyers and supporters of the auction, youth participants are awarded scholarships to offset education costs, ultimately strengthening agriculture in our state by allowing them to pursue their career ambitions."
The 2015 Governor's Blue Ribbon Livestock Auction raised $419,750 for youth scholarships and grants -- a $98,900 increase from the 2014 auction. The auction included a total of 25 junior market steers, barrows, and lambs. Lauren May of Mineral Point, Wisconsin exhibited the Grand Champion steer, a 1,333-pound animal sold for a record-breaking $65,000 to Roundy's Supermarkets.
Due to these record-breaking numbers, the Blue Ribbon Sale of Champions Foundation has increased the 2016 scholarship awards to $30,000, funding scholarships for 26 Wisconsin students, including five $2,000 scholarships, six $1,500 scholarships, seven $1,000 scholarships, and eight $500 scholarships. These scholarships recognize the achievements of Wisconsin State Fair Junior Livestock exhibitors and assist them with their educational expenses.
