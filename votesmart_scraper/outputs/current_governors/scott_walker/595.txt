Strong fiscal management has led to another decrease for the State's General Fund deficit according to the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report released today by the State Controller's Office. Based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the General Fund deficit has declined since Governor Walker took office in 2011, totaling a $1.6 billion decline over the past three fiscal years. For Fiscal Year 2014, the GAAP deficit is approximately $1.3 billion.
Governor Scott Walker issued the following statement about the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR):
We have put more money into the pockets of our hardworking taxpayers and our GAAP deficit has continued to decline, strengthening Wisconsin's financial position. The tough, but prudent, decisions we have made -- and will continue to make -- have improved our bond rating and helped us move Wisconsin forward.
