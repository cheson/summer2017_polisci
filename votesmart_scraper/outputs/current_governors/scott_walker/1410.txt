Governor's Office Releases Detailed Budget Savings Breakdown
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 16, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker's office released documents from the State Budget Office outlining a detailed breakdown of each local unit of government's impact from the savings realized by the budget repair bill and potential impact of the proposed biennial 2011-13 budget.
Attached is the detailed breakdown as well as a cover letter explaining the methodology used in each calculation.
Along with this detailed analysis Governor Walker released the following statement:
Overall counties, municipalities, school districts and other local governments will realize more savings than reductions in state aid. Instead of pushing tough spending decisions and potential tax increases onto other levels of government, like has been done in the past, I chose a new direction.
The budget we introduced will reduce the structural deficit by 90%, to the lowest point it has been in the last 16 years while maintaining core services. Over 160 years ago our founding fathers adopted the state's constitution which discussed that through frugality and moderation in government we will see freedom and prosperity for our people. We are upholding their promise today.
