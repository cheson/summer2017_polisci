Governor Scott Walker toured the Healing House in Kansasville today as a part of Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Healing House is the second location operated by Women's Resource Center (WRC) of Racine. WRC is a trauma-informed care organization that provides personalized service to victims of domestic violence and their families to help them find safety and self-sufficiency.
"The Women's Resource Center is dedicated to supporting victims of domestic violence and their familes," Governor Walker said. "With the addition of the Healing House, they are able to increase services for Wisconsin's most vulnerable. Domestic violence impacts the lives of tens of thousands of Wisconsinites every year, and we will continue our work to support victims of domestic violence and their children, so they can end the cycle of domestic violence."
