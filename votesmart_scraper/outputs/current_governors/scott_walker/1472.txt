OpenSky Radio Problems Plague Police, Fire Fighters

Scott Walker, Milwaukee county executive and candidate for governor, today issued the following statement on Mayor Barrett's failed OpenSky Police and Fire radio system:

"Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett has failed the brave men and women on the frontlines of public safety as well as the families they serve by ignoring the complaints of hundreds of frontline employees who documented this troubled radio system.

Tom Barrett's $17.5 million police and fire radio system continues to be plagued with problems with no solutions coming from the Mayor that will give first responders the confidence that, when they call for backup, someone will be on the other end of that call.

It's unacceptable that no matter how many complaints Mayor Barrett receives, he continues to blame others and pass the buck instead of showing the leadership necessary to solve this problem."
