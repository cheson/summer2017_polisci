Today, Governor Scott Walker spoke with business owners and community leaders at the Door County Economic Development Corporation meeting in Sturgeon Bay.
"From agriculture to manufacturing, shipbuilding to tourism, Door County plays a vital role in Wisconsin's economy," Governor Walker said. "To support the economy in Door County and throughout the state, we have replaced billion-dollar deficits and double-digit tax hikes with a $911 million dollar surplus and nearly $2 billion dollars in tax relief. Together, we continue moving Wisconsin forward."
Founded in 1989, the Door County Economic Development Corporation is a community partnership between public and private entities. The group focuses on creating and sustaining economic growth and job creation in Door County. The Door County Economic Development Corporation targets key industries for expansion, such as shipbuilding and tourism, while also fostering entrepreneurial growth.
Almost 100 million people travel to Wisconsin every year generating an income of $16.8 billion dollars. These visitors support over 184,000 jobs, meaning one in every 13 jobs is directly or indirectly sustained through tourism.
