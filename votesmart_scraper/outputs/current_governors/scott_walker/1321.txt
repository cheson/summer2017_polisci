Governor Walker Accepts Homeland Security Preparedness Report
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Dec. 21, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today accepted a report from Major General Don Dunbar, Adjutant General of Wisconsin and Wisconsin's Homeland Security Advisor, on Wisconsin's overall homeland security readiness. The report outlines the efforts Wisconsin is taking to prevent and respond to potential emergencies.
"Keeping Wisconsin citizens safe is my top priority," said Governor Walker. "This Homeland Security report confirms that we are continuing to improve our readiness to respond but we still have work to do to make sure whatever the threat, we are ready to respond."
Some of the highlights of this year's annual report include:
* Homeland Security funding. As anticipated, federal homeland security funding for Wisconsin decreased -- from $10.4 million in FY 2010 to $5.8 million in FY 2011. The decline was expected as a change in how the U.S. Department of Homeland Security calculates funding for states.
* Improving Cyber Security. To combat cyber terrorism, Wisconsin's Division of Enterprise Technology has developed a Cyber Annex to the State Emergency Operations Plan. DET is partnering with various law enforcement, government agencies and the private sector to counter the cyber threat.
* CBRNE Emergency Response Force. The Wisconsin National Guard has developed a specialized unit that will support local responders in decontamination, medical response and search and extraction capabilities. The CERFP (CBRNE Emergency Response Force Package) will greatly expand the state's response capabilities to major incidents.
