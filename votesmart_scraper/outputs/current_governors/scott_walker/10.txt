Governor Walker Calls on U.S. Senators to Keep Their Word and Repeal and Replace Obamacare
Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker is calling on Republican members of the United States Senate to keep their campaign promises and repeal and replace Obamacare. Governor Walker is also warning that continuing to allow the Obamacare Medicaid expansion to grow is not a repeal.
"Republican Senators vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare if they had a chance," Governor Walker said. "Well, now is their chance. There are no excuses."
Recent reports suggest there is an effort to extend the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare far into the future. Governor Walker is warning against this idea as it goes against repealing Obamacare.
"The current system is not working. Allowing the Obamacare expansion to grow is not a repeal of Obamacare," Governor Walker continued. "Senate Republicans need to keep their promise and repeal and replace Obamacare."
Governor Walker says Wisconsin is a model for how to repeal and replace Obamacare. Wisconsin did not buy into the Obamacare expansion, yet everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid for the first time in state history. Wisconsin is a top 10 state for coverage and for health care systems.
