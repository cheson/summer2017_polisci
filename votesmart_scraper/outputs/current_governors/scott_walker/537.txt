Today, Governor Scott Walker announced the state is accepting nominations for the 32nd annual Virginia Hart Special Recognition Award. This award recognizes the "unsung heroines" of state service.
"Since 1983, the Virginia Hart Special Recognition Award has been a great way to recognize outstanding women serving the state," said Governor Walker. "I encourage everyone who knows someone who goes above and beyond in their position, working for the state of Wisconsin, to tell us their story and submit a nomination."
The award was established on behalf of Virginia Hart, Wisconsin's first female cabinet member. During her public service career, she served as Secretary of the Department of Regulation and Licensing, Chairperson of the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations Commission, and Chairperson of the Labor and Industry Review Commission. Her friends and colleagues established this award upon her retirement.
If you are interested in nominating someone for the award, please see the attached form. The deadline for submitting nominations is March 31, 2015. The award ceremony will be held at the State Capitol in May.
