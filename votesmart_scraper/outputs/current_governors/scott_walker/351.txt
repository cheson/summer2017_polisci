Location: Madison, WI

This week, Governor Scott Walker joined the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) in announcing $1.5 million in Broadband Expansion Grants. Today, Governor Walker traveled throughout the Northwoods to award grants to Wittenberg Wireless, LLC in Antigo, Norvado in Cable, and ChoiceTel, LLC in Land O'Lakes. The grants are being matched by Wisconsin businesses, non-profits, and local governments, which benefit thousands of citizens throughout the state. The Broadband Expansion Grants announced this week are a part of the Broadband Expansion Grant Program.
"We've heard from business leaders around the state, especially in Northern Wisconsin, that a major hurdle to economic development in their communities is minimal access to high speed internet," Governor Walker said. "We are dedicated to growing our economy and ensuring it remains strong, and by tripling the funding for broadband grants in our most recent budget, we're working to ensure that goal is a reality. The bottom line is that these grants help us level the playing field in terms of economic development in the underserved areas of our state with limited access to broadband internet."
