Hi Everyone. Scott Walker here.
Wisconsin hit an all-time record for exports last year, and this week, we are working to build on that success.
Today, I'm in Spain as part of a weeklong trade mission that also includes France and Germany.
We are busy meeting with companies and international leaders, and building relationships, to promote business growth and investments with Wisconsin companies.
These overseas partnerships are key to increasing the state's exports.
We were in Germany for the signing of an agreement between the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, to collaborate with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health on Alzheimer's Research.
The Water Council has also made great progress here in encouraging innovation in water technology startups in Wisconsin.
These are just a few of the great strides we are making to continue to grow Wisconsin exports, build on the economy, and create great, family-supporting jobs at home.
