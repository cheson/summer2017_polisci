Weekly Radio Address: Lasting Property Tax Relief
Statement

Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Lasting Property Tax Relief."
Hi, Scott Walker here.
Ever wonder why the state government is listed on your property tax bill?
Well, we need to get rid of the state property tax.
I'm proud to report to you that in my state budget plan, we actually eliminate the state property tax. That's right. For the first time since 1931, there will be no state tax on your property tax bill. That is, if lawmakers approve our budget.
Please tell your state Representative and your state Senator that you want them to stop the state property tax. Remind them that this is a key part of lasting property tax relief.
In the decade before we took office, property taxes went up 27 percent.
When we came in, we made property tax relief a priority. Now, property taxes on a median-valued home are lower than they were in 2010. And with this budget, they'll be even lower in 2018.
We want that tax relief to continue far into the future. But we hear that some lawmakers are reluctant. Please tell your lawmakers that we must stop the state property tax.
Thank you.
