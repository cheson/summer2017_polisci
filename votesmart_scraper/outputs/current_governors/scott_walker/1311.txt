"Farming is not just Wisconsin's most robust industry; it's a way of life for families who farm. As a child in rural Wisconsin, I watched farm families work from dawn to dusk to produce the food we buy and the raw materials found in products we use every day. The agriculture industry is the largest contributor to Wisconsin's economy and if it struggles, we all do. That's why I have worked to preserve Wisconsin as the home of the world's best producers."
-- Scott Walker
Wisconsin's agricultural industry contributes $59 billion to our economy each year and provides for more than one in every ten Wisconsin jobs. A new farm job spurs the creation of 1.3 jobs in other industries like food processing and distribution. Without a doubt, thriving farming operations are essential to a healthy state economy.
Year after year, our farmers overcome the challenges presented by Mother Nature and the federal government and consistently produce high quality products. It's critical to all of our families that Wisconsin farmers remain competitive in the growing global economy. It's not enough for Wisconsin government to simply avoid erecting regulatory roadblocks to success; I have been working to establish policies that allow farmers to thrive. It is taking some time, but our efforts are working and exports of agriculture products are up 24%.
