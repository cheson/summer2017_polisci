Issue Position

We must make quality, affordable healthcare available to hardworking families through market-based solutions like competition, transparency, and tax incentives - not Canadian style programs that put bureaucrats in charge of personal health care decisions. You should be able to choose your doctor, not have government make that decision for you.
Government's role should be to provide a system of checks and balances and a safety net for those who need it, while encouraging competition and transparency to make the system less complicated and more manageable for consumers.
We must also ensure that there is one standard of care for everyone - regardless of age, income level, or location - and that people have the option of taking their healthcare plan with them when they change jobs or move.
