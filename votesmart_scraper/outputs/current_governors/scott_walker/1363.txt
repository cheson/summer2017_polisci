Governor Walker announced today that Gundersen Lutheran Health System received a grant in the amount of $140,000 toward a biomass energy project from the Wisconsin Bioenergy Grant Program. The goal of the grant program, which is administered by the Wisconsin State Energy Office, is to assist businesses, NGOs, and municipalities in reducing fossil fuel use by applying renewable energy systems that use local resources. The new biomass energy system is set to be in place within two years.
"Gundersen Lutheran should be proud of all that they have recently accomplished," Governor Walker said. "As the recipient of a biomass energy grant, Gundersen Lutheran Health System exemplifies what Wisconsin business is. Businesses like these will play an integral part in creating 250,000 new jobs in Wisconsin by 2015."
