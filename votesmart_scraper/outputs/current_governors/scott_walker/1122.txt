This week the Bureau of Labor Statistics responded to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development's (DWD) suggestions on ways to improve the Census Employment Statistics.
"I am encouraged that Secretary Newson's hard work may help monthly job statistics become more accurate for our entire nation. Most importantly, his work will provide Wisconsin job creators with confidence to invest in our economy," said Governor Scott Walker. "While improvement of the monthly estimates is a step in the right direction, I will continue to track job growth by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which is widely regarded as much more accurate than the CES. Early last year I said we'd use the QCEW because it is an actual job count that is compiled from nearly 160,000 Wisconsin employers, which is better than an estimate that comes from a small sample of employers."
The CES is based off of a survey of roughly 3.5 percent of Wisconsin's employers. These estimates are currently unreliable for Wisconsin because, for the first time ever, the federal government benchmarked this estimate off of two quarters of data (previously three quarters were used).
The latest QCEW jobs numbers published showed that Wisconsin is heading in the right direction. After three years where Wisconsin lost more than 100,000 private sector jobs, in 2011 we added thousands of new jobs.
