Governor Scott Walker today honors those who lost their lives and their loved ones on September 11, 2001, and during the events that followed.
"Today we remember all of the victims killed and injured in the attacks of 9/11, and recognize the loss that changed the lives of their loved ones," Governor Walker said.

Today, we honor the law enforcement officers, first responders, and ordinary citizens who selflessly and heroically risked their lives in order to aid victims of the attacks. We also honor the servicemen and women who paid the ultimate price for our freedom and protection, as well as all of the troops who have served."
Governor Walker issued an Executive Order to fly the United States and Wisconsin flags at half-staff beginning at sunrise on Thursday, September 11, 2014, and ending at sunset.
Governor Walker delivered remarks at the 9/11 Remembrance Ceremony at the Milwaukee County War Memorial today, and also made stops at the 128th Air Refueling Wing in Milwaukee, and the 115th Fighter Wing in Madison to thank members of the Wisconsin Air National Guard for their service
