Governor Scott Walker recently joined the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) in announcing $1.5 million in Broadband Expansion Grants. Today, Governor Walker visited the Marshfield Clinic Lake Hallie Center in Chippewa Falls to award a $286,165 grant to Chippewa County and the Wisconsin Independent Network (WIN). Chippewa County and WIN are providing matching funds for the grant.
"Access to high-speed internet is a critical part of our infrastructure," Governor Walker said. "Just as we invest in building roads and putting up power lines, we're investing in these Broadband Expansion Grants to ensure Wisconsin's communities with limited access to internet are getting the infrastructure needed to support broadband connections. We've heard from business and community leaders all throughout northern Wisconsin that they need high-speed internet in order to grow jobs and new businesses. With these grants and the matching funds, we're working to help make that a reality."
