Governor Walker Signs Bill into Law Strengthening Rights for Waterfront Property Owners in Wisconsin
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 26, 2016
Location: Green Bay, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 459 into law today at De Keyser Construction in Green Bay. This bill modifies and further clarifies Wisconsin's navigable waters and wetlands regulations.
"When the people of Wisconsin buy land, they often want to improve it but find current regulations overly restrictive and difficult to understand," Governor Walker said. "This bill strengthens private property rights for Wisconsinites and streamlines the regulatory process for waterfront property owners so they are able to further use and enjoy their land."
Senate Bill 459, now Act 387, adds to the list of Areas of Special Natural Resource Interest (ASNRI) bodies of water that contain a sensitive area, and requires each waterway listed as an ASNRI to be published on a map on the website of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR). It also makes changes to areas designated as ASNRIs by removing waters or portions of waters that contain endangered or threatened species or aquatic elements as defined and identified in the Wisconsin Natural Heritage Inventory as well as waters in areas identified in a special management plan or special inventory study. The bill was authored by Senator Frank Lasee (R -- De Pere) and Representative Adam Jarchow (R -- Balsam Lake).
