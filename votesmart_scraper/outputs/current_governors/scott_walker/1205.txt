Governor Walker Signs Public Safety Legislation in Green Bay

Governor Walker signed four bills into law in Green Bay today, aimed at protecting victims and holding criminal offenders accountable.
Assembly Bill 552 eliminates the time limit to prosecute the crimes of first degree sexual assault, and attempted first degree sexual assault.
"Victims of violent sexual attacks suffer serious physical and emotional harm," Governor Walker said in signing the bill. "Those victims and prosecutors now have the ability to pursue felony charges when they are ready, or when they feel they have the evidence they need, regardless of how much time has passed."
Before Assembly Bill 552, felony prosecution of first-degree sexual assault and attempted first-degree sexual assault involving adults had to happen within six years of the crime. Current law already exempts first and second-degree homicide and first-degree sexual assault of a child from the statute of limitations.
Governor Walker thanked State Representative Jim Steineke (R-Kaukauna) and State Senator Rob Cowles (R-Green Bay) for their work on the bill.
Assembly bill 232 clarifies and strengthens the rights of crime victims and witnesses. This bill prohibits public agents and agencies from disclosing information that could identify the victim or witness for purposes unrelated to official business. It also allows victims and witnesses to assert their rights in court without having to rely on the Crime Victim Rights Board, and offers recourse if they feel their rights have been violated.
"Keeping Wisconsin safe, means ensuring crime victims and those who witness crimes know they will be treated with dignity and respect within the system," Governor Walker said. "I want to thank State Representative Andre Jacque (R-Bellevue) and State Senator Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) for working to protect these rights."
