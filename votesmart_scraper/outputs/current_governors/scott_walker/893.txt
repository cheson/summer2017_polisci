Governor Scott Walker today commended the University of Wisconsin (UW) System after it announced four additional UW campuses would be offering programs in the UW Flexible Option due to its early success.
"Offering additional programs for competency-based learning is great news for the UW System and prospective students across Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "I am looking forward to watching the UW Flexible Option grow and provide additional education options for people who are looking for opportunities outside the conventional education model."
UW-Parkside, UW-Stevens Point, UW-Stout, and UW-Madison will now be offering certificate programs in a variety of fields within the UW Flexible Option. The UW Flexible Option is a collaborative effort between the UW System, UW Colleges, and UW-Extension's Division of Continuing Education, Online and E-Learning.
