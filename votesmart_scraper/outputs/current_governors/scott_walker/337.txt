Governor Scott Walker Statement on Presidential Overreach
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Jan. 6, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today released the following statement regarding President Obama's planned executive action related to gun control:
President Obama is again disregarding the Constitutional principles of separation of powers and exceeding his authority as Chief Executive. The Obama Administration issued guidance creating uncertainty and fear of prosecution for law-abiding citizens who wish to exercise their right to sell firearms lawfully. Forthcoming federal rules could also deprive millions of Americans of their Second Amendment rights without any indication of imminent danger.
I have asked the Attorney General to review this proposed rule language as soon as it is made available and, if issued as reported, to take any and all legal measures available to challenge this illegal act.
