The number of job postings on JobCenterofWisconsin.com during 2012 is outperforming last year's totals at this time.
"Employers are optimistic that we've turned the corner and that Wisconsin's economy is moving in the right direction," said Governor Walker. "We're seeing this play out with a continued increase in the number of open and available jobs. Last year, we had a record 151,000 job postings on the site, and the totals for this year are over 15.6 percent higher than where the numbers were at this point in 2011. We encourage all job seekers to pursue these opportunities available through JobCenterofWisconsin.com."
The site JobCenterofWisconsin.com was launched in 2008 and has posted thousands of jobs both directly from employers as well as through partnering sites. On any given day, job seekers will find over 34,000 jobs on the site to consider. The weekly total number of postings has surpassed 2011 totals for each of the first 12 weeks of 2012. The increase in postings is consistent with other recent indicators, which show employers plan to hire more workers--showing employers have confidence in Wisconsin's economic outlook and are looking for qualified job seekers.
JobCenterofWisconsin.com is a free online service accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week that includes over 35,000 employee resumes in addition to job postings. Since autumn 2011, the site has also featured tens of thousands of additional postings that are pulled every day from a variety of websites and made available in real time directly on JobCenterofWisconsin.com.
