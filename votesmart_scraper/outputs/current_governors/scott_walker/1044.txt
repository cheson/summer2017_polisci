Transcript below:
Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
Every child, regardless of income or geographical location, should have access to a great education. One way we can do that, in addition to providing incentive funding for high performing and rapidly improving schools, is to provide alternative educational opportunities to students who are enrolled in a district that has multiple failing schools. Parents should not be forced to send their children to schools that are failing to meet expectations.
While my budget contains funding specifically dedicated to fixing failing schools, if they agree to create and implement a turnaround plan, that wasn't enough. For parents whose children are in districts where there are failing schools, I wanted to provide them with immediate additional choices. Specifically, my budget plan expands the Wisconsin Parental Choice Program to school districts that have at least two D or F schools, at least 4,000 students enrolled, and at least 20 students applying to the program. Enrollment in new districts would be capped at 500 for the first year and 1,000 for the next. Only middle-income and low-income families are eligible for vouchers through this expanded program.
My goal is to empower parents to make decisions regarding their children's education. I will continue to advocate strongly for middle-class and low-income parents whose children are in school districts with more than one failing school. Providing additional educational opportunities to these families will ensure children all across the state have access to a great education.
