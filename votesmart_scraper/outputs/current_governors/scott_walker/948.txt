Governor Scott Walker announced an increase today in the value of Wisconsin's dairy exports for the first half of 2013 and an increase in overall exports compared to the first six months of 2012. Dairy export value increased 23 percent in the first six months of this year compared to the same period last year, totaling $171 million. Wisconsin now ranks fourth nationwide for the value of dairy exports.
"The growth in our dairy industry is due to the hard work of the farmers and processors who produce quality and safe dairy products," Governor Walker said. "Wisconsin is quickly growing beyond being America's Dairy Land. Our agriculture industry continues to be a strong cornerstone of our state's economy, and the overall increase of Wisconsin exports is good for our economy and the hardworking employees who help produce great products. "
Dairy-related products were Wisconsin's most valuable agricultural export during the first half of 2013; followed by raw furskins, food ingredients, ethanol, and cereal grains. Canada, China, and Mexico were the state's top agricultural export destinations halfway through 2013.
Overall, Wisconsin exported $1.6 billion worth of agricultural products to 132 countries in the first half of this year. That is an increase of nearly 10 percent over last year, ranking Wisconsin 13th overall for agricultural exports, up from 14th for same period last year. In total, exports increased 0.35 percent.
