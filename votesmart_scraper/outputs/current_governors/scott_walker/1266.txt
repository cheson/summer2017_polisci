Today members of the Joint Finance Committee (JFC) voted unanimously to renovate a facility (Gates Hall) at the Wisconsin Veterans Home in Union Grove.
"This project will be good for the Department of Veterans Affairs Budget and it will help improve health care for Wisconsin Veterans," said Governor Walker. "I am glad the Legislature took the initial step to move forward this proposal. I would like to specifically thank State Senator Wanggaard and Rep. Vos for providing leadership on this important issue."
