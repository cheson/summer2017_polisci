Get Healthy!

The best way to reduce the cost of health care for individuals, businesses and taxpayers for the long term, is to shift our focus from treatment to prevention. This week I announced the re-creation of the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Health. I've tasked the appointees on the Council with focusing on ways to help people live healthier lives. Council members bring to the table background on fighting childhood obesity, promoting healthy eating, and encouraging physical activity. I look forward to their policy and program recommendations.
