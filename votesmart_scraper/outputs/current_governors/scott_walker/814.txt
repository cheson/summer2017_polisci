Helping Little Hearts: Governor Scott Walker Signs Newborn Testing Legislation at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 3, 2014
Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker today signed legislation relating to updating and expanding testing of newborn babies for congenital and metabolic diseases.
Senate Bill 523 allows Wisconsin's Department of Health Services to add or update requirements for newborn testing that have been the most effective for diagnosing congenital and metabolic diseases.
"This is a potentially life-saving measure for our newborns," Governor Walker said. "All babies deserve the best chance at a happy, healthy life. When a simple test can lead to early detection of a critical disease, making sure our newborns get that screening is the right thing to do."
The pulse oximetry test, which can detect certain critical, congenital heart defects, is likely to be the first test reviewed under this bill. The non-invasive test measures oxygen saturation in the blood using a sensor. Early detection of congenital heart defects leads to earlier treatment, which can be life-saving for a newborn.
The American Heart Association, March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, UW Health, Medical College of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Hospital Association, and other infant health advocates in Wisconsin support the bill.
Governor Walker thanked the authors of the bill, Senator Leah Vukmir (R-Wauwatosa) and Representative Pat Strachota (R-West Bend) for their work. The bill passed on a voice vote with bipartisan support. It is Act 135.
