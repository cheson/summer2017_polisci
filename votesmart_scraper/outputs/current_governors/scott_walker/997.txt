Governor Scott Walker released the following statement regarding the Joint Finance Committee's approval of income tax cuts for middle-class families:
"Because of our tough, but prudent, decisions we are now able to invest in our priorities. Cutting income taxes for middle-class families is one of those priorities, and I'm pleased the budget now includes tax relief totaling nearly $1 billion for the hardworking taxpayers. This tax relief is the largest since the 1999-2001 budget, and it also simplifies our tax code. While there is much work left to be done, we are headed in the right direction and we're moving Wisconsin forward."
