Today Governor Walker signed three bills aimed at improving health care delivery in Wisconsin.
"Helping health care professionals utilize technology will make patient care easier to administer and help reduce prescription drug abuse," said Governor Walker. "Today I am signing legislation into law that improves Wisconsin's health care system."
Governor Walker signed Senate Bill (SB) 317 into law, legislation that allows electronic prescriptions instead of paper copies for controlled substances that have a high potential for abuse and dependence. State Senator Leah Vukmir and State Representative Jeff Stone were the lead authors on this important legislation.
The Governor signed SB 421 into law, legislation that will lower health care costs by making it easier for some patients to access health care from physician assistants. This bill was authored by State Senator Leah Vukmir and State Representative Warren Petryk.
SB 383 was also signed into law, which ensures that health care professionals in Wisconsin are appropriately trained and supervised by creating disciplinary standards for anesthesiologist assistants and creating the Council on Anesthesiologist Assistants. This bill was authored by State Senator Alberta Darling and State Representative Erik Severson.
