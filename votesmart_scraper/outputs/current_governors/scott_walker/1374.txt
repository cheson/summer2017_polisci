Governor Walker Statement on Unemployment Benefits
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 11, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker released the following statement regarding the Legislature's action to extend unemployment benefits:
I support the Legislature continuing to move forward to extend unemployment benefits. I will sign the bill when it gets to my desk. I am pleased the Legislature has chosen to take up this legislation, which I called for earlier this year.
While this will provide relief to those who could use a helping hand, taking this action underscores the importance of the need to enact pro-growth policies that create an environment where the private sector can create 250,000 new jobs.
