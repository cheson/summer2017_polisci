Governor Scott Walker and Department of Workforce Development (DWD) Secretary Reggie Newson announce today $2.2 Million in Youth Apprenticeship (YA) grant awards to 32 regional consortiums to sustain and expand local, in-demand training opportunities for approximately 2,500 high school students across Wisconsin for the 2015-16 school year.
"As I travel throughout the State of Wisconsin, I consistently hear from employers, especially those in high-demand fields such as manufacturing, that they have jobs, but don't have enough skilled workers to fill their open positions," Governor Walker said. "Investing in the Youth Apprenticeship program is an important step towards ensuring that Wisconsin's workforce continues to grow and develop, and that the youth of today possess the skills necessary to obtain family-supporting jobs in a high-demand field tomorrow."
