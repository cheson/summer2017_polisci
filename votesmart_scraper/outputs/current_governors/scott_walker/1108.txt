Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker released the following statement on the terrorist attacks in Libya and Egypt:
Like most people in this country, I am outraged by the attacks on Americans in Libya and Egypt. The United States is the defender of freedom in the world and it's painful to see radical extremists attempt to intimidate the people of our great country.
Instead, they have once again united us as Americans because when you attack one of us, you attack all of us. We will not back down in our defense of freedom.
