Location: London, United Kingdom

Governor Scott Walker today met with key executives at Genus plc, a global leader in applying biotechnology to advance the science of animal breeding, and the parent company of Genus ABS in DeForest.
"While the main focus of this week's trade mission is to encourage UK-based businesses to consider investing in Wisconsin, we can't overemphasize the importance of companies like Genus that have already done so," Governor Walker said. "Genus has increased its employment in Wisconsin in recent years and today's meeting enabled us to thank the company for its commitment and to see if there are more opportunities for even further investment in our state."
Governor Walker, Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation Secretary and CEO Reed Hall met with Genus Group Finance Director Stephen Wilson and Non-Executive Director Professor Duncan Maskell in London.
"Genus ABS has a long history of being in Wisconsin, and we value the dedicated and skilled employees we have there," Wilson said. "They have been a key to our global success and we continue to invest in growing our presence in the state."
Genus plc is headquartered in Basingstoke, UK, and has its laboratories in Madison. Genus employs more than 2,300 people worldwide and has operations in more than 25 countries.
One of the company's divisions is Genus ABS, which is based in the Dane County community of DeForest and is the largest dairy and beef genetics business in the world. Genus ABS has strong ties to the University of Wisconsin, including the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the Wisconsin School of Business.
