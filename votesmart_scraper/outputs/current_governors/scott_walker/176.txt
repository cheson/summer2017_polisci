Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today issued a letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Director of Civil Works requesting federal assistance for the Village of Mount Pleasant to control severe bluff erosion along the shoreline of Lake Michigan.
"The erosion of shoreline is threatening residential housing and the village's infrastructure," Governor Walker said. "The state is doing everything it can to assist homeowners and local governments. We are asking the U.S. Army Corps for assistance, and we appreciate their attention to this serious issue."
Two village roads, including utilities within the roads, are immediately threatened by bluff failure. Current erosion rates will soon threaten a nearby public street paralleling the affected area. The State of Wisconsin is working closely with Village of Mount Pleasant and Racine County officials on the issue.
Wisconsin Emergency Management held an informational meeting with residents and local officials in Mount Pleasant last Tuesday, June 7, to discuss the bluff erosion. Federal, state, and local officials discussed possible programs available at the meeting and offered steps homeowners could take to help protect their properties.
The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR), at the request of Governor Walker, is working cooperatively with the Department of Administration (DOA) and other state and local entities to support local homeowners with expedited review of emergency stabilization measures for the bluff.
