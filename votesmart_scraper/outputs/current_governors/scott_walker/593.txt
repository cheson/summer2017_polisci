Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Dec. 17, 2014
Location: Washington, DC

Today, Governor Scott Walker traveled across the state to highlight the property tax relief included in his Blueprint for Prosperity and talk about the real savings families, seniors, farmers, and small business owners will see this year on their property tax bills.
"Today, a typical homeowner will have a lower property tax bill in 2014 than they did 2010," Governor Walker said. "By putting more money back into the hands of the hard working taxpayers, they can continue to invest that money into our economy. That is why I'm committed to continued property tax reform so property tax bills in 2018 will be even lower than they are today."
Prior to Governor Walker taking office, property taxes on a median value home had increased 27 percent over a decade. These rates have gone down each of the last four years, providing the typical Wisconsin family over $800 in savings compared to the prior four year trend. Signed in March, Governor Walker's Blueprint for Prosperity has provided homeowners with $406 million in additional property tax relief this year alone.
