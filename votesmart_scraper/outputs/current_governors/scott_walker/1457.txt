Walker Statement on State Employee Contracts
Statement

Location: Madison, WI

In response to recent developments involving state employee contracts, Governor-elect Walker released the following statement:
The State of Wisconsin is facing a $150 million current fiscal year budget shortfall and $3.3 billion long-term structural deficit. There will need to be shared sacrifice to deal with our budget deficit, which is why the first day I take office I will voluntarily begin making the employee portion of my pension contribution.
Due to the delay of these contracts I have all options on the table to tackle Wisconsin's budget challenges. I plan to use the flexibility afforded to me to make the tough choices necessary to reduce state spending while still providing core government services.
