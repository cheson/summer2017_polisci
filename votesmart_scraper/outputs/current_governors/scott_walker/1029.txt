Today, Governor Scott Walker met President Xi Jinping, while he participated in the U.S.-China Governors Forum in Beijing. The Forum comes at the beginning of the Governor's trade mission to China, which is taking place April 13-21.
"I am excited to join Governor Branstad (IA), Governor Calvo (Guam), and Governor McDonnell (VA) in this third forum," Governor Walker said. "These conversations are an important part of working together to promote positive state-to-state relations."
The governors will meet in Beijing for briefings and meetings with the US Embassy before traveling to Tianjin. Discussions will be held on economic and trade opportunities. In addition, the governors are the first elected officials from the United States to meet China's new President, President Xi.
