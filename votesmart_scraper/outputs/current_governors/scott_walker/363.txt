Governor Scott Walker Approves Agency Rule Relating to Entitlement Reform
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Nov. 3, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker approved a rule submitted by the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families (DCF), which is another step forward in implementing drug testing of able-bodied adults seeking certain welfare benefits.
"Our 2015-17 State Budget implements common-sense reforms that put in place drug screening, testing, and treatment mechanisms, so we can continue strengthening Wisconsin's workforce," said Governor Walker. "Employers across the state frequently tell me they have good-paying jobs available in high-demand fields, but need their workers to be drug-free. These important entitlement reforms will help more people find family-supporting jobs, moving them from government dependence to true independence."
