Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: June 1, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today regarding the Notice of Appeal filed by the Department of Justice to continue improvements to Wisconsin Highway 23:
The proposed four-lane expansion project is crucial for families, communities, and businesses throughout the state. The expansion will improve mobility and provide greater access to local businesses and recreational areas, but more importantly, it will significantly improve safety for Wisconsin Highway 23 travelers between Sheboygan and Fond du Lac.
Wisconsin Highway 23 is an important east-west route connecting the cities of Sheboygan and Fond du Lac as well as two major Wisconsin interstate highways, I-41 and I-43.
The proposed expansion project is the result of more than a decade of extensive public input and technical analysis, including traffic forecasts developed as part of the project's Environmental Impact Statement. The forecasting processes used by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are industry-accepted methodologies similar to those used in states throughout the nation.
The improved highway will:
Increase Safety -- changes in roadway design will help reduce a long history of vehicle crashes and highway deaths.
Enhance Economic Development -- the project will enhance safety and make it easier for local and statewide commercial traffic to deliver goods and services and make it more attractive for new or expanding businesses.
Increase Access -- safety and mobility improvements will make it easier for Wisconsin citizens, visitors, and businesses to travel throughout Fond du Lac, Plymouth, Sheboygan, and the surrounding communities.
