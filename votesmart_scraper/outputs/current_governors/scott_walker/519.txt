Governor Scott Walker today issued a proclamation declaring Wednesday, March 25 as "Medal of Honor Day" across the state of Wisconsin. This national celebration recognizes individuals who have received a Congressional Medal of Honor for their sacrifice and service to our nation.
"Today, we keep in our thoughts and prayers the courageous men and women who have served or currently serve our country, putting themselves in harm's way in order to protect our freedom," Governor Walker said. "We specifically keep in mind those who have distinguished themselves by going above and beyond the call of duty and received the prestigious Medal of Honor. Wisconsin is home to 63 recipients of the Medal of Honor, including my friend and fellow Harley rider, Gary Wetzel, and we are incredibly proud of their valor and grateful for their dedicated service to our state and our nation."
Recipients of the Medal of Honor in Wisconsin are honored for their heroic actions each year on March 25 in accordance with 2009 Wisconsin Act 144. This date marks the anniversary of the first Medal of Honor presentation, which took place on March 25, 1863.
