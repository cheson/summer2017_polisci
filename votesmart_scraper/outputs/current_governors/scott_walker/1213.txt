Today Governor Walker delivered the weekly radio address that is titled "For the Next Generation."
Transcript below:
Hi. I'm Scott Walker.
My two sons play football at our local high school. Last season, Matt got a slight concussion. The trainer had him sit out a week and get checked out by a doctor. That was good.
On Monday, I went to Lambeau Field and signed into law a bill that requires student athletes who have a possible concussion playing in school and club sports to be sidelined until they are cleared by a health care professional. We want safe sports for our kids in Wisconsin.
I want to thank the Green Bay Packers and the NFL--as well as many health care organizations for their support of this measure.
We also went to Franklin Elementary School in Wausau where I signed a law that advances many of the reforms in reading and educator effectiveness I worked on with State Superintendent Tony Evers and a diverse group from around the state. Last year, I was at the same school and sat down with the staff to talk about ways to improve education. We listened and incorporated their ideas into our work.
Overall, we are creating a safer state for our kids and a better learning environment for our students.
