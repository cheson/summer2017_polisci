Hi, this is Scott Walker.
This week, I had the honor of joining the Special Olympics athletes in running for the final leg of the 29th Annual Law Enforcement Torch Run, which benefits Special Olympics Wisconsin. It's kind of a tradition for me -- and something I look forward to each and every year.
This relay event is a unique opportunity for law enforcement officers and athletes to run the "Flame of Hope" from throughout the state, eventually meeting in Stevens Point to kick-off the annual Special Olympics Wisconsin State Summer Games.
The passion and dedication these athletes exhibit is incredible, and this year, nearly 1,800 athletes will compete in aquatics, track and field, soccer, and powerlifting events in hopes of qualifying for the Special Olympics World Games, which are held in Los Angeles at the end of July.
The Law Enforcement Torch Run is an event near and dear to my heart. Again this year, I am happy to join law enforcement officers and community leaders in supporting our Special Olympics athletes.
