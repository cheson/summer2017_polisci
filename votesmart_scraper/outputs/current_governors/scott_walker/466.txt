Hi, Scott Walker here.
This week I had the opportunity to join leaders of the French company, Saint-Gobain, as they announced plans to expand their Portage facility -- which will create new jobs here in Wisconsin. This comes on the heels of our European trade mission, where we worked to strengthen our relationships with companies looking to launch or expand business in Wisconsin.
Saint-Gobain, is one of the 100 largest industrial companies in the world -- and it is expanding its medical device manufacturing facility here in Portage. With so many international options, we're thrilled they chose Wisconsin. It's another testament to the state's dedicated workforce and strong business climate.
The $11 million project will be completed during the first half of 2016. Its supported by tax credits from the the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation-- contingent on the number of jobs created and amount of capital investment by the company.
Our relationships with international companies, fueled by trade missions, are key to boosting Wisconsin exports -- which hit a record high last year. Wisconsin businesses exported more than $23 billion in goods worldwide in 2014.
We live in a global economy, and our work to strengthen relationships around the world leads to more good jobs for working families here at home.
