Hello, this is Ray Allen, Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions.
A year ago, Governor Walker signed legislation giving Wisconsin businesses the ability to raise capital through crowdfunding.
One of the biggest challenges for job creators is raising the capital they need to start-up, or expand. Crowdfunding opens the door for many more people to become investors in Wisconsin businesses that will boost our economic growth.
Wisconsin was on the forefront of this innovative way to help businesses grow, and it has paid dividends in the first year. Numerous Wisconsin businesses already have used or are in the process of using crowdfunding to raise funds to expand their businesses and add jobs to the state's economy.
Crowdfunding is a great example of how Governor Walker's efforts to create a business-friendly climate, grow the state's economy, and build a brighter future for all, is working for Wisconsin.
