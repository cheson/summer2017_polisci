Developing Our Workforce: Governor Scott Walker Signs Law to Accelerate Credentialing Exams
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Dec. 19, 2013
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 337 today at Madison Area Technical College in Madison. The bill alters the eligibility requirements for individuals taking credentialing exams while still pursuing a post-secondary degree.
"All economic indicators show our economy is growing, and every day we have more jobs for students to fill," Governor Walker said. "This legislation speeds up the process, and allows students to graduate workforce ready, so that they can begin working in these high demand fields."
Senate Bill 337 is one of eight bills included in the Worker Training initiative announced by Governor Walker in September. These initiatives strive to get students the training they need to close the skills gap in Wisconsin and succeed in the today's growing economy. This legislation allows students to pass examinations while completing their postsecondary degree program, enabling them to join the workforce faster upon graduating.
Governor Walker thanked Senator Frank Lasee (R-De Pere) and Representative Dale Kooyenga (R-Brookfield) for their work on this bipartisan bill. Senate Bill 337 is Wisconsin Act 114.
