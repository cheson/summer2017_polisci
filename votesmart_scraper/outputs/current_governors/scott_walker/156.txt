Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: June 24, 2016
Location: Green Bay, WI

Governor Scott Walker delivered a keynote address today at the opening ceremony of the 88th annual Wisconsin State Fire Chiefs' Association Conference. The conference brings around 400 fire chiefs throughout Wisconsin together for a weekend of speakers and workshops.
"When a fire breaks out, Wisconsin's firefighters do not hesitate to respond and protect the property and lives of our citizens," Governor Walker said. "This conference allows our firefighters to collaborate and learn about newer, safer ways to prevent and put out fires."
The Wisconsin State Fire Chiefs Association (WSFCA) is comprised of more than 1,100 active and retired volunteer, combination, and career Chief Fire Officers. The association works to serve its members by providing leadership, education, advocacy, and networking.
"Wisconsin firefighters put their lives on the line every day and we recognize them for their service to our state and commemorate those who lost their lives in the line of duty," Governor Walker added.
The annual WSFCA conference provides a forum for members to discuss problems, provide educational opportunities, seek counsel from experts in equipment, build engineering, chemical, and research fields interested in fire prevention, and cooperate with government agencies with the goal of better serving their individual communities. The conference also includes a memorial ceremony in honor of the chiefs and firefighters who passed away in the last year.
