Governor Scott Walker joined Wisconsin Department of Tourism Secretary Stephanie Klett and University of Wisconsin-Madison Men's Basketball Coach Bo Ryan today in the grand opening ceremony of the "Travel Wisconsin Supper Club" concession stand at the Kohl Center in Madison. Located outside of Section 112 at Gate C, the remodeled concession stand perfectly captures the ambiance and menu of a traditional Wisconsin supper club.
"The "Travel Wisconsin Supper Club' concession stand not only features the winning combination of supper clubs and sports, it also puts Wisconsin Tourism front and center," Governor Walker said. "The economic impact tourism has on our state is significant, and since 2010, tourism activity has grown by 25 percent, an increase of nearly $3.7 billion. Highlighting our tourism brand at this newly-remodeled concession stand in the Kohl Center will have a huge impact as we work to attract more visitors to Wisconsin's numerous family-friendly tourist destinations."
