Governor Scott Walker issued the following statement on the Department of Workforce Development's release of April job creation numbers:
"Nearly 25,000 Wisconsinites are back to work since we declared Wisconsin open for business in January with 11,500 of those jobs in manufacturing," Governor Walker said. "Because of the hard work done so far to improve Wisconsin's business climate, employers are willing to grow and invest in Wisconsin. That is good for middle class working families and it is good for Wisconsin. We are on our way to 250,000 jobs by 2015, but there is more work to be done in order to meet and surpass that goal."
This positive economic news came soon after a recent nationwide survey of CEOs taken by Chief Executive that shows Wisconsin's business climate improving 17 places among the 50 states to #24 from #41. According to the publication, that is the single best improvement for any state in the history of the survey.
