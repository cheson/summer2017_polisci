Today Governor Walker issued the following statement on Congress's approval of the St. Croix River Project.
"I commend the U.S. House of Representatives for voting in favor of the St. Croix River Project today. After decades of work, this bill is now going to the president's desk. This legislation was a top federal priority for my administration and is a great example of bipartisanship teamwork that will create thousands of jobs. The construction of this safer, better bridge will bring a welcome economic boost to the region. I thank Congressmen Sean Duffy and Ron Kind, as well as Senators Ron Johnson and Herb Kohl, along with the many others who worked on this legislation in Wisconsin and Minnesota including Governor Mark Dayton, for their diligence and persistence in bringing this legislation across the finish line."
