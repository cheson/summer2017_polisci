By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker delivered remarks today at the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce (WMC) Future Wisconsin Economic Summit, which was held at Monona Terrace Community Convention Center in Madison. This second annual summit focuses on the future of Wisconsin and discusses what the state's economy will look like in 20 years.
"The Future Wisconsin Economic Summit is an excellent reminder that growing Wisconsin's economy is best accomplished by thinking long-term," Governor Walker said. "We've accomplished a great deal for our state since taking office -- our unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since 2001, property taxes are lower, and our fiscal house is in order. Today's summit is an opportunity to have a conversation and brainstorm ways we can continue to move Wisconsin forward together in the years to come."
