Earlier this year long-term, structural changes were made to fill in Wisconsin's $3.6 billion budget deficit and help local units of governments balance their budget without increasing taxes.
Simple changes have saved taxpayers millions, such as allowing local units of government and school districts to take competitive bids for public employee health insurance plans and reforming overtime rules.
I created a website (www.reforms.wi.gov) to track examples of the savings realized from these reforms. This website has video testimonials from local government officials talking about balancing their budgets, a breakdown of the savings in each county and a categorization of how these savings were achieved.
Reforms.wi.gov goes beyond simply listing the savings from having public employee's to pay a little bit more toward their pension and toward their health insurance premiums (which is still well below what federal government employees pay and well below the average Wisconsin citizen). This website also shares examples of how the reforms have actually improved government services.
