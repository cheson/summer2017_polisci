Hi, this is Scott Walker.
We have some more good news for Wisconsin workers. This week I signed a Special Session Assembly Bill, increasing funding for the Wisconsin Fast Forward program by $35.4 million. Job creators across the state tell me they have jobs available -- what they need are skilled workers to fill them.
With this latest investment, we will work to eliminate technical college waiting lists for high demand fields -- including advanced manufacturing, agriculture, and Information Technology.
We'll also help high school students get training in high demand jobs through dual enrollment programs between our high schools and technical colleges. And we'll invest in programs that help people with disabilities enter the workforce. All of this is in addition to the more than $100 million investment in worker training we included in the last state budget.
According to the federal government's Bureau of Labor Statistics report on Monday, as of this January, Wisconsin ranks fifth in the nation in new manufacturing jobs, year over year.
Wisconsin is going back to work -- and we'll keep our upward trend going, by improving the business climate and investing in the motivated, dependable workforce we are known for.
I want to thank members of the state Legislature for working together across party lines to pass this $35.4 million investment for Wisconsin's workers.
