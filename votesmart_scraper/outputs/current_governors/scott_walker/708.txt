Governor Scott Walker Requests SBA Disaster Declaration
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 9, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker has requested the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) declare Grant County a disaster area due to storm and tornado damage from last month. An SBA declaration would provide low interest loans to businesses and individuals affected by the storms. This request also includes counties contiguous to Grant (Crawford, Iowa, Lafayette, and Richland counties).
"June was a difficult month for many property owners in Wisconsin. Touring the damage was a first step, and now, we are moving forward to pursue an SBA disaster declaration." Governor Walker said. "This would provide some assistance to people who need access to resources, so they can begin much-needed repairs."
A series of severe storms moved through Wisconsin beginning on June 16, 2014. These storms included flash flooding and six tornadoes hitting Dane, Grant, and Green counties. Officials with the SBA conducted an initial damage assessment and reported more than 25 homes and businesses sustained significant damage and uninsured losses in excess of 40 percent in Grant County. Based on that assessment, SBA determined that Grant County had met its criteria to request a declaration.
Damages to homes and businesses did not meet requirements for a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) major disaster declaration.
