Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 13, 2014
Location: Menomonee Falls, WI

Governor Scott Walker addressed attendees of the Leadership Menomonee Falls and Leadership Germantown today at their annual luncheon. The event is part of a professional development program offered to members of the Menomonee Falls and Germantown Chambers of Commerce.
"The strength of our economy is rooted in our local communities, and we will continue to work with each region, town, and village in the state to ensure the growth of their local economies," Governor Walker said. "Our Blueprint for Prosperity provides much needed tax relief while also investing in the future workforce of Wisconsin. Together, we will continue moving Wisconsin's economy forward."
Leadership Menomonee Falls has offered these training programs for members since 1990; development sessions focus on public speaking, networking, team building, social styles, strategic planning, conflict resolution, and business ethics. Leadership Germantown also offers monthly leadership sessions which typically feature panel discussions with corporate executives, elected officials, subject matter experts, and village or community leaders.
Governor Walker's Blueprint for Prosperity passed the State Senate on March 4th and now goes before the State Assembly, which passed a previous version of the proposed tax cuts in early February.
