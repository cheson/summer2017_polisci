ICYMI: Wisconsin Ranked 12th Best State for Business by Chief Executive Magazine
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 7, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Chief Executive Magazine today ranked Wisconsin the "12th Best State for Business" in its annual survey of CEOs, an increase of two spots over the 2014 ranking, and a significant increase since 2010, when the state ranked 41st.
"Our continuous improvement in this ranking is another indicator that job creators around the country are becoming more aware of what Wisconsin has to offer businesses of all sizes and all industries," said Governor Scott Walker. "The pro-business policies we have implemented over the last four years to help companies succeed in Wisconsin are paying off in terms of business growth and job creation -- and that message is resonating beyond our borders."
The article in the May/June magazine singled out Wisconsin as being one of four states that have "dramatically transformed themselves over the last six years in the eyes of CEOs."
