Governor Walker Encourages GAAP Deficit Solution
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Feb. 3, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker thanked legislators for proposing a solution to Wisconsin's GAAP deficit, also known as generally accepted accounting principles. The federal government requires all local governments and publically traded companies to follow GAAP. The Wisconsin Constitution currently requires that the state budget be calculated using what is known as a cash basis accounting system. Governor Walker pledged to support moving to GAAP while campaigning for Governor in 2010.
"Working toward using the same accounting system used by local governments and businesses all across Wisconsin when evaluating our state budget will continue our efforts to protect our children and grandchildren," said Governor Walker. "I congratulate State Rep. Kooyenga, Rep. Kapenga, Rep. Marklein, Rep. Klenke, Rep. Strachota, State Senator Zipperer, and Sen. Lasee and encourage the Legislature to tackle this issue. Honest budgets are not built on the use of one time raids for ongoing operating expenses, increased taxes, delayed payments, or segregated fund raids. We must show the next generation that we are committed to honest budgeting that does not pass debt off to our children and grandchildren."
