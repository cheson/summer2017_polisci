Governor Walker Statement on Flexible Degree Option Programs
Statement
By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Earlier this year, Governor Walker, University of Wisconsin System President Kevin P. Reilly, and UW Colleges and UW-Extension Chancellor Ray Cross announced a competency-based degree model that will transform higher education in Wisconsin. Today, the first UW Flexible Degree option programs were rolled out.
Governor Walker released the following statement regarding the new flexible degrees:
Using a competency-based degree model coupled with online testing has the potential to revolutionize higher education. Today's announcement is the next step in that direction.
There is a need for skilled workers in a number of high demand areas such as manufacturing, information technologies, and healthcare. We can help bridge the skills gap by allowing individuals who have learned skills from their employment, from military service, or from other areas to work toward a degree at their own pace.
I would like to especially thank President Kevin Reilly and Chancellor Ray Cross for the work they have done, and will continue to do, to support new methods of learning through programs like this.
I look forward to the continued development of additional UW Flexible Degree option programs.
