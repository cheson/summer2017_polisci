Dear Legislative leaders,
I am writing to respectfully ask you to not convene an extraordinary or special session of the Wisconsin Legislature to approve yet-to-be-disclosed public employee union contracts. In light of the State of Wisconsin's current fiscal year $150 million budget shortfall and impending $3.3 billion structural deficit, returning and newly elected officials are going to need maximum flexibility to craft and work through our current and next state budget.
I've met with both Democrats and Republicans since becoming the Governor-elect and delivered a clear message: Let's work together to balance our budget and put Wisconsinites back to work. Bringing the Legislature into an extraordinary or special session with the sole purpose of finalizing public employee union contracts prior to my inauguration will likely lead to a need for more aggressive spending cuts.
Please delay action on these contracts os we can fully evaluate their effect on our next state budget.
Thank you for your consideration of this request and for understanding that my sole motivation for sending this letter is to ensure that we have the flexibility needed to balance our next state budget.
Sincerely,
Governor-elect Scott Walker
