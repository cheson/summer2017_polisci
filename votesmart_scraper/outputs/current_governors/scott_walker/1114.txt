Today, the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) released figures for Wisconsin's exports through the first half of 2012.
In response to these figures, Governor Walker released the following statement:
The production of Wisconsin's economy is strong, which is exhibited through the growth of exports. This data is encouraging and signals products made by Wisconsin's private sector economy are valued all across the world.
While we work to overcome an underperforming national economy, these figures are good news for the residents of our state.
Unlike the failed economic policies being currently pursued at the federal level, we will continue to foster a pro-growth environment in Wisconsin to get government out of the way, so private sector employers can create jobs.
According to DACTP, in the first half of 2012, Wisconsin exported $1.5 billion worth of agricultural products to over 132 countries; an increase of 5% over first six months of 2011. Overall, US exports of agricultural products totaled $77 billion, a decrease of 4% over the first half of 2011.
According to WEDC, Wisconsin's total exports grew by 7.9 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 2011, with increases in exports of industrial machinery, agricultural products, vehicles, and medical and scientific instruments. Wisconsin exports totaled $11.6 billion in the first quarter of 2012. Industrial machinery exports, the top product Wisconsin exports, increased 13 percent, driven heavily by exports of parts for ship derricks, mobile lifting cranes and trucks with cranes.
