Governor Scott Walker today issued the following statement on the Assembly and Senate's passage of the Relocation Tax Credit with bipartisan support.
"The relocation tax credit will help us attract new businesses to Wisconsin that will create jobs and improve our economy," said Governor Scott Walker. "As we make our case to businesses around the globe that we are transforming Wisconsin into a job-friendly state, this tax credit will offer an immediate incentive to relocate to our state. The work of Representatives Joe Knilans and Al Ott and Senators Van Wanggaard and Terry Moulton has helped open Wisconsin for business."
The legislation will exempt businesses from income and franchise taxes for two years for businesses that have not done business in Wisconsin for two years or more.
