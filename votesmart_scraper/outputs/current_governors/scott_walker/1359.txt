BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
MORGAN: Scott Walker took office as governor of Wisconsin in January of this year. He's lost no time making a splash. His budget showdown with union workers after just five weeks in office led to headlines across the country, not all of them entirely favorable.
Governor Walker, welcome. So you don't believe in doing things by half, do you? You get in to power as the new governor. Were you, even though you knew it would be provocative, taken aback by the scale of protests that came your way?
GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R), WISCONSIN: Absolutely, and by the national attention. I knew -- for eight years before I was the governor. I was a county executive in a county that has never elected a Republican before. We pushed the status quo there.
But I had no idea the kind of national attention, the national focus, the national money that came in early on. That's probably more than anything the part that surprised me.
MORGAN: Knowing what you know now, would you have played things differently?
WALKER: Yes. I think in January and February, in particular, I would have spent more time building the case for specifically what we were going to do. I talked about it in the campaign. Heck, I talked about it for eight years when I was a county official, about the need to change things, to make sure we could avoid layoffs.
In the end, I had no idea. In about a month's time, that first month, they brought -- dropped four or five million dollars worth of TV ads, not on a candidate but specifically against me and against this issue. I would have better prepared for that had I 20/20 vision.
