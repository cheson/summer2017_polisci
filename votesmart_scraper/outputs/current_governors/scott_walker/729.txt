Today, Governor Scott Walker ran in the 28th Annual Law Enforcement Torch Run, which benefits Special Olympics Wisconsin.
"This event is very close to my heart, and a great collaboration among Wisconsin law enforcement officers, and community members in support of our Special Olympics athletes," said Governor Walker. "It's a great way to show our dedication while kicking off the Wisconsin Summer Games."
The Law Enforcement Torch RunÂ® is a relay event in which participants and athletes run the Flame of Hope from more than 30 different kick-off points each year, to converge in Stevens Point for the annual Special Olympics Wisconsin State Summer Games Opening Ceremony on June 5 and competitions on June 6-7. Law enforcement and corrections officers, fire department members, and military groups, along with their families, are invited to take part. Since it started in 1986, Wisconsin's Torch Run has raised more than $22 million for Special Olympics.
Nearly 2,000 athletes will compete in the Wisconsin State Summer Games in aquatics, athletics, soccer, and powerlifting in Stevens Point. Sixty-two Team Wisconsin athletes will compete at the Special Olympics USA Games in New Jersey during the week of June 14-21.
Special Olympics Wisconsin promotes the overall well-being of children and adults with intellectual disabilities, and provides year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports, offering participants opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy, and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills, and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes, and the community.
