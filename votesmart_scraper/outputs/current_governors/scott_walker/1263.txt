Statement

Location: Madison, WI

Yesterday the State Senate passed AB 450 also known as Wisconsin Wins legislation, which allows Wisconsinites receiving unemployment benefits to take part-time training jobs with employers potentially looking for full-time employment. This program will allow current job seekers to receive training and demonstrate their skills for potential employers. Wisconsin Wins is part of the Governor's Wisconsin Working package.
"Reforming unemployment benefits will ultimately improve the economic climate in Wisconsin," said Governor Walker. "Allowing unemployment recipients to gain useful job training without losing benefits will help those seeking work gain meaningful experience. State Representative Mark Honadel and Senator Van Wanggaard did a fantastic job authoring and providing leadership on this important bill."
