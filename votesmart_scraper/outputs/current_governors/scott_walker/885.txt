Press Release
By: Scott Walker

Location: Racine, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 333 into law today, which is one of eight bills included in the Worker Training initiative. The legislation allows the Department of Children and Families to establish a Transitional Jobs Program to assist employment services in cities or counties with high unemployment and child poverty rates.
"This legislation is a great step in the development of Wisconsin's workforce," Governor Walker said. "This allows us to provide workers with the necessary training they need to succeed and help employers hire workers that want to contribute, putting both employers and employees at a great advantage."
The bill enables an expansion of the Transform Milwaukee Jobs Program that provides job access to low-income parents and young adults. This measure provides immediate income, work opportunities, and placements for qualified individuals. It also offers the ability to gain skilled training for those without previous experience in long-term employment.
The Department of Children and Families will reallocate existing agency funds to subsidize the program. The number of communities served will depend on available funding.
Governor Walker thanked Senator Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) and Representative Thomas Weatherston (R-Racine) for authoring this bill. Senate Bill 333 passed the Assembly with a vote of 92-3 and the Senate on a voice vote. The bill is Act 113.
Earlier today Governor Walker signed Senate Bill 336. That bill is Act 112.
