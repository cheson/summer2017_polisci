Governor Scott Walker announced details of the third annual Governor's Small Business Summit today. This year's summit will be held on Wednesday, September 25, at the Stevens Point Convention Center. The annual event will include panel discussions with cabinet secretaries and speakers discussing issues like employing people with disabilities and exporting products across the country and around the world.
"The third annual Small Business Summit is coming to Stevens Point," Governor Walker said. "Fostering relationships with small businesses and listening to their ideas is how we have come this far. We're hosting the summit again this year in order to hear from more small businesses and dive into issues like increasing exports and hiring people with disabilities. Our economy is growing and we are continuing to move Wisconsin forward."
"This summit will provide another great opportunity for small businesses to learn about how state government can assist in fostering growth," Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch said.
The Governor's Small Business Summit is held annually as a forum for discussion on how to continue growing the economy and further job creation in Wisconsin.
