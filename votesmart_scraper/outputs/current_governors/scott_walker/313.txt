Press Release

Location: Appleton, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Assembly Bill 373 into law today at Manpower, an employment agency in Appleton. The bill revises certain aspects of the civil service laws for classified employees for the hiring process, probationary periods, merit compensation, awards, and disciplinary actions. These reforms will help state agencies to address issues they experience as they work to quickly hire or identify the best person for the job, retain and reward top employees, or try to discipline the few bad actors who are taking advantage of the system.
"The legislation we are signing here today implements common-sense reforms to our recruitment and retention processes to get the best and brightest in the door and keep them there," Governor Walker said. "This bill also provides state agencies with clear direction to create uniform disciplinary practices to address the few bad actors who abuse the system. We're creating a government that works for you, the people of Wisconsin, and these civil service reforms provide a more effective, efficient, and streamlined hiring process to ensure state government operates at a good value for our citizens."
Assembly Bill 373 -- Governor Walker signed Assembly Bill 373 with a partial veto to Section 94. The bill, as amended, makes the following changes to current law:
Requires a selection process and an open competitive process for vacancies rather than the explicit examination process that is required under current law;
Provides $6 million for merit-pay bonuses for top-performing state employees to ensure the most talented and dedicated state employees continue working for the state;
Requires certification and appointment be made in 30 days for each step in the hiring process;
Requires that after the certification list for a civil service position is finalized, Veteran's Preference System requirements must be followed;
Requires that performance reviews be made at least annually;
Changes the determination for the order of layoffs which must be primarily based on performance, and then based on disciplinary records, seniority, and ability;
Requires a one-year probationary period, which may be extended an additional 12 months if needed for all employees;
Provides that the Division of Personnel Management (DPM) must establish a general standard for progressive discipline plans, which will be adopted and utilized by each agency;
Specifies the procedure, including timelines, for an employee to contest an adverse employment decision;
Removes the ability under current law for the State Compensation Plan to supersede provisions in statutes and administrative rules relating to pay, benefits, and working conditions;
Requires the Department of Administration (DOA) to consult with each agency to develop a plan for assuming the human resources functions for all state agencies except for the Board of Regents and Technical College Systems Board;
Requires DPM and the Bureau of Merit Recruitment and Selection to review other critical aspects of the civil service (or human resources) functions including the current classification system, the State Compensation Plan, and the feasibility of requiring state agencies to use electronic personnel files and a uniform personnel evaluation system.
