Governor Scott Walker joined local business leaders and representatives today at Marketplace 2014, the Governor's annual Conference on Minority Business Development. Organized by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), the conference features a business expo, trade show floor, capacity building seminars, and networking options.
"This is an excellent opportunity for small, minority, women, and veteran-owned firms to network," Governor Walker said. "This event offers these business leaders a chance to meet individually with buyers and state agencies, and identify resources for funding. This conference builds on Wisconsin's pro-business climate, enhancing the perfect environment to expand your business and establish new connections in the state."
Approximately 600 attendees are participating in the 2014 Marketplace Conference, which features a new addition this year, the Small Business Academy. The Small Business Academy is a free seminar which focuses on minority entrepreneurs and ways in which they can improve their business startups and get in contact with services and providers that can help them attain their visions and goals.
The Marketplace Conference concludes with the Marketplace Governor's Award Luncheon, in which the winners of the Governor's Minority Business Awards are announced in three categories: Minority Businesses, Women Businesses, and Service-Disabled Veteran Businesses. In these categories, outstanding large businesses, outstanding small businesses and rising stars will be recognized.
