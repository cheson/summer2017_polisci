Date: March 10, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker announced the Green Bay Packers and Edvest are sponsoring the "Big Apple Giveaway" sweepstakes. One lucky student and their family will win a $10,529 Edvest college savings account and a trip to New Your City to announce the Green Bay Packers fourth-round draft choice.
"I am excited to see the State and the Green Bay Packers partnering together to raise awareness about the importance of saving for college," Governor Walker said. "It just takes $25 to start an Edvest college savings account, but it begins an invaluable investment in your child's future."
Starting today, parents, grandparents, or the legal guardian can enter their child or grandchild into the contest. Children must be between the ages 8-14 years, and there is only one entry per child. The grand prize is a $10,529 Edvest college savings account and a trip for four to attend the 2014 NFL draft at Radio City Music Hall. The winning student will get to announce the Green Bay Packers fourth-round draft choice.
Wisconsin schools can also enter to win a $5,529 cash contribution for teaching resources by registering online.
All contest entries must be received by April 4, 2014, and the winner will be selected randomly. No Wisconsin tax funds are used for the prizes or other costs of this promotion. The costs of operating the Edvest plan, including promotions, are self-supported through participant and other fees.
