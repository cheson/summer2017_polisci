This week, the federal government verified the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) for the first quarter of 2012. It showed Wisconsin created more than 37,000 private sector jobs from March 2011 to March 2012, including a gain of 12,138 jobs in the manufacturing sector.
Unlike other states, Wisconsin faced economic and political uncertainty over the last year, and our continued private sector job growth is good news. I am particularly pleased with the gains in the manufacturing sector, which make up a huge portion of our state's economy.
The quarterly job count data shows, yet again, the monthly job estimates are not accurate. I am hopeful the state Department of Workforce Development will be able to work with the federal government to bring the monthly estimates back in line with the actual job numbers.
The fiscal reforms we put in place, coupled with reforms like reducing frivolous lawsuits and bringing certainty and accountability to state regulations, established a strong foundation for job growth.
Moving forward, we will continue to find ways to make it easier for the people of our state to put Wisconsinites back to work.
Below are a few highlights of the QCEW data published by the federal government:
Wisconsin added a total of 28,133 jobs from March 2011 to March 2012, including a gain of 37,497 private sector jobs and a decline of 9,364 government jobs.
Wisconsin manufacturers created 12,138 jobs year over year, leading all other sectors in net job growth.
The state added 7,459 jobs in the professional and business services sector, which experienced the second-highest area of growth.
