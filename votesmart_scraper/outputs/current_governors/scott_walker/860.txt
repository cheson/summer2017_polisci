Joining Governor Scott Walker this evening for the 2014 State of the State were students excited about the tuition freeze at the University of Wisconsin System.
"For too long students and parents of University of Wisconsin students have been saddled with tuition increases, averaging five and half percent each year," Governor Walker said. "Now for the first time in the history of the UW System, we have enacted a two-year tuition freeze. This freeze goes a long way toward make college more affordable for students and their families."
Anastasia McCain, UW-Green Bay, is a full-time student who works three jobs to cover the costs of her textbooks, supplies, and housing. Anastasia noted the tuition freeze is a huge help for her parents who are working to send three kids to college, while also helping her save for law school.
Stephanie Johnson and Hannah Bresson, UW-La Crosse, joined McCain also attended the speech. Governor Walker met the students at their school when he announced the tuition freeze last year.
Bresson is paying her own way through college. She mentioned she is excited about the prospect of being able to save for her future and appreciates the high-quality, and now, more affordable education she is receiving.
Johnson, and each of her siblings, has hopes for higher education. Their parents were unable to assist in paying for college, and this tuition freeze is making college a reality for her. Johnson said she is thankful for the opportunities, which come with attending college, including the lesson that hard work does indeed pay off.
