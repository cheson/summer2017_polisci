Governor Scott Walker today released the following statement after the Senate's concurrence of Special Session Assembly Bill 1, which addresses the failed federal rollout of the Affordable Care Act:
It is irresponsible to force some Wisconsinites to pay the price for the federal government's failure. I am pleased the Senate and Assembly passed this legislation, which will give our fellow Wisconsinites additional time to make a logical transition. In 2014, everyone living in poverty will be covered--for the first time--under Medicaid in Wisconsin. No more waiting lists, and no more enrollment caps. Wisconsin's unique solution to health care will ensure everyone in our state has access to health care. I look forward to signing this bill into law tomorrow.
