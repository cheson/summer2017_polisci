Governor Scott Walker today made a stop at the AMSOIL World Championship Snowmobile Derby in Eagle River, the "Snowmobile Capital of the World."
"Wisconsin is a top destination for snowmobiling, a vital part of the state's tourism industry," Governor Walker said. "The AMSOIL World Championship Snowmobile Derby is the world's premiere snowmobile racing event, and a great draw for northern Wisconsin in the winter, attracting drivers and spectators from all over the U.S. and Canada."
With oval, snocross, and vintage racing, the AMSOIL World Championship Snowmobile Derby attracts amateur and professional drivers, as well as more than 40,000 spectators annually. The derby began in 1964 as a small winter festival to bring awareness to tourism in northern Wisconsin. That first year 100 racers participated, the derby now boasts more than 1,000 participants.
The 52nd AMSOIL World Snowmobile Championship began Thursday, January 15, and concludes with the championship race Sunday, January 18.
