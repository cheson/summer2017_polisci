Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker will join Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Production (DATCP) Secretary Ben Brancel this evening at the grand opening of the 2016 CIGAL Dairy Trade Show held in Jalisco, Mexico, Wisconsin's sister state since 1990.
Mexico is Wisconsin's second-largest export destination with the state's exports to Mexico totaling nearly $3 billion in 2015, over $290 million for agricultural products.
The CIGAL (Conferencia Internacional sobre Ganado Lechero or International Conference on Dairy Cattle) trade show and the trade mission are giving Wisconsin companies an opportunity to learn more about market potential in Mexico, connect directly with producers and importers, and set up opportunities for long-term business partnerships. Other goals of the mission are to establish and reinforce connections with Mexican officials and increase awareness of Wisconsin industry and commerce, including agriculture.
"This is a great opportunity to showcase all of what Wisconsin has to offer as it relates to the dairy industry," said Governor Walker. "Our state is strong, and this is a perfect time to strengthen our ties to the dairy producers in Jalisco."
A Wisconsin pavilion features booths and displays specially designed by DATCP and was set up at the trade show held at the largest convention center in Mexico.
"It is a distinct honor to offer welcoming remarks at the CIGAL grand opening ceremony at this very important international trade show," Governor Walker added. "I am proud to see Wisconsin companies receive recognition and attention for being industry leaders in dairy production, and all the other important businesses that support it from dairy farmers to cheese companies."
