This morning Governor Walker signed Senate Bill (SB) 2 into law, which extends the open enrollment period. SB 2 applies to the upcoming school session--the new period for open enrollment will run from February 6th to the end of April.
"Open enrollment empowers parents with additional educational opportunities for students," said Governor Walker. "I am glad we were able to put this legislation in place prior to the spring session. State Senator Olsen and Representative Jacque have done a great job leading this bill through the Legislature."
