A Safer Wisconsin: Governor Scott Walker Signs Legislation to Protect Victims of Domestic Violence
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 16, 2014
Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed three bills in law today, strengthening laws against domestic violence and adding protections for domestic abuse victims. Assembly Bill 464, Assembly Bill 176, and Senate Bill 160 were all signed in Milwaukee at Zimmerman Architectural Studios, the firm designing the new Family Justice Center building. Survivors of domestic violence and family members of victims joined Governor Walker at the bill signing.
"Every year in Wisconsin, thousands of people, mostly women, seek help from law enforcement and the legal system, because they believe someone they have a relationship with, may harm them," Governor Walker said. "These laws empower the system that serves them, so we can do better in protecting the victims, and potential victims, of domestic abuse and connect them with crucial services, when they need our help the most."
