Statement on Joint Finance Committee Approval of Medicaid Proposal
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: June 4, 2013
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker issued the following statement today following the Joint Finance Committee's approval of his Medicaid proposal:
"Under our plan, everyone in Wisconsin will have access to affordable health care options, and we are building upon Wisconsin's strong track record of providing affordable health care to our people. These reforms strengthen Wisconsin's safety net for those in need, while protecting our taxpayers from unnecessary risk and the fiscal uncertainty coming out of Washington, D.C.
"I thank the members of the Joint Finance Committee for approving this important reform that is based on providing the best outcome for our citizens, not on obtaining short-term financial assistance for Wisconsin."
