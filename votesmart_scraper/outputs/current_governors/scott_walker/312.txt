Governor Scott Walker issued the following statement today regarding the passing of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia:
"Justice Scalia was a patriot and a hero of American legal jurisprudence. A lion of the justice system, he stood for the letter of the law and did not allow politics of the day to sway his dedication to the constitutional role of the judiciary. Justice Scalia served our country with honor and distinction. Tonette and I join with the nation in mourning his loss, and we send our thoughts and prayers to his family."
In honor of Justice Scalia, Governor Walker issued an executive order to lower the flags of the United States and of the State of Wisconsin on Saturday, February 13 through the date of his interment. A copy of the Governor's Executive Order is attached.
