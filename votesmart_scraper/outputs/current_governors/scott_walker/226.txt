Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today wishing Wisconsin mothers a Happy Mother's Day:
Mother's Day is a special day of the year where we honor the moms across the state who work to give their children every opportunity to pursue their dreams. Their selflessness and unconditional love help shape our youth and our communities -- making Wisconsin a great place to live and raise a family. I'm grateful to have a mother who helped me believe I could do anything if I worked hard enough. I'm lucky to be married to Tonette, who instills this belief in our sons, Matt and Alex. Today, and every day, we celebrate the women of Wisconsin and wish them a very Happy Mother's Day.
