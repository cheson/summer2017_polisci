Hi, Scott Walker here.
Tonight, we're going to party like it's 1999.
That's more than just the lyrics to a classic song. It's a solid reminder that the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is now the lowest it's been since October of 1999. That's the second lowest unemployment rate ever.
The only time that the unemployment rate in Wisconsin was lower than it is now was in May, June, and July of 1999.
Think about that. Bill Clinton was President back then and Episode I of Star Wars had just come out. My sons Matt and Alex were 5 and 4 years old back then. Soon, they'll be 23 and 22 years old.
Overall, the current unemployment rate is less than half of what it was when I started as your Governor and nearly one-third of what it was at the beginning of 2010. Wisconsin is working.
In fact, more people are employed in Wisconsin than ever before.
And the percentage of people who are employed in our state? Well, it's one of the best in the nation.
We are a top ten state for employment. We're also a top ten state for employing people with disabilities, for ACT scores, for high school graduation rates, for health care systems, for access to health care coverage and for many other areas. In fact, Wisconsin, which was once in the bottom ten for business, now ranks in the top ten states in the nation for business.
Our common-sense, conservative reforms are working. And more people are working in Wisconsin than ever before.
