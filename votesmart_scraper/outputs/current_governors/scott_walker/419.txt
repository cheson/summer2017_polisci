Executive Director Dennis Reilly highlighted the activity included in WHEFA's 2015 Fiscal Year in Review and said, "This fiscal year will mark the end of one of the busiest years in WHEFA's 36-year history. WHEFA is proud to have been able to assist so many of Wisconsin's nonprofit organizations over this past year, allowing them to grow and compete by providing access to low cost capital.
