Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Jan. 22, 2015
Location: De Pere/Mosinee, WI

Governor Scott Walker today is making stops at Wel Companies in De Pere, and Sulzer Machine & Manufacturing, Inc. in Mosinee, to talk about the investments in workforce readiness included in the 2015-17 State Budget proposal.
"We know employers in Wisconsin have jobs available, but they don't have enough qualified employees to fill those positions," Governor Walker said. "With this budget, we are addressing some of the barriers keeping people from achieving true freedom and prosperity and the independence that comes with having a good job and doing it well."
