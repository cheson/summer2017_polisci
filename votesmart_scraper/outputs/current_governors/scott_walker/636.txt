Location: Milwaukee, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker participated in the second annual Wisconsin Cyber Security Summit. The summit brings together national and international cyber security experts to discuss and provide guidance on how states, businesses and individuals can better protect against cyber-attacks.
"The State of Wisconsin takes cyber security very seriously," said Governor Walker. "We continually work to improve upon and strengthen our cyber security systems and proactively guard against ever-changing attacks. Cyber security is everyone's responsibility and this summit is an important opportunity to identify top priorities for agencies and businesses to ensure they are well protected and prepared for any and all cyber-attacks."
Wisconsin has been a leader of incorporating cyber security into emergency planning. Governor Walker recently expanded the role of Major General Don Dunbar, who is Wisconsin's Homeland Security Advisor, to include serving as the senior state official for cyber security matters. Major General Dunbar is leading a team with representatives from several state agencies to focus Wisconsin's cyber security program on deterring threats through common sense steps, establishing a solid line of defense, and treating cyber-attacks through collaboration by all State partners. The second annual Wisconsin Cyber Security Summit features speakers from the National Campaign for Cyber Hygiene.
Governor Walker declared October as Cyber Awareness Month.
