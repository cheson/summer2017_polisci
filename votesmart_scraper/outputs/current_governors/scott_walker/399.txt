Governor Scott Walker today released the following statement regarding recruitment and retention reform legislation to be introduced by Senator Roger Roth and Representative Jim Steineke:
"Wisconsin needs to be able to compete for the best and the brightest employees in today's modern workforce. This legislation will implement common-sense reforms to our recruiting process to get the best in the door and will give state agencies the tools to retain their great employees, as well as to address the bad actors who abuse the system.
"Through these reforms, we will be able to ensure state government is providing the highest quality services to our citizens. I appreciate the hard work of Senator Roth and Representative Steineke in developing these thoughtful recruiting and retention reforms."
