Working for Wisconsin: Governor Scott Walker Tours Green-Tek, Inc. and Coextruded Plastics Technologies, Inc.
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Oct. 8, 2015
Location: Janesville, WI

Governor Scott Walker toured Green-Tek, Inc. and their sister company, Coextruded Plastics Technologies, Inc., today as a part of his Working for Wisconsin tour, which highlights programs and initiatives throughout the state that are working for the people of Wisconsin. Governor Walker's visit to Green-Tek and Coextruded Plastics Technologies focuses on efforts to equip job seekers with the skills they need to fill open positions.
"Thanks to our tough, but prudent reforms, Wisconsin is back on the road to prosperity," Governor Walker said. "Our economy and our workforce are stronger -- but there is still work to be done. One of our focuses is bridging the skills gap here in Wisconsin. I often hear from employers and manufacturers like the two companies I visited today that with the improved economy, they have positions available, but cannot find skilled workers to fill them. We will continue to work for Wisconsin by investing in programs that connect job seekers and job creators and equip our workforce with the skills they need to succeed."
