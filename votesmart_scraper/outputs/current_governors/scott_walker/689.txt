Governor Scott Walker's Reforms Upheld in All Supreme Court Cases
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 31, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Today, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld Governor Scott Walker's reforms in both Act 10 and the voter ID law.
Governor Walker released the following statement in response to the Wisconsin Supreme Court's affirmative rulings on Act 10 and voter ID:
Act 10 has saved Wisconsin taxpayers more than $3 billion. Today's ruling is a victory for those hard-working taxpayers.
Voter ID is a common sense reform that protects the integrity of our elections. People need to have confidence in our electoral process and to know their vote has been properly counted. We look forward to the same result from the federal court of appeals.
