Governor Scott Walker joined local business leaders and representatives today in Milwaukee at Marketplace 2015, the Governor's 34th Annual Conference on Minority Business Development. The conference is the premier matchmaking and training resource for minority business enterprises, women-owned businesses, and veteran-owned businesses.
"Wisconsin's minority, women, and veteran-owned businesses are an integral aspect of our economy," Governor Walker said. "Some of our top priorities for the state include developing our workforce and growing our economy, and our minority businesses are crucial in achieving that goal. The success of these businesses contributes to the success of Wisconsin and today's conference was an excellent opportunity for minority business leaders to establish or expand their business in our state."
