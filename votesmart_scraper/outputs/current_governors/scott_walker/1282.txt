Location: Madison, WI

Today the State Senate and Assembly passed Assembly Bill (AB) 450 and Senate Bill (SB) 352 out of their respective committees. These bills are companions, which create a pilot program called "Wisconsin Wins" to offer voluntary occupational training to Unemployment Insurance claimants for 20-24 hours a week for up to six weeks. The goal of the program is to place job seekers directly into the workplace for on the job training. Unemployment claimants will be given the opportunity to undergo unpaid part time training while continuing to receive their regular unemployment benefits. The program offers benefits to both employers and the unemployed.
"Helping individuals who are on unemployment gain experience and job training, while still providing a basic safety net as they transition into full employment will be helpful as we work to grow Wisconsin's economy," said Governor Walker. "I would like to thank State Senator Waanggard and Representative Honadel for working advance these bills through the legislative process."
SB 352 was passed by the Senate Committee on Labor, Public Safety and Urban Affairs by a vote of 5-0 and AB 450 was passed by the Assembly Committee on Labor and Workforce Development by a vote of 7-0.
This proposal is modeled after successful similar training programs in Georgia and New Hampshire.
