Governor Scott Walker today visited the King Veterans Home and participated in a remembrance ceremony to pay tribute to veterans, in memory of the 73rd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was joined by several veterans who survived the Pearl Harbor attack.
"The attack on Pearl Harbor is certainly a day that shall "live in infamy,'" Governor Walker said. "Today, we remember the courageous individuals who risked or gave their lives at Pearl Harbor in order to protect our freedom. We bear in mind the heroism of the brave men and women of our Armed Forces, past and present, and the debt of gratitude we owe them for defending our nation and our freedom, not just today, but every day."
The King Veterans Home is a 721 bed facility that has been serving veterans in Wisconsin for more than 125 years.
