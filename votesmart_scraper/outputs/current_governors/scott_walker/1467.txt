Scott Walker Statement on September Jobs Report
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Oct. 21, 2010
Location: Wauwatosa, WI

Scott Walker, Milwaukee County executive and Republican nominee for governor, today released the following statement on news that just last month, Wisconsin lost another 9,900 private sector jobs.
"It's unacceptable that under Jim Doyle's failed leadership Wisconsin lost nearly 10,000 more jobs last month," said Walker. "Unlike Jim Doyle and Tom Barrett, who raise taxes and add regulations, I believe people create jobs, not the government. My plan to bring 250,000 jobs to Wisconsin focuses on getting government out of the way so that private employers can help Wisconsin get back to work."
