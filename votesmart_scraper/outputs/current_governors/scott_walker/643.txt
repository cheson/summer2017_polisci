Press Release

Date: Sept. 26, 2014
Location: Warrens, WI

Governor Scott Walker today toured the cranberry bogs at Russell Rezin & Son Cranberry Marsh, a fifth generation family farm in Warrens, the "Cranberry Capital of Wisconsin." The Warrens Cranberry Festival always runs the last full weekend of September, and is the world's largest and oldest cranberry festival.
"What better way to kick off this weekend-long celebration of all-things cranberry, then to get down into the marsh and see what it takes to grow and harvest one of the world's healthiest foods," Governor Walker said. "I drink cranberry juice daily, so it's fascinating to hear from the experts in the cranberry industry, who make us the number one cranberry producer in the nation. Our investments in agriculture allow all of our cranberry farmers to help grow a stronger economy, and a healthier community."
As the largest fruit crop in the state, the cranberry industry provides approximately 3,400 jobs throughout the state and adds about $300 million to the economy every year.
Cranberries are often called a "superfood" for their disease-fighting antioxidants, that are known to improve the immune system and boost health benefits against urinary tract infections, certain types of cancer, inflammation, aging and neurological diseases, heart disease, and more.
Russell Rezin & Son Cranberry Marsh is a fifth generation family farm, established in 1918, which has grown to 230 acres. Currently run by the fourth and fifth generations, the farm is a member of the Ocean Spray Cooperative.
