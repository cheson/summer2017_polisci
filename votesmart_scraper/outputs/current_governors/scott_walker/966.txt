Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Welcoming the National Governors Association to Wisconsin."
Transcript:
Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
This week, I'll welcome America's governors and an estimated 1,000 attendees to the National Governors Association 2013 Summer Meeting in Milwaukee. This will be Wisconsin's third time hosting the National Governors Association annual meeting -- the previous events were held in Milwaukee in 1998 and in Madison in 1914. The NGA's annual meetings are a unique opportunity for governors from across the country to meet and discuss policy issues facing our states.
In addition to engaging in discussions on economic development and commerce, I also have the honor of showcasing some of the best of Milwaukee's attractions. Highlights include taking attendees out to Miller Park to experience one of America's great stadiums, and heading out on a motorcycle ride to celebrate the 110th Anniversary of one of Wisconsin's icons, Harley-Davidson.
Tonette and I, on behalf of all of us here in Wisconsin, welcome the nation's governors, their families, and attendees to Milwaukee and our great state.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute a brief radio address once a week. Audio files and a written transcript of this radio address can be accessed on http://www.wi-broadcasters.org and http://walker.wi.gov/Weekly-Radio-Addresses.
