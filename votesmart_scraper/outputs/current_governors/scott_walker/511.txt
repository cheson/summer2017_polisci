Duke is a formidable opponent, but this is Wisconsin's year to bring home the victory. Make "em believe!"
Governor Walker bet an assortment of Wisconsin cheese, sausage, and root beer that the Wisconsin Badgers will win, while Governor McCrory wagered North Carolina barbecue, coleslaw, hush puppies and Cheerwine for a Duke victory.
