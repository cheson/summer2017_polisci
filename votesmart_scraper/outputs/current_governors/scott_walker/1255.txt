This week Illinois Governor Pat Quinn introduced his budget proposal, which according to the Chicago Tribune and Associated Press:
· Closed numerous prisons;
· Closed mental health and social service offices;
· Contained massive cuts to Medicaid;
· Closed popular tourist attractions two days a week;
· Contained a nine percent cut to most state agencies;
· Made major reductions in the public employee workforce, including layoffs; and
· Increased taxes on businesses.
The Chicago Tribune reported that even with these cuts Illinois still would carry over $8 billion in unpaid bills. All of these cuts come after Illinois enacted massive tax increases on both businesses and individuals last year.
Also in his budget address Governor Quinn said, "This year's General Revenue Fund payment for public pensions is $5.2 billion; triple what it cost in fiscal year 2008."
We are turning Wisconsin around due to the budget reforms put in place last year. Wisconsin is now on a path to prosperity, Illinois is not. In Wisconsin:
· Instead of passing off debt to the next generation, we eliminated a $3.6 billion budget deficit;
· Instead of massive tax increases, we not only maintained current tax rates, but actually saw some of the best property tax bills in years--with the total school levy portion of the tax decreasing for the first time in six years;
· Instead of ending the budget with $8 billion of unpaid bills, we paid back millions of dollars in unpaid bills ($60 million payment to Minnesota for tax reciprocity and $233 million repayment for the illegal raid of the Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund);
· Instead of engaging in massive layoffs of public employees, our reforms saved the jobs of thousands of hardworking, middle-class public employees; and
· Instead of slashing funding for Medicaid, we invested $1.2 billion of additional state taxpayer funds to help those who are truly in need.
I proposed, advocated for, and enacted solutions to the fiscal challenges that have been avoided and ignored for years because I care more about next generation than the next election. This has begun to turn our state around.
