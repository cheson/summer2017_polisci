Gov. Scott Walker applauded members of the Assembly for passing AB 426, which updates Wisconsin's mining regulations by creating new laws specific to ferrous (iron) mining. The process created by the bill would expedite the approval of a mining application, while maintaining environmental and natural resource protections. The passage of this bill follows an extensive public review period.
"In order to justify risking millions of dollars in capital investments, job creators deserve to have certainty in our state's permitting process and to know that our regulations are science-based and predictable," Gov. Walker said. "At the same time, we can put in place a process that allows us to maintain our high standards for clean air, clean water, and clean land. I commend Chairperson Mary Williams (R-Medford) and the Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economy, and Small Business for travelling to Northern Wisconsin twice to receive input from the citizens who will be most affected by the proposed taconite mine in Iron and Ashland Counties. I applaud the Assembly Republicans on the passage of this bill and their steadfast focus on the creation of jobs in Wisconsin. I urge the Senate to take this bill up quickly in order to continue job growth in Wisconsin."
The Assembly action came one day after the Governor encouraged lawmakers to act on mining legislation in his 2012 State of the State speech, citing a mine project proposal in northwestern Wisconsin that would create at least 700 jobs at the mine and has the potential to create thousands more across the state.
