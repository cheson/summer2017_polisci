Governor Scott Walker proclaimed today "Read the Constitution Day" on the 226th anniversary of the signing of the United States Constitution.
"Our Founders had the forethought and wisdom to ratify a constitution and it still defends the freedoms of its citizens 226 years after its creation," Governor Walker said. "The Founders had been through war and risked everything to build a nation where its citizens could find freedom, justice, tranquility, and prosperity. We're proud to our honor our nation's founding document and those who fought courageously to create and defend it, including those men and women of the Armed Forces who are defending it today."
Fun facts about the Constitution:
*States ratified the Constitution in the following order: Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island.
*James Madison of Virginia is known as the "Father of the Constitution." The Virginia Plan, which he drafted, was used as a blueprint for the Constitution. He is also responsible for later offering twelve amendments to the Constitution. Ten of these amendments were ratified and are known as the Bill of Rights.
*Only thirty-nine of the delegates signed the Constitution. Edmund Randolph and George Mason of Virginia, along with Elbridge Gerry from Massachusetts, refused to sign due to concerns about the lack of a bill of rights.
*Roger Sherman from Connecticut and Robert Morris from Pennsylvania were the only delegates to have signed the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution.
*After signing the Constitution, Benjamin Franklin gazed at the half-sun on George Washington's chair and stated, "But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun."
*In 1789, President George Washington proclaimed and established the first national Thanksgiving Day to give thanks for the new Constitution.
