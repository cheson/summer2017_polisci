Governor Scott Walker today signed Assembly Bill 143, which will provide additional access to affordable transportation options throughout the state, while protecting riders' safety and sets a clear statewide standard to ensure appropriate levels of insurance.

"This bill's broad, bipartisan support in the State Legislature highlights the importance of providing affordable transportation options for all our citizens while maintaining strict safety measures," said Governor Walker. "I have also directed the Department of Safety and Professional Services to immediately begin the rule-making process, which will allow the Department to gather the information to hold drivers accountable and further ensure the safety of our citizens."

While the bill includes extensive and detailed measures to protect public safety, Governor Walker has further directed the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) to promulgate rules to clarify the intent of the law, ensuring that DSPS has the ability to obtain the information necessary to hold individual drivers accountable and preserve public safety.
