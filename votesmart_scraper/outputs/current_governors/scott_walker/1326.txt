Governor Scott Walker today signed Executive Order #54 concerning mandatory reporting requirements for child abuse and neglect and the University System. The Governor was joined by Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, University of Wisconsin System President Kevin Reilly, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Chancellor Michael Lovell, and Dr. Barbara Knox, Chair, Wisconsin Children's Trust Fund.
"Keeping our children safe is the first priority of any parent," said Governor Walker. "Today's Executive Order will extend the state's mandatory reporting requirements on child abuse to employees of the University System. I want to thank the University System and the Attorney General for working together with us on this issue."
Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen said, "We owe every child the freedom from abuse and neglect. Today's Executive Order broadens and strengthens Wisconsin's laws to protect children, and each of us, as human beings, has an ethical and moral responsibility to protect the most vulnerable. When child abuse is witnessed or suspected, we must treat the behavior seriously and swiftly take action by calling the police."
University of Wisconsin System President Kevin Reilly added, "Protecting our children is one of the most solemn moral obligations of adulthood, one we want to model for the young adults who are our university students. With that in mind, I believe this Order captures and clarifies our fundamental responsibility to protect vulnerable populations."
