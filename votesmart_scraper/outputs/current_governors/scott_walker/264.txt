Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 5, 2016
Location: Eau Claire, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 596 into law today at Chippewa Valley Technical College in Eau Claire.
"The future of Wisconsin's workforce and economic success depends on our youth," Governor Walker said. "To ensure Wisconsin maintains a strong workforce, we continue to invest in programs like Youth Apprenticeship, which provide our students with hands-on training in high-demand fields, like manufacturing. Senate Bill 596 gives DWD the flexibility to distribute funds to the program to best meet the needs of our workforce."
Senate Bill 596 -- consolidates funding for Youth Apprenticeship and Apprenticeship workforce training programs into a single appropriation, thus increasing flexibility for these important programs without requesting additional funding. The Department of Workforce Development (DWD) has the ability to place funds wherever the greatest demand is and respond in a timely manner, rather than having to wait until the next budget cycle. Authored by Senator Chris Kapenga (R -- Delafield) and Representative Kathleen Bernier (R -- Chippewa Falls), the bill passed the Senate with a vote of 32-0 and was concurred by the Assembly with a vote of 95-0. It is Act 348.
