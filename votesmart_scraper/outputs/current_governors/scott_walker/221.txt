Governor Scott Walker Approves Emergency Rule Easing Access to DMV Identification Documents for Voters
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 11, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker approved the proposed emergency rule modifying the Wisconsin Administrative Code to ensure everyone is able to obtain the documents they need to vote.
"Voter I.D. is about making it easier to vote and harder to cheat," Governor Walker said. "This action ensures an individual is still able to vote while they work to obtain documentation needed for a free voter I.D. card."
This week, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation's Division of Motor Vehicles announced a new process to issue photo ID card receipts to those who need them to vote. These receipts will be issued to individuals who are in the process of obtaining photo ID cards for voting but are unable to produce the necessary documents in time for an election. The DMV has been offering free voter identification cards since 2011. This measure builds on that service, so that those who have difficulty accessing documentation needed for an ID card, and those who have errors on documentation, such as a misspelled name on a birth certificate, are still able to vote with a temporary photo ID card receipt.
The new process will be fully operational on Friday, May 13. Applicants can obtain more information about the process online at wisconsindmv.gov or by calling 608-266-1069.
