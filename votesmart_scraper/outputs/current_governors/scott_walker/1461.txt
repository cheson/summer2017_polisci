Dear President Obama:
Thank you for inviting me and other newly elected Governors to the White house for a discussion on security and other important issues. I appreciate your willingness to start a dialogue with Governor=elects from all across the country.
There are two items that I would like to bring to your attention before Thursday. First, I spoke to U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood right after the election regarding my opposition to the proposed train line between Milwaukee and Madison. I am grateful that the Secretary and his staff listened to my concerns.
It is my hope that there is a way to use these or other funds to fix the crumbling roads and bridges in Wisconsin that are a part of the federal interstate system -- instead of using $810 million on a proposed high speed rail line.
Second, I spoke with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sibelius last week about the federal health care act. As you might know, I raised major concerns about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act especially with respect to the individual federal mandate provision. However, it is my hope that your administration will allow Wisconsin to take a free-market, consumer driven system approach under the health care exchange provisions of the federal act.
To do so, we need to have maximum flexibility at the state level. When Secretary Sibelius and I spoke, she expressed support of this concept and I hope that will continue when I take office on January 3, 2011.
Thank you for your attention to these important matters. i look forward to meeting you on Thursday in Washington, D.C.
Sincerely,
Scott Walker
Governor-elect, State of Wisconsin
