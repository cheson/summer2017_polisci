Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today after the University of Wisconsin (UW) System announced that UW-Milwaukee and UW Colleges received approval to begin providing Flexible Option degrees:
"Our budget included $2 million to fund start-up costs for this first-in-the-nation approach, and I'm pleased to see this come to fruition because we're making it easier for people to pursue higher education. This is great news for students and workers, and I thank UW System faculty and staff and the UW System Board of Regents for their hard work on this bold and innovative improvement."
The UW Flexible Option is a collaborative effort between the UW System, UW-Milwaukee, UW Colleges and UW-Extension's Division of Continuing Education, Online and E-Learning. Visit http://flex.wisconsin.edu for more information.
