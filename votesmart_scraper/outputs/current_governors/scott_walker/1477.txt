Walker Calls on Barrett's MMSD Board to Stop Increasing Property Taxes
Press Release

Location: Wauwatosa, WI

Scott Walker, Milwaukee County executive and Republican nominee for governor, today called for an end to the proposed 4.4% property tax levy increase by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District board.
"Now is the worst time to raise taxes on hardworking families and, unlike Tom Barrett, I denounce MMSD's tax increases," said Walker. "After years of mismanagement, millions of dollars worth of damage to private property owners, and 8.2 billion gallons of sewage dumping, taking more money from families who are the hardest hit is not the solution."
Walker noted that 7 of the 11 MMSD board members are appointed by Barrett.
The MMSD tax increase proposal comes one day after Mayor Barrett's election year ploy of -- for the first time EVER -- joining Scott in holding the line on taxes. Scott Walker has introduced 8 consecutive budgets without a property tax levy increase from the previous year.
