July Flooding Leads to Agriculture Disaster Declaration in Northern Wisconsin
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Sept. 30, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Eight northern Wisconsin counties have been designated agricultural disaster areas after July flooding that destroyed more than 30 percent of crops.
Governor Scott Walker and Executive Director Patty Edelburg of the USDA Farm Service Agency requested the designation on September 15, 2016 from USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack. Governor Walker received notice on Thursday, September 29, 2016 that the request had been granted.
"We're pleased the USDA recognizes the damage Wisconsin farmers have suffered due to July's storms and resulting floods," Governor Walker said. "With this disaster designation, farmers in these counties will be eligible for assistance, if needed."
The disaster designation covers the primary counties of Ashland, Bayfield, and Iron, as well as the five neighboring counties of Douglas, Price, Sawyer, Vilas, and Washburn.
Severe storms and flooding on July 11 and 12, 2016 left many farm fields under water or with saturated soil. The result was destroyed crops or sharply reduced yields.
The disaster designation may make farmers in these counties eligible for low-interest emergency loans for the next eight months, and any other assistance that may become available through federal action.
Farmers in these counties should contact their local FSA offices for further information.
