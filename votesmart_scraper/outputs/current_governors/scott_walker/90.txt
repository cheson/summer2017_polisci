Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Supporting Our National Guardsmen and Reservists Deployed Overseas."
Hi, Scott Walker here.
The greatest honor I have as your governor is being the Commander-in-Chief of the more than 10,000 strong soldiers and airmen in the Wisconsin National Guard.
This week, I am joining a group of governors to visit our deployed members of the National Guard and Reservists from Wisconsin who are overseas.
It's an honor to speak with these brave women and men and personally thank them for their dedication and service on behalf of our great state.
With the holidays quickly approaching, we know this is an especially difficult time of the year for people in our Armed Services who are deployed so far away from home. I encourage the citizens of Wisconsin to keep the members of our Armed Forces in their hearts and prayers this Christmas. We wish them a very Merry Christmas and happy holidays, and we pray for their safe return.
