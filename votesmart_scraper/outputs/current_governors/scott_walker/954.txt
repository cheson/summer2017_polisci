Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Building Wisconsin's Credit Rating."
Transcript:
Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
Earlier this week, I met with investors and firms to discuss Wisconsin's credit rating. These annual meetings give us a chance to discuss the state's bond rating, the fiscal impact of our state budget, and the status of the economy in Wisconsin. Thankfully, we have a great story to tell. We turned a $3.6 billion budget deficit into a sizable surplus, we have the largest rainy day fund in state history, our state pension system is the only one in the U.S. that is fully funded, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia just ranked Wisconsin as second in the country on its leading indexes for the next six months.
Over the past few years, we had to make some tough, but prudent, decisions. Thankfully, they worked as our fiscal and economic situation is much better. This allowed us to invest more into our schools, technical colleges, and a tax relief, the UW System, veterans' programs, health care, and other important priorities in our recent budget. Unlike our neighbors to the south, we laid a strong foundation for future prosperity and ongoing stability. We're moving Wisconsin forward.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute a brief radio address once a week. Audio files and a written transcript of this radio address can be accessed on http://www.wi-broadcasters.org and http://walker.wi.gov/Weekly-Radio-Addresses.
