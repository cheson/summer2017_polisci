Press Release

Location: Erin, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker joined local officials at Erin Hills Golf Course to promote the 2015 PGA Championship, 2017 U.S. Open, and 2020 Ryder Cup coming to Wisconsin.
"Wisconsin is home to a number of world-class venues and we are honored to host three of golf's most prestigious events," Governor Walker said. "We look forward to showcasing our wonderful hospitality and all the beauty Wisconsin has to offer."
In 2017, Wisconsin will host the U.S. Open for the first time at Erin Hills Golf Course. Opened in 2006, the 652-acre course consists of rolling hills and abundant wetlands that make it particularly difficult and attractive to the game's best players. The week-long event is expected to draw nearly 35,000 spectators a day. The U.S. Open is considered one of the most challenging events each year.
Whistling Straights, near Kohler, will host the 2015 PGA Championship for the third time August 10-16 of this year. The course also held the event in 2004 and 2010 and will host the Ryder Cup in 2020.
A 2008 study showed golf has a $2.4 billion dollar impact on Wisconsin, supporting over 38,000 jobs. The upcoming golf events are each expected to bring in an extra $100 million in tourism revenue for Wisconsin.
