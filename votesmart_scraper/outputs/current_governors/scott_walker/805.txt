Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 73 today at Group Health Cooperative of Eau Claire, which establishes a grant for workplace wellness programs for small businesses.
"Workplace wellness has a huge impact on the morale and productivity of a business," Governor Walker said. "I thank Senator Terry Moulton (R-Chippewa Falls) and Representative John Murtha (R-Baldwin) for their work on this legislation, and I encourage businesses across the state to take advantage of all the opportunities workplace wellness offers."
Senate Bill 73 -- offers an incentive for small businesses to create a workplace wellness program. The grant will cover up to 30 percent of the cost of the program and the employer is responsible for the remaining cost. To be eligible for the grants, companies must have fewer than 50 employees and not already have a wellness program. The Department of Health Services will be responsible for administering the grants.
Wellness programs promote a healthy work environment and often result in increased productivity, fewer sick days, and fewer work-related injuries. This grant program will help businesses cope with the skyrocketing costs of health care. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that for every $1 invested in wellness programs, a business saves between $3 and $7 in costs.
The bill unanimously passed the Senate and passed the Assembly with near unanimous bipartisan support with a vote of 97-0; it is Act 137.
