Today, Governor Scott Walker delivered the weekly radio address titled "Cutting Income Taxes."
Transcript below:
Hi. I'm Scott Walker.
The income tax cuts proposed in my budget specifically target middle-class taxpayers. The biggest percent of tax relief, under my plan, is for individuals making between $20,000-60,000 per year. This tax cut amounts to a $341 million down payment on what I hope is just the beginning of the income tax relief we can provide in this and future budgets.
There have been a number of news stories discussing this income tax cut. While some individuals criticize the size of the income tax cut, or exactly what the effect of it will be, it's important to remember that cutting taxes is a drastic turn from the budgets of the past. The state budgets enacted prior to my tenure contained massive tax increases and contributed to huge job losses and high unemployment.
Unfortunately, those who are critiquing the details of my middle-class tax cut are many of the same politicians who voted to increase taxes by more than a billion dollars just a few budgets ago.
I welcome the discussion of how much money we can return to the hardworking taxpayers of our great state, instead of debating how much we need to raise taxes to fund the government.
