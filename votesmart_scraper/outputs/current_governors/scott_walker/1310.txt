"We are restoring trust in the Department of Natural Resources by requiring more transparency and accountability while ensuring decisions are based on objective science and the best interests of the taxpayers and license buyers. The DNR works for us, not the other way around. As governor, I have ensured that the DNR becomes an "opportunity' agency, giving job creators the opportunity to grow, sportsmen and women the opportunity to be heard and not ignored, and all Wisconsinites the opportunity to enjoy our state's abundant natural resources."
--Scott Walker
Two Great Lakesover 15,000 inland lakesthousands of acres of foreststhe nation's greatest river. These are a small but significant snapshot of Wisconsin's fantastic natural resources where Wisconsin families camp, fish and hunt. Throughout Wisconsin, family businesses related to tourism, recreation, hunting and fishing can be found near our abundant natural resources. Meanwhile, goods are transported through our forests and over our rivers. From the Horicon Marsh to the Apostle Islands and everywhere in between, Wisconsin is truly a natural marvel whose resources must be effectively managed and protected.
Managing and protecting our resources is no easy task. It requires people who understand their value and the need to use them in a sustainable manner. Wisconsin can have both economic growth and a clean environment as long we make decisions based on fact and objective science, not politics and rhetoric.
