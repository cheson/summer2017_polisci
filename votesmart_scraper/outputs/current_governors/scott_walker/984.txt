Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Honoring Our Fallen Heroes."
Transcript:
Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
I'll be signing Assembly Bill 166 in Mayville which creates an individual income tax exemption for military personnel who have sacrificed their lives for our freedom in a combat zone. The bill passed both houses of the State Legislature with unanimous support, and I'm proud to sign it into law.
This legislation sends an important message of gratitude to fallen service members and their families. The bravest amongst us shouldn't be required to pay Wisconsin state income tax when they've already paid the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
I'm signing the bill in Mayville because Andrew and Laura Johnson and their son, First Lieutenant David Johnson, inspired us to act. First Lieutenant Johnson died in Afghanistan in January of 2012 after injuries suffered while encountering an improvised explosive device during a patrol. Although we'll never be able to fully repay him and the others who have died for our country, this bill is one way to give back and honor them, and I'm honored to join the Johnsons at the bill signing ceremony.
The memories of 1st Lieutenant Johnson and all of our fallen heroes live on, and they are solemn reminders that freedom is never free.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute a brief radio address once a week. Audio files and a written transcript of this radio address can be accessed on http://www.wi-broadcasters.org and http://walker.wi.gov/Weekly-Radio-Addresses.
