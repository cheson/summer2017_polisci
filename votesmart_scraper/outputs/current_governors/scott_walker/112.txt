Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Continued Tax Relief for Wisconsin Families."
Hi. Scott Walker here.
All across Wisconsin, students are back in school.
Tonette and I still remember all of the supplies and clothes that we bought the kids each year before they went back to the public schools in our hometown of Wauwatosa. My brother and sister-in-law were just doing the same thing with my two nieces.
Thankfully, stores all across Wisconsin have back to school sales. Now, we want to create a back to school sales tax holiday to make it easier for families to save as you get ready for the new school year.
We remember all of the notebooks, pens and pencils, crayons and glue, scissors and paper that Matt and Alex needed when they were getting ready for the new school year. As they got older, we remember buying those computers and we certainly remember the clothes they wanted for the new school year.
We will work with lawmakers to pass a sales tax holiday that will help Wisconsin families and Wisconsin businesses. Save money while shopping in-state and help our many fine employers. It's a win-win.
