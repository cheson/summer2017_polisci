Hi everyone, Governor Scott Walker here.
We are just days away from the kick off of yet another exciting gun deer hunt in Wisconsin.
The 9-day hunt is not only a great time to get together and make lasting memories with family and friends, it's also a healthy boost for our state economy, as people travel from all over the world to Wisconsin, with the hopes of bagging that trophy buck.
To keep this great tradition alive -- we encourage you to take a first-time hunter out with you this year. First-time hunters can get a license for only five dollars.
And to help you track down that big buck -- use the Department of Natural Resources fall hunting forecast, and Public Access Lands Atlas.
Most of all, as you head out into the woods, be safe.
Here's looking forward to another successful, gun deer hunt in Wisconsin. Good Luck!
