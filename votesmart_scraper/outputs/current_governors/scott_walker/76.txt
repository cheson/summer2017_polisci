Governor Scott Walker released the following statement tonight after President Donald J. Trump announced Judge Neil M. Gorsuch as his nominee for the United States Supreme Court:
Judge Neil Gorsuch is an outstanding nominee; a jurist committed to a textualist and originalist judicial philosophy. It is important the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy, left by the great Justice Antonin Scalia, is filled by someone of the highest integrity, who will adhere to the rule of law, and who understands the proper role of a justice. Judge Gorsuch meets these criteria.
