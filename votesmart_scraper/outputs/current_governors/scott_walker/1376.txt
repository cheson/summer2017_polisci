Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 41into law today at Schneider National, Inc. in Green Bay. Senate Bill 41 relates to agreements for motor carrier liabilities.
"This legislation protects motor carriers from the negligence or intentional acts of others and it will make our nation's transportation services industry stronger in a recovering economy," Governor Walker said. "I thank Senator Lazich and Representative Nygren for their leadership on this issue."
The bill prohibits contracts from requiring the motor carrier to indemnify the shipper from liability arising from the negligence or intentional acts of the shipper. It also nullifies any such provisions included in existing contracts.
