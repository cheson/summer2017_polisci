Hi, Scott Walker here.
For the first time in history, we enacted a UW tuition freeze for four years in a row. Prior to our freeze, tuition went up by more 118 percent over ten years. Compared to that trend, our freeze saves UW students an average of $6,311. That's real savings for Wisconsin students and families.
Today, we are one step closer to our goal of making college more affordable for Wisconsinites after the state Assembly passed our college affordability legislative package. We thank Representatives Murphy, Heaton, and Macco for their work on these bills, as well as the entire Assembly for passing this legislation.
These proposals are a critical part of our work to lower the cost of higher education and ease the burden of student loan debt. That's why we need the state Senate to take up these bills as soon as possible.
Continuing to put the taxpayers first, we are dedicated to keeping higher education costs down and lowering the burden of student loan debt for students and families with this important legislation.
