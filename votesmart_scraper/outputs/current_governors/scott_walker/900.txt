Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 335 into law today at the Wisconsin State Capitol.
Senate Bill 335 -- relating to a tuition reimbursement program for apprentices and employers, granting rule-making authority, and making an appropriation. This bill creates an incentive, administered by the Department of Workforce Development, which will reimburse tuition costs for skilled workers or employers involved in apprenticeship programs. The legislation passed the Senate on a 32--0 vote and the Assembly on a 93--2 vote. Senate Bill 335 is 2013 Wisconsin Act 57.
"Apprenticeships are some of the most valuable worker training programs available," Governor Walker said. "This bill will help employers address the current shortage of skilled workers and tailor training to their specific industry needs. It also encourages skilled workers to continue their education in rewarding career paths and allows them to earn while they learn. I would like to thank Senator Sheila Harsdorf (R-River Falls) and Representative Lee Nerison (R-Westby) for their work on this important issue."
