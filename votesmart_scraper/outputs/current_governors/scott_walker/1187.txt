Press Release

Date: May 4, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today Cabela's announced they'll be building a 100,000-square-foot store that will be located in the Titletown Development area. According to Cabela's the store will employ approximately 175 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees, most of which will come from Green Bay and neighboring areas.
The construction of this store was made possible by the passage of Senate Bill (SB) 10.
"Wisconsin is open for business," said Governor Scott Walker. "Making state regulations science based and predictable creates jobs. Here is a real word case in point--due to reasonable changes we made early in 2011 there are now more than 150 jobs being created in Green Bay. I will continue to establish certainty and stability in state regulations, which will lead to more private sector jobs."
