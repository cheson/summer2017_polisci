Location: Hayward, WI

Governor Scott Walker kicks off opening weekend of fishing season by hitting the water of the Chippewa Flowage in Sawyer County, east of Hayward for the 50th Annual Governor's Fishing Opener. The Chippewa Flowage is a favorite among those hoping to reel in a record walleye or musky.
"The opening of fishing season is a great time of year in Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "This is also a great draw for the tourism industry, which we are happy to report is thriving. Revenue from tourism is up $1 billion in 2014, thanks in part to the skilled team we have that works so hard to promote all we have to offer here."
