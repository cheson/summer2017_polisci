Hi this is Scott Walker.
This week, we continue our work finalizing the next State Budget, and I want you to know that we remain focused on lowering the overall tax burden, so you can keep more of your own money.
This is our third budget, and each time we go through the process, it seems the issues that get the most headlines are not the issues that affect the hard-working taxpayers of this state. But I want you to know, our priorities haven't changed.
Even though the process is not yet complete -- I can tell you this. The budget I will sign will lower property taxes for the fifth and sixth years in a row. That means the property tax bill on a typical home will actually be lower in 2016 than it was in 2010.
This budget will invest in our workforce, so more people get the training they need for the good-paying jobs that support our families here in Wisconsin.
We will support our seniors and needy families by increasing our support for Medicaid.
And we are working together to provide more money for K-12 education.
Our budget includes reforms to help people transition from government dependence to true independence.
Our budget priorities are simple, and they have not changed. We are working to build a better Wisconsin, to offer a brighter, more prosperous future for all who live here.
