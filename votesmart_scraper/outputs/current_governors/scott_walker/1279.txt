Location: Madison, WI

Today members of the Legislature introduced a bill that allows the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to create a voluntary check off on hunting, trapping, and fishing licenses and permits; snowmobile, all-terrain vehicle, and boat registrations; and state park vehicle admission receipts (approvals), to make a voluntary contribution of at least $2 in addition to the fees. The funds collected by this voluntary check off would be used to establish an endowment program to support habitat management activities on land owned or managed by the state.
"I support the bill introduced today that allows the DNR to create a voluntary check off to fund habitat management activities," said Governor Walker. "This provides an easy way for those who utilize public lands to chip in to help manage and preserve Wisconsin's pristine natural resources."
"For everybody who loves Wisconsin's Natural Resources, this is a great way to make a difference," said State Senator Dale Schultz.
"As a lifelong Wisconsin outdoorsman and conservationist, I am delighted to help introduce this innovative and visionary legislation," said State Representative Warren Petryk. "Generations to come will be benefactors of our effort."
"The new paradigm for our beloved state-owned lands is that private citizens need to support the care and management of these properties that we all use for diverse outdoor experiences, be they recreational, educational or spiritual," said Charlie Luthin, Executive Director of the Natural Resources Foundation of Wisconsin. A permanent and certain source of funding is necessary to maintain the health and integrity of these public lands for Wisconsinites today and for future generations."
