Today, Governor Scott Walker attended a ribbon cutting ceremony at Fromm Family Foods to celebrate the expansion at the company's Columbus location, which has created 75 new jobs over the past three and a half years.
"Fromm Family Foods is a great Wisconsin success story, built on innovation, motivation, and hard work," Governor Walker said. "This fifth-generation, family-owned company is a leader in the industry of premium pet food producers. Their multi-million dollar investment means more jobs and a big boost to the local economy. Companies like this are the fuel allowing us to keep moving Wisconsin forward."
Fromm Family Foods, which is celebrating 110 years in business, has manufacturing facilities in Mequon and Columbus. The Columbus expansion includes the addition of 14,000-square-feet of manufacturing space and a 40,000-square-foot warehouse. Due to increased demand, the company created a new line that will double production capacity.
Fromm Family Foods specializes in premium and super-premium all-natural pet food for dogs and cats. The company is a pet food trailblazer with a history of quiet innovation. Fromm created the first canine distemper vaccine and introduced the concept of premium pet food to the world by pioneering the process of cooking meat and grain together to create dry kibble food. Fromm products are sold exclusively through independently owned pet supply stores.
