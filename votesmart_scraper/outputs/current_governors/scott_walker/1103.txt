Transcript below:
Hi, this is Scott Walker.
This week the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, a public-private authority tasked with creating jobs in our state, launched a new branding campaign called "In Wisconsin."
While I will continue to highlight all of the reasons why Wisconsin is a good place to grow, expand or relocate jobs, there is no one more qualified to speak directly about the advantages of doing business in Wisconsin than already established employers.
The new marketing campaign will feature Organic Valley in La Farge, the nation's largest organic dairy farmer cooperative; Rockwell Automation in Milwaukee, a global leader in the advancement of smart manufacturing; Schneider National in Green Bay, one of the world's largest transportation and logistics companies; Trek in Waterloo, world-renowned manufacturer of bicycles and related products; and Virent in Madison , a company using naturally-occurring renewable resources to replace crude oil.
Hopefully when employers from other states hear about positive experiences in our great state, we'll be able to attract more good-paying, family supporting jobs to Wisconsin.
