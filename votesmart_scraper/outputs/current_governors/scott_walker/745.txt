Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker thanked nurses around the state today on Nurse Appreciation Day:
The nurses of today are leaders in health care, and are often the first line of defense in life-saving situations. As primary care evolves, nurses are using their diverse skills, training, and unique abilities to improve the lives of their patients, and I would like to recognize the commitment and efforts of the invaluable members in this ever-changing profession. With more than 94,000 nurses in the state, we are lucky to have such caring individuals looking over us when we need them, even working nights, weekends, and holidays. Thank you, to all of those who champion the good health of our state.
