Governor Scott Walker released the following statement in honor of Memorial Day:
Today, Tonette and I wish everyone a safe and enjoyable Memorial Day. While Memorial Day is the perfect opportunity to spend time with friends and family outdoors, grilling Wisconsin brats and drinking Wisconsin beer, let us pause for a moment to remember what today is truly all about. We honor the memory of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, so we may enjoy the freedoms we have today. We are grateful for the selflessness of the courageous men and women who serve in our armed forces. On this Memorial Day, we hold these heroes in our hearts and keep them, as well as their loved ones, in our prayers.
