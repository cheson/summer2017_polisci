Property Taxes Go Down for First Time in 12 Years Statewide
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 16, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker announced that statewide property taxes for the typical homeowner have gone down for the first time in 12 years. The tax bill for the median value home is $39 per homeowner lower than originally estimated by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau when the 2011-2013 budget was passed.
"Our reforms have reversed a decade of property tax increases from previous administrations," said Governor Walker. "For the first time in over ten years, the average property taxpayer will have more money in his or her pocket than the year before."
Since 1998, property taxes paid by homeowners have risen 43 percent. This year property taxes paid by the typical homeowner went down .4 percent. Without the Governor's reforms the average homeowner would have paid an additional $700 over the biennium.
