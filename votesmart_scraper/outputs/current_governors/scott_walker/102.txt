Governor Scott Walker recognized Wisconsin women-owned businesses today as a part of Women's Small Business Month. Wisconsin is home to more than 142,000 women-owned businesses, which represents nearly one-third of all businesses in the state.
"Women-owned businesses play a crucial role in the economic success of our state," Governor Walker said. "They are job creators, employing 168,000 Wisconsinites. Women business owners also serve as important role models, inspiring our next generation of business owners to pursue their dreams and creating jobs and economic growth in the process. We've declared October as Women's Small Business Month to highlight the growth in women's business ownership over the past decade and its contributions to Wisconsin's workforce and economy."
From 2007 to 2016, the number of women-owned firms in Wisconsin has grown by 26.7 percent and women are the majority owners of an estimated 31 percent of all Wisconsin businesses. Every year, women-owned businesses in Wisconsin have an economic impact of $27 billion, and their influence is expected to continue growing.
