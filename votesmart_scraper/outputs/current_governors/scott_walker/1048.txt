Governor Walker Signs Historic Mining Reform
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 11, 2013
Location: Madison, WI

After hundreds of hours of debate and more than a year of public discussion, today, Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 1 into law, which streamlines the permitting process for safe and environmentally sound mining. Along with signing the bill, Governor Walker released the following statement:
Wisconsin's seal and the state flag both depict mining in our great state. In light of our mining tradition, I'm thrilled to sign legislation into law protecting environmental safeguards, while providing certainty to the mine permitting process.
I would like to thank Legislative leaders in both the State Senate and State Assembly for their tireless commitment to move this bill forward. After making substantial changes to the legislation, aimed at protecting our state's vital natural resources, the bill I signed into law today will preserve our tradition of clean land, water, and air.
I am hopeful today's actions will result in the creation of thousands of private sector jobs in the coming years.
